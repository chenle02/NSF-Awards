The PI will collaborate with Univ Colorado at Boulder and with scientists in
Iceland to complete a survey initiated in 1986 of the South Iceland Seismic Zone
using GPS geodesy. A sequence of M 7 events is overdue in this region and the
basic framework for the study has been completed. The rupture sequence typically
has a duration of several years. It is vital to strengthen, extend and densify
the network in view of the major scientific rewards anticipated from
remeasurements during and after rupture of this on-land transform system.
