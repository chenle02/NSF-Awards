Submarine springs and seeps discharge a substantial but not precisely defined
quantity of water into the ocean. Recent estimates suggest that the magnitude of
this discharge, driven by gravitational and convective forces, may be globally
significant. Discharged fluids may consist of fresh water, connate waters,
brines derived from evaporite deposits, or recirculated seawater. Because the
composition of submarine hydrologic discharge may be markedly different than
seawater, this process is capable of contributing significantly to the marine
geochemical cycling of many elements. The proposed research will determine the
potential of using water column standing crops of the tracers 222Rn, 226Ra and
CH4, constituents greatly enriched in groundwater relative to seawater, for the
purpose of locating and assessing submarine groundwater discharge to the ocean.
A detailed geochemical mass balance will be constructed for the single best
tracer, 222Rn, within a relatively small area on the continental shelf of
northwest Florida, an area where we expect to find appreciable submarine
discharge. Groundwater tracer concentrations and fluxes will be measured, both
in the form of discrete springs and as disseminated seeps. Benthic fluxes and
other processes, such as advection and air-sea exchange, which contribute to
changes in the water column standing crop will be evaluated. These measurements
will be modeled to evaluate the prospects of developing a simple tracer-based
technique for determining the magnitude of groundwater discharge to the ocean
applicable to other areas.
