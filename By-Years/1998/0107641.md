This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
techniques and equipment for simple, cheap and reliable mass production of
triploid and tetraploid giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) using a new
technology called Automated Polyploid Induction System (APIS). This proprietary
APIS system uses a specially designed spawning tank, an automated spawn sensing
device and computer applied shock treatments. The specific objective of the
Phase I project is to determine the optimal values of the three key parameters
for triploidy induction in P. monodon: time to start shock application, shock
intensity, and shock duration. This determination will allow the complete
development and demonstration of APIS during Phase II of the project. Additional
objectives in Phase II will include production of tetraploid P. monodon, and
completion of production trials with diploid, triploid and tetraploid shrimp.

The commercial application of this project is in the farmed shrimp production
market. Farmed shrimp from Asia constitutes approximately 75% of the world's
farmed shrimp production, and P. monodon accounts for greater than 50% of that
production. Successful mass production of the triploid P. monodon, and
demonstration of superior culture performance of triploids will allow marketing
of this proprietary technology throughout Asia.
