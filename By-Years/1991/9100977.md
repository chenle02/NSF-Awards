This project investigates the developmental course of social action groups. It
tests propositions from classical social theory about the natural course of
development from spontaneous and relatively unorganized groups to bureaucratic
organizations with rules and defined official responsibilities. PIs sent
questionnaires to about 370 such organizations active in 1986, and plan to
interview their leaders and analyze printed material in the course of this
research. Results will help establish whether the predicted bureaucratization is
universal or whether certain conditions modify its course.
