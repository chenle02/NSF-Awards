The Students Understanding Chemistry Concepts to Enhance STEM Skills (SUCCESS)
project at Jackson State University will target at-risk and underrepresented
students, with a focus on biology majors, and will enable them to successfully
complete general and organic chemistry. The SUCCESS project will provide three-
day Chemistry Readiness Workshops prior to the start of a course, and an
additional two-hour SUCCESS Session during each week of the semester. Enabling
at-risk and underrepresented students to succeed in their chosen major will
support diversification of the STEM workforce. How these interventions promote
student success will be documented, and the knowledge gained will complement
successful approaches to undergraduate instruction across multiple STEM
disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of Chemistry Readiness Workshops,
the modified Xavier University Chemistry Drill Program, and Process Oriented
Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) sessions on the success of students in general
chemistry will be documented. Data from the intervention groups will be compared
to historical data and evaluated to determine whether these strategies: (a)
improve attendance in chemistry classes, (b) decrease drop/fail/withdraw rates,
(c) improve students' conceptual understanding of chemistry, and (d) improve
student retention. The results will be disseminated in biology and chemistry
education conferences, and associated proceedings. Overall, this project will
contribute to what is known about the promoting student success in STEM with at-
risk and underrepresented students. This project will support broadening
participation in STEM and the STEM workforce.
