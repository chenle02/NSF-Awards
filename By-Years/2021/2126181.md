The GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of
Michigan will operate a new laser user facility to be called NSF Zettawatt-
Equivalent Ultrashort pulse laser System (ZEUS) facility. The NSF ZEUS facility
will operate the most powerful laser in the US and will provide unique and
world-leading capabilities for scientific research. The NSF ZEUS facility will
have an open and transparent review process for facility access with at least 30
weeks per year dedicated to external user experiments. The facility will have
local and national economic and societal impact through training of students and
post-doctoral researchers at universities throughout the US, with specific
outreach efforts focused on increasing demographic diversity of the ZEUS user
community. The facility will also foster innovation in the field of laser
technology, potentially enabling formation of new high tech
companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new NSF ZEUS user facility will include a
multi-beam 3 PetaWatt (PW) laser system that will have three radiation-shielded
experimental target areas to accommodate differing experimental configurations
for users. The ZEUS laser system will have three modes of operation, either for
experiments using a single 3 PW beamline, dual beam 2.5 PW/500 TeraWatt (TW) or
up to 300 TW at higher repetition rate. A nanosecond-duration 75 J shock driver
beamline for generating high-energy-density states of matter will also be
available. The repetition rate of ZEUS at full power will be one shot per minute
but will also have a higher repetition rate mode at 5 Hz for powers up to 300
TW. This additional operational mode will enable a significant amount of data to
be taken, which is particularly important for x-ray (up to 50 keV) and neutron
(up to 20 MeV) imaging applications. These bursts of x-rays and neutrons
produced by ZEUS will have ultra-short pulse duration and can also be used for
probing dynamic events at picosecond or femtosecond temporal
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
