An international symposium on the molecular genetics of root development
support November 6-8, 1992 at New York University will be partially. The meeting
is designed to have a workshop-like atmosphere, featuring discussions of the
recent results and new approaches in the area, and will include a major emphasis
on the use of Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental organism. The main
objective of this meeting is to bring together, for the first time,
investigators from around the world who are working in this relatively new and
growing field and to promote the exchange of ideas and the establishment of
collaborative efforts. In addition, this meeting designed to help expose other
plant biologists to the ways in which root development can be used to study
basic questions in plant morphogenesis.
