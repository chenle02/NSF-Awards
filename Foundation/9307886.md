Solovay will investigate various topics in Mathematical Logic. A common theme
of many of the questions to be explored is the notion of the consistency
strength of formal systems. Among the questions to be considered are the
following: Did Godel have a proof of the independence of the axiom of choice
from the axioms of type-theory prior to Cohen's discovery of forcing? Is the
non-orthodox system of set-theory proposed by Quine consistent? Can one get
significantly more precise estimates on the "consistency strength" of subsystems
of second order number theory? One of the important discoveries of twentieth
century logic is that the kinds of reasoning carried out by mathematicians can
be codified into axiom systems. The most popular such system, by far, is the
axiom system proposed by Zermelo (and later modified and corrected by Fraenkel
and Skolem), but there are interesting extensions that have been extensively
studied by set theorists as well as some significantly weaker ones beloved by
the mathematically cautious. It has become clear that the study of such weak
subsystems of set-theory is intimately related to large cardinals (a research
specialty of Solovay's). Solovay hopes to apply his expertise in large cardinals
to achieve a more precise calibration of the strength of these weak subsystems.
If successful, this will bring substantial progress to a research program of
some fifty years duration, which excites renewed interest in the present era of
computers.
