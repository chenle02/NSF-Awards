9309098 Varvarigos Communication efficiency is the key to the broad success of
massively parallel computation. One can see that by looking at the success
stories of parallel computation, which are currently limited to applications
that have small communication requirements, or use a small number of processors.
In order to use massively parallel computation for a broader range of
applications efficient algorithms to execute the underlying inter processor
communications have to be developed. The objective of this research is to create
a library of algorithms to execute a number of generic communication tasks in
several multiprocessor topologies. Communication tasks and traffic patterns that
arise often in applications will be examined. Emphasis will be given to finding
easily implementable communication algorithms to execute these tasks in optimal
or near-optimal time. These algorithms can be called as communication primitives
by the programmer of the compiler of a multiprocessor computer in the same way
that subroutines implementing standard functions are called from a library of
functions in a conventional computer. ***
