The severe shortage of qualified STEM teachers necessary to educate and inspire
the future technical workforce undermines our nation's economic competitiveness
and its scientific and technological leadership. The situation in physics is
particularly alarming. Fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are
led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one
shortage area for new K-12 teachers. Since 2001, the Physics Teacher Education
Coalition (PhysTEC), led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American
Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), has been working to engage physics
departments in establishing the infrastructure needed to address the national
physics teacher shortage. Building on the widespread engagement of the physics
community and project experience and knowledge from dozens of successful
programs, this award funds the thirteenth national PhysTEC Conference. This
conference will bring together leaders of PhysTEC Sites, faculty from PhysTEC
Member Institutions, and other members of the physics teacher preparation
community.&lt;br/&gt;Conference goals include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Provide professional
development for physics teacher educators&lt;br/&gt;2. Foster networking among
PhysTEC community members&lt;br/&gt;3. Support faculty learning communities for
PhysTEC Site leaders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide an
opportunity for approximately 100 leaders and participants in the PhysTEC
community to update and expand their knowledge regarding effective practices and
research in physics teacher preparation. An evaluation plan will investigate the
effectiveness of the PhysTEC Conference to engage physics departments, develop
capacity for change, and improve physics teacher preparation, and result in a
survey instrument that can be used for future conferences. Participants will
lead their institutions in adopting research-based practices, including
instructional practices shown to increase student learning and develop knowledge
and skills for teaching physics.
