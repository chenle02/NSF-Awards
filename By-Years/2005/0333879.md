The "Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC)" will advance the
research base and leadership capacity supporting K-12 mathematics curriculum
design, analysis, implementation and evaluation. It will serve the K-12
educational community by focusing scholarly inquiry and professional development
around the issues of mathematics curriculum, examining and characterizing their
role and influence on both teaching and student learning. The Center partners
are: Michigan State University; University of Missouri; Western Michigan
University; Battle Creek Public Schools; Columbia Public Schools; Kalamazoo
Public Schools; Novi Public Schools; the University of Chicago School
Mathematics Project Group; and Horizon Research, Inc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Center will test strategies and produce new knowledge about the impact of
curriculum materials on student and teacher leaning. The Center will examine the
potential of curriculum materials as tools for teacher learning. The work of the
center will contribute to teacher knowledge through the professional development
activities while at the same time creating opportunities for research on these
issues. The diversity that exists in the school partners will also provide
opportunities to gain better understandings of ways instructional materials can
be designed to improve learning among underserved groups.&lt;br/&gt;
