This award will support an observational project to explore the nature of cool
("red") binary and multiple stars. The project adopts a two-pronged approach to
uncover both close binaries and those with wide separation. The main goals of
the project are to reveal important clues about star formation, improve
knowledge of the luminosity and mass functions of individual and multiple red
dwarfs, provide samples for studies of the longevity of wide multiples in the
solar neighborhood, and evaluate whether multiplicity affects the formation of
exoplanets around red dwarfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to
shed light on the process of star formation and how binary and multiple systems
evolve with time. The research will also contribute to the education and
training of students from a variety of backgrounds, and non-scientists will
benefit from opportunities to participate in this project.
