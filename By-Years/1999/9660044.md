*** 9660044 Muzio This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project
involves the development of an enhanced micromixed natural gas combustion
process. This novel combustion process provides the opportunity for a burner
fuel/air mixing system to approach the performance of a premixed combustion
system. This has two major implications in terms of benefits. First, it provides
a means to approach very low NOX levels by not only controlling thermal NOX
formation, but also minimizing prompt NOX formation. This is key to achieving
ultra low NOX performance (i.e., less than 10 ppm). The proposed concept
involves a novel approach to provide micromixing of fuel and air in order to
achieve ultra low NOx emissions (i.e., less than 10 ppm). If successful this
project should provide a cost effective alternative to NOX emission reduction.
