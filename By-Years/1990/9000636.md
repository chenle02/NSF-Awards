At this REU Site electrical engineering seniors will gain research experience by
participating in projects in microelectronics and photonics. Specifically, they
will work on continuing and new projects in a) advanced silicon processing for
devices and integrated circuits, b) high-power and high-frequency bipolar
transistors and other microwave devices, c) III-V compound quantum
nanostructures, d) non-crystalline silicon structures for energy conversion, e)
basic semiconductor material studies and f) ASIC design for high-frequency
circuits and systems. They will work on these projects full time during the
summer and part time during the academic year. Cooperation with Lincoln
University, North Carolina A &amp; T, and the State University of New York- New
Palz, and institutions with a significant minority enrollment is planned. A
microelectronics fabrication course each summer with teaching responsibilities
shared by all four participating faculty is offered. Students will be able to
transfer the course credits to their home institutions. A number of these
research-trained and motivated students will continue into graduate studies and
elsewhere; consequently, graduate students interested in microelectronics and
photonics from the program participants will be actively recruited.
