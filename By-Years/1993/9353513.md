ABSTRACT ESI 93-53513 Christian Hirsch Western Michigan University Kalamazoo,
MI Mathematical Sciences Sequential Summer Institute for High School Mathematics
Teachers This 3-year master's degree program for 30 well-prepared high school
teachers (selected state-wide) builds on a current, state- supported project:
Making Mathematics Accessible to All (MMAA). The program includes 3 sequential
summers of mathematics courses in such areas as: discrete mathematics,
statistics and probability, dynamical systems, transformational geometry, matrix
algebra, etc. All courses in the program stress: applications and mathematical
modeling, the uses of computers and graphing calculators, long-term projects
requiring cooperative group efforts, and writing about mathematics. To
complement the sequential summer program, in each of the 3 academic years,
participants take an additional course, including 2 mathematics education
courses that focus on issues of curriculum; pedagogy; assessment; and the
teacher as a thoughtful practioner, researcher, and mentor. These year-long
courses include 6 2-day meetings on campus and a staff site-visit to each
partcipant's school, but more frequent interaction between participants and
staff will be faciliatted by MichNet. A post- program evaluation study will
document the participants' professional activites and the kinds of leadership
roles they assume. Cost-sharing is 23% of the NSF contribution.
