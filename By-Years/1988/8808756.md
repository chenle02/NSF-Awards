Previous studies of the effects of anharmonicity, and of atomic disorder, in
crystals, are to be extended through a combined theoretical and experimental
investigation. The objective is to study the width and structure in phonon
lineshapes arising from both sources, in extreme cases. Computer programs to
apply the molecular dynamics technique are to be developed, and applied to the
calculation of the correlation function S(k,f) in both types of system.
Inelastic scattering of neutrons will be used to give experimental S(k,f)'s. The
experiments will be perforned as a collaboration with the neutron scattering
group in the physics division at Brookhaven National Laboratories. Materials to
be studied will include argon, aluminum, iron and its alloys, noble metal
alloys, and potassium bromine-rubidium bromine mixtures.
