The P.I.s propose the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with an EDS
x-ray detection system, stage and electron optical column automation, image
acquisition, processing and electron beam lithography software. Specifically, a
JEOL JSM 6400 SEM and Link Analytical eXL analyzer and LZ4 Si(Li) detector,
stage and beam automation hardware and software are requested. The microscope
will be used by a number of engineering research programs in materials science,
microelectronics and tribology. Additional uses will be in biomedical
engineering and related fields. The microscope will be housed in and operated by
the Rippel Electron Microscope Facility at Dartmouth College. Facility personnel
will train others in the use and care of the microscope and will oversee
appropriate use of the microscope.
