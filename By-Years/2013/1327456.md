Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofuel cells are energy sources that rely on
biocatalysts for the transformation of renewable feedstocks to electrical power
via bioelectrochemical pathways. The overall objective of this project is to
develop a biofuel cell that relies on glucose, a sugar derived from
lignocellulosic biomass, as the sole carbon fuel source for electrical power
generation. The device will generate electrons from glucose by a series of
enzymatic reactions which utilize commercial enzymes as the catalytic elements.
The biofuel cell will contain an assembly of biocatalysts on high surface area
electrodes composed of gold microfibers or composite gold carbon nanotube
fibers. The high surface area will enable the immobilization and stabilization
of a high density of enzymes, and will allow for better diffusion of substrates
to and from the electrode. The proposed research will provide insight into the
fabrication of enzymatic electrode on gold microfibers as the scaffold for
construction of a practical biofuel cell. Towards this end, there are three
research tasks: (1) Microfiber fabrication; (2) enzyme immobilization and
electrochemical redox properties; (3) biofuel cell design, fabrication and study
of effects of flow on performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will integrate the proposed
research into education activities with a multi-tiered approach to training and
mentoring, with emphasis on the recruitment and training of women and under-
represented minorities, and co-mentoring experiences for undergrads and graduate
students. Outreach activities include school visits, workshops at the annual
Carnegie Science Center SciTech Festival, middle school summer camp and training
of high school students. A simplified version of the biofuel cell will be
integrated with K-12 educational activities via the existing research
experiences for teachers (RET) and mobile lab initiative.
