Under this PYI award the process of laser excited chemical vapor deposition will
be studied and developed for rapid deposition of films of diamond, born nitride
and other nitrides. The process is a non-equilibrium process which relies on the
number of molecular collisions and therefore should scale up with pressure. This
will be quantified and the dominant chemical species will be determined by
spectroscopic diagnostics. Film morphology, microstructure and mechanical
properties will be correlated with gas phase chemistry in order to optimize the
process parameters.
