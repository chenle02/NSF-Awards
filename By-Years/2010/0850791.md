The goal of this project is to address a series of interesting open problems in
mathematical analysis relating to the Radon transform and its generalizations.
These problems include determining the boundedness of certain multilinear
functionals (nonlinear analogues of the Holder-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities) on
products of Lebesgue spaces, as well as the understanding of the regularity of
averaging operators (in both the standard and overdetermined cases) on Lebesgue
and Lebesgue square integrable Sobolev spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radon
transforms and their generalizations are intimately connected to some of the
greatest outstanding problems in modern analysis, including the Kakeya
conjecture, the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, the Restriction conjecture, and
Sogge?s local smoothing conjecture. The intellectual merit of the particular
problems to be studied in this project is that their solutions require
significant new theoretical insight, and they are potentially significant steps
on the road to solution of some of these broader outstanding
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding the Radon transform and
its generalizations also may have broader impacts on other fields within the
scientific community. Medical imaging, including CT and SPECT scans, NMR
imaging, RADAR, and SONAR applications all depend on a deep theoretical and
practical understanding of the Radon transform. Optical-acoustic tomography,
scattering theory, and even motion-detection algorithms also depend on the Radon
transform. All of these fields and more could potentially benefit from insights
produced by this project.&lt;br/&gt;
