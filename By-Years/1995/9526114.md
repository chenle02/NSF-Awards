9526114 Paulraj Traditional barriers across disciplines such as Communications,
Computing, Control, and Signal Processing are fast disappearing. New
technological challenges require concepts and techniques from several
disciplines. Moreover, interdisciplinary approaches are being increasingly
developed to tackle challenging problems in seemingly disparate areas. Driven by
fundamentally new applications and approaches, the coming century will need even
further convergence and cross- fertilization of ideas. The general objective of
the conference is to highlight some of the recent advances made toward
developing and integrated approach to problem solving at various levels, and to
communicate some of the exciting questions and challenges that remain unsolved.
The conference will stimulate discussions at various levels: mathematical
foundations; algorithms: statistical and computational efficiency, numerical
issues, new paradigms; architectures (parallel systems, hardwired,
reconfigurable and programmable). ***
