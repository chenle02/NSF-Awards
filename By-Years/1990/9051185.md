Students in precalculus and calculus are working in teams in a laboratory
equipped with Macintosh IIcx computers running Mathematica. Mathematical
concepts are clarified and reinforced by visualization, more realistic problems
and models are considered, and writing skills and understanding of concepts are
improved by the requirement of formal written reports. The institution will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
