Research Planning Grant: Experimenting with Different Control Structures for
Text Analysis This grant provides support for planning a research project based
on the previous natural language processing research of the principal
investigator, which was interrupted for a period of time. Its emphasis is on
study and experimentation in two areas related to text analysis. The first area
involves verb classification taxonomies, and will incorporate recent linguistic
work in the categorization of English verbs, along with implementations in
existing computational systems. The second area is that of flexible control
structures for integration of semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic information in
processing, with the hope of making the control of the analysis process flexible
while retaining the efficiency of some of the best syntactic parsing procedures.
