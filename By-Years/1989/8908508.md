This is a fundamental engineering research project to characterize the
mechanical and rheological properties of sickle erythrocytes under various
physiological and therapeutic conditions. A better fundamental understanding of
the mechanical engineering properties of sickle cells could be used to base new
therapies for treating sickle cell anemia.
