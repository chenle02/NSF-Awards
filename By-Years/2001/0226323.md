The Collections project, Viewing the Future: Aligning Internet2 Video to K-12
Curriculum, is using the high quality Internet2 video resources from the
University of Washington's UWTV and ResearchChannel to build a collection of
STEM materials for the K-12 community. These resources are being aligned to
state and national curriculum standards, including relevant classroom
assessments. The project is allowing teachers to attach feedback and contexts-
of-use, and to place descriptive records for the Internet2 resources into Merit
Network's widely used and scalable Michigan Teacher Network (MTN), and to
disseminate further project work through the University of Washington's Pacific
Lighthouse project. This project is developing the means to transfer curricular
material in new and exciting ways and is aiding K-12 educators engage in a
community of shared practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viewing the Future is
building on the networking performance of Internet2 for the delivery of video,
including traditional video as well as simulations, animations, virtual reality
movies, images with audio sound tracks, remote control of microscopes and other
instrumentation, and other types of digital media objects. Access is not limited
to only those schools with Internet2 capabilities. For all educators, this
project is allowing teachers and students to identify and to utilize video
relevant to learning needs. Even with the most exciting multimedia enhancements
to learning resources, K-12 educators must still respond to state and national
teaching and learning standards in order to prepare students for high-stakes
assessments. This project is moving beyond solely generating rich, item level
descriptions of Internet2 video based on IEEE/LOM metadata toward making
available previously uncollected and uncategorized Internet2 video resources.
The project is scaffolding additional use of Internet video by capturing teacher
feedback and contexts-of-use, is supporting classroom integration of resources
through online professional development, is using existing dissemination
initiatives to reach many K-12 educators, and is adhering to standards and
protocols of the ever-increasing NSDL environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viewing
the Future is building capacity in all partner organizations to collect,
describe, and support innovative teaching resources on a sustained basis. By
leveraging existing Internet2 connectivity applications to serve all K-12 users,
the proposed project is also forming the basis for increasing priority and use
of broadband connectivity and applications in teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;
