9422885 Mathias This project encompasses fundamental investigations of monomer
synthesis and polymerizations based on multifunctional acrylates. Recent results
demonstrate the ability to control rates of polymerization for monoacrylates
with a variety of pendant functional groups at the alpha methyl position
including halides, ethers and especially esters. The latter display unexpectedly
rapid polymerizations which make them excellent candidates for hard and rapidly
generated thin films via photopolymerizations. Diacrylates linked at the alpha
methyl position with ether, carbon and amine or amide groups provide entry to
high glass-transition-temperature materials with multiple functionality pendant
from the polymer backbone. The steric and electronic effects of these
substituents on the efficiency and stereochemistry of the cyclopolymerization
process leading to 5-and/or 6-membered rings in the polymer backbone will be
explored. The combination of pendant groups that can be incoprorated makes
possible applications in microlithography, biological and drug uses, catalytic
and supernculeophilic reagent materials, and modifiers for commercially
important acrylates and methacrylates. %%% This project encompasses new monomers
and polymers which lead to materials with greatly improved physical and chemical
properties. These materials have enhanced capabilities for use in
photolithography and microelectronics, anti-cancer and biological materials,
surface coatings and encapsulation, and property enhancers for currently used
acrylate, methacrylate, and stryrenic materials. ***
