9601885 Sleight An X-ray diffraction system for materials research will be
acquired by Oregon State University. The system will support studies of thin-
film superconductors, transparent conductors, electroluminescent devices,
magnetic semiconductors and dielectrics; thermal expansion of materials and
other dynamic studies; nonlinear optical crystals; and nanocomposites. The
proposed instrument will expand current capabilities for structural
characterization of materials by including components for analyzing thin films
and collecting data quickly, both at low and high temperatures. %%% The added
measurement capabilities will provide a means for establishing an understanding
of the basic relationships among structure, properties, and processing
conditions for a given material. These relationships will then be used as a
basis for creating new or improved materials. The proposed activities will be
performed in a collaborative interdisciplinary mode, enhancing both the
prospects for solving difficult problems and the research training of students.
