California State University Fullerton (CSUF), the John D. Cooper Archaeological
and Paleontological Center, and various Orange County, California high schools
and community colleges are engaged through this award in a planning effort to
develop a new geoscience paleontology-based internship program for
underrepresented minority students. Five workshops that engage representatives
from the partner organizations are being held. Major focus areas of the planning
activity are to: build understanding and trust among the different stakeholders;
identify the institutional, administrative, and logistical barriers to
implementing a successful and sustainable internship program; develop co-
curricular activities; and, develop a tracking and assessment plan to monitor
students participating in the various programs. The ultimate goal of this
program is to engage diverse students in geoscience education and career
pathways through hands-on, scientist-mentored research experiences based at the
Center. The internship will capitalize on the recently established Cooper
Center, which offers numerous opportunities for students to learn about fossil
curation and preservation and work alongside professional geoscientists.
Additional participants include Fullerton Union, Troy Tech, and Magnolia High
Schools and Fullerton, Santa Ana, Santiago Canyon, Mt. San Antonio, Orange Coast
and El Camino community colleges. This project directly serves the NSF and GEO
Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM disciplines, generally,
and in the geosciences, specifically.
