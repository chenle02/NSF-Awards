J.Riely&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is a means of
updating the functionality and security policies of high-confidence computer
systems in a way that is both dynamic (can be accomplished while the system
runs) and safe (does not compromise the trustworthiness of the
system).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal investigates the use of aspect-
oriented techniques in the dynamic configuration of high-confidence software
systems. The specification and implementation and verification of secured
components will be studied in an aspect-oriented style. The addition of new
software components, both for additional functionality and for security, will be
modeled as dynamic aspects, which can modify software during its
execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic aspects may allow for flexibility in the
dynamic configuration of software, but they also introduce the possibility for
subtle bugs to be introduced in the interaction between conflicting aspects. A
similar problem (known as the Feature Interaction Problem) has been studied in
the telecommunications field. The experience and techniques from that area will
be brought to bear on security features modeled as
aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A class-based, object-oriented language with
dynamic advice loading will be defined. Temporal logic will be used to specify
both security properties and the conditions under which cutpoints apply. Static
and dynamic analysis methods will be developed to identify interactions between
aspects. Finally, tools will be developed to support these methods, and they
will be applied in case studies.&lt;br/&gt;
