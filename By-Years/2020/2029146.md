COVID-19 is the first major pandemic to disrupt person-to-person interactions on
a global scale, but it is unlikely to be the last. The U.S. government, firms
and organizations around the world invest billions of dollars every year on
research and development to create novel inventions and develop new capabilities
and strategies to address contemporary problems. The COVID-19 pandemic
represents a challenge to the process of invention that no previous economic
crisis imposed. Invention is critical for sustaining a nationâ€™s economy and for
developing the tools to solve problems and manage crises. The act of knowledge
creation and invention is premised upon person-to-person interactions, and not
only between workers within firms and organizations, but with customers,
competitors, supply chain partners, and service providers. The project
quantifies the effects of COVID-19 disease transmission mitigation strategies on
tacit knowledge exchange and impacts on US invention rates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will quantify the extent of impact that
constraints on human interaction by constructing a new data set for real-time
investigation and identify inventor and domain characteristics that are more
resilient to change. Furthermore, the work will compare national strategies to
see if there are different outcomes for invention and patent application rates.
The work is novel from moving from the traditional USTPO dataset to a time
series dashboard that analyzes patents with only a 30-day lag (rather than the
traditional 18-month lag). The work will analyze the size of the businesses to
examine whether national strategies have affected different types of businesses
abilities to patent. The work will inform our understanding of the consequences
of crisis policies on invention. Invention is essential for the economy;
therefore, policies that significantly decrease our ability to innovate will
affect the outcome on the economy. Understanding the ways in which policies can
protect innovation while mitigating the spread of disease will be important for
the continual management of the pandemic and future crises. This work will
inform the theory of innovation and particularly the notion of innovation
resilience and will be made available online for the research community, policy
makers, and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
