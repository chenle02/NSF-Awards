This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the Gonzaga University in the purchase
of a dual length drybox. This equipment will be used in the following areas of
research: (1) The synthesis of transition metal porphyrin complexes; (2)
Preparation of new solid state materials; (3) The synthesis and testing of new
ion-exchange materials; (4) The synthesis of new transition metal fluoroalkoxide
complexes. Dryboxes are routinely used in academic, industrial, and government
laboratories to provide an inert atmosphere environment for the safe
manipulation of air- or water-sensitive materials.
