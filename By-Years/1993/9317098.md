9312847 Zhang This award supports cooperative work with Chinese scientists at
Shandong Teacher's University, Jinan, China on quantum dynamics of polyatomic
molecules. The U.S. principal investigator, John Zhang of New York University,
will work with NYU graduate students on a two year collaboration with the Atomic
and Molecular Physics Group at Shandong Teacher's College. Understanding the
fundamental mechanisms that control intra-and intermolecular energy transfer and
energy partitioning among the products of unimolecular reactions is of practical
importance in chemical dynamics. As studies of unimolecular reaction move ever
closer toward state to state level thanks to advances in laser and molecular
beam technologies, it is increasingly important and necessary to use dynamical
theories to simulate unimolecular processes in order to understand the detailed
dynamics and features of the potential energy surfaces that characterize
unimolecular reactions. In this proposal, the researchers will focus on rigorous
quantum mechanical study for vibrational predissociation of HF dimer and other
hydrogen bonded complexes and the direct photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide.
