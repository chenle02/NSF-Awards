PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct a 2-year empirical study
that will: (1) identify the mentoring structures that are empirically observable
in undergraduate research experiences at research universities, in terms of the
strength and function of relationships within the undergraduate-postgraduate-
faculty triad; (2) examine how different mentoring structures relate to the
cognitive, behavioral, and affective outcomes undergraduates realize from
participating in research; and (3) determine the extent to which women and
underrepresented minority undergraduates experience different mentoring
structures or realize outcomes differentially in comparison to majority
students.
