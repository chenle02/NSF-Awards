Engineering (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Briar Colleges S-STEM project is
providing fourteen, four-year, $10,000/year scholarships to academically-
talented female students who major in engineering science and/or engineering
management. Scholarship recipients, selected by a steering committee composed of
engineering faculty and admissions staff, will have demonstrated academic
achievement in high school or in a community college, financial need, and a
strong interest in pursuing engineering. Support systems include scholar
orientations, a mentor program with area women engineers, participation in
local, regional, and national engineering events (e.g. SWE), a peer mentor
system, career counseling events, and a job placement program.
