Quantification of neutral species densities in the upper thermosphere and lower
exosphere remains elusive in spite of recent advances in both theoretical
modeling and observations. Techniques for routinely measuring neutral atmosphere
parameters using ground-based instruments is essential if progress is to be
made. This award takes advantage of precise new measurement capabilities to
attack the problem of atomic oxygen and hydrogen density quantification in the
region of low-earth orbit. The study will make use of measurements of light ion
species densities and ion temperatures in the F-region through the topside
ionosphere that are currently being made at the Arecibo and Millstone Hill
Observatories. The radar observations are combined with sensitive optical
airglow measurements, and neutral densities are extracted using ion-energy
balance, charge exchange equilibrium, and the coupled moments of the Boltzmann
equation. The methodology uses existing radar chain data and new measurements
from clustered instrumentation at Arecibo. The study will lead to a self-
consistent technique to derive neutral densities routinely and reliably at and
above the F-region peak through ground based remote sensing of the coupled
atmospheric regions. In addition to evaluating and constraining contemporary
atmospheric models and theories, the proposed activity will further address
broad concerns of the scientific community by allowing for the important
characterization of the neutral atmosphere with respect to secular, temporal,
seasonal, and solar cycle variations.
