Complex multiphase chemistry, convection-dominated three- dimensional fluid
flow, and hierarchies of heterogeneities in porous media are essential features
in modeling of modern enhanced oil recovery and the transport of contaminants.
In order to simulate fluid flows for these problems, the investigator will
develop higher-order finite difference methods, in combination with
sophisticated phase behavior algorithms and adaptive mesh refinement. These
techniques will be applied to realistic engineering problems occurring in
current enhanced oil recovery processes and contaminant transport. Because of
the intense computational effort, all of the algorithms will be designed for
efficient implementation on modern supercomputers, and effective visualization
techniques will be employed.
