Seasonal cycles of reproduction and development are very common in a wide
variety of animals that utlize the length of the day as a cue to asses the time
of year. The research proposed is directed toward understanding the mechanism by
which daylength (or photoperiod) is measured. Previous studies have led to the
hypothesis regulates the biological clock that regulates daily (i.e., circadian)
rhythms of behavior and metabolism is involved in photoperiodic time
measurement. We plan to directly test that hypothesis utilizing and insect, the
cricket, Gryllus firmus, as a model system. There are two specific goals of the
research program. The first is to confirm that the "circadian clock" is in fact
a component of the "photoperiodic clock" that regulates seasonal rhythms. The
second is to initiate studies to determine the precise role of the circadian
clock in carrying otu the measurement of daylength. Gryllus Firmus females lay
eggs that either develop immediately or enter a state of developmental arrest.
If the adult female is maintained in long, summer-like days (e.g., 14 h of light
per day) then the egge develop, but if the females ismaintained in short,
winter-like days the eggs undergo developmentyal arrest for over-wintering. We
plan to characterize the anatomical and physiological organization of the
circadian system thaty regualtes daily rhythms of locomototr activity, and
examine the specific role played by the circadian system in photoperiodic time
measurement.
