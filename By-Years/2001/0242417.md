A fully digitized multimedia enriched world will be a reality when security and
quality of the multimedia content can be guaranteed. Information hiding
(watermarking, digital fingerprinting, etc.) has been gaining popularity in this
quest for security. Investigation of information hiding based security
techniques that suit multimedia data and networks is the goal of this project.
Primarily, this project considers problems in providing multimedia security from
the following different perspectives: (a) Encoder/Content originator
perspective, (b) Decoder/Content recipient perspective, (c) Attacker's
perspective, and (d) Networking perspective. Studying the multimedia data
security problem from these perspectives could lead to a better understanding of
security issues from an end-to-end system view point. Connections between
perceptually based and information theory based information hiding, and content
based watermarking will be investigated with robustness and embedding capacity
being the main focus. Detector dependent embedding and game theoretic
formulation to study the dynamics between the decoder and a malicious attacker
are proposed. A new attack dependent definition of security and methods to
compute the information hiding capacity based on this definition are also
proposed in this project. Finally, joint source-channel coding and multiple
description coding approaches for robust watermark systems that can handle
network losses are also of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
