This proposal requests continuing support for the particle physics group at
Northeastern University covering a comprehensive three-year program of studies
of the top quark and electroweak physics at the D0 experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron and preparation plans for the turn-on of the CMS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland. Experimental particle
physics at the energy frontier has taken on a new importance in light of recent
cosmological and astrophysical data. It is an exciting time to pursue this
forefront research. The proposal describes the proposed activities in the
following two areas: (1) Electroweak (EW) and top-quark physics in D0. This
activity also includes the group's hardware and software responsibilities in the
collaboration. (2) Construction and preparation for physics in CMS. The group's
goal on CMS is to carry out a wide range of research studies, with an emphasis
on electroweak physics and searches for new phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;The group is
active in a broad range of outreach and education initiatives. These activities
are connected to their core research program by involving students in the
research at CERN and Fermilab.&lt;br/&gt;
