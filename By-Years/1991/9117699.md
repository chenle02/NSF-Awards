This research is to develop a better theory governing the propagation of Love
and Rayleigh surface waves on a laterally heterogeneous earth model. The theory
uses a slowly varying Lagrangian method to develop a JWKB theory that is then
extended in a JWKB-Maslov manner to be valid near caustics, that is, near the
source and antipode of the surface waves. Unlike other theories, this then will
be applicable over the entire earth. The resulting computer program will be
applied to the study of surface wave amplitude variations including geometric
focusing and defocusing, laterally heterogeneous anelasticity, and earthquake
source directivity. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
