This project is to provide information, academic activities and educational
exposure to the marine environment to faculty and students from colleges and
universities with enrollments dominated by minority groups. It will be operated
by nine members of the Southern Association of Marine Laboratories (SAML), and
36 Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCUs). Additional HMCUs
will be encouraged to participate in the project during its second year. The
three major components are: provision of support for minority students to
participate in courses and research at SAML institutions; provision of academic
interactions between SAML members and HMCUs (seminars, faculty visits, marine
familiarization programs); and provision of marine field trip experience to
colleges and universities whose student bodies are dominated by minority
students. These proposed activities will reach more than 350 students and 75
faculty annually.
