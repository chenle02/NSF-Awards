The PIs propose to perform detailed analyses of comprehensive optical and radar
measurements obtained during CEDAR campaigns at Sondre Stromfjord. The project's
major goals are to elucidate long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in
auroral zone neutral composition in response to auroral energy deposition.
Current problems in understanding thermopheric photochemistry will be
investigated, along with analysis of data using the auroral electron,
photoelectron, photochemistry, and spectral synthesis codes.
