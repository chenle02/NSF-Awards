The Noyce Fellowship Program at the University of Colorado at Boulder is an
enhancement of the STEM Teacher Preparation (STEM-TP) project, a collaboration
between the School of Education and four mathematics and science research
departments. Collaborative, student-centered learning is introduced into large-
enrollment courses by employing talented undergraduate STEM majors as Learning
Assistants. Learning Assistants are then recruited to become K-12 teachers.
Through the Noyce Program, substantial fellowships are provided to help overcome
barriers that these students face in obtaining their teaching licensure. The
program identifies and recruits STEM majors into the teaching profession at any
time during their undergraduate careers, and includes both a post-baccalaureate
and a Master's Degree program. Noyce Fellows teach in high-needs schools and
participate in an induction program where they receive intensive mentoring and
support. The STEM-TP/Noyce program addresses fundamental issues in education,
including: (1) the advantages of and barriers to collaborative learning in large
enrollment settings; (2) the development of pedagogical skills and attitudes
toward K-12 teaching among STEM majors; (3) the development of attitudes of
faculty members regarding student-centered learning and the responsibility of
preparing K-12 teachers; and (4) the induction and retention of new teachers in
high-needs schools.
