the study of the distribution of mass of high dimensional convex bodies or more
general of log-concave probability measures. Recently, several classical results
from probability theory have been extended to the broader setting of these
measures. These new results appear to be out of reach of the classical
probabilistic reasoning based on independence which is replaced by the geometric
notion of convexity. The PI intends to further investigate the geometric
parameters of high-dimensional measures and in particular the geometry of
generalized centroid bodies associated to these measures. With this approach and
applying techniques from local theory of Banach spaces, classical convexity,
probability and information theory, the PI wishes to attack various open
problems related to log-concave measures such as small ball probability
estimates and the hyperplane conjecture, as well as, various conjectures in the
theory of convex bodies such as the regularity of the entropy numbers and the
optimal bound of the minimal mean width. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a
general principle that underlies the research in this proposal: the tendency of
high dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms. This is a central
fact that influences the study of complex systems which appear in probability,
combinatorics, statistical physics and complexity. The unexpected regularity of
high dimensional convex bodies when viewed as probability spaces is expected to
add a new component to our understanding of this general principle. Applications
to random polytopes, random matrices, and random algorithms (topics from
combinatorics, mathematical physics and informatics respectively) have already
been discovered, indicating that&lt;br/&gt;more should be expected in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
