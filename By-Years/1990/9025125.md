When earthquakes strike, federal, state and local emergency response and
disaster assistance systems move into place. The responders are periodically
trained through response exercises which provide realistic simulations of
possible disasters. The exercises prepare participants to make decisions,
coordinate with others and face extreme situations under extraordinary pressure.
However, after the emergency responders have gone back to normal operations, the
tasks of rebuilding are just beginning. A new set of players faces extreme and
unanticipated circumstances which can dominate work for years to come. This
project is designed to help planners across the country who someday may be faced
with the immense challenge of guiding the rebuilding of a community damaged by
an earthquake. The proposed project is to draw upon and expand past work of the
principal investigators and others to develop a model timeline of rebuilding
after earthquakes. This model timeline will be synthesized from actual timelines
of rebuilding constructed for 15 to 18 communities damaged by earthquakes. It
will show the sequence and relationships of key rebuilding actions and decisions
pertaining to clearance, repairing infrastructure, rehousing, business recovery,
restoration of public facilities, and reconstruction planning. The model
timeline will then be used as the basis for creating a simulation exercise
telescoping 10 to 20 years of rebuilding activity into a two-day, realistic,
interactive learning experience for local planners. The simulation exercise will
be tested with a group of planners invited from around the country, revised, and
then described in a report for use by local planning departments.
