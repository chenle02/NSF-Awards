Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past forty years have been characterized by a
secular decline in interest rates and, relatedly, an increase in asset
valuations. This proposal consists of two projects that examine the
distributional effects of declining interest rates. The first project explores
the effect of declining interest rates on wealth inequality. The second examines
the welfare implications of declining interest rates by focusing on who gains
and who loses from this trend. The project further collects detailed data on
high wealth income, and granular data on asset purchases from financial filings
and surveys. The project has policy implications in understanding the role of
monetary policy on wealth inequality and individual welfare.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project develops a sufficient statistic approach
to determine the long-run effect of lower rates on top wealth inequality, as
measured by the Pareto exponent of the wealth distribution. Sufficient statistic
is estimated by creating a new dataset on the financing of firms owned by
billionaires in the US, by combining surveys of fortunes, financial filings, and
stock and firm level financial data. The second project will examine the effect
of lower rates, or alternatively higher asset valuations, on individual welfare.
Using a standard consumption-saving model, the project will derive a sufficient
statistic that captures the lifetime effect of lower rates on welfare. The
project will then quantify these statistics by using micro-data on net asset
purchases across the whole wealth distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
