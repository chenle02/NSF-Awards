The experimental and theoretical studies of the superstructures formed from the
isothermal compressions of lipid monolayers have provided Dr. McConnell with a
wealth of intriguing and important avenues to probe in the elucidation of the
properties of induced phospholipid domains. The planned research has two
principal objectives. The first is to develop theory and experiment to the point
where the monolayer domain patterns are thoroughly understood. The second is to
extend the theory and experiment to bilayers on solid supports.
