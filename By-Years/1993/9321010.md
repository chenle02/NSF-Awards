9321010 McKibbin The purpose of this project is to extend and refine a
multicountry economic model to explore the consequences of regional and global
environmental policies that might be used to control global climate change. This
model will be extended in several ways. First, greater attention will be paid to
the treatment of developing countries. Second, the model will be improved by
moving to a more flexible econometric specification. Third, a wide range of
unilateral and multilateral global warming control policies will be analyzed,
with particular emphasis on the effect of policies such as trade in carbon
intensive goods. Forth, China will be treated in greater detail, separate from
other developing countries. Fifth, a general framework for modeling non-
renewable resources will be developed in order to analyze how constraints on the
availability of fossil fuels would affect carbon emissions and the development
of alternative energy sources. Sixth, a set of baseline forecasts will be
generated regarding carbon dioxide emissions under a variety of alternative
assumptions such as population growth and technological change in different
regions. ***
