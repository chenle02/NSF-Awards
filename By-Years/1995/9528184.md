NCR-9528184 George Whitehead Bellcore, Tektronix, the Joint Interoperability
Test Command (JITC), and the University of Pennsylvania will implement an ATM
Interoperability Testbed to develop tools, procedures, and standards that
promote interoperability among Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) products. The
project will focus on three key areas of ATM technology and include relevant
research and development of interoperability testing systems. These areas are 1)
ATM signaling Interoperability, 2) ATM traffic management interoperability, and
3) higher-layer protocol interoperability. These areas are chosen because
standards for signaling, traffic management and higher layer protocol
interoperability.
