With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is
cofunded by Chemistry, Professor Karen Allen and colleagues from Boston
University will acquire a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer. The proposal is
aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in
areas such as (a) chemical and catalytic mechanisms of enzymes, (b)
characterization of proteins, (c) natural product biosynthesis, (d) assignment
of absolute stereochemistry of enantiomerically pure compounds, (e)
determination of structural perturbations caused by mutations in glycolytic
enzyme, and (f) stabilization of the functional form of NF-kappa-b essential
modulator (NEMO) protein.

A circular dichroism spectrophotometer will produce spectral data that provide
information on molecular structure and especially the conformations of bio-
molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes. The principle of
measurement is based on differential absorption of left and right circularly
polarized light by optically active samples such as those in the double helix of
DNA. The instrument will provide research and laboratory training in analytical
techniques that allow measurement of physical properties of organic and
inorganic molecules to graduate and undergraduate students as well as
postdoctoral fellows. The CD spectrophotometer will be integrated into training
of students in the Chemistry and Biology Departments, as well as the
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program for the study of intermolecular
interactions, geometric isomers and protein structure.
