the (18th) Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics will actively engage
68 talented and high motivated high school students and 9 faculty in the
creation of a lively, rigorous environment in which mathematics is created,
shared, and enjoyed. Faculty and students will live together, eat together, and
work together in small workshops, classes, and problem seminars (which meet for
37 hours each week). Participants will receive personal mathematical and career
guidance on a daily basis, and will cone to see themselves as full members of a
productive mathematical community. Challenging problems, significant and active
branches of mathematics, and substantial applications from outside the usual
secondary and college curricula will be intensively investigated, but emphasis
will be placed on the methods of discovery and proof. Visiting mathematicians
and users of mathematics, computer labs, films, and other activities are
designed to enhance participant's understanding of the nature of mathematics,
the range of its influence, and the opportunities open to those who do it.
