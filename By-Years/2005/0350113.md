LAY SUMMARY; ION CHANNELS in HIPPOCAMPAL ASTROCYTES. Harold K. Kimelberg and Min

Voltage gated ion channels for the small cations sodium (Na+ ) and potassium
(K+ ) are responsible for the wave of depolarization that travels down the
neuronal axon and excites other neurons to which it is linked by synapses, where
the depolarization releases neurotransmitters which rapidly diffuse across the
synaptic cleft to stimulate the next neuron, and so on,. The formation of
circuits by such connected neurons are thought to underlie how the brain works.
The properties of the Na+ and K+ ion channels in neurons have been extensively
studied. The other major type of brain cells are called glia and they are not
excitable. Current studies have now shown that these cells can contain the same
type of voltage sensitive sodium and potassium channels as are found in neurons,
and also voltage dependant chloride channels. This is surprising as the function
of these channels is thought to be to modulate neuronal excitability and the
glia are unexcitable. This project will use a freshly isolated preparation of
one of the main kinds of glial cells the astroglia to identify what ion channels
are present in these cells and to help understand their functions. Our work to
date shows that this preparation can be divided into two different classes of
astroglia based on a different repertoire of channels. Knowledge of the detailed
properties of these channels will give us important clues as to their functions.
We will test one hypothesis that one type of astrocyte but not the other has K+
channels and Cl- channels designed to allow it take up K+ plus Cl- when K+ is
released via the outward rectifying K+ channel on neurons during impulse
conduction. (293 words).
