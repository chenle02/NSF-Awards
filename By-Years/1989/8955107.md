This program is designed to train 20 science supervisors and 80 science
teachers to replicate and implement specific experiential methodologies using
applications of the built environment (bridges, buildings and beams) to increase
the interest of middle school students in the study of science and mathematics.
These methodologies were developed over the past 15 years by Dr. Mario
Salvadori. The program, which will be conducted in several phases at the City
College of The City University of New York, focuses on an experimental training
model for instructors. For the summer of 1990, The City College and
participating districts will identify and recruit 20 appropriate science
supervisory candidates for Phase I of the program. At the same time curriculum
materials, hands-on activities, and teaching strategies will be refined for this
phase of the project. Upon the completion of these steps, selected supervisors
will be trained by Dr. Salvadori and his assistants using these materials on the
built environment. They will teach both content and methodology to the
participants. This comprises Phase II of the program. In Phase III, six
qualified supervisors, chosen from the initial 20, will train 60 selected middle
school teachers (in three groups) in the Salvadori program replicating their own
training. Simultaneously, Dr. Salvadori will train an additional complement of
20 teachers. Beginning in 1990, the workshops are scheduled for 4-hours, after
school, once a week for 15-weeks. Participants will earn 4 graduate credits. In
Phase IV of the program, 60 teachers taught by the supervisors and the 20
teachers taught directly by Dr. Salvadori will implement the program in their
own schools. They will receive support in their schools on an ongoing basis from
project staff, and will be invited to periodic conferences at The City College
to reinforce the basic ideas fostered by the program. Throughout the program a
thorough evaluation will be conducted to ascertain the effect and
transferability of the Salvadori program to schools where Dr. Salvadori is not
directly involved. Cost sharing in an amount of $590,514 equals 205% of the NSF
award.
