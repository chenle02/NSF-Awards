This award supports participation of The Texas Women in Mathematics Symposium
(TWIMS) which will be held on February 1-2 2020 at Texas A&amp;M University in
College Station, Texas. The aim of TWIMS is to highlight the research of women
mathematicians in Texas, to strengthen the network of Texas-based women
mathematicians, to provide a supportive platform for women mathematicians to
present their work. This is the fourth TWIMS conference, following events held
at the University of Texas at Austin, Sam Houston State University, and the

A&amp;M University are: to showcase the research of women mathematicians in
Texas; to strengthen the network of Texas-based women mathematicians; to provide
a supportive platform for women mathematicians to present their work; to explore
issues surrounding being a woman in mathematics; to find collaborators and
mentors and begin long-lasting professional relationships. Conference details
