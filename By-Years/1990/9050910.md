This proposal calls for the development of a field course in Marine Geophysics
that will concentrate on seismic reflection data acquisition, processing and
interpretation. Students will develop proposals that describe an experiment and
present a plan of attack to address the problem. One or two projects will be
undertaken as a group effort. This will involve short cruises in the coastal
waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay. Our results will be published as
a group effort.
