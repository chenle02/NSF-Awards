This grant will support Dr. Ntafos' work in computational geometry for robot
motion planning under uncertainty. Specific problem domains include limited
visibility range, unknown environments, and terrain regions offering different
traversal costs. Robotic goals include least-weight path planning, limited-
visibility watchman and sweeper route planning, and scheduling of surveillance
tours with multiple watchmen under a variety of coordination and optimization
criteria.
