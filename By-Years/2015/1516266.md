The goal of this program is to use simulations to understand corrections to the
distribution of weak gravitational lensing effects caused by the particles that
make up normal matter (known as "baryons"); gravitational lensing is the process
in which large amounts of matter bend the light coming from more distant
objects, located beyond the matter distributions. These simulations would reduce
systematic errors for next-generation studies of the "dark energy" phenomenon
that causes the accelerating expansion of the universe that use weak lensing.
Broader impacts are substantial and include training of undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as public outreach. Dr. Zentner will give public
lectures at the Allegheny Observatory, conduct educational events at the
Carnegie Science Center Buhl Academy, organize the University of Pittsburgh's
Astronomy Outreach Program, and lecture at continuing education events for
public school teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program addresses the issue
that all weak lensing surveys probe small scales where baryonic effects become
important in the interpretation of dark energy studies, and includes carefully
planned steps to deal with these effects. A key strength is the use of multiple
approaches to model the effects of baryons: parameterizing baryonic effects by
modifying density profiles; using blind analyses of simulations with different
baryonic effects; cluster expansion methods; and Lagrangian methods.
