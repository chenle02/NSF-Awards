"Groups, Graphs, and Geometry," hosted at the University of North Carolina,
Asheville, provides eight talented college math majors with the opportunity to
engage in original research in mathematics. Faculty possessing substantial
experience in mentoring undergraduate research projects lead this summer REU
program. Students focus on problems which lie at the intersection of several
related fields of mathematics (group theory, graph theory, and geometry), and a
number of the projects have practical implications as well as theoretical ones.
For instance, several of the students in past years of the program have
investigated models for communication networks, relationship networks, and other
dynamically changing structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program does more than
give participating students an authentic research experience. It also trains
them in professional skills such as library research, abstract-writing, and
technical communication. Furthermore, through their participation in the
program, the students are ushered into the mathematical community as they meet
and consult with top researchers in the program's focal fields and are given
support and encouragement to attend and present at regional and national
conferences. By these means the students are set on a path leading to successful
careers in mathematics.
