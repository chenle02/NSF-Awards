Combining an academic-year leadership program with summer institutes for junior
and senior high school mathematics teachers, this three-year project will
develop a model for collaboration between a university and the public schools.
Each year, five "co-op teachers" will spend the academic year at the university,
teaching and taking courses, participating in a colloquium on mathematics
instruction, and working on an independent project. Each summer, twenty other
teachers will participate in a four-week workshop that focuses on problem-
solving and the use of microcomputers and programmable calculators in teaching
mathematics. Follow-up activities include six meetings during the academic year,
as well as visits by the university faculty and the co-op teachers to the
participants' classrooms. The evaluation will assess the project's effect on the
participants' teaching practices and the co-op teachers' development as
instructional leaders. The project will serve a total of 75 teachers, including
15 co-op teachers, from the Tucson, Arizona, area. The university and the school
districts are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to 250% of the NSF
award.
