Abstract ? Award Number 1505098 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Livingstone College is
completing the implementation of an HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in
STEM Education project to examine the impact of the Advancing Interest and
Motivation (AIM) model on student career interests, motivation, self-efficacy,
career outcome expectations, and employment outcomes in STEM. The PIs also
propose a supplemental study using structural equation modeling and path
analysis to study self-regulation and its influences on STEM career interests
and progression. AIM is designed for Livingstone College juniors and seniors
from the biology, mathematics, and computer information systems departments in
collaboration with the Office of Career Services and STEM faculty. The research
framework is based on social cognitive career theory. The research design will
incorporate pre- and post-tests of students? career development orientations
using quantitative surveys to measure the effectiveness of the career
development program. The PIs will also employ a path model to examine the
theoretical relationships explicated by social cognitive career
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will inform STEM teaching and career
development intervention strategies. The findings could contribute to the
current body of information regarding phenomena associated with STEM majors that
do not pursue STEM careers, an important aspect to understand in trying to
increase the representation of minorities in the STEM workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal was evaluated following the merit review
process in accordance with procedures and criteria stated in the NSF Grant
Proposal Guide. On March 25-26, 2013, a review panel of STEM education and
research experts reviewed the proposal based on National Science Board approved
criteria as well as specific criteria stated in the program solicitation (NSF
13-516).
