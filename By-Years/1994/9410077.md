The project focuses on two important inter-related issues in the design of
large scale parallel computers: inter-processor communication and fault-
tolerance. The nature of the research is one of synthesizing theoretical and
practical approaches to parallel computing. Efficient inter-processor
communication is at the heart of efficient parallel computing. With some
exceptions, much of the theoretical work has focused on provably optimal
algorithms that are often too complex to implement. On the other hand, much of
the implemented routing hardware have simpler designs but lack theoretical
guarantees as to their performance. This project will attempt to bridge this gap
and focus on simple routing schemes that are provably good (though not always
optimal). Fault tolerance is becoming ever-increasingly important in the world
of parallel computers with a large number of fallible components. The study of
fault-tolerant routing schemes focuses on algorithms that can route packets
efficiently even in the presence of faulty switches. The two research directions
represent very important but largely uncharted territory. The first concerns the
question of intrinsic limitations on the fault tolerance of networks. The second
research direction concerns reconfiguring in increasingly important class of
parallel computers known as heterogeneous parallel computers.
