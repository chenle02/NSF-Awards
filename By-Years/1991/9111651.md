The development of efficient packet routing algorithms is a very important task
in the construction of parallel computers. In a parallel architecture, different
computing elements must be able to communicate with each other fast while the
size of the message (packet) queues created during the routing must be bounded,
ideally, to a small constant. Through packet routing, real machines are able to
simulate idealized machines and theoretical models can be tested and tuned. Up
to now, the best existing permutation packet routing algorithm on the mesh
architecture is by Leighton, Makedon and Tollis which routes the packets to
their destination in optimal time and with constant size queues. However,
drastically new methodologies are needed to make these results practical. Two
types of parallel communication algorithms will be considered, online and off-
line on multidimensional meshes and tori. Off-line packet routing is used in
cases where the communication pattern is known in advance, before the execution,
or for computations in which the data dependencies are fixed before run-time.
Universal approximation algorithms for packet routing on meshes and tori will
also be examined for completing the routing in the cases of actual problems. A
universal approach is also needed in the case of off-line routing, that can be
applied to any pattern, such as many to one routing.
