This project at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques is to provide some
annual support in order to cover around 35% of IHES expenses (stipends and
subsistence fees) for the visit of numerous American scientists.. The statistics
continue to show a large proportion of US visitors among Institute's visitors
(an average of 35% of the total number of visitors for the last ten years and
more than nearly three times the number of the next best represented country
which is France).
