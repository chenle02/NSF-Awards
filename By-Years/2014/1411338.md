Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides new
understanding into the interaction energy between two electron spins with
precise control of the distance between them by a homemade microscope capable of
resolving dimensions below a millionth of the width of a human hair. The
quantitative data form the basis for understanding magnetic ordering and provide
numerical results that can be used (instead of parameters) in the analysis of a
broad range of magnetic phenomena. The combined experimental and theoretical
research impacts the next generation of information storage devices and
futuristic technologies based on the electron spin properties of new materials.
This microscope provides images of the spatially dependent interaction between
two spins and allows direct visualization of this interaction. The use of
homemade instrument to make measurements previously not possible to gain new
understanding provides valuable education and training of students. This project
teaches the students how to solve difficult problems and endows them with skills
that allow them to tackle seemingly unrelated and highly challenging problems in
their future careers. A byproduct of this research contributes to the creation
of a highly skilled workforce in a society with increasingly sophisticated
technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
coupling between electron spins is central to the understanding of magnetic
phenomena and forms the basis for a number of important effects in atoms,
molecules, and condensed matter. For atoms and molecules with spin moments
adsorbed on a solid surface and interacting with a nearby spin, the energy of
coupling depends on the exchange interaction and the magnetic anisotropy. The
electron spin-spin coupling can be probed in four dimensions (E,x,y,z) using the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM), at 0.6 K and up to 9 Tesla magnetic field,
by attaching a molecule with an electron spin to the tip and measure the
coupling energy (E) at different locations (x,y,z) over a single magnetic atom
or molecule adsorbed on the surface. The realization of the spin-tip requires
the implementation of a novel synthetic method based on STM manipulation of
single atoms and molecules. This project yields precise data that enable
quantitative analysis by theoretical calculations. This synergy between
experiment and theory leads to the validation of the theoretical framework in
understanding magnetism at a level not previously attainable and further extends
this project to new and unforeseen directions. Still, results of the spatial
dependence of the spin-spin interaction may also deviate from the conventional
expectation and thus require a new framework of thinking.&lt;br/&gt;
