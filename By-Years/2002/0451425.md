Dartmouth College continues a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site
The REU Site has been operational since 1999. The theme of the initially funded
REU Site was Molecular Materials; it has gradually evolved into the broader area
of Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology. Ten undergraduate students will be
recruited nationwide every year for a nine-to-ten-week summer research
experience. Student research projects fall into three broad categories:
synthesis, computation, and characterization; projects will be done under the
mentorship of faculty in the departments of Chemistry, Physics and Engineering.
In addition to participating in individual research projects, REU students will
attend a mini-course in Ethics, and participate in scientific field trips and
recreational activities.

The REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
NSF REU program.
