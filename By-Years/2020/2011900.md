The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Southern University (SU) will enhance undergraduate STEM
education by establishing the SU-Computing and Data Education (SU-CoDE) program
to equip computer science, as well as other STEM majors, with computing and
analytical skills across a range of contexts, disciplines, and problems. The
project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to
strengthen undergraduate education in the area of computer and data
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of SU-CoDE are to: enhance the role
of the computing curriculum to have short- and long-term impacts on non-CS STEM
programs; improve access to computational research experiences for undergraduate
students to educate qualified STEM graduates for the workforce or graduate
school; increase the interest, broaden participation, and thereby improve
recruitment and retention of African American students in STEM fields; improve
students’ transition from K-12 to undergraduate and undergraduate to graduate
school; and enhance collaborations, partnerships, and professional developments
to promote the research capacity of STEM faculty in computing and data science.
A team of faculty from all STEM departments at the institution will be involved
in this project. The project is guided by an external
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
