This program will bring eighteen high school students (grades 10-12) to the
campus of Texas A&amp;M University for career orientation and instruction
relevant to science and engineering, with special emphasis on Chemical
Engineering. Students from small, rural, and predominantly minority high schools
will be targeted. The program duration will be four weeks, beginning June 6,
1988, and the students will reside in dormitories on the Texas A&amp;M campus.
Activities will include work on a research project under the direction of a
Chemical Engineering faculty member, lectures, seminars, discussions, and field
trips. The instruction, discussions, and field trips will emphasize career
orientation, communications skills (both written and oral), and problem solving
methodology (both in class and with microcomputers). Instructors will include
Chemical Engineering faculty and graduate students, staff from the Speech
Communications Department, invited speakers from other areas of the campus and
industry representatives.
