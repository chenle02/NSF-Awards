Major emphasis will be on a study of films of 3He-4He mixtures by means of a
combination of NMR and third-sound techniques to elucidate the interactions
among the 3He atoms and the energetics of the 3He in the confining 4He
environment. Other studies will include third-sound pulses in collision and the
wetting of alkali metal surfaces by helium.
