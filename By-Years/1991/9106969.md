Support is provided for a workshop on the national geomagnetic initiative. The
workshop will address challenges and future directions in geomagnetic studies,
including all aspects of the temporal and spatial variations, from the near
earth environment to the earth'score; consider the needs for an ongoing
mechanism for future interaction and coordination; and develop a plan of action.
