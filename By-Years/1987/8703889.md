Mathematical arguments are being developed for proving lower bounds on the
computation time and on other resources in machine based complexity theory.
Combinatorial methods are being explored for answering a number of fundamental
questions about important methods for both sequential and parallel computers.
Among the mdoels considered are Turing machines, random access machines,
branching programs, and circuits. Lower bound results are important in the
science of computing for at least two major reasons: (1) they allow evaluation
and comparison of various computational models that reflect interesting aspects
of currently existing computers and of potential future computers; and (2) they
allow comparisons of the use of computational resources by currently known
algorithms with theoretically established optimal limits. Thus lower bound
results may indicate where room for improvement lies in both computational
models and in existing algorithms.
