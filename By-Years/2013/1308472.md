This project aims to study properties of Poisson structures on manifolds as well
as of related geometric structures such as Dirac structures, Lie algebroids or
generalized complex structures. The project focus primarily on global aspects,
drawing on ideas and techniques from Foliation Theory, Equivariant Geometry,
Integral Affine Geometry and Symplectic Geometry. These ideas, together with
recent results and techniques in Lie groupoid theory developed in the last 10
years, will lead to new methods to attack some long standing fundamental
problems in Poisson Geometry, such as the existence of regular Poisson
structures, the classification of Poisson manifolds of "compact type", or the
existence of normal forms around leaves that go beyond linearization. The
project also aims at going beyond the current boundaries of Poisson Geometry by
proposing new interactions with the theory of Exterior Differential Systems and
with the theory of Integrable Systems.

Poisson Geometry lies on the intersection of Mathematical Physics and Geometry.
It originates in the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the
semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. The field developed rapidly in the
last 20 years, stimulated by the connections with a large number of areas in
mathematics and mathematical physics, including differential geometry and Lie
theory, quantization, noncommutative geometry, representation theory and quantum
groups, geometric mechanics and integrable systems. This project shares this
flavor of Poisson geometry, aiming not only at a deeper understanding of
geometric properties of Poisson brackets, but also at developing new
applications in other fields of Mathematics.
