ABSTRACT CTS-9527999 The effects of temperature, time history and material
properties on nanoparticle (5 to 50 mn) formation will be investigated. Studies
of particle size and agglomeration processes of certain metal oxides and metals
will be investigated either in a free jet flame, furnace or laser ablation
aerosol generators. The influence of trace gases on primary particle size will
be analyzed. Measurements of coalescence rates compared to theory will provide
the nanophase solid state diffusion coefficient. The work has relevance to
ultrafine particle synthesis, control of residue particles resulted from
incinerators and of contaminants in plasma processing. ***
