Project Impact at Northeastern University and the Eisenhower Regional Alliance
at TERC propose a design project to create a customized technical assistance
plan for higher education disciplinary and education faculty that focuses on
curriculum use along with the professional development models required for
successful implementation. It is anticipated that these activities will result
in more effective provision of services by higher education faculty to teachers
and schools in the MSP projects. It is also anticipated that faculty would
incorporate the use of STEM materials and professional development modules into
their preservice teaching.
