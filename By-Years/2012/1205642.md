In this project the PI will synergistically integrate biological and state of
the art quantitative experiments along with mathematical modeling to investigate
the interfacial dynamics of coupled water entry and exit problems as manifested
in animal systems. This work will focus on biological behaviors that include
both water exit and entry, in particular focusing on locomotion on the water
surface and animal drinking. This offers a unique underlying opportunity: to
learn how nature uses the interaction of these forces and thereby develop the
knowledge that will enable novel bioengineering and bio-inspired systems. The
PI's approach will use mathematics, biology and engineering to investigate the
hydrodynamic principles that underlie and enable specific animal water entry and
exit behaviors, as well as to develop mathematical models for such complex
dynamics. The PI will identify how differences in animal movement patterns, body
size, and surface characteristics relate to differences in performance in fluid
transport (drinking) and fluid force generation (locomotion across or through
interfaces). In the modeling of interfacial dynamics, the PI will develop water
exit models and also modify the current theory to integrate water entry followed
by exit, as suggested by relevant aspects of animal movements. In physical
experiments, the effort will quantify processes of water entry and exit with
various well-controlled parameters. This approach provides a complete framework
that has not been implemented in these systems before. This project will provide
interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students by training
them in fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology as well as in experimental
methods combined with rigorous mathematical modeling.
