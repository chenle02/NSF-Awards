This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the construction of photovoltaic thread for supplying power to distributed
sensor network devices. Semiconductor nanowire coated thread will enable high
conversion efficiency photovoltaic thread to be built at low cost using high
volume manufacturing techniques. High conversion efficiency devices will be
achieved as a result of both the intrinsic high broadband absorption of the
semiconductor nanowire array structure and the efficient collection of the
generated electron-hole pairs in the narrow vertical junction structure of the
device.

This architecture will enable solar power systems to be built that can be used
in distributed security sensor networks by providing unique collector
architectures or be directly integrated into the security sensor packaging while
providing in excess of 1000 Wh/kg. The photovoltaic thread technology enables a
new paradigm in photovoltaic panel construction. Threads may be woven into
fabrics that can readily be used as standalone solar panel sails or be
integrated onto electronics packages as appliques. In larger power generating
applications the omnidirectional collection capability of the thread geometry
can enable the construction of solar panels that automatically track the sun,
eliminating the need and high cost of a tracking system and enabling passive
collection systems to harvest a greater portion of the energy incident upon them
throughout the day.
