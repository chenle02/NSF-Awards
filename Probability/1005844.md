This project deals with several problems and conjectures which lie at the
interface of probability, harmonic analysis and the spectral theory for the
Laplacian, the fractional Laplacian, and its relativistic versions. It aims to
find new sharp inequalities for a class of Fourier multipliers that result from
functional modifications of Levy processes via the Levy-Khintchine formula. It
proposes to give universal bounds for the trace of the semigroup of Brownian
motion, stable and relativistic stable processes and to explore the second order
asymptotics for the spectral counting function for these processes. The unifying
theme in these investigations is the use of the symbols of the underlying Levy
process. Martingale theory, heat kernel estimates and techniques (perhaps even
yet to be discovered) from the theory of the wave equations for fractional
Laplacians, will play a key role in these investigations.

Martingales, which were invented more than a hundred years ago to explain the
theory of "fair" games, play a fundamental role in many branches of mathematics
and their applications in countless areas of the physical, biological and social
sciences. They are intimately related to a second order differential operator
knows as the Laplacian. This operator, named after the mathematical astronomer
Marquis Pierre-Simon De Laplace more than two hundred years ago, gives the
matheamtical foundation for the theory of heat, waves, electricity, magnetism
and fluids. Both martingales and the Laplace operator interact with Brownian
motion which models physical, biological and economic systems, and even with
more general Levy processes which are widely used to model various financial
systems which are subject to more instantaneous changes or jumps. At the root of
the interactions between martingales, the Laplace operator and Brownian motion,
is a deep mathematical theory which makes these applications scientifically
sound. This project deals with several of these core questions and relates them
to several other branches of mathematics including more general partial
differential equations and their applications to the diffusion of heat,
propagation of waves and their connections with random phenomenon.

These projects will involve graduate students. The results will be disseminated
through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the web. A
sincere effort will be made to expose (and involve) students and young Ph.D.'s
from underrepresented groups to this research and to increase their
participation in mathematics.
