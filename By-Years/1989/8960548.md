This research will develop a hybrid technique for the intelligent control of
dexterous robotic manipulators. Tasks initially specified in a high-level task
language will be encoded and refined in a neural-nework form. Phase I will
determine the feasibility of applying this technique to the difficult problem of
learning to position the loaded endpoint of a redundant manipulator subject to
multiple goals and constraints. Rule- based control components will train, then
shift control to, neural network components. Network performance will then be
refined through reinforcement learning and on-line optimization. This technique,
combining design convenience with implementation efficiency, will lay the
foundation for robotic systems able to acquire skills for performing complex
tasks in unstructured environment.
