The IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC), sponsored
by IEEE Computer Society and the Technical Committee on Computer Architecture,
is dedicated to the understanding and characterization of workloads that run on
all types of computing systems ranging from PDAs and embedded systems up through
massively parallel supercomputers. Though computing workloads evolve and change
with advances in micro-architecture, compilers, programming languages, and
networking/communication technologies, real improvements in computing technology
are often based on a solid understanding and analysis of existing commercial and
research workloads. This award provides travel and lodging support for students
to attend the conference and benefit from the keynote, panels, and talks, as
well as interacting with the other attendees. Better understanding of computer
system workloads is a critical component to identifying areas to improve
computer systems. Improving student knowledge and awareness in this area could
result in both better research and better real systems.
