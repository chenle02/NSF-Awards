Proposal No.: 9721370 PI: Winter University: SD School of Mines and Technology
ABSTRACT This REU site has several goals: 1) to provide eight undergraduates of
Chemical Engineering or allied fields, with unique and exciting research
opportunities in the area of molecular level surface modification; 2) to enhance
the students' critical thinking skills and communication skills (including
written, oral, listening, and audio/visual presentations); 3) to increase the
students' interest in graduate studies (with a target of 25% of the participants
pursuing graduate degrees) by igniting that spark of interest through hands on
experiences in a research laboratory working in their field of interest; 4) to
introduce the students to the 'beyond the classroom' experience in a research
setting; and 5) to enhance the students' ability to think independently. The
students will gain hands on experience utilizing state of the art surface
characterization instrumentation and experimental facilities while participating
in meaningful research activities. Equally important, the undergraduate
researchers will enjoy a close mentoring relationship with the faculty mentors.
Through this program students will gain significant research experience and
develop critical thinking skills, communication skills, and instrumentation
skills, and will also be exposed to professional ethics and other activities to
promote life-long learning. At least 50% of the students will be recruited from
Tribal, four-year, and community colleges and universities from the four
surrounding EPSCOR states, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming where
research opportunities have been historically lacking. The recruitment of Native
Americans is a particular focus of this REU Site, building upon opportunities
that have been developed in recent years by the project's Principal
Investigator. In addition other underrepresented minorities, women, and disabled
will be encouraged to participate.
