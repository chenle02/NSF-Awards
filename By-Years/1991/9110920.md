Earlier work on the acoustic microcavitation in the water at low megahertz
frequencies and low duty cycles strongly suggests that the fluid-borne
submicronic particles can be acoustically coaxed to make their presence known.
The exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. The measurements will reveal
fluid/acoustic interactions at nanometer length scales. Experimental facility
will be set up to investigate the phenomenon and look for control strategies
that will make "acoustic coaxing" a viable technique. This will offer a new way
of detecting, studying and understanding submicronic particulate presence even
in ultra- clean liquids. Further, unlike electron microscopy the technique will
need no special sample preparation and unlike laser method the technique will
not be blind in opaque environments. Applications range from the detection of
corrosion debris in the clean water for nuclear power plants to the particulate
control in the nanometer regime for silicon chip industry.
