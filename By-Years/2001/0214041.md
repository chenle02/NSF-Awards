The award supports the acquisition of high-resolution, absolute-dated speleothem
records of the Asian Monsoon. Such records will lead to an understanding of the
mechanisms that control the Asian Monsoon during all portions of glacial-
interglacial cycles over the last 200,000 years. They will also constrain the
relative timing of change in the Monsoon and the climate in other
regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This important new research effort builds upon
previous work by the investigators that demonstrates a link between North
Atlantic climate and the East Asian Monsoon, which originates from the warmest
portion of the tropical oceans (the West Pacific Warm Pool). This research
explores the links between tropical and high northern latitude climate and
abrupt climatic shifts. For example, the end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a
large and rapid change in East Asian Monsoon intensity. The change occurred in
less than 10 years and is synchronous, within an error of approximately 100
years, with a similarly rapid rise in Greenland
temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assembled research team represents a
strong international collaboration among American and Chinese researchers and
institutions. Both the United States and China are partners in the research as
both supply research funds and expertise to help the research succeed.
