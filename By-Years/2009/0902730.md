Satellite measurements taken near Earth's magnetopause have indicated that heavy
ions can dominate the mass density about a third of the time. The processes that
control the transport of energy and mass across the magnetopause are all
significantly affected by the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions also the
process by which low frequency compressional waves are converted to kinetic
Alfv√©n waves.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will examine ionospheric
outflows, plasma sheet refilling and transport during northward and southward
IMF conditions using a combination of observations from CLUSTER, THEMIS,
Geotail, Polar, FAST and DMSP and multi-fluid nonlinear kinetic simulations that
treat physics on the scale of the ion gyroradius. It will examine the effects of
heavy ions on: (1) plasma entry processes due to reconnection, Kelvin-Helmholtz
waves and mode conversion to kinetic Alfven waves and (2) on transport
coefficients due to computed wave fields from these various processes. The
project will utilize a combination of theoretical modeling work and data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support a postdoctoral
researcher and will include research tasks for undergraduate students
participating in the National Undergraduate Fellowship Program in Plasma Physics
and Fusion Energy Sciences and the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships
at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
