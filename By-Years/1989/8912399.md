This is in support of the International Conference on the Physics of Highly
Correlated Electron Systems to be held September 11-15, 1989 in Santa Fe, New
Mexico. The focus of this conference will be on d- and f-electron systems.
Topics of interest include: 1) anomalous f- and d-electron systems, 2)
mechanisms in high Tc and heavy fermion superconductors, 3) magnetic ordering
and correlations, 4) fluctuating valence, 5) crystal field effects and 6) heavy
fermion phenomena. The purpose of the conference is to bring together
researchers working on various aspects of both d- and f-electron metallic
systems and to provide an interactive environment for the exchange of ideas.
