Intellectual Merit: Physical contacts between chromosomes, known as
interchromosomal interactions, are observed in interphase nuclei of diverse
species. In some cases, these interactions allow regulatory elements to act in
trans, modulating the expression of genes encoded on a separate chromosome held
in close proximity. The advent of high-throughput genome-wide analyses of
chromosomal conformations has vastly accelerated the rate at which
interchromosomal interactions can be cataloged; however, the functional
characterization of their genetic consequences has lagged behind. This CAREER
project helps to fill the "function gap" by developing a comprehensive
understanding of how a gene expression enhancer will behave when it encounters
potential gene regulatory promoters on separate but nearby chromosomes. The
experiments center on the creation of transgenic Drosophila carrying various
fluorescent reporters that act as readouts for the impacts of interchromosomal
interactions on gene expression. These experiments will provide a better
understanding of the parameters governing enhancer action in trans, providing
information on how the spatial organization of the nucleus impacts enhancer-
promoter specificity.

Broader Impacts: The education plan of this project is focused on expanding
research opportunities and hands-on experience in genetics and molecular biology
for undergraduate students. Specifically, the project will 1) develop a
research-based lab module for an undergraduate genetics course, 2) offer an
annual workshop for undergraduate students from a local community college, 3)
partner with an existing program that introduces research opportunities to
students from underrepresented groups, and 4) provide opportunities for
independent research for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds.
