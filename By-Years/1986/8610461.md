This research effort seeks to examine the use of biomass for removing toxic
metal ions from industrial waste waters. The toxic-waste-treatment problem is a
significant one and is generally recognized to be a major task for research in
the coming years. The use of biomass for this purpose may prove advantageous
because of the affinity of algal biomass to a wide variety of toxic metal ions.
