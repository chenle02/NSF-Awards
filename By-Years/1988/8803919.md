This research is focused on a variety of problems related to the development of
rotational molding techniques involving reactive liquids and/or thermosets.
Various coating flow phenomena will be examined, primarily through mathematical
analysis in certain limiting conditions, and also with more generally valid
numerical modeling techniques. Film thickness jump phenomena uncovered in a
prior investigation will be further explored, as will stability of such films.
