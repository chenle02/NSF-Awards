This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in computer
programming languages involves Jean-Luc Gaudiot of the University of Southern
California, Isabelle Attali of the French National Institute for Research in
Computer Science and Engineering and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Sophia-
Antipolis, and Denis Caromel of the University of Nice. The award provides
travel support and subsistence to Dr. Gaudiot for his collaboration with the
French researchers. The objective of the research is to investigate formal
description and extension of parallelization techniques and algorithms for
compilation of programs written in a functional language (Sisal) and in a
parallel object oriented language (Eiffel). They will also explore their
effectiveness in designing parallel programming. The project takes advantage of
access to a programming language known as Eiffel which was developed by the
French investigators.
