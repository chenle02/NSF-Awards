This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support three research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at Kansas State University: Numerical Solution of Inverse Scattering
Problems, directed by Alexander Ramm and Qisu Zou; The CAYLEY Program in Group
Theory Research, directed by Andrew Chermak, Alberto Delgado, Ernest Shult, and
David Surowski; and Investigation of Steady-State and Dynamical Bifurcations in
Poorly-Stirred Premixed and Nonpremixed Chemically-Reacting Systems, directed by
Wendell Dan Curtis, Rodney Fox, and Kadosa Halasi.
