The purpose of this project is to establish a research seismic processing
facility on the San Diego Super-computer Center (SDSC) Cray X-MP/48. The system
will be available for remote processing to all geophysical and geological
researchers with access to the SDSC. The PI plan to convert and significantly
enhance the Scripps basic marine seismic processing package by adding the
advanced processing techniques of depth migration and cylinrical wave slant
stack. The wide accessibility of the SDSC facility will afford researchers and
students computing capabilities from remote sites that are presently available
only at the largest commercial geological/geophysical centers. The power of the
supercomputer will also enable advanced, computationally intensive seismic
processes such as migration, statics and slant stacks to be performed orders of
magnitude more rapidly than allowed by specialized seismic computer systems. The
supercomputer speed will facilitate new processing techniques that are not
practical on smaller computers. The PI will hold training courses in the use of
the SDSC seismic processing system.
