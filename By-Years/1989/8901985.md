This project continues and extends current studies of quantum strongly-
interacting collective phenomena associated with (i) the (mainly fractional)
quantum Hall effect (QHE) and (ii) strongly- quantum magnetism (mainly
antiferromagnetism). Surprising theoretical connections between these apparently
physically very different strong-interaction phenomena have emerged, and will be
more fully explored by this project. Novel types of off-diagonal long-range
order will be emphasized, as will the possible application to superconducting
oxides. Goals of the project include: (i) a more fundamental classification of
incompressible fractional QHE states, (ii) the study of fractional QHE states
involving spin-reversal, and (iii) the development of the non- linear field
theory of quantum antiferromagnetism, taking into account order-parameter
topology and qualitative differences between integer and half-integer spin
systmes. Possible novel "chiral" states (i.e., states with broken reflection and
time- reversal symmetry) of 2D quantum spin systems will also be investigated.
