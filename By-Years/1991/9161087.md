High-surface-area doped stannic oxide electrodes are prepared using porous
titanium substrates; the dopants include antimony, bismuth, and arsenic. The
electrodes are tested as anodes for the electrolyses of phenol, aniline, EDTA,
and chlorophenol. Toxic organic compounds are present in the waste streams of
many industries, including textiles, petroleum products, pulp and paper, and
organic chemicals. Present methods are either unable to reduce concentrations to
acceptable levels or produce toxic solid wastes that pose another problem.
Efficient electrochemical destruction may be an attractive option in many cases.
