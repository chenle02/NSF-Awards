This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports
work by Professor Abel Baerga-Ortiz at the University of Puerto Rico to lead an
investigation into how omega-3 fatty acids are made by marine micro-organisms
using a polyketide synthase enzyme complex. The structure and mechanism of the
different enzyme components will be studied separately using enzyme kinetics,
site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography. The goal of the research is
to delineate exactly (i) how these enzymes work and (ii) whether they can be
altered to produce new compounds which resemble the parent fatty acid molecule
in structure and physical properties. In addition, the PI will supervise a
course aimed at Puerto Rican science undergraduates, graduates and faculty
members, but open to science journalists and communicators, to raise awareness
about the history and current status of natural products chemistry in Puerto
Rico and the Caribbean, with an emphasis on its potential to develop new
technologies and new enterprise. This initiative will link well with on-going
outreach efforts by the PI with the Puerto Rico Medicinal Plants Garden and with
workforce re-training efforts with the Puerto Rico Chemists
Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids have tremendous potential
as therapeutics, food additives, lubricants or biofuel components. Detailed
knowledge about how omega-3 fatty acids are made in nature could be used to
expand the chemical diversity of this class of useful compounds.
