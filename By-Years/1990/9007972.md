Professor Robert B. Weisman is supported by a grant from the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of excited gas
phase organic molecules. This research will help to further our understanding of
laser induced photochemical reactions. Weisman will employ nanosecond pulsed
lasers to perform electronic and vibrational spectroscopy on excited states and
photochemical products of organic compunds. In one project, Weissman will
continue his study of the light-induced dissociation and isomerization of
azoalkanes. This work is to be complemented by quantum chemical calculations in
support of the detailed mechanism which Weisman has proposed based on his
experimental findings. In another study Weisman will use transient CARS to
explore the gas phase photodissociation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Additional
experiments based on a recently developed method to measure the collisional loss
of vibrational energy from organic molecules will be used to identify the
factors that cause unexpected variations in vibrational energy transfer as a
function of energy in the colliders. Finally, transient infrared absorption will
be developed as a tool to probe short-lived excited states of gas phase
polyatomics.
