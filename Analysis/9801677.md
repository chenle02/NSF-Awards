Grant Title: Extremal Problems, Orthogonal Polynomials, and Approximation Theory
Principal Investigator: Edward B. Saff Co-Principal Investigator: E. A.
Rakhmanov The project involves the use of potential theory and operator theory
to investigate three main problem areas: (1) discretization of the surface of
the unit sphere in N-dimensions, including asymptotics for minimal energy
arrangements and algorithms for constructing near optimal points; (2) weak and
strong asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials with respect to continuous and
discrete weights; and (3) best rational and meromorphic approximation in
function spaces, including generalizations of the theory of Adamyan, Arov, and
Krein. The main problem to be investigated concerns finding nearly optimal
arrangements of large numbers of points (typically in the hundreds or thousands)
on the surface of a sphere so that these points are uniformly dispersed with
respect to area on the sphere (i.e., the proportion of points lying in an
arbitrary cap is close to the ratio obtained by dividing the area of the cap by
the total area of the sphere). For this purpose the investigators will use
minimum energy criteria which were introduced in a previous NSF grant. By
analyzing the asymptotic behavior (as the number of points grows large), the
investigators aim to devise simple schemes that generate configurations with
near minimal energy. The importance of this problem is underscored in a recent
article by S.Smale, who lists the study of such spherical point schemes as one
of the eighteen main mathematical problem areas for the next century. Indeed
this study has a wide variety of practical applications, among which are the
following: (1) the structural analysis of large, stable, carbon molecules (known
as fullerenes); (2) the determination of optimal sampling points on the Earth's
surface for data gathered by orbiting satellites; and (3) the testing of radar
sensors for aircraft when spherical coverage around the aircraft is essential.
