Continuous-time analog CMOS circuits are being developed to realize infinite-
impulse-response (IIR) adaptive filters that were recently developed. These
structures are all based on notch biquads that have good sensitivity properties
and are easy to adapt while guaranteeing that the filter is stable. Previous
research has concentrated on the theoretical analysis of these structure, where
global convergence was proved and it was shown the structures have very small
biases. he future research will focus on the development of the adaptive filters
for practical applications. These include FM demodulators, frequency- assisted
phase-locked-loops and Costas-loops, carrier and clock- extraction circuits,
efficient channel-banks for spectral analysis and periodic noise cancellation
circuits, to name only a few. In many ways, these new circuits represent a
generalization of the phase-locked-loop to the multi-sinusoidal case. As such,
they will be the first ever analog circuits capable of isolating individual
sinusoids having unknown frequencies from a multisinusoidal input signal, in
real- time.
