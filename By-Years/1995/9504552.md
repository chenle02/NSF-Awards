9504552 Barrall This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad at research centers of
proven excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. Financial support for this award is from the
U.S.-New Zealand Program. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral
research visit by Dr. Geoffrey A. Barrall to go to Palmerston, North, New
Zealand to work with Dr. Paul Callaghan of Massey University. This research will
focus on the development and use of pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to study the translational dynamics of high
molecular weight polymers in flowing and non-flowing systems. The primary goal
of these studies is to test the predictions of present polymer dynamics theories
using new experimental information provided by NMR techniques. This research
will have great applicability to engineering processes used by the American
plastics industries. ***
