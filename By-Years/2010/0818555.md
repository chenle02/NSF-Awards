How does the brain encode experience so that future behaviors are changed?
Altered neural function that long outlasts experience characterizes brain
processes from learning to memory modification to resetting the circadian clock,
which patterns behavioral changes over the day-night cycle. Underlying
mechanisms are not understood. Consensus is emerging that stimulus-induced
remodeling of the actin-based cellular architecture redistributes key
informational proteins bound there. Which proteins mediate this change? The
researcher will use the power of the mammalian circadian clock, where
mechanisms, including plasticity, are evolutionarily ancient and conserved, and
control of the rhythmic homeostatic patterning of daily behaviors is localized
within one brain site, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). They will employ a
cross-disciplinary approach, combining novel analytical chemistry that enables
large-scale analysis and identification of actin-binding proteins in local brain
regions with neurophysiology and behavior. The researcher will manipulate SCN
actin state, comparing effects of natural neural signals on actin-associated
proteins with reagents that directly activate or inhibit actin remodeling. This
broad approach will permit discovery of protein complexity necessary for
circadian neural and behavioral plasticity. Coupled proteomic and functional
analyses will provide new insights on how sensory experience is integrated into
a long-lasting response spanning molecular, cellular, brain and behavioral
levels. Research on this evolutionarily ancient brain system will identify a set
of core plasticity elements that may contribute critical emergent properties to
all forms of brain plasticity. Thus, findings will impact understanding of
fundamental principles of experience-induced brain adaptation. Beyond scientific
inquiry, this study will provide training opportunities at the intersection of
analytical chemistry and neuroscience for students in the laboratory, as well as
outreach to undergraduates, especially minorities under-represented in science.
