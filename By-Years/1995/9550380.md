Even the simplest of programs can be full of elusive errors. The study of
program checkers, self-testing programs and self- correcting programs was
introduced in order to allow one to use a program P to compute a function f
without trusting that P works correctly. Many problems are easy to specify, but
efficient programs which solve them may be vepy complicated. For such problems,
the proposed approaches to program correctness have already show promise. The
goal of this project is to understand how broadly these techniques apply. This
research will develop a core of algorithmic techniques for writing fast and
simple checkers, self-correctors, and self-testers. Previous research on self-
correctors and self-testers obtained theoretical tools and insights which have
been used in recent results in the theory of interactive proof systems. This
research involves the study of the relationships between these areas. Other
topics in the area of computational learning theory and game theory will be
studied. These topics have applications to algorithms in reinforcement learning,
text correction, part-of-speech-tagging, DNA sequencing and handwriting
recognition. Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course entitled
Program Correctness Probabilistic Proof Checking and Interactive Proofs.
