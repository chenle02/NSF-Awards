Popescu 9610205 The principal investigator will pursue research in algebraic
geometry, computational algebra, and computational algebraic geometry. He will
work on problems in the following areas: (1) Calabi-Yau 3-folds, moduli and
equations of abelian surfaces; (2) The Coble-Gale transform and free
resolutions; (3) Vector bundle resolutions; and (4) Small codimensional smooth
projective varieties. The computational aspects involve the design of new
algebraic algorithms and their implementation in some of the currently available
systems: Macaulay, Macaulay2 and Schubert. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
