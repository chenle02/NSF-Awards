ABSTRACT

11 June 2008 Proposal Number: 0824996 Institution: San Jose State University,
MLML PI: S. Lamerdin

The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support items for San Jose
State University, Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) as well as other vessels in
the academic fleet. The request includes modifications to improve the hydraulic
motor on the primary CTD winch, a 500mm Harken block delivered through a group
purchase administered by the University of Delaware, a Fleet 77 ?Broadband? and
Iridium phone through a group purchase administered by WHOI, two (2) replacement
searchlights, and firefighting communications equipment for the R/V POINT SUR.
Moss Landing Marine Labs is also administering a group purchase of firefighting
turn out gear and SCBA?s for the academic fleet. All items will either enhance
safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.

Broader Impacts: The R/V POINT SUR supports both federal and state funded
scientific research along the west coast and exposes graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography. The R/V POINT SUR will support over 80 NSF-
funded days in 2008.
