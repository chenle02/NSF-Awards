Paleoclimate Record from SOuth America: Lake Titicaca A long and continuous
paleoclimate record from tropical South America is needed to answer several
persistent and important questions. This award supports the recovery of such a
record by coring the deep basin of Lake Titicaca on the northern Altiplano of
Peru and Bolivia. Through the preliminary analysis of a series of short, mini-
piston cores, it is demonstrated that the sediments of the lake are suitable for
climatic reconstruction. Also, high- solution seismic reflection profiling has
shown that there are many excellent localities for siting much longer piston
cores and for obtaining even older sediments via offset coring. Previous studies
revealed large-amplitude fluctuations of lake level in the Holocene and
Pleistocene, implying that effective moisture (and probably temperature) has
likewise varied drastically. Siting of a series of long cores will be aided by
medium-resolution, deeper penetration seismic reflection profiling with uniboom
and water gun sound sources. The cores will be subsequently analyzed for
chronology (AMS radiocarbon), sedimentology (X-ray diffraction and optical
petrography), physical properties (porosity, density, magnetic susceptibiity),
geochemistry (stable isotopic analysis and minor-element chemistry of
ostracodes; stable isotopic analysis of organic carbon and cellulose;
determination of organic and inorganic phosphorous, and biogenic silica;
strontium isotopic analysis of ostracodes) and paleobiota (ostracode and diatom
species compositions), This record will allow us to examine in detail the timing
and mechanisms of tropical forcing of high- latitude climate (and vice versa),
as well as the linkage between the climate of the Altiplano and the Amazon basin
