9550652 Hardy The proposed research would improve the research infrastructure in
the atomic, molecular, and optical laboratories at Florida International
University. A ring laser system and a radio frequency spectrum analyzer will be
purchased. The ring laser system will provide a continuous wave, narrow line
width, intense source of photons for use in three experimental programs. Cooling
and trapping of metastable rare gas atoms will be used for a source of slow
atoms for differential and integral scattering cross section measurements at low
relative velocities. Laser radiation will be used for atomic beam deflection in
time-of-flight studies of the dissociative recombination reaction. Beam
deflection will be used for state separation and identification in measurements
of the dissociative recombination reaction of the molecular ions of the rare
gasses. Lasing without inversion and optical transparency will be studied in
rubidium systems. Two graduate and two undergraduate students will participate
in the proposed work. ***
