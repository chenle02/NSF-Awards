Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0926109&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last twenty
years, the international open source community has increasingly provided
thesoftware at the heart of the world?s high-performance computing systems. The
community provideseverything from operating system components to compilers and
advanced math libraries. As an international community, however, there are only
loosely coordinated activities and plans for&lt;br/&gt;development. The new
rapidly changing technologies in multicore, power consumption, GPGPUs, and
memory architectures creates an opportunity for the community to work together
and build an international program to design, build, and deliver the software so
critical the science goals of these&lt;br/&gt;institutions. To help plan how the
international community could build a partnership to provide the next generation
of HPC software to support scientific discovery, a series of workshops are being
planned. Funding under this proposal would provide travel and support for the
first workshop in the series.&lt;br/&gt;Goals for this first meeting
include:&lt;br/&gt;路 Assess the short-term, medium-term and long-term needs of
applications for peta/exascale systems&lt;br/&gt;路 Explore how laboratories,
universities, and vendors can work together on coordinated HPC
software&lt;br/&gt;路 Understand existing R&amp;D plans addressing new
programming models and tools addressing extreme scale, multicore, heterogeneity
and performance&lt;br/&gt;路 Start development of a roadmap for software on
extreme-scale systems
