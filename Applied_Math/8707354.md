This research program is concerned with the mathematical theory of complex
fluid flows in complex geometrical domains. Only numerical solutions are
expected for this type of problems and the main task here is to make the best
use of the super- computing facilities available to obtain as accurate a
solution as we possibly can for a given problem. The research program will
develop a number of supercomputer codes, each appropriate for a different class
of problems. The research results will have applications in the aero- dynamics
of aircraft, atmospheric science and oceanography as well as other fluid
dynamics phenomena. The PI's current research supports from other divisions of
NSF and other funding agencies confirm this expectation.
