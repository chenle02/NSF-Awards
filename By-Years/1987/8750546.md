This project would provide contemporary research equipment to enable the
psychology department at Holy Cross College to upgrade its natural science
education. The Psychology Department has, in its short history, made significant
progress in establishing a strong research component to its curriculum. However,
its equipment has become antiquated and several courses and laboratories lack
adequate scientific and computing equipment necessary to provide modern
training. The department is currently revising its curriculum to require
students to take a minimum number of electives falling within the natural
science category of Psychology. This grant will provide up-to-date equipment for
specific areas of instruction within this category: physiological, sensation and
perception, and cognition and memory. Students will have the opportunity to work
with modern equipment and program computers to design experiments, collect, and
analyze data.
