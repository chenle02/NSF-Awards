Amnesia and other related cognitive problems are often a result of dysfunction
of one of three interconnected memory systems: the temporal lobe, the
diencephalon, and the basal forebrain. The goal of the present research is to
use behavioral and neurochemical assays to examine how the diencephalon
modulates the integrative role of the hippocampus-a key temporal lobe structure
in memory processing. To investigate these issues a rodent model of diencephalic
amnesia, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency, will be used. Pyrithiamine-
induced thiamine deficiency creates lesions within the diencephalon, disrupting
many important memory pathways. The loss of diencephalic structures may down-
regulate the activation of other memory-related structures such as the
hippocampus thereby impairing their contributions to learning and memory
processing. To investigate diencephalic-hippocampal interactions in memory
processing the proposed studies will use in- vivo microdialysis to determine
whether acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, a marker of memory-related
activation, is altered in rats with these lesions when learning spatial tasks.
The goal of this Minority Career Advancement award is to build upon the
recipient's prior research on animal models of memory dysfunction and allow her
to advance her research program by learning techniques (in-vivo microdialysis
and HPLC) to examine functional neurochemical changes associated with learning
and memory. This project will provide new insights into understanding how
several memory-related brain structures interact
