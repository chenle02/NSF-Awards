The calcium phosphate apatites are found in igneous, metamorphic, and
sedimentary rocks. Interest among geologists in these minerals has increased in
recent years, especially as indicators of geologic environment. Recent
investigations by the P.I.'s indicate that many aspects of the crystal
structures of natural apatites are not well understood. The studies proposed are
intended to elucidate the crystal structures of natural apatites. They will
emphasize naturally-occurring apatites, whose chemistry falls within ranges of
interest to geologists, and the resultant data will complement that already
available in the published literature. The proposed research should be important
to geologists who use thermodynamics, partitioning, diffusion and annealing
properties of apatite minerals to gain insight into geologic processes.
