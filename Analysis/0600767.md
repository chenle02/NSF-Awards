ABSTRACT

Recent years have seen a burst of activity in the interface of harmonic analysis
and its related fields (such as partial differential equations, combinatorics,
number theory, and mathematical physics) with beautiful and mutually beneficial
consequences. Long-standing open problems in harmonic analysis have been solved
using combinatorial techniques, while tools from harmonic analysis have helped
in proving exciting results in number-theory and mathematical physics. In this
project, the PI outlines future goals in three areas of harmonic analysis: (a)
Fourier estimates for cones and their applications (section 2), involving a
local smoothing estimate of Wolff (b) analysis of linear and monomial polyhedra,
and their applications to (i) associated maximal operators and (ii) Bergman
kernel estimates for weakly pseudoconvex domains (section 3), and (c) decay
properties of oscillatory integral operators with degenerate phases section 4).

Projects 1, 2 and 3 address a class of problems that may be approached using
Wolff's microlocal estimate for light cones (arising in his proof of the local
smoothing conjecture), and would answer a variety of questions regarding
averaging and Fourier integral operators and partial differential equations.
They necessitate a deeper understanding and extension of the delicate
combinatorial arguments employed in his proof. Results from project 4 would mark
nontrivial progress on a much-studied open question on Bergman kernel estimates,
and would be of significant interest in complex analysis of several variables.
Project 5 addresses a problem of which very little is known at the moment, but
which has deep ties not only to numerous problems in harmonic analysis
(regarding degenerate Fourier integral operators), but also to an extremely rich
and thriving area of algebraic geometry, namely resolution of singularities.
