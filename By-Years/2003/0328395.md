This award provides support for a Workshop on Confidentiality Research, to be
held in Arlington, VA on 12-13 May 2003. Data and data access fuel the social
science engine. The rapid pace of technological change, however, means that new
attention needs to be paid to confidentiality issues in order to both fully
exploit and protect the massive national investment in data infrastructure. The
workshop will include noted researchers from a variety of disciplines, including
cultural anthropology, economics, ethics, management science, sociology, and
statistics. Short-term goals of the workshop include the identification of the
most important research questions and cutting-edge issues in this area. It also
is expected that this workshop will provide useful information to NSF staff that
are involved in planning new activities for the Human and Social Dynamics
priority area for FY 2004 and beyond. Research growing out of the workshop has
the long-term potential of improving the availability and quality of social
science data. The final report of the workshop will be made available to the
broader research community.
