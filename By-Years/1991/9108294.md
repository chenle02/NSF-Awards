This ROW planning grant is concerned with developing a methodology for
investigating the effects of help in plan selection for experienced programmers
learning a new programing language. Programmers learning a new language spend
the largest percentage of their time in planning activities. A model of program
development in a new language shows that this activity causes much iteration in
the developmental process. This model is contrasted with the model of
programmers writing a program in a known language. This work will study object-
oriented and declarative languages during the planning period. After they type
of planning help needed in different types of languages has been determined plan
templates will be constructed. Studies willthen be designed to determine the
effect that these templates have on program development.
