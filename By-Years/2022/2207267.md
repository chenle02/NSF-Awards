We expect that our universe is filled with gravitational waves coming from pairs
of supermassive black holes (with millions to billions of times the mass of the
sun) orbiting each other at the centers of galaxies. These waves are different
from the gravitational waves detected first by LIGO, because they are
continuous, rather than coming in bursts, and they have very low frequencies,
often taking several years to complete a cycle. These low-frequency
gravitational waves are the target of the North American Nanohertz Observatory
for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav). Professor Olum and his group will work to
improve the mathematical and computational procedures used to analyze NANOGrav
observations. This work will help NANOGrav make the first detection of low-
frequency gravitational waves and determine their sources. Professor Olum will
also give public presentations, and lectures in high schools, to bring the
excitement of gravitational wave astronomy to the broader public.

The purpose of this work is to enhance the ability of the NANOGrav collaboration
to detect gravitational waves through new mathematical techniques and improved
codes. These enhancements will increase the significance of NANOGrav data
analysis, possibly pushing it above the level at which the collaboration can
confidently claim a discovery of a stochastic background of gravitational waves.
Faster codes will make it possible to check more carefully for possible "false
alarms" and easier to explore new ideas that may extract important signals from
the pulsar timing observations. These techniques may also contribute to the
detection of the first individual source of low-frequency gravitational waves,
expected to be a nearby supermassive black hole binary whose signal stands out
above the background.
