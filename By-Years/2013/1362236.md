The objective of this award at the Interface of the Biological, Mathematical and
Physical Sciences, and Engineering (BIOMAPS) is the development and optimization
of new mathematical models for cancer treatment. In particular, the first part
of the project involves developing mathematical models of intra-tumor
heterogeneity and radiation induced cellular plasticity. The work will develop
optimized radiation delivery schedules that incorporate therapy induced
plasticity as well as normal tissue toxicity constraints and maintain clinical
feasibility. This will be done using both non-linear programming techniques and
heuristic methods such as simulated annealing. The PI will collaborate with a
radiation biologist to further calibrate and validate mathematical models with
mouse experiments. The second part of the project deals with modeling the impact
of spatial tissue structure on cancer initiation and progression. Using tools
from the field of interacting particle systems (such as duality and refined
results about random walks) simplified models will be developed that allow for
field cancerization to be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
results of this research will lead to improvements in radiation therapy delivery
schedules, and improvements in treatment and surveillance of epithelial cancers.
The primary goal of this work is to develop new mathematical models for the
evolution of cancer, and then to furthermore apply optimization techniques to
these models to learn improved methods of treating the disease. In particular,
radiation fractionation schedules will be developed that are predicted to
improve patient survival, and further surveillance recommendations will be
developed for the treatment of epithelial cancer. These results will have the
potential to improve patient survival and quality of life. This work will also
contribute to the solution of nonlinear optimization problems and the study of
spatial stochastic processes.
