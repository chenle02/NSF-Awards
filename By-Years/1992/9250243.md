This project will incorporate physiological instruments, data acquisition
systems, and simulation modeling software in courses which emphasize whole plant
physiology and environmental biology. Analytical capabilities will be enhanced
at the advanced levels and in introductory courses. Exercises will emphasize
student directed experiments and will focus on complex phenomena where
experiments will be guided by simulation models and theory. Students will
interface data acquisition systems and Macintosh computers with thermocouples,
light sensors, hygrometers, and CO2 analyzers as they explore the mechanistic
controls of photosynthesis and obtain calculated results on line. A plant stress
meter will assist students to understand the photochemical reactions of
photosynthesis and monitor photosynthetic capabilities under a variety of
conditions. These complex but realistic exercises will be interpreted and
presented by teams of students. Ecological studies will be helped by addition of
a plant canopy analyzer, a porometer, a water potential system and a Hydrolab
Surveyor 3. Small group interactions will be fostered.
