A multidisciplinary team from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD),
specializing in the fields of nanophotonics, nanooptics, optoelectronics, and
material science and material processing are collaborating in developing
Integrated Nanoscale Materials, Devices and Systems with special focus on
Nanophotonics for Optical Delay Engineering (NODE). The aim of the project is to
demonstrate chip-scale realization of multistage optical delay architectures
using nanoscale photonic materials and devices in a waveguide configuration,
taking advantage of the polarization degree of freedom. The largest thrust will
be on investigation of resonant phenomena in nanophotonic optical components
placed in proximity to each other and demonstration of their integration into
Nanoscale Devices-and-System Architectures realizing programmable optical delays
which are crucial for numerous applications including optical buffering for
large optical data routing systems, true time delay phased arrays, and general
digital optical signal processing architectures. Research efforts in
methodology, design, fabrication and characterization of nanophotonic materials,
devices and systems will be useful for students and researchers in the fields of
nanophotonics, advancing the fundamental understanding of the near field
resonant and nonresonant interactions between nanoscale devices, and enabling
their effective integration with novel functionalities. We will also establish
innovative education and outreach projects with the UCSD's Preuss School,
designed for students in 6-12 grade coming from disadvantaged
households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
