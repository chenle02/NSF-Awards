CTS-9622108 Elliott This is an award to support the purchase a Nd:YAG pulsed
laser and intensified CCD camera system which will dedicated to research in
mechanical and aerospace engineering. The first project will be to develop a
laser based diagnostic technique termed Filtered Angularly Resolved Rayleigh
Scattering (FARRS). this will be a non-intrusive flow diagnostic technique that
will have the ability to measure instantaneous velocity, density, temperature,
and pressure. The successful development of FARRS will aid in a better
understanding of complex flow phenomena and the development of more accurate
computer simulation schemes.
