This meeting will explore recent developments in the basic physics and
applications of the short-wavelength radiation generated by high-intensity
laser-matter interactions. Topics to be addressed include high-intensity
multiphoton phenomena in atoms and plasmas, new developments in high throughput
and high resolution x-ray optics, and new sources of XUV and X radiations.
