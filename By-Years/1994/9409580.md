9409580 Honavar The primary objectives of the proposed research is a systematic
exploration of a class of constructive learning algorithms for neural networks
for pattern classification that can potentially: 1) Eliminate the need for ad-
hoc, often inappropriate choices of network architecture; 2) Yield close to
minimal networks whose complexity is commensurate with the complexity of the
particular task implicitly specified by the training data; 3) Provide empirical
estimates of expected-case complexity of real- world pattern classification
tasks; 4) Offer natural ways to trade off some performance measures (e.g.,
learning time) against others (e.g., network size); 5) Provide convenient ways
to incorporate domain knowledge (when available) to speed up learning.
