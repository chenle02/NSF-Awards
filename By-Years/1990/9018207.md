With the appearance of depleted springtime ozone abundances over Antarctica
there has been much concern over the impact of enhanced ultraviolet radiation on
the region's ecology. Dr. Gautier proposes to develop a method for mapping
biologically active ultraviolet (UV-B) and photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR) falling on the Antarctic and the surrounding Southern Ocean. Satellite
remote sensing techniques, validated with surface measurements from NSF's UV
monitoring program at specific Antarctic sites, will extend the geographical
mapping of ozone and UV radiation over Antarctica. The project will place
special emphasis on the period of springtime ozone depletion. Atmospheric data
will be collected to develop a thorough understanding of solar radiation
transfer in the Antarctic earth-atmosphere system. Moreover, this information
will be used to modify for high-latitude work the satellite remote sensing
algorithms already developed by Dr. Gautier for surface radiation budget studies
at lower latitudes. The results of this project will be maps of surface UV-B and
PAR irradiance having 50 kilometer resolution which are comparable to maps of
stratospheric ozone abundance using satellite remote sensing.
