The California State University @ San Bernardino will initiate a six-week,
residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in physics, mathematics
and astronomy which will offer science enrichment activities for 39 precollege
students entering grades 11 and 12. This summer program will emphasize research
participation in determining the orbit of an asteroid. Students will be involved
in all aspects of the research project including taking photographic plates,
making astrometric measurements and final orbit computation.
