PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This program provides finical aid and academic support
for talented low-income students majoring in Computer Science, Engineering or
Mathematics. There is a strong recruitment plan for Hispanic students that
attend surrounding high schools and community colleges. The program actively
seeks Hispanic students but does not discriminate against other minority or non-
minority students. The program has developed partnerships between Coral Park
Senior High School (CPSHS) and Miami Dade Community College (MDCC) that helps to
identify candidates in terms of need, well roundedness and scholarship. However,
the program is not limited to these students. Indeed, information of the program
is mailed to all the Miami Dade High Schools and Florida Community Colleges. The
goal of the program is for the entering first year students to graduate with a
Bachelors degree in 4 years and for the community college transfer students to
finish their Bachelors degree in 2 years. A counseling program is in place with
the purpose of providing the scholars with the adequate support mechanisms to
make the above goals successful. As part of the retention effort, tutorial
assistance and an internship program are in place. There also is a group of
specialists to assist the scholars in coping with the everyday problems they
face during their college experience.&lt;br/&gt;
