AST-0324238 Webb Microvariability is defined as extremely rapid (less than an
hour), low amplitude (less than a magnitude) variation, intermittently seen in
radio loud quasars and BL Lac objects. Recent observations are starting to yield
insight into the characteristics of this class of variability. It seems that the
types of active galactic nuclei showing unambiguous microvariability are those
dominated by emission from relativistic jets, and thus the observations should
provide insight into physical processes in the inner regions of jets. The
supported research program expands the lead investigator's efforts in this
field, to make new comprehensive observations of more examples, and to begin a
systematic study of the theoretical implications. The microvariations are
diagnostics for discriminating between theoretical models.

This program incorporates amateur quasar monitoring networks, graduate, and
undergraduate students, which not only benefits this research, but also exposes
all participants to the scientific process by letting them contribute to cutting
edge research. Other professional observatories are also collaborating. In
addition the students will be responsible for the web site, which will be used
to display continually updated results of the research throughout the award
period. ***
