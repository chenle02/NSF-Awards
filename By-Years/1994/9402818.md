9402818 Gao The research proposed in this application is concerned with
developing a self-contained, micro ultrasonic transducer module with on-board
electronics which can be fully integrated into the shaft of a conventional long
cane to assist the visually impaired in perceiving overhanging obstacles that
are not detectable by traditional canes. Upon obstacle detection, a human voice
signal, describing in key words the distance and height of the target, will be
displayed to assist in orientation. The first phase of the research focuses on
the human factor study to specify design rules that adequately serve the need of
the potential users. The second phase will concentrate on the design, modeling
and prototyping of the transducer. Focus will be on the circuit miniaturization
using established IC foundry technologies, and the adaptation of the module to
the cane. The final phase will be the performance evaluation and optimization
which will be conducted in close cooperation with the Louisiana Center for the
Blind in Ruston, Louisiana. ***
