This award provides funds for a PYI award to an outstanding young scientist
interested in the development of non-invasive methods for image analysis of
complex materials including human tissues. Dr. Mcfarland has had a broad
training in nuclear engineering, medical engineering and medicine. In this
proposal, he will focus on the use of NMR for the image analysis, in particular,
the analysis of images that reflect biochemical reaction kinetics. The planned
research will make substantial and important contributions to the field of non-
destructive imaging of biological and non-biological materials.
