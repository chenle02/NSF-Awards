This proposal is to design and implement a science measurement described as part
of research element 1 "Satellite Assessment of Land Use/Land Cover." This
element is part of the Vice-Presidential initative, the GLOBE Program (Global
Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environement), a program that engages
K-12 students around the globe in taking scientific measurements and data that
is authentic research data used by scientists. This project is to use satellite
images to provide information on land cover/land use patterns in communities of
the participating students and teachers. Students are given data consisting of
miltispectural images, and using the distinctive spectral signatures which
classify forests, crops and other covers, they will map the vegetative cover of
their monitoring sites. Studnets will create thematic maps with their sateliite
images and make ground-truthing expeditions to verify the land cover
interpretations initially made in the classroom. Studnets learn to treat these
images as data and experimental protocols are designed by scientists to
incorporate measurements makde by these studients. Supporitng science curriculum
materials are to be designed by a tem of scientist, science educators, and K-12
teachers and students. Development of a model curriculum on the use of satellite
data sets and development of a common base for understanding and implementing
technologies required for use of satellite imagery in GLOBE classrooms are seen
as outcomes of this project.
