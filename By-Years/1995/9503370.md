9503370 Balas The project will examine two approaches to control design for
structures subjected to environmental as well as small- to-moderate dynamic
loads. The first approach is to use "hard-bounds" or norms to describe the
possible models for a structure and its corresponding set of possible prediction
errors with a goal of maximizing the robust performance of the controller for a
given set of possible excitations. In the second approach probability
distributions are placed over the sets of possible models as well as over the
possible excitations. This probable-model approach to control design introduces
an extra dimension to the first approach that will yield additional information
about the possible performance of the controller, such as the probability of
achieving various levels of performance. Experimental data will be used to
update and refine the control design models to improve the close-loop
performance. The use of shape memory alloy actuators also will be investigated.
Improvements in active and passive structural control can save lives and reduce
structural damage and economic losses. ***
