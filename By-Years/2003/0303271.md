REVISED ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will establish the South Bay
Geo-Diversity Project (SBGDP), a multifaceted, multilevel initiative to increase
the participation of underrepresented groups in geoscience education and
research. The primary objectives of the SBGDP are to 1) offer professional
development workshops for middle- and high-school teachers from schools
associated with San Jose State University's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering,
Science Achievement) Program; 2) to provide summer enrichment activities in the
geosciences for underrepresented middle- and high-school students in the MESA
program; 3) to involve selected college students in research projects partner.
Undergraduates will be recruited from San Jose City College and National
Hispanic University as well as from San Jose State University to enhance
regional collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the student-research component,
students will work under the direct supervision of a faculty member of the SJSU
Geology Department on a field-based study of the geology, geomorphology, or
neotectonics of key areas in the southern San Francisco Bay region. Students
will present their findings at Open House events hosted by the U. S. Geological
Survey and at a section meeting of the Geological Society of America. The
project will be evaluated by faculty and students from SJSU's College of
Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
