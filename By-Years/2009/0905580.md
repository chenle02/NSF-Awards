This project focuses on understanding the principles and methods for the design
of green networks at the edge of the Internet. The total power consumption of
edge networks is estimated to be quite significant, so even moderate
improvements in energy-usage in an individual device can result in non-trivial
savings overall. Obtaining these moderate improvements in the energy-efficiency
of edge networks is challenging for two reasons: the diversity of edge networks
and the dynamics in their workload.

Intellectual Merit. Leveraging the researchers' combined expertise in low-power
electronics, link-layer technologies, and energy-efficient network subsystem
design and architecture, the project will: a) devise a deep energy-inspection
architecture that encompasses a broad range of edge devices and networking
technologies, and incorporates innovative hardware designs for subsystem-level
monitoring and control of energy usage; b) explore run-time energy adaptation at
various levels of the network, enabled by this inspection architecture; c)
examine coordination mechanisms for controlling edge network energy usage which
will allow coordinated energy management across components and devices, enabling
more aggressive energy savings.

Broad Impacts. The project can have significant societal benefit, targeted as it
is on sustainable technologies. Moreover, the techniques it develops for energy
efficiency can be broadly applied to other areas of computing: large server
systems, mobile devices, and consumer appliances. Beyond its impact on
technology, the project will also contribute to workforce development by
training EE and CS students in sustainability.
