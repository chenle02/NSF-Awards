Several questions in the mathematical theory of capillarity and related
geometrical problems will be addressed in this project. Much of the work is
motivated by concrete problems encountered in space where gravity is not present
to mask the effects of surface tension as occurs for many phenomena on the
earth's surface. Some of the more immediate applications will be to new
procedures for precise measurement of contact angle (and by inference to the
question of whether contact angle can be regarded as an intrinsic property of
materials in the sense envisaged by Young, Laplace and Gauss). Other important
issues center on the question of when capillary surfaces can exist in
cylindrical tubes of general section in the absence of gravity. There are known
cases where tubes will not hold fluids, but readily accessible geometrical
conditions on the cross sections which will predict this are not known. Work
will be done in describing boundary behavior in the singular cases of
perpendicular and tangential contact angles and on the formulation of general
equilibrium conditions for liquid volumes resting on support surfaces. Liquid
drops can, in principle, achieve a continuum of non-congruent equilibrium
surface configurations. Efforts will be made to find general conditions ensuring
uniqueness and stability for such surfaces. Capillary problems can be used as
barriers in the study of geometrical properties of surfaces of prescribed mean
curvature. This approach has been exploited with considerable success in recent
years. The full potential of the method is far from realized; work will continue
toward this end. //
