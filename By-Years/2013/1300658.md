This project seeks to develop an integrated research and educational
collaboration to examine the fundamental behavior of large arrays of coupled
nonlinear oscillators. Through a combined series of theoretical and experimental
investigations, we will investigate how alterations in the coupling (via
magnetic interactions) can tailor bandgaps, bifurcations, the localization of
energy, and a new phenomena called a passively reconfiguring bandgap. Research
studies build from theory to micro/macro experimental demonstrations with a
focus on tuning the magnetic interactions to create desired phenomena. The
Principle Investigators believe the passively reconfiguring bandgaps, where a
response threshold could be used to completely reconfigure the bandgap
structure, offers a fundamentally new capability for avoiding catastrophic
failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental nature of the research
investigations is expected to improve engineering practice with specific
examples of how to exploit nonlinearity to achieve desirable energy flow
behaviors in oscillator arrays. The avoidance of catastrophic failures from
mechanical or acoustic overloads is a specific application area for this
research. Educational and outreach efforts will leverage the PIs successful
involvement in existing programs, the Pratt Fellows program at Duke University
and the NSF funded Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the
Professoriate (SEAGEP) program at the University of Florida, to attract
underrepresented students to participate in engineering research and pursue
advanced degrees. Summertime graduate student exchanges are planned to broaden
the perspectives of everyone involved and enhance the project collaboration and
impact.
