In this project funded by the Americas Program of the Office of International
Science and Engineering, Alejandro Perez from the Center for Gravitational
Physics and Geometry at Pennsylvania State University will work with Michael
Reisenberger and other members of the Institute of Physics at the University of
the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay to develop the spin-foam approach to non-
perturbative quantum gravity. In this effort the researchers will investigate
models of quantum geometry from a space-time perspective. The specific projects
concentrate on the mathematical issues involving the removal of the regulator
(space-time discretization) generically used to define the spin foam path
integral for gravity as well as on developing consistency tests that provide
means for eliminating the intrinsic ambiguities that exist in the current
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pursues a promising approach to the
quantization of general relativity, which is one of the most important unsolved
problems in physics. Not only will the interactions with the Uruguayan
researchers stimulate international scientific exchange, but they will also
promote the training of students and young researchers at both institutions.
This project has the potential of setting up a long-term partnership between the
two Universities from which both will benefit in terms of research and
training.&lt;br/&gt;
