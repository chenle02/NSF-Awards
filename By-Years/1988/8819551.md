This is a sole source contract to establish a satellite image receiving station
at Palmer Station, Antarctica. The system proposed will be capable of acquiring
the meteorological imagery and geophysical data transmitted by the TIROS-N and
DMSP series satellites. The system proposed will supplement the system installed
at McMurdo Station to complete the coverage for meteorological/imagery of
Antarctica for use in weather and sea-ice forecasting critical to flight and
ship operations. In addition, imagery acquired will be collected and forwarded
to Scripps Institute of Oceanography for archive and later analysis by the
scientific community.
