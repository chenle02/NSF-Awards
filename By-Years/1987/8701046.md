The role of learning in modifying behavior through experience is well known for
the females of many species of bees, wasps, and ants. Recent experimental
investigations of a social species of bee have shown that learning by males is
important in the mating behavior of this species, although the generality of
these findings is unknown because of lack of comparisons with related species.
Mr. Wcislo's doctoral-dissertation research will use behavioral and chemical
assays to investigate (1) whether or not chemicals produced by females attract
males in two other species in the same family of bees, (2) the role of learning
by males in the biology of these species, (3) the details of unusually complex
pre- mating behavior in one of these species, and (4) the chemistry of glandular
secretions, nest-cell linings, and nest entrances of the other species. Results
from this doctoral-dissertation research project will contribute to
understanding the evolution of recognition mechanisms.
