This is a proposal for a two-day conference on state-of-the-art methods for
longitudinal field research on organizational adaptation, change, innovation,
and design. The conference will bring together established scholars and young
investigators to explore alternative methods for research on organizational
processes. The conference will provide a useful and much needed codification and
critique of current field work methods. The conference will be held in
September, 1988. Despite the importance of studies of organizational adaptation,
change, innovation, and design, little effort has been spent in critically
reviewing alternative methods for investigating these processes. This unique and
innovative conference will include presentations and tutorials by leading
researchers on five major methodological approaches. These approaches will be
critiqued and evaluated by a group of expert discussants. It is expected that
the conference proceedings will be published as a special issue of one of the
leading scientific journals on organizational research.
