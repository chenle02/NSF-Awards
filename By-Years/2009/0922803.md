This award provides funds to secure computer equipment with initial setup and
maintenance to support the computational requirements of several NSF supported
projects, including algorithm design and application of high order numerical
methods for convection dominated problems and high order numerical methods for
elasticity, and numerical relativity. The algorithms being investigated include
the finite difference and finite volume WENO schemes, discontinuous Galerkin and
other finite element methods, and spectral methods, especially in adaptive,
multiscale and uncertain environments. A particular emphasis of some of the
proposed work is development and algorithmic adaptation of high-order methods to
graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated architectures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms developed in this project will help to
improve our capability to understand the fundamental physics of many important
problems, and to facilitate the engineering design and production of advanced
materials, aircrafts, semiconductor devices, and energy products.
