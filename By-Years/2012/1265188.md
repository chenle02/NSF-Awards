This engineering education research project seeks to understand how learning
experiences outside of formal learning environments contribute to engineers'
education, and how such experiences can be meaningfully assessed and
credentialed. The proposed study uses a combination of qualitative and
quantitative methods that will investigate informal learning experiences at
three universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance
of this project arises through the potential impact that learning how to
credential such informal activities can have on opening up new avenues for the
education of engineers and the STEM workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's
strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
