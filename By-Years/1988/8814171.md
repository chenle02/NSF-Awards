The 7th Topical Workshop on Proton-Antiproton Collider Physics was held at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory from June 20 through 24, 1988. The previous
workshops in this series were held in Europe. The workshops have been the
primary vehicle for gathering together the physicists working on proton-
antiproton collision at high energy. In the past, the workshops have been
dominated by experiments from Europe. This year the Tevatron at Fermilab will
have completed its first major run. NSF funds would be used to defray costs for
publications, particularly for young physicists who were not obliged to pay a
registration fee.
