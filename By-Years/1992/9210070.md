The focus of this research is on solutions of the Bayesian multiple integration
problem in econometrics, using a class of numerical integration procedures
widely known as Gibbs samplers. The objectives of the project are to make
Bayesian inference as routine and reliable as classical methods in econometrics,
and to provide solutions of outstanding econometric problems on which little
progress has been made heretofore using either Bayesian or classical approaches.
The project involves extensions of the analysis of Gibbs samplers to develop
central limit theorems appropriate to the systematic assessment of numerical
accuracy, evaluate senstivity to initial conditions, and apply these methods ot
underidentified models. The project will also exploit the successive
conditioning fundamental to Gibbs sampling and the related technique of data
augmentation, to develop a modular treatment of most econometric models. These
modules include semi-informative priors in regressions, censored regression,
heteroskedasticity, seemingly unrelated regressions, the multinominal probit
model, reduced rank regression, the latent factor model, multivariatre (moving
average) autoregression, and state space models.
