The transport of molecules across the nuclear membrane is primarily regulated by
members of the importin beta family of proteins. Although the function of these
proteins is well characterized in yeast and mammals, very little is known about
their function in plants. The experiments described in this project are designed
to reveal the function of HASTY, the Arabidopsis orthologue of Exportin5.
Exportin5 has been implicated in the nuclear export of miRNAs and tRNAs in
mammals, and the mutant phenotype of hasty suggests that it may have a similar
function in plants. This hypothesis will be tested by examining the effect of
hasty mutations on the sub-cellular distribution of miRNAs and tRNAs, and by
identifying the molecules with which the HASTY protein physically interacts in
vivo and in vitro. Screens for mutations that suppress the phenotype of hst-3
have been conducted in order to identify genes that are functionally related to
HST. Positional cloning will be used to identify the gene affected by one such
mutation, soh, and its function will be characterized. At present, HASTY is the
only orthologue of Exportin5 in higher organisms for which mutant alleles exist.
These mutations provide a unique opportunity to study the function of this
important protein, and may provide new insights into the biogenesis and function
of miRNAs as well.
