This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. The objectives of this research are the
development of new instrumentation and methodologies with which the peptide
sequences of biopolymers at the picomole level can be determined. By combining
fast atom and ion bombardment techniques for sample ionization with tandem
quadrupole Fourier transform detection of fragment ions, Professor Hunt has,
during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-8319728, developed a prototype mass
spectrometer with which the high resolution characterization of polymeric ions
with masses ranging up to 13,000 Daltons has been demonstrated. The current
project renews those efforts and has as its primary target the optimization of
this new instrument which should enable the sequence analysis of biopolymers of
up to 50,000 Daltons. New concepts in mass spectrometer instrumentation are
expected to ensue from this research project. These advances in instrument and
technique development could provide unprecedented analytical capability for the
characterization of trace quantities of polymeric materials and impact broadly
and positively in biotechnology and materials chemistry.
