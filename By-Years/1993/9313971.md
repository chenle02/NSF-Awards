9313971 Shneiderman This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to
investigate the interactive operation of multiple windows where the sources of
information are located and coordinated invarious windows, with the purpose of
improving performance and reducing the number of errors and user frustration
that might other wise occur in the handling of one window at a time. The
methodology used in the development utilizes metrics, a taxonomy of tasks, and
builds multiple-windows coordination prototypes using hierarchiacal browsers and
advanced widgets. Usability tests are conducted with experienced computer users.
This work should impact the classical and limiting use of independent overlapped
window management strategies which have dominated and remained unchanged for the
last decade.
