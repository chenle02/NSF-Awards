This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Nanotechnology for Manufacturing Flexible Electronics under the
direction of Dr. Howard (Hao) Wang, SUNY at Binghamton, will develop a
systematic undergraduate nanotechnology educational program in the School of
Engineering with a focused theme of flexible electronics manufacturing and
applications. The FlexE-NUE will address the educational needs in the great
Nano/FlexE adventure at the undergraduate level through a series of courses,
design projects, seminars, research and cyberinfrastructure experiences, as well
as domestic and international collaborations.
