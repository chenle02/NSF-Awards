This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program in support of the research of Dr. Kenton Whitmire at Rice University.
The research deals with the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of main
group/transition metal clusters. Work will focus on the heavy main group
elements (thallium, indium, lead, tin, bismuth and antimony) clustered with
Group VIII transition metals (iron, cobalt, ruthenium and osmium). The goals of
the research are to synthesize new metal cluster compounds which will probe the
limitations of current bonding theories, to study the reactivity of these
complexes with a view to establishing stability and structure/function
relationships, and to determine how structure, bonding and reactivity patterns
vary as a function of transition metal and main group element. %%% The
fundamental interactions of main group elements and transition metals is a topic
of considerable importance to chemistry, materials science and catalysis. Main
group/transition metal alloys have interesting electronic and magnetic
properties while main group element compounds are often used as promoters in
commercial catalytic processes.
