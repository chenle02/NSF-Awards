Message Passing Interface (MPI) is de-facto standard for communications software
used by scientific parallel applications community well over last 10 years. The
current standard has a core of routines used for point-to-point and one-sided
data exchange, blocking collective communications routines, remote parallel file
access and dynamic process control. In addition, it provides support for
features such as derived data types, communications contexts, process groups,
and virtual process topologies. However, arrival of multicore- and heterogeneous
chips pose a significant challenge for scientific community as they are porting
and optimizing existing applications on new computational
platforms.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Message Passing Interface Forum addresses the
continuation of activity focused on enhancing the MPI for passing data between
processes in a MIMD computing system, for parallel remote file operations and
for dynamic process control of such parallel application programs. The work of
this forum will produce a communications standard suitable for addressing the
needs of applications on the next generation computing facilities at the Peta-
Scale level and beyond
