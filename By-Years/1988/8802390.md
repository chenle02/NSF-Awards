The overall objective of this research is to develop a task level geometrical
planning theory for representing, reasoning about, and manipulating physical
systems. A specific goal of this work is the generation of assembly strategies
from task - level descriptions. The investigation will concentrate on the
following problems: + Algorithmic techniques for modeling geometric constraints,
and the planning of robot motions using these constraints. + The synthesis of
compliant motion programs using the geometric constraints imposed by the task. +
The explicit modeling of uncertainty and error is sensing, control, and the
shape of the manipulated part. + The development of a precise theory of error
diagnosis and recovery, and a method for generating sensor-based plans with
built-in detection and recovery.
