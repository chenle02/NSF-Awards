This project investigates the relationships between fragile high self-esteem,
self-doubt, and self- and other-focused destructive behavior. Self-esteem has
been a topic of substantial interest to researchers and the public alike because
of high self-esteem's presumed importance for psychological well-being. Recent
evidence, however, suggests that high self-esteem comprises subtypes, and that
one subtype in particular, fragile high self-esteem, may be associated with
undesirable qualities that have important societal implications, such as
aggression in the face of perceived threat. This research includes 5 studies
which use psychophysiological measures to offer new insight into the experience
of people with fragile high-self esteem. The proposed research can advance
existing knowledge in a number of major ways. For example, although multiple
facets of fragile high self-esteem have been linked theoretically, a core
element -- easily activated self-doubt -- has yet to be empirically
demonstrated. In this work, it will be tested as a core element. In addition, a
range of seemingly disparate behaviors that are destructive to the self and
others will also be investigated. The distinct bodies of evidence associated
with the destructive behaviors will be bridged by testing a common link to
easily activated self-doubt among people with fragile high self-esteem

This research seeks to illuminate why people with fragile high self-esteem
engage in destructive behavior and as such it has several potential benefits for
society. First, substantial resources are regularly invested in trying to raise
people's self-esteem. Understanding fragile high self-esteem will help to ensure
that such well-intended efforts do not inadvertently create it. Second, this
research can suggest methods to prevent people from engaging in costly
destructive behavior. The behaviors under investigation include aggression and
ethnic discrimination, both of which contribute to important social problems.
Given these benefits, results of the proposed research should generate broad
interest in both the field of psychology and the general public.
