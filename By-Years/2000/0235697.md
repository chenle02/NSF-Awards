The project will use cutting edge genomic techniques to dissect the genetic
basis of butterfly wing eyespot patterning. These eyespots consist of concentric
rings of different colors, and have important ecological roles in both predator
avoidance and mate choice. Eyespots have long fascinated biologists and laymen
alike. They are a particularly exciting model system as there is great diversity
in these patterns within and between butterfly species and this diversity is
amenable to analysis at different levels, including ecological, physiological,
developmental, and genetical. The type of integrated approach that is possible
with this system is of great value to biological
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will develop genomic tools that will allow us
to explore variation in the wing patterns of Bicyclus anynana butterflies. These
tools will include a library containing genes which are expressed in developing
butterfly wings, and a genetic map made using DNA sequence polymorphisms in many
of those genes. The genetic map will help us localize the genes which contribute
to eyespot variation. These tools will be a valuable asset for the larger
scientific community working on Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths).
Lepidopterans are still an understudied insect group despite their great
positive (e.g., silkworms) and negative (e.g., many agricultural pests) economic
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
