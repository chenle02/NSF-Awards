Accelerators are important instruments for the advancement of scientific
research, for their broad application in medicine and industry, and as a
research area in their own right. Accelerators typically accelerate protons,
antiprotons, electrons and positrons (anti-electrons). Powerful accelerators
have lead to the discoveries of the Higgs Boson and the top quark, intermediate
sized accelerators have been used as sources of x-rays to study properties of
materials, and smaller machines are used to provide cancer therapy or for
electron beam microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent novel trend in
accelerator and beam physics is the development of precise electron beams for
diverse applications in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics, and as the
drivers for Free Electron Lasers or laser-based accelerators. This award to UCLA
aims to develop a new electron source capable of generating electron beams with
an order of magnitude higher brightness than has been previously achievable
using state-of-the-art radiofrequency photoinjectors. By pushing for lower beam
charges, the design choices of a photoinjector cavity can be reevaluated,
incorporating recent advances in cathode surface engineering and adopting
different solutions for the beam dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically,
the development of a novel electron source with extreme beam parameters will
have important impact on compact x-ray free-electron lasers and ultrafast
electron diffraction and microscopy. These technologies have the prospect to
provide real time atomic scale images of matter with the potential for profound
impact in a variety of scientific fields such as condensed matter physics,
chemistry, biology and material sciences. Educationally, the work with be
intrinsically interdisciplinary and will provide full hands-on experience for
students with a broad preparation in photoemission physics, laser and
accelerator technology, and high brightness beam and beam diagnostic
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the program as awarded, the UCLA group
plans to study some of the most pressing unanswered questions in electron-source
physics, such as the growth of the longitudinal emittance and uncorrelated
energy spread and the limit in the cathode thermal emittance.
