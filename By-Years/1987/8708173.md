Partial funding (50%) is requested for the purchase of a new, fully automated
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of California at Santa Barbara. The instrument will replace a 1966
unit which has given good service but has now deteriorated beyond effective
repair. The main use of the instrument will be by faculty and graduate student
research programs in petrology and geochemistry that are in need of this multi-
element chemical analysis capability for characterizing rock and mineral
samples. The matching 50% funding is to be provided by the University.
