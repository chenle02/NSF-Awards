This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
revolutionize vertical transportation for skyscraper-class buildings (150 meters
or taller). The skyscraper-class segment of the total addressable global
elevator market is estimated at $8 billion for installation, driven by two key
trends: urban densification and aging societies. It is expected that the number
of people over 65 will increase by 33% by 2050 and that upwards of 70% of the
worldâ€™s population will live in urban centers by the end of the century. This
demographic shift will create an new demand for space in densely populated urban
areas, skyscraper-class buildings within, and associatd vertical transportation
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to
develop a cable-less, tractive drive system to propel an elevator cab. Equipped
with a tractive drive system, cabs become self-propelled, high-performance
electric vehicles that are not bound to a single shaft, but instead navigate
autonomously throughout multiple shafts. In addition, the absence of cables
allows multiple cabs to travel within the same shaft, enabling greater transport
capacity and shorter wait times to be achieved using fewer shafts. The tractive
drive system propels cabs using frictional forces developed between the tractive
drive wheels and the shaft. The objective of this Phase I project is to
construct a proof-of-concept prototype that will allow for (1) direct
measurement of the frictional behavior of the tractive drive wheel and shaft
material combinations for the expected scale, geometries, and ambient operating
conditions, and (2) verification that the expected mechanical performance (i.e.,
load-bearing capacity, power transmission) is achievable. This demonstrates the
feasibility of such a system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
