The Applied Math and Science Education Repository (AMSER) is a collaborative
NSDL Pathways project designed to help meet the needs of community and technical
colleges, and forge a link between the colleges and the NSDL. Project partners
include the Internet Scout Project, MERLOT, the American Association of
Community Colleges, the City College of San Francisco, projects of NSF's
Advanced Technological Education program, the Tennessee Board of Regents, the
Virginia Community College System, and others. The project provides several
innovative ways to connect students and faculty with the NSDL and with the
applied math and science resources available through AMSER. AMSER consists of an
applied mathematics and science educational resource collection, a customized
portal to aid community college students and educators in locating and accessing
those resources, and a variety of integrated services designed specifically to
enhance the learning experiences of community college students and the teaching
capabilities of instructors at those institutions. Services designed and carried
out by AMSER include a mixture of technology based ones and hands-on training.
The development of these services, and AMSER as a whole, is informed by the
target community with focus groups, an advisory board, and a user advisory
group.
