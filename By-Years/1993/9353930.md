9353930 Alexander This project establishes a coalition between science faculty
at the University of Wisconsin Centers, which are two-year institutions, and
other University of Wisconsin System institutions. An interdisciplinary workshop
on environmental science will be held June 6-10, 1994, at UW-Green Bay, with
academic year follow-up activities. Participants will include science faculty
from the UW Centers and the four-year campuses. The goals are to help
participants learn of advances in their disciplines as they relate to
environmental science, incorporate these advances into their classes, and plan
inter- institutional research. ***
