The theory of Operator Algebras was developed in the 1930s as the mathematical
foundation of quantum mechanics. This theory also provides the natural
mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called
dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; Groups are the algebraic
structures that represent the time in dynamical systems. Today, each of the
theories of Operator Algebras, Groups, and Dynamical Systems are independently
of each other among most important and well-established parts of modern
mathematics and mathematical physics. But the framework of operator algebras
still allows deep interactions between these mathematical concepts. The aim of
this project is to exploit the existing, and develop new bridges between these
different theories. This allows one to utilize the current advanced mathematical
technology of each area to help overcome some open problems in the others.

This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic
group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via
the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson
boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups
were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of
Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity
results for lattices in Lie groups. The former type of boundaries have since
been vastly investigated and used as the main tool in some of the most
substantial results in the past few decades in both ergodic theory of groups and
rigidity theory of von Neumann algebras. However, topological boundaries are
much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar
powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems.
These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also
non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such
as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of
semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of
such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in
operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such
boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective
von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the
project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and
investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the
quantum setting.
