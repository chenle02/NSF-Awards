Proposal DMS-0401261&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lihe Wang (University of
Iowa)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Regularity for Partial Differential
Equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal is directed to the study of regularity theory of
elliptic,&lt;br/&gt;parabolic partial differential equations and the study of
the regularity &lt;br/&gt;properties of their level surfaces. Degenerate
equations arising from &lt;br/&gt;geometry, fluid dynamics and several complex
variables are also proposed.&lt;br/&gt;Equations with stochastic media are
connected with properties of the&lt;br/&gt;obstacle problems. New methods and
new understandings to these problems &lt;br/&gt;are
introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is working on problems from pure
mathematics and on issues from liquid &lt;br/&gt;crystals and from geological
underwater problems. The proposed research will be &lt;br/&gt;important for a
wide interdisciplinary subjects. The PI is actively involved in the
&lt;br/&gt;training and recruiting of post-doctors and graduate students. At the
Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Department of the University of Iowa, there is a student
body about 100 graduate&lt;br/&gt;students from around the country and around
the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
