9317329 Goldberg This award will support the travel of Dr. Fred Goldberg from
the Department of Physics at San Diego State University to conduct cooperative
research, over a two year period, on student learning of physics with Dr.
Richard Gunstone, Director of the Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology
Education at Monash University in Melbourne. The project has three objectives
that address needs established by the physics education community: to develop
instruments and methodologies to explore students' beliefs about the structure
and content of physics knowledge, and about teaching and learning; to develop
tasks that would elicit students' prior ideas; and to develop strategies
suitable for ongoing assessment of student understanding. When met, these
objectives will be utilized to develop a new infrastructure for promoting
meaningful learning of physics in college level introductory courses.
