This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) on Modeling Computational
Science and Engineering is jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE). The PASI is organized by Dr. Jose Castillo from San Diego State
University and it will take place in the Fall of 2009 at the Universidad de
Carabobo, Venezuela. The key objective of the proposed PASI is to foster
research by disseminating advanced computational science and engineering
processes. Topics to be covered will include numerical optimization, exponential
data fitting, parallel computing, scientific visualization, wavelets and partial
differential equations (PDE?s), and engineering computing. The PASI will
introduce students to the realm of current methods of research utilized in the
US and other developed countries. It will also include hands-on computer
laboratories and one-on-one guidance for beginning researchers. A web site will
be created and administered by the Computational Science Research Center (CSRC)
at San Diego State University to disseminate the information to be presented at
this PASI.
