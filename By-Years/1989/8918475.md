Lightning detection developed several years ago gradually emerges as a new
technology in meteorology. By now, there are approximately six years of
lightning data for the eastern U.S., more than two years for the central U.S.,
and approximately four years for the western U.S. Under this award, Mr. Changnon
will combine this archive on lightning and data on crop loss due to hail,
provided by the National Crop Insurance Service, to examine the relation between
lightning activity and hailstorms. Guided by a normalized criterion used in the
crop and property insurance industry, that is, damage of $1 million or more, Mr.
Changnon will also examine how the occurrence of severe storms in the U.S.
varied in the last forty years with prolonged wet and dry periods on the decadal
scale.
