This project is an integrated experimental and analytical research project of
repaired and retrofitted buildings that performed adequately during the
September 19 and 20, 1985 Mexican earthquakes. An investigation of promising new
techniques for the rehabilitation (repair and/or retrofitting) of existing
buildings located in regions with soil conditions similar to those of Mexico
City is conducted. Comparative analyses of these promising techniques along with
development and application of the most promising to the rehabilitation of
specific buildings in Mexico City and in the U.S. are made, and guidelines for
practical repair and retrofitting of existing buildings, for use in engineering
offices and by city officials are developed.
