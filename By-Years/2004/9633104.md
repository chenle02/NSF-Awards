Abstract - Edgar - 9633104 The World Congress of Chemical Engineering, held
every five years, brings together the international chemical engineering
community. It will be held in the United States during the summer of 1996,
possibly the only time in the foreseeable future that the Congress will be held
in the U.S. There will be 112 technical sessions in area including: (1) energy,
safety, environment; (2) future chemical process technologies, products and
materials; (3) agriculture, food, biotechnology and biomedical; (4) technology
management and transfer; and (5) advanced fundamentals. Chemical engineers in
the United States face global challenges that will continue to affect both the
industries in which they work and the world in which they live. By focusing on
innovations and applications of chemical engineering technologies, the World
Congress is expected to advance the profession's knowledge and the nation's
industrial competitiveness.
