This dissertation research will allow a cultural anthropologist to study how
cooperative ideologies and political entrepreneurs function in agro-pastoral
communities in the Andes mountains of Peru. The theory to be addressed deals
with collective action on common property, and the focus of the research is to
see how individual decision making yields cooperative collective outcomes.
Methods include participant observation, agricultural surveys, key informant
interviewing, participant-observation of work groups, and household surveys.
This research is important because simplistic models of the "tragedy of the
commons" have been widely publicized, and have led to an erroneous understanding
of how actual commons are managed by real communities. Studies of the actual
collective management of common property will give models for understanding how
to sustain environmental processes in controlled access common property.
