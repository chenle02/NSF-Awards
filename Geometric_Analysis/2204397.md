The research project falls within the field of spectral asymptotics, which
studies the behavior of high-frequency Laplace eigenfunctions on manifolds
(surfaces and spaces with curvature). The physical analogues of eigenfunctions
are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding
frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the
geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of
fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-
state solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the
corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task
of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the
flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be
expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new
tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness
to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study
particularly valuable.

As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from
microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a
variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions,
and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these
formulas. The PI intends to make advancements towards a conjecture on the
remainder term of the Weyl law for products of manifolds, to develop a general
multilinear theory of Fourier integral operators for use in both spectral
asymptotics and geometric measure theory, and to further explore the connection
between spectral quantities and the presence of corresponding geometric
configurations in the manifold.
