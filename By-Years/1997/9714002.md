This project applies recent methods for large-scale nonlinear convex
optimization, e.g., semidefinite programming (SDP), to VLSI design problems. The
new techniques allow using more accurate models, better but more complex cost
functions, new types of constraints, or simply improve the speed and capacity of
existing tools. The research focus is on various problems of simultaneous delay
optimization, transistor and wire sizing, and placement.
