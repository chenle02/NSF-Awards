The proposed research aims to deepen our understanding of the combinatorics of
infinite sets, to develop new techniques, and to explore new applications of
infinite combinatorics in other fields of mathematics. One component of the
research is foundational: it aims to better understand the relationship between
classification problems (such as the basis problem for the uncountable linear
orders and the metrization problem for compact convex sets) and the value of the
cardinality of the continuum. Currently we have an acceptable understanding of
how to produce models of set theory in which the continuum is the second
uncountable cardinal; the methods for producing models of set theory in which
the continuum has some other value is considerably more limited. Part of the
present proposal aims to develop better techniques for producing models of set
theory in which the continuum is larger than the second uncountable cardinal,
while maintaining the ability to control other combinatorial properties of sets
in the model. Additionally, the proposal aims to further develop techniques in
Ramsey theory needed to solve problems arising in other fields and in particular
arising in the study of the amenability of groups. Specifically the amenability
of Thompson's group F - the subject of a longstanding problem in the field - is
equivalent to a new type of Ramsey-theoretic statement relating to
generalizations of Hindman's theorem to nonassociative operations.

Frequently in mathematics it is necessary to find a guiding heuristic in order
to gain intuition in a setting where our own human experience falls short. Two
examples of this need are provided by the study of the combinatorial properties
of infinite sets and the geometry of high dimensional spaces. In both cases,
guiding intuition is provided by a classical piece of mathematics known as
Ramsey's theorem, concerning colorings of edges in a graph, a mathematical
abstraction relating to networks. The proposal aims to develop new techniques in
Ramsey theory in order to improve our understanding of foundational issues
relating to infinite sets and high dimensional geometric objects.
