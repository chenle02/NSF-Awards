9409358 Li This proposal deals with an important class of adaptive schemes for
state/parameter estimation, known as multiple model (MM) estimation. These
schemes are characterized by using multiple models and are particularly good for
problems involving both structural as well as parametrical changes. Applications
of MM estimation can be found in many areas, such as failure
detection/isolation, maneuvering target tracking, air traffic control, and
adaptive filtering. An intelligent framework of the following three variable
structure schemes will be developed in particular: active model set, model-set
switching, and adaptive grid. Theoretical work on model set selection will also
be carried out, which will provide a solid basis and a useful guideline for
design of practical MM estimators. Moreover, a theoretical framework for the MM
estimation will be established based on graph theory. This will lead to
systematic treatment of model set evolution (adaptation) as well as better
understanding of the existing schemes. The developed schemes will be applied to
practical problems and their performance and computation will be compared with
those of the existing schemes. ***
