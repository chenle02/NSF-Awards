Funds are requested for a Small Grants for Exploratory Research award to study
the fast transient photoinduced conductivity and photoinduced absorption of
materials from the family of high temperature superconducting oxides.
Photoinduced absorption studies in this researcher's laboratory have already
demonstrated carriers on the copper oxide planes are polarons and large
transient decreases in the resistivity of single crystals of yttrium-barium
cuprate have been observed. The proposed research will search for experimental
evidence of the relevence of the polarons to the mechanism of superconductivity.
The level of excitation will be sufficiently high to approach a photoinduced
metallic state and photoinduced superconductivity.
