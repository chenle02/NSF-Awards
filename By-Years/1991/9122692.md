One of the most striking political developments of the past century has been
the expansion of government regulation and the consequent intrusion of "civil"
enforcement agencies into most areas of social and economic life. The past three
decades in particular has witnessed a dramatic growth in the scope of authority
and size of government agencies that focus coercive enforcement activities on
normal citizens, rather than on criminals and criminal activities. While studies
of regulatory enforcement and administrative justice have also expanded rapidly,
there is a considerable gap in our knowledge of civil enforcement and the
behavior of non-policement enforcement agencies. In particular, the critical
question addressed in this project is the extent to which the expanded coercive
activities of enforcement agencies are controlled by democratic political
institutions and principles. This project analyzes the extent to which the
coercive enforcement powers of federal agencies are controlled by elected
officials and democratic principles. The project expands the conceptual
framework to include the democratic principles of efficiency and equality, which
may constrain even controls exerted by elected officials over enforcement
actions against citizens. The research team analyzes the responsiveness of
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enforcement activities to democratic controls.
This will be accomplished through interviews with Financial and Examination
officials in the IRS and political leaders and knowledgeable observers in
Washington, New York and California. The researchers will develop three state-
level data bases consisting of: IRS audit activities by audit class for
1960-1980; total individual and corporate audit activities for 1960-1990; and,
IRS personnel for 1975-1990. They will use multiple indicators to probe the
impact of presidential, congressional, gubernatorial, and state legislative
officials on IRS audits and personnel. They will clarify the concepts, develop
measures, and probe the impact of the democratic principles of efficiency and
equality on IRS audits and personnel. Finally, they will compare enforcement
production functions for effectiveness of audits in improving tax compliance
over time, states, and audit classes. This research will provide an extensive
analysis of IRS enforcement, focusing on the impact of political controls,
democratic principles, organizationl constraints, and enforcement effectiveness
in explaining the variance of enforcement across tates and taxpayer categories
for the last three decades.
