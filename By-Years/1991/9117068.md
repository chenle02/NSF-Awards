Results of research in the past decade clearly suggest an excellent potential
for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technique in heat transfer augmentation of organic
media with low-electrical conductivity. Many of the newly identified
refrigerants have poor heat transfer characteristics, but appear to have a low
enough electrical conductivity to qualify for the EHD enhancement. An
exploratory experimental research effort is proposed to investigate the
effectiveness/applicability of EHD heat transfer augmentation of three
environmentally acceptable (Ozone-safe) refrigerants. The selected refrigerants
are R-22, R-123 and R-134a, which are believed to most likely represent the core
of future non-azeotropic working fluids for residential/commercial air
conditioning and heat pumping systems. The potential of EHD boiling heat
transfer augmentation of these refrigerants will be studied as a function of
electric field parameters (applied voltage and electrode geometry/orientation)
and heat transfer surface characteristics (smooth and enhanced configurations).
Should results of this initial investigation be encouraging, a more
comprehensive future proposal will be submitted whereby systematic study of the
problem both experimentally and analytically can be conducted.
