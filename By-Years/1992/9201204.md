This research focuses on sums of squares formulae type Ä±r,s,n! over the
integers and the reals. In the integer case, the principal investigator will
analyze for r = s the shortest formulae with prescribed z1=x1y1+...+xryr. He
will also investigate the possibility of constructing new formulae by modifying
known formulae of Hurwitz-Radon type. In the real coefficients case, he will try
to validate the Adem conjecture by improving current lower bounds. Related
geometric and topological problems on isoclinic planes in euclidean spaces,
polynomial maps between spheres, and the construction of nonsingular bilinear
maps will also be studied. The research supported involves the theory of
quadratic forms. This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial forms of
degree two. Equivalently, it is an analysis of the types of inner products that
can define the metric geometry of an n-dimensional vector space. The study of
quadratic forms has deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic
k-theory.
