9321930 TOBIN Major disasters focus attention on the need for a better
understanding of the ways that individuals and communities assess threats
beforehand and react to events after catastrophic events. Geographers and other
social scientists have been concerned with a variety of factors that affect
underlying attitudes, reactions, and behaviors associated with living in a
hazardous area and/or experiencing a catastophic event. This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research will provide support for a team of experienced scientists
to explore the psychological impact of the massive flooding in the Midwest
during the summer of 1993 on residents of two different communities, one urban
(Des Moines, Iowa) and the other rural (Hartsburg, Missouri). The researchers
will be able to modify a survey form that has already proven successful in a
similar investigation of elderly residents near the Trinity River in Texas, thus
providing an excellent point of comparison. The questionnaire also includes key
questions that were asked of Des Moines residents before the flooding. The study
will focus on three levels of factors influencing stress: the primary level,
including individual characteristics; the secondary level, focussing on the
degree of homogeneity within the neighborhood; and the tertiary level, mainly
the distinction between urban and rural communities. This project will provide
new insights into the general principles governing human attitudes and behaviors
in hazardous environments. It should prove especially useful to policy efforts
that attempt to institute pre-event mitigation as well as those efforts designed
to help victims cope after disastrous events. The research will clarify the
special roles which might be played by the different types of communities in
shaping the attitudes of residents towards the hazard potential and in
responding to specific disasters. ***
