This project supports a workshop on the multidisciplinary aspects of thermal
problems in tribology. A substantial body of knowledge exists for isothermal
problems in tribology. This is not the case for nonisothermal cases, and there
is a clear need to establish an improved understanding for nonisothermal
tribology. The workshop focuses on and identifies new research needs and
opportunities in the field of thermal problems in tribology. The resulting
report will assist the tribology community in attacking these problems in a
systematic way.
