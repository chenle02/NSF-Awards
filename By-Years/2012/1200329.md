This proposal aims to study the geometry of moduli spaces, such as their
dimensions, irreducible components, birational types, and geometric invariants.
The principal investigator plans to carry out the study in several directions.
Firstly, he would like to study Teichmueller curves, which are rigid geodesics
in the moduli space of curves, and hence can provide crucial information for the
geometry of the moduli space. Secondly, he wants to explore moduli spaces
parameterizing curves in an ambient space, focusing on the comparison between
the moduli space of stable maps, the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves,
Hilbert scheme and Chow variety. Finally, he plans to study the Jacobian variety
of line bundles on a non-reduced curve, which may reveal geometric properties of
smooth curves by deformation and degeneration techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project belongs to the subject of algebraic geometry,
whose main objects are algebraic varieties defined by the solution sets of
polynomial equations. Moduli spaces parameterize varieties of a given type. For
instance, a donut and a car tire are of the same type, because they both have
one hole, but a pretzel with three holes is different. An attractive aspect is
that a moduli space for its objects tends itself to be a variety. Therefore,
studying moduli spaces can help us understand the classification of algebraic
varieties. In addition, moduli spaces have been extensively used in many other
fields. The principal investigator expects that the outcome of this project can
enrich the studies of other subjects, including combinatorics, dynamics,
enumerative geometry and mathematical physics.
