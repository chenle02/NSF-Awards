The objectives of this project are (1) to develope the capability to sample
seawater automatically, with moored in-situ pumping systems, for dissolved and
particulate forms of the natural radionuclides 210Pb, 210Po, and 234Th; (2) to
apply this new capability to obtain a year-long time series of the radionuclide
concentrations during the Shelf-Edge Exchange Processes (SEEP) program over the
outer continental shelf and upper continental slope; and (3) to use the data to
test a time-dependent chemical transport model. This work will advance our
ability to sample the oceanic water column and our understanding of the
transport of reactive chemical species in the marine environment.
