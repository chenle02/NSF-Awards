This investigation is a continuation of research into the mechanisms used by
hydrothermal vent animals to nurture themselves and to avoid the toxic
potentials of the vent habitats. The on-site studies will be executed on cruises
to 13'N on the East Pacific Rise during 1991 and 1992 in cooperation with a
French group from IFREMER. The studies will focus on measuring the rates of
exchange of CO2, O2, sulfide and potential nitrogen sources by the intact
chemoautotrophic symbiotic associations (vestimentiferan tubeworms and mussels)
under different conditions of temperature, pH, O2, sulfide and CO2, to define
the environmental requirements and limitations on these organisms as well as to
investigate the interaction of animal and symbiont metabolism in dealing with
sulfide and its oxidation products. The transport of CO2, O2 and reduced sulfur
compounds within the animals will be examined by means of experiments with
intact animals and with isolated O2 and sulfide binding proteins. Similar
studies will also be carried out on the hydrothermal vent crabs to gain an
understanding of their abilities to live continuously in low O2, high sulfide
environments. Similar studies will additionally be conducted for comparison on
non-vent symbiotic and heterotrophic species as well.
