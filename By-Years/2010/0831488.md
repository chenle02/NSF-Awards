This project concerns traffic analysis--the practice of learning sensitive
&lt;br/&gt;information from communication patterns, rather than their contents.
As&lt;br/&gt;encryption of data becomes more prevalent, a detailed study of
traffic &lt;br/&gt;analysis is necessary to understand the threats to privacy
that patterns&lt;br/&gt;of communication pose, and to design effective
countermeasures. Traffic &lt;br/&gt;analysis is also important for intrusion
detection, to detect attacks and&lt;br/&gt;abnormalities that are embedded in
encrypted traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on two types of
traffic analysis: flow linking, &lt;br/&gt;where packet timings are used to
discover causal relationships between &lt;br/&gt;network streams, and semantic
information extraction, where information &lt;br/&gt;about the flow contents is
leaked through packet sizes and timings. In&lt;br/&gt;both cases, the goal of
the project is to use information, detection, and&lt;br/&gt;queuing theory to
discover the fundamental limits of traffic analysis and&lt;br/&gt;to design
optimal defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
