Abstract 9723721 Butler Observations made in chickens, sheep, swine and cattle
suggest that many paradigms of B cell and antibody repertoire development
established in laboratory mice and humans are not applicable to all species and
in fact may be the exception rather than the rule. The proposed research will
characterize the ontogeny of the antibody producing cells in fetal piglets and
determine how these cell generate the antibody repertoire available to the
newborn piglet at birth through rearrangement and somatic mutation of the genes
which encode them. A detailed analysis of this developmental process in the
fetal piglet model, will provide valuable insights into this mechanism. These
studies will broaden out knowledge of the development of the immune system in
higher vertebrates. %%% In order to respond to many different harmful agents to
which an organism is exposed, primates and rodents recombine genetic components
which code for these different antibody molecules. Other organism have developed
different mechanism to generate a large number of different antibodies, and in
these studies fetal piglets will be used to determine they system which the pig
uses able to make these diverse antibodies. ***
