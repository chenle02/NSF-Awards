The core of this project is to investigate the design and implementation of a
Field-Programmable Mixed analog and digital Array (FPMA) analogous to the
concept of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for implementing various
mixed-signal circuits. An FPMA as an integration of a Field-Programmable Analog
Array (FPAA), FPGA, and Reconfigurable Data Converter (RDC) will be developed.
An FPMA will contain: (1) an FPAA that integrates a general purpose FPAA and
dedicated cells to realize various sampled-data and continuous-time circuits
found in mixed- signal systems, (2) an area-efficient FPGA that combines a data-
path FPGA and a bit-level FPGA to realize data-path circuits, finite state
machines, and random logic, and (3) an RDC that can be configured to realize a
number of high accuracy ADCs and/or DACs with different throughputs and
resolutions for interfacing analog and digital signals.
