9531884 Weiss In this project the PI will participate in the Spring, 1997
hydrographic survey as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment
(ACCE), a U.S. contribution to the International World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). The survey will cover the central/eastern basin of the sub
polar gyre in the North Atlantic between Greenland and the Azores. Specifically,
the PI will provide support to collect and analyze water samples for their
content of oceanic chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tracers F-11, F-12, and F-113 in
order to use them to study water mass formation and circulation. Specific
studies include identification of location and depths of wintertime convection ,
and characterization of the rates and pathways for the communication of surface
water into the deep circulation. The time scales of CFC decay complement those
of Helium-3 and Tritium in providing firmer constraints on these processes in
models of the North Atlantic circulation.
