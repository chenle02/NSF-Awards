This project is focused on the development of a multiscale model to predict the
evolution of soot particles during atmospheric processing. The nature of soot
particles can change after emission through restructuring when they come in
contact with trace gas chemicals and water vapor in the atmosphere. Advances in
modeling the atmospheric processing of soot will help to reduce uncertainties in
the atmospheric lifetime of soot and also will improve the assessment of the
impacts of soot on air quality, human health, and
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will address outstanding questions on
the origin and magnitude of changes to soot aggregates, including: (1) the
stress induced by condensate located in junctions between monomers and monomer
branches, and (2) the forces holding together the individual monomers. A
Discrete Element Method (DEM) model will be developed in which soot
restructuring is driven by stresses from a growing or shrinking layer of
condensate and resisted by necks between monomers. The DEM model will be
parameterized using atomic-level simulations and lab experiments. Experiments
will be conducted using mass-mobility measurements, electron microscopy, and
atomic force microscopy to obtain the required neck parameters (number and size
distribution, strength, and atomic structure). Two major soot aging mechanisms
will be considered: the condensation of trace-gas chemicals to form coatings,
and the subsequent cloud processing of coated soot
particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide interdisciplinary
training for graduate and undergraduate students and young researchers in a rich
interdisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
