This award will provide support to a group from Southeastern Massachusetts
University to pursue their research in elementary particle physics. They are
involved in a diverse program at Brookhaven National Laboratory to study the
basic constituents of matter, quarks and gluons. The experiments are performed
with a large particle detector known as the multiparticle spectrometer for which
the SMU physicists have made important contributions to the apparatus and are
now involved in the data analysis. The newest of these experiments is a major
program in hadron spectroscopy designed to detect multiple gamma final states
for the search and the unambiguous identification of various meson states.
