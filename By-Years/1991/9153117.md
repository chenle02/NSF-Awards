We propose to expand a pilot computer-based facility for undergraduate social
science research. The Laboratory for the Social Sciences, established in 1989,
is built around an innovative, menu-driven "expert" system developed at
Brandeis. The Microcomputer Integrated Data Analysis System(MIDAS) provides
novice undergraduates easy access to a massive social- science data archive. The
enthusiastic response has confirmed the power of MIDAS to capture the research
imagination of liberal arts undergraduates, most of whom have not yet taken
statistics courses. Accordingly, the Sloan Foundation, through its New Liberal
Arts Program has awarded Brandeis a $170,000 curriculum development grant to
support faculty efforts to incorporate research projects based on MIDAS
throughout the undergraduate social-science curriculum. Our small pilot facility
cannot service the rapidly growing demand, thus we are requesting funds to
purchase six additional computer work stations.
