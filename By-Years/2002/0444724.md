Animals use calcium taken from the environment to formed mineralized hard
tissues, like shells, teeth and bones. The mechanisms used to carry out the
formation of teeth and skeletons are not well understood. The central issue
addressed by this research is to use biochemical approaches to learn how cells
can precipitate and crystallize calcium salts, and then form the beautiful and
useful structures necessary for dentition and skeletal support. The proposed
research focuses on the sea urchin embryo, which forms an elaborate internal
skeleton made of calcium carbonate. The cells that make this skeleton, and the
skeleton itself, are accessible and the formation of the skeleton can be
investigated in real time in these transparent embryos. We expect to learn the
precise role of various proteins found in the skeleton, and how they influence
its formation and its properties. This kind of information is very useful in
learning how vertebrate teeth and bones are formed. Furthermore, the way in
which proteins influence the material properties (like flexibility and hardness)
of the skeleton have implications for synthesis of prosthetics and other useful
materials.
