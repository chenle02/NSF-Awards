This project of St. Olaf College is a two-year program to improve classroom
teaching of geometry in secondary schools by empowering teachers to integrate
modern computing technology into their instruction. The program will develop a
cadre of master geometry teachers called the Teacher Action Group (TAG), from
schools within sixty miles of St. Olaf. During the first year, the TAG members
will attend workshops to enhance their subject matter, pedagogy, computer, and
leadership skills. During the second year, the TAG members and the project staff
will offer similar workshops to increase the size of the group prepared for
implementation and outreach. Teachers in the larger group will come from schools
located within 200 miles of St. Olaf. In all, one hundred teachers will
participate in the project. The Mathematics Department at St. Olaf College
enjoys an excellent national reputation and position of leadership in the
general mathematics education community. St. Olaf College and the participating
districts are contributing an amount equal to 37% of the National Science
Foundation request.
