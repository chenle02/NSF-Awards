This Presidential Young Investigator Award provides general research funds for
Dr. Last's studies of mechanisms of gene regulation in plants and how plants
regulate amino acid biosynthesis in response to environmental and developmental
cues. His model system for these studies is the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway
in Arabidopsis thaliana. He also hopes to use some of his own discoveries to
develop improved methods for the genetic manipulation of this organism.
