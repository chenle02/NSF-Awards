The workstations in an undergraduate power systems laboratory will be upgraded
so that the controller/data logging computers are compatible with available
computing hardware and software. The workstations will be included in the
college and university computer network. An instrumentation package is included
that will capture data at a sufficient rate to calculate average and room
currents and voltages, average power, reactive volt amperes, shaft sped and
torque angles of power system components being operated at 60 Hz, with
reasonable harmonic content. The calculated data from the instrumentation
package can be used in feedback control. The calculated data can be logged at
0.05 seconds/data point and can be displayed on the controller monitor. The
capacity of the laboratory is increased from 12 to 18 students at a time.
