This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of California where a previous REU site was funded
for 1996-1998. Robert Bau is the site's Program Director. Thirteen faculty will
serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students
will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Minority students will be
recruited through existing contacts with institutions in the LA area that have
significant populations of underrepresented groups and with the help of the
institution's McNair Scholars Program. The available research will include
imaging and manipulations with STMs and AFMs, optical imaging of reaction
products, femtochemsitry experiments, X-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, and
theoretical simulations. Students will participate in informal evening tutorials
and seminars. Visits are planned to several large R&amp;D labs in the LA area.
All students will prepare a final written paper and a poster presentation on
their research. Evaluation forms are to be completed by all students. In the
future, the career choices of the students will be monitored.
