Technical abstract: Research will be conducted in the area of magnetic
nanostructures, including ultrathin films, multilayers and granular structures.
The effect of non-magnetic or polarized overlayers and doped interfaces on
magnetic anisotropy, domain structure and magneto-transport properties of
ultrathin films fabricated by sputtering and molecular beam epitaxi will be
investigated. Further, the use of granular films for electrical injection, spin-
dependent scattering and modification of the thin-film domain structure will be
explored. Non-technical abstract: Research will be conducted to investigate the
magnetic and electrical properties of materials comprised of nanometer- thick
films and nanometer-size particles. Films and layered structures will be
fabricated by ultra-high vacuum vapor deposition and evaporation. The role of
the interfaces in determining the magnetic reversal and electron transport
characteristics of the films will be explored. Potential applications of this
research include magnetic recording, novel memory devices and magnetic field
sensors.
