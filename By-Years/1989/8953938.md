Calculus students are benefiting from this joint effort involving universities,
two- and four-year colleges, high schools, and high technology industry to
develop and implement a new calculus curriculum which makes integral use of
symbolic/graphical calculators. Text materials appropriate for the equivalent of
three semesters of calculus are being produced; these materials are being class
tested in a variety of instructional settings; workshops are being planned to
provide continuing instructional support for teachers using the curriculum
materials and symbolic/graphical calculator.
