This project is to install a high quality heading, attitude and positioning
system on the Healy, namely the POS/MV-320 manufactured by Applanix (now part of
Trimble). The system will be integrated into the vessels existing data systems
while preserving flexibility to allow the system to support future data systems,
implement interfaces and add a real-time data display system for monitoring and
controlling the attitude and heading system.

The intention is to be able to do the installation at the end of the maintenance
period in late spring, prior to sea trials for the '04. The POS/MV and
navigation system will be evaluated during the post maintenance sea-trials and
on the transit prior to the funded science cruises.
