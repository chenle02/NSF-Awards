This award will enable Prof. Walton W. Dickhoff of the University of Washington
to collaborate with Prof. Hiroshi Kawauchi of Kitasato University, Iwate
Prefecture, Japan, over a period of two years. They will investigate the
biochemical purity, biological activities, and immunological characteristics of
preparations of salmon gonado- tropic hormones, thyroid stimulating hormones,
growth hormones, and prolactin. In addition, they will attempt to isolate and
determine the amino acid sequence of one particular subunit of the thyroid
stimulating hormone, and develop criteria for control of quality and uniformity
of fish hormone specimens. The overall purpose of this research is to facilitate
the eventual establishment of centers for the distribution of well-characterized
fish hormones to qualified researchers in the U.S. and Japan. These centers, by
providing researchers access to standard hormone prepara- tions, would
facilitate research on fish physiology and aquaculture in both countries. The
work brings together the respective strengths of the U.S. laboratory in the area
of fish physiology, and of the Japanese laboratory in the area of biochemistry.
