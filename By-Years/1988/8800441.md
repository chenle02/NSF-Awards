This project is concerned with a class of commodities- information commodities-
projected into prominence by information technology. The specific aims of the
project are to: (1) Identify and describe information commodities currently in
use or under development in several different industries; (2) Develop a taxonomy
of information commodities that can be used in studying the evolving information
marketplace; (3) Characterize - by means of graph theoretic representations -
changes in production and marketing practices induced by information commodities
in business organizations. The project is intended as a contribution to our
understanding of the growing importance of information commodities in the
economy. A sound taxonomy is indispensable for making reliable estimates of
information-related employment and revenues. Systematic knowledge of the
organizational impacts of information commodities will become a vital component
of strategic planning by businesses. Such knowledge will become equally
important for precise targeting of economic and social policy initiatives by
government agencies.
