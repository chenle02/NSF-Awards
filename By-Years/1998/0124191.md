This research examines the relationship between fiscal decentralization and
economic policy reforms among a small sample of countries in Africa. The first
objective is to conduct a spectral analysis of the decentralization process in
four countries on the basis of selected indicators of fiscal decentralization.
This allows a ranking of each country's reform process on a spectral continuum
between the two extremes of absolute centralization and absolute
decentralization. The second objective is to conduct an empirical test of the
relationship between decentralization and central government fiscal position,
using a non-parametric approach to analyze correlations between and among the
decentralization and macroeconomic indicators. The hypothesis to be tested is
that if fiscal decentralization is enacted in the context of a strong,
transparent, and credible institutional and political framework, fiscal
decentralization need not undermine reforms at the national level. The results
of this research will enable the development of a larger research proposal that
considers data and empirical models that capture the effects of decentralization
on the fiscal position of central government for a larger sample of countries in
Africa
