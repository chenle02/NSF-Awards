9415578 Ipsen This project will support a Workshop on Krylov Subspace Methods
and Applications to be sponsored by North Carolina State University in Raleigh,
North Carolina on March 17 and 18, 1995. Krylov space methods are used for the
iterative solution of large systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems
that arise in scientific and engineering applications. In addition to work on
algorithm design and analysis by numerical analysts, engineers and scientists
study the properties and suitability of these methods in the context of special
applications. The purpose of this workshop is to bring theory and applications
together. Four teams of speakers will discuss in detail their collaborative work
on the application of state-of-the-art ideas from numerical analysis to the
solution of real world problems. A team consists of a numerical analyst and an
expert in an applications area. The tentative list of applications includes
problems in geophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, and fluid mechanics.
