This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the
University of California-Los Angeles. The project is to maintain and develop a
data-base of demographic information about a small group of foragers known as
the Hadza, in Tanzania. The PI and other collaborators have conducted research
among this group for the past 10 years. The questions to be asked concern the
nature of the local women's reproductive histories to test hypotheses relating
men's reputations and their wife's fertility, the relation of a woman's size and
reproductive history, and the nature of the desired offspring set size and
gender composition. In addition a linguist will study the Hadza language with
the goal of recording its distinctive features, analyzing its relations with
other regional languages (none have been recognized so far), and recording
indigenous folk-lore. This research is important because the group to be studied
represents one of the few and fast vanishing hunter-gatherer societies still
existing in the world. The data on the reproductive behavior and language of
these people represent a valuable data-base to be used for comparative studies
of human language, reproduction and family planning.
