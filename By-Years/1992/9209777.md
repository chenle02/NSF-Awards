This Research Planning Grant will be used to extend previous work on the use of
social science reasoning in decision making processes in regulatory agencies by
adding data for the EEOC and the EPA to an existing data base. The planning
activities include developing a computerized data base, the development of a
sampling frame, and the development of a coding scheme for documentary and in-
depth interview data. The research proposal resulting from these planning
activites will outline a study of the ways in which social science expertices is
incorporated into some areas of regulatory law. This study in turn will
contribute to our understanding of the ways in which regulatory agencies make
decisions.
