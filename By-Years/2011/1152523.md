This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop of
a cloud-based, Internet service that facilitates a free and global exchange of
user-generated music (UGM). A recent technological convergence of hardware,
software, and the Internet has greatly reduced capital requirements for music
production and distribution. The use of inexpensive production tools for music
creation has reached a critical point and an opportunity now exists to
facilitate a global, open, and free musical exchange directly between producer
and consumer. Cloud computing offers the ability to facilitate this exchange in
a highly scalable, capable, and cost efficient manner. Cloud computing also
enables a cloud-based music consumption methodology which eliminates the
consumer burdens of file management and backup while increasing accessibility.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is
the greater technological understanding of the robustness and cost efficiencies
of media-driven, cloud computing application deployments, and a potentially
extreme disruption of current music markets and music consumption methods. Music
is deeply rooted in human nature and throughout our life experience. Over the
past century, the economic activity surrounding recorded music was concentrated
in a small number of companies. This Phase II project supports an innovation
that spreads this economic activity more equitably and provides the consumer
music with cloud convenience, the producer direct access to consumers,
affiliates with expanded markets, and society with democratized music.
