The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is organizing a meeting for
Principal Investigators (PIs) and co-Principal Investigators of currently funded
DUE projects in the mathematical sciences in Washington, DC in March, 2002. The
meeting brings together PIs of projects funded by the Course, Curriculum, and
Laboratory Improvement Program (CCLI), the Advanced Technological Education
Program (ATE), and selected PIs of past Course and Curriculum Development
Program (CCD) projects in the mathematical sciences. Meeting themes center on
the role of the mathematical sciences in undergraduate general education with
emphases on the ATE program, teacher preparation, and electronic publication,
notably through the MAA Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (MathDL). An
important activity of the meeting is consideration of the dissemination of
(digital) learning materials in new forms and through new vehicles.
