Biochemical instrumentation will be acquired for use in research projects in a
broad range of basic biological disciplines, including developmental biology,
microbiology, protein chemistry, cell biology, biochemistry, cell physiology,
molecular biology, and biotechnology. The equipment, which includes
microchemical instrumentation for DNA, RNA, and protein chemistry, and
ultracentrifuges and related equipment for basic biochemical manipulations, will
be part of a shared facility. Access to modern equipment is critical for
progress in contemporary biology and in biotechnology-related research.
