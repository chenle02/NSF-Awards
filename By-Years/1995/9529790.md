The region beneath mid-ocean ridges where the mantle melts will never be
sampled directly, so understanding melting in the mantle depends on laboratory
experiments at the temperatures and pressures where melting occurs. These
experiments, coupled with thermodynamics of mantle minerals, have allowed us to
predict the amount of melting, the temperature of melting, and the depth range
of melting beneath ocean ridges. The present predictions, however, do not agree
with new melting experiments using techniques that produce less than 5% melting.
Thus, it appears that a few key experiments and refinements of the thermodynamic
models are needed. The proposed work is to conduct the experiments and
incorporate new thermodynamic data into existing predictive models.
