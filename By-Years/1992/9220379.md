This award will support research aimed at improving the level of accuracy
attainable in the quantitative analysis of elements via the electron microprobe.
The electron microprobe is a very widely used instrument capable of chemically
analyzing for major, minor and trace elements in solid samples with a spatial
resolution of one micrometer on polished sample surfaces. The analytical method
for determining the concentration of elements depends on the generation of
characteristic X-radiation from atoms near the surface due to collisions with a
finely focused beam of electrons. The complicated interactions of electrons and
photons that determine the intensity of the emerging X-radiation are the key to
correcting raw intensity data into accurate quantitative analyses. The staff of
the electron microprobe laboratory in the Department of Geological and Planetary
Sciences at Caltech, under the direction of the Principal Investigator, have
extensive experience the electron microprobe technique and its application to
the quantitative analysis of geological samples. This project will produce
improvements in the procedures for quantitative analysis that will be
disseminated throughout the interested scientific research
