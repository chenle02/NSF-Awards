Janet E Macdonald from Vanderbilt University is supported by the Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the
Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials (SusChEM) initiative to pursue
research into the preparation of new photocatalysts based on nanoparticles of
the family of copper sulfides. The research aims to develop shape and size
controlled syntheses to new and underexplored phases of the copper sulfides, and
to gain a fundamental understanding of their crystallographic structures and
photoluminescence phenomena. Syntheses of hybrid metal-semiconductor
nanoparticles of the copper sulfides will also be developed and studied for
their photoinduced charge separation and application towards photocatalytic
water splitting to give H2 gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These syntheses and new
nanoparticles will facilitate the study of advanced photocatalyst design, and
the building of stable, active, non-toxic, viable photocatalysts for green fuel
generation from solar energy. The educational goals of this CAREER award is in
part to integrate the research into outreach programs to Tennessee middle and
high school students through the Vanderbilt Summer Academy and the Vanderbilt
Students Volunteer for Science, thereby encouraging economically disadvantaged
and underrepresented groups into careers in the physical and material sciences.
