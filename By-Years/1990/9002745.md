In this proposal the principal investigator plans to continue his studies of
the formation and propagation of shock waves in stiff polymeric materials and to
develop a mathematical theory of finite deformations of membranes. The latter
theory is useful in providing better estimates of the errors incurred when
employing stress analysis to wrinkled membranes. The principal investigator will
also study the mathematical properties of certain idealized materials that have
applications to the twinning of crystals and the behavior of shape-memory
alloys. Materials scientists very often study the properties of materials by
testing their responses to applied stresses; one could call this the
experimental approach. Mathematicians interested in the behavior of materials
usually take a different approach which involves the theoretical analysis of
mathematical models of materials. In this proposal the principal investigator
will use advanced mathematics to try to understand twinning in crystals, necking
in polymers and the behavior of shape-memory alloys.
