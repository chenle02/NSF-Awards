In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Secrest will develop and apply new theoretical methods to
describe how molecules change the way in which they rotate and vibrate upon
collidng with each other. The PI will develop highly accurate representations
for the rotational channels which are present in a collision involving molecules
other than isotopes of hydrogen, by improving the coupled states and infinite
order sudden approximations. He will also investigate new approaches for finding
the proper mode structure for representing the vibrational degrees of freedom.
