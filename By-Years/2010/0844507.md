Progress in the field of machine translation (MT) has come to depend heavily on
open-source toolkits, which make it easier for new research groups to tackle the
problem at lower cost, broadening participation. Unfortunately, toolkits have
not kept up with modern computing infrastructure (e.g., the MapReduce framework)
required for modern "big data" approaches to MT, the "primitives" in most
toolkits are hardly extensible to new models since they focus on pipeline
components rather than algorithmic concepts, and experiment management has been
all but ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing the Integrated
Cluster Computing Architecture (INCA) for translation to overcome these
challenges, by implementing an extensible, open-source toolkit that can leverage
MapReduce clusters and flexibly implement many types of MT systems. MT is not a
perfect fit for MapReduce (it has massive memory footprints and requires
iterative algorithms); new algorithms are being developed to take advantage of
the framework without being limited by it. Experiment management, evaluation,
and advice about "best practices" are also part of the toolkit, to make it as
widely accessible as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to
have broad impact in MT research through the open-source toolkit to be made
available to the research community. A course project suitable for
undergraduates will be developed and shared openly using the toolkit. Technical
solutions to problems in large-scale, parallelized MT will be applicable in
areas of data-intensive natural language processing and machine learning, and
elements of the toolkit are expected to be useful in such research efforts as
well.
