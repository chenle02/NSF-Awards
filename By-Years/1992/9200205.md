The purpose of this study is to 1) provide a large scale organizational test of
an extended version of the Davis, et al Techonology Acceptance Model (TAM)
(Davis, F., Bagozzi, Warshow,P., "User Accepatace of Computer Technology: A
Comparison of Two Theoretical Models.: Management Science, vol. 35,no.9(Aug.
1989, pp.982-1003) and 2) to determine the extent to which the deployment and
use of personal computer workstations leads to improved individual and
organizational productivity. The research involves a study of the antecedents
use of a stock broker's woukstation system and the subsequent impacts on
individual and branch office porductivity as related to the workstation's use or
non-use. The research model is drawn and extended from a model porposed by
Davis, et al (1989). The research design includes a longitudinal study with
groups of offices implementing the new system compared against control groups
with the system. The controlled research design helps to determine the impact of
the new technology on individual and group productivity using economic outcome
variables.
