A dynamical system, at its most general, is any set of circumstances or physical
object?e.g., the economy, a viral epidemic, or a solar system?that evolves from
one moment to the next according to definite mathematical rules. It is often
important but quite difficult to use such moment-to-moment rules to predict the
state of the system in the relatively distant future. Will a change in
regulation lead to a speculative bubble? Will present interventions suffice to
stop an outbreak? Will the solar system fly apart? In a broad mathematical
sense, all of these questions reduce to understanding whether some aspect of the
dynamical system in question is 'stable' or 'unstable'. That is, does it vary
slowly and predictably as the system evolves, or is it prone to change rapidly
and chaotically with a small variation in the system. The research in this
project aims at better understanding the mathematics of dynamical systems, and
in particular at determining and describing those parts of a system which are
most unstable. Funding for this project will, among other things, support the
principal investigator's graduate student as well as several undergraduates who
are helping to run math circles for local K-12 students. It's broader impact
will be further felt through the principal investigator's involvement with the
Riverbend Math Center, which is a local independent non-profit organization
dedicated to promoting math education at all levels.

This project concerns problems in the intersection between analysis, complex
algebraic geometry and dynamical systems. The problems stem from a very general
program for constructing and analyzing measures of maximal entropy for rational
self-maps of projective space. The work will prominently feature the particular
case of rational maps preserving a meromorphic two form. Specific issues to be
investigated include `algebraic stability' for degree growth of maps, the
manufacture and intersection of dynamically natural closed currents to produce
invariant measures, and combinatorial `train track' models for the dynamics of
real automorphism on rational surfaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
