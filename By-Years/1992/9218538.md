The objective of this project is to obtain quantitative cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) data at Palmer Station, Antarctica, using a CCN spectrometer of the
principal investigator's own design. The project is integrated with a study of
tropospheric sulfur chemistry in order to examine the climatic negative feedback
mechanism involving atmospheric CCN and the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS)
from oceanic phytoplankton. DMS is oxidized and converted to CCN in the
atmosphere, with the increased concentration of CCN leading to more extensive
marine stratus clouds. The increased cloud cover, because it reflects a greater
proportion of the incoming solar radiation, is hypothesized to produce large-
scale atmospheric cooling. The net cooling and the reduced solar radiation at
the surface reduce the oceanic phytoplankton population and the rate of DMS
emission. The remote location of Palmer Station, and the establishment of the
two-year study of atmospheric sulfur chemistry offers a unique opportunity to
study quantitative relationships, not only between CCN and DMS, but also with
other transient and stable sulfur compounds such as non-sea salt sulfates,
methane sulfonate, and sulfuric acid, as well as dry aerosols and sea salt
particles.
