As part of an ongoing GLOBEC-funded interdisciplinary modeling effort for the
Coastal Gulf of Alaska, this study includes the following technical objectives:
higher spatial resolution and nested grid capabilities for regional circulation
modeling, nested mesoscale atmospheric modeling and regional wind and buoyancy
forcing, and a deep-ocean NPZ model to provide boundary conditions for an
existing coastal NPZ model. Present single-year simulations of these models will
be expanded to continuous multi-decadal integrations, designed to provide
circulation and prey fields to an individual-based model of juvenile salmon.
Together, these coupled models will be used to explore the mechanisms by which
interannual/interdecadal variability of physical fields affect the production of
GLOBEC target zooplankton species and the feeding of juvenile salmon in the
CGOA. The ecosystem dynamics of these models will be compared with those
developed under GLOBEC for the California Current System. Central scientific
issues include: 1) The "optimal stability window" hypothesis where Gargett has
suggested that variations in the Aleutian Low affect salmon through their impact
on water column stability in the CGOA and CCS systems. Typically, high nutrient
but low light conditions are observed in the subarctic gyre adjacent to the
CGOA, in contrast to low nutrient but high light conditions in the subtropical
gyre adjacent to the CCS. And 2) The source of nutrients of the CGOA, i.e., the
Coastal Gulf Alaska is a downwelling system for nearly all of the year. The
adverse pressure gradient so produced should work against the supply of deep
nutrients to the shelf, whether that shelf is smooth and straight or (as is the
case in the CGOA) punctuated by submarine canyons. These comparison will help
elucidate the observed (inverse) covariance of salmon in the two systems on
decadal time scales.
