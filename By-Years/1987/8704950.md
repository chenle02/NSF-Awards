This Equipment Award will be used to upgrade the Corrsin Wind Tunnel at the
Department of Civil Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. With these funds a
data acquisition system, a filter/amplifier/power supply system, a local
computer access, a spectrum analyzer, and the upgrading of the anemometry system
will be purchased. Some of the studies that will be undertaken with the
retrofitted wind tunnel are: the evaluation of the effects of miniaturization of
models, measurements of flow turbulence and forced and free vibration of vortex
shedding among others.
