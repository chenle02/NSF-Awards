Clark University The proposed research will focus upon the economic importance
of women-owned businesses (WOB) in the economic restructuring process of the
U.S. The objectives of the study are to explore the processes through which
gender and geography shape entrepreneurship and through which gendered
entrepreneurship is in turn transforming places. The study will compare two
metro areas of similar size, but with different proportions of WOBs: Colorado
Springs, CO and Worcester, MA. The research plan calls for three phases of data
collection in each place. The analysis will combine the case-oriented
comparative method with variable-oriented statistical analysis. The research
will contribute to theoretical and empirical understandings of the relationships
among geography, gender, and entrepreneurship.
