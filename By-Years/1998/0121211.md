ITR/\(PE+SY\): Responsive Virtual Human Technology Research

Responsive virtual human technology (RVHT) is used in diverse fields (computer
generated forces, manufacturing, medicine, theater), but not for interaction
skills training. Yet interaction skills are usually critical. Specific
situations identified where improved interaction skills would be important
include: Medical practitioners taking patient histories or interacting with
children; Law officers handling crisis situations involving mental illness,
trauma, or violence; and Military officers interviewing refugees or settling
stressed civilians. This project will address multiple research issues relevant
for RVHT to reach the sophistication required for robust interaction skills
training. Important questions to be answered include: How is behavior modeled
under normal conditions (i.e., a calm adult) and derivative conditions (e.g.,
anger, schizophrenia, pain, and childhood)? What expressions, gestures,
movement, and other behaviors will users interpret as serene, angry,
schizophrenic, pained, or childlike? What skills can be acquired, practiced, and
validated using RVHT? What is involved in providing a convincing simulation of
human interaction where acquired skills transfer to a live environment? The
research results will expose a range of additional training and educational
opportunities, such as interviewing risky behavior and presenting rare,
traumatic events. Combinations of RVHT-based training and instructor-led
training offer significantly reduced training development and delivery costs,
and increased student throughput, while maintaining training effectiveness and
consistency.
