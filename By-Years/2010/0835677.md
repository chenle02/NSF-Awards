This project will build a comprehensive infrastructure for resolving cellular
phenomena, from the molecular to the tissue level. The key underlying
contribution of the project is the use of domains within biomolecules as primary
units of functional description. This goal poses several intellectual
challenges, which form the focus of the proposal: (i) building robust
analytical, algorithmic, and software infrastructure for domain inference to
complement existing (experimental) domain data; (ii) resolving existing
molecular interaction data into domain interaction data; (iii) developing
techniques for inferring modularity and functional coherence in domain
interaction data; (iv) investigate implications of domain-based analysis on
identification of disease markers, intervention, and experimentation.

The analysis, simulation and design of complex systems is often performed in
terms of intuitively natural components. However analysis in such terms does not
always provide the most powerful descriptor of complex systems, for purposes of
prediction, design, or understanding. An example of this is the normal mode
analysis of linear or linearizable complex systems. The normal mode is a
mathematical abstraction, but is a powerful descriptor of real-life physical
systems. Normal modes also define modules in the hierarchical and coarse-grained
description of systems. Modularity is a hallmark of biology. Deciphering
biological modules, studying how they combine in a quantitative manner to yield
function, and describing their hierarchy in producing larger phenotypes, is
likely to establish fundamental laws that govern living systems. Leveraging
expertise in molecular and cellular biology and algorithm development, this
collaboration of four institutions will focus on developing algorithms, tools,
and methods for studying and designing biomolecular modules.
