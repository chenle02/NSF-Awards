Studies of chickens have provided serological and nucleic acid probes useful in
defining the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in other avian species.
Methods used in detecting genetic diversity at loci within the MHC of chickens
and mammals will be applied to determining the extent of MHC polymorphism within
small populations of ring-necked pheasants, wild turkeys, cranes, Andean condors
and other species. The knowledge and expertise gained from working with the MHC
of the chicken should make for rapid progress in defining the polymorphism of
the MHC in these species and in detecting the polymorphism of MHC gene pool
within small wild and captive populations of these birds. Genes within the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known to encode molecules that provide the
context for recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. Whether a
given animal is able to mount an immune response to the challenge of a pathogen
is determined, in part, by the allelic makeup of its MHC. In many species, an
unusually high degree of polymorphism is maintained at multiple loci within the
MHC in freely breeding populations. The allelic pool within a population
presumably provides diversity upon which to draw in the face of environmental
challenge. The objective of the proposed research is to extend ongoing studies
of the MHC of domesticated fowl to include avian species experiencing severe
reduction in population size. Knowledge of the MHC gene pool within populations
and of the haplotypes of individual animals may be useful in the husbandry of
species requiring intervention for their preservation.
