Genes are an essential building block of all forms of life. Understanding how
genes evolve and diversify their function would contribute significantly to
elucidating many phenomena and processes in biology, including how diseases
emerge and how to treat them. Genes undergo evolutionary events that range from
small-scale ones (e.g., one nucleotide is replaced by another) to large-scale
ones (e.g., a gene gets duplicated resulting in more than one copy of the same
gene). Accurately identifying these evolutionary events for different gene
families is the focus of this project. In particular, the project is aimed at
devising mathematical models, computational techniques, and software products
for mapping the trajectory of a gene through time in light of a variety of
evolutionary processes. The project will have impact on biology and biomedicine,
will result in publicly available software products that enable new analyses,
and will train students at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and
biology.

Inferring accurate evolutionary histories, or phylogenies, of species is a
major endeavor in evolutionary biology, and has implications on all aspects of
biology. This inference used to be conducted by sequencing a certain region of
interest from the genomes of species under investigation, building a genealogy,
or gene tree, for the region, and declaring the tree to be the species
phylogeny. In the post-genomic era, this practice has been replaced by utilizing
hundreds of genomic regions. While this new practice promises to yield more
accurate estimates of the species phylogeny, it also gives rise to a new major
challenge, namely accounting for the different evolutionary processes that could
be acting simultaneously on the different genomic regions. In particular, three
evolutionary processes have been prominent in post-genomic evolutionary
analysis: incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), horizontal transfer (or, gene flow),
and gene duplication/loss (GDL). Currently, no statistical methods exist for the
task of inferring evolutionary relationships of genes and genomes while
accounting for all these three processes simultaneously. The overarching goal of
the project is to develop mathematical models and algorithmic techniques for
this task. The proposed project will produce mathematical and algorithmic
results, as well as open-source software that would enable species phylogeny
inference from genome-wide data while simultaneously accounting for ILS, gene
flow, and GDL.
