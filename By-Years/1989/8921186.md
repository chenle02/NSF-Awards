This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of dynamic reaction studies at metal surfaces. Professor Janice Reutt-
Robey of the University of Maryland will use a unique pulsed molecular beam
source to observe the time dependence of adsorption and diffusion of molecules
at specific topologically distinct sites on platinum single crystal surfaces.
Using infrared spectroscopic detection the amounts and types of molecular
reactions sites will be determined. This will have impact on the understanding
of the role of morphologically distinct sites on surface chemical reactivity.
The pulsed molecular beam source will be constructed and used to study the
diffusion of carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide over stepped platinum
surfaces. The study will then move to more chemically complex systems, nitriles,
with monodentate binding sites. Calibration of the infrared signal will allow
absolute determination of the concentrations of species at specific sites.
Further, theoretical collaboration to simulate the dynamics of molecular
diffusion will be supported by the experimental results from this work.
