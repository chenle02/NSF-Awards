&lt;br/&gt;Various studies have shown that women scientists are not reaching the
top ranks in the proportion that they should. The chemistry community has found
that one-day workshops that emphasize negotiation and leadership skills are very
useful in helping women advance their careers. The American Physical Society
proposes to hold a series of workshops for women in physics that are closely
based on those that have been successful for women chemists, both in content and
in format. The first-year workshops will be aimed at tenured women faculty
because they are the leaders who serve as role models for junior faculty
members. The second-year workshops will be for non-tenured faculty members.
Finally in the third year, workshops for senior women in industry and the
national labs are planned. The workshops will both provide skills and also allow
networking. Each workshop will have 30 participants divided into two groups. At
the end of the day, we will have a final session with all 30 to discuss how they
can follow up on what they have learned. APS will work with the groups to
arrange further activities as suggested. APS will also do an online survey of
all participants of each workshop to learn what worked well and what can be
improved. Ideas for improvements will be worked into subsequent
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
