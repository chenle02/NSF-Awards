9310733 Gartland The investigator undertakes the mathematical and numerical
analysis of problems related to the science of liquid crystal materials. He
continues interdisciplinary work with the Glenn H. Brown Liquid Crystal
Institute (LCI) at Kent State University. The primary focus of the project is on
three areas: (1) numerical minimization of the Landau-deGennes free energy for
liquid crystals (which involves tensor order parameters, finite-element
analysis, large-sparse optimization, and numerical bifurcation), (2) automatic
code generation for the finite-element analysis of problems in liquid crystals
(using modern computer science technology from the area of symbolic and numeric
computing), and (3) numerical analysis and modeling of the optics of display
devices (involving the solution of Maxwell's equations in nonhomogeneous
birefringent media). The study of liquid crystals is an area of materials
science that is rapidly growing in importance, driven primarily by commercial
applications in the display industry: watch or calculator displays, notebook
computer screens, high-definition flat-panel TV screens, etc. The Liquid Crystal
Institute at Kent State has a strong international reputation. It is the only
academically-based institute devoted solely to research on liquid crystals, and
it is the locus of the NSF Science and Technology Center on "Advanced Liquid
Crystalline Optical Materials" (ALCOM). The investigator's research project
contributes to this activity in an interdisciplinary environment involving
physics and chemistry in addition to mathematics and computer science. He
performs numerical simulations on current problems of interest to the
theoreticians and experimentalists in the LCI. He brings to bear state-of-the-
art techniques from modern numerical analysis and scientific computing to
complement theory and experiment. Investigators in the LCI are at their limits,
using sophisticated experimental techniques, in probing the stru cture of liquid
crystals in the very small (submicron) size containments in certain display
technologies currently under development. Also, the numerical simulation of the
optical properties of complicated liquid crystal devices (of the types mentioned
above) is in a rather primitive state of development. The project's numerical
work plays an important role in these areas. ***
