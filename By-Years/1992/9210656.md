The growth and reproduction of insects is controlled by hormones released from
the endocrine glands. These glands are, in turn, controlled by specific
neuropeptides produced in small groups of cells in the brain. Molecular genetics
and DNA cloning methods will be used to investigate the control of production
and the functions of one of these neuropeptides, named PTTH (prothoracicotropic
hormones). The studies will be carried out using the fruitfly Drosophila, which
is the organism of choice for molecular genetic studies. The idea that PTTH
controls the production of molting hormone will be tested by determining the
levels of PTTH and molting hormone at different developmental stages and in
insects affected by mutations that perturb growth. The PTTH gene will be cloned,
and synthetic PTTH derived from the cloned gene will be used in experiments to
investigate how PTTH controls its target organ, the prothoracic gland, Genetic
techniques will be used to disrupt the PTTH gene in order to identify all of the
processes that it controls. The results of these studies promise to extend our
understanding of the hormonal control of insect growth and lead to novel
strategies for designing new insect control agents. In addition, they will
provide a new way of investigating the basic neurohormonal mechanisms underlying
control of reproduction in other organisms including man.
