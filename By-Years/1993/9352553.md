This project is providing students with daily access to computer hardware along
with mathematical software by putting computer work stations directly into two
mathematics classrooms. Each classroom has twelve computers, enabling a class of
thirty-six students to work on projects in groups of three. Courses taught in
these computer classrooms are being centered around problem solving teams that
use the computers to do mathematics and to write reports that combine text with
graphical and numerical output. Students are becoming comfortable enough with
the hardware and software so that they naturally and effortlessly use the
computers as they think, discuss, and experiment. Daily access, rather than
occasional trips to a lab, is allowing this to happen. The project is beginning
in precalculus classes and then branching to intermediate algebra and calculus.
With computers close at hand, faculty are fundamentally revising the way they
teach mathematics.
