This award provides partial support for US students and lecturers to attend the
Seventh International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders to be held at the
Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) in Indore, India, 27
November through 8 December 2012. The program of the school will cover a wide
range of topics related to lepton colliders, from beam dynamics to damping
rings, from superconducting radio frequency technologies to precise
instrumentation, from room temperature radio frequency technology to beam
delivery systems . The school will serve as an opportunity for US students and
post docs to interact with their counterparts from other regions of the world
and to form collaborations and partnerships. The program is supported jointly by
NSF Division of Physics, through its program in Experimental Elementary Particle
Physics, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, through
its Global Venture Fund.
