"Discrete and Topological Models in Molecular Biology" is a workshop to be held
at the University of South Florida on March 12-14, 2012. In recent years it has
become clear that mathematical tools from algebra, group theory, combinatorics,
and topology play essential roles in understanding vital biological processes at
the molecular scale. These include applications of (a) polynomials over finite
fields in systems biology; (b) combinatorics and graph theory in secondary and
ternary RNA structures, mRNA, as well as in protein folding and protein-protein
interactions; (c) combinatorics, algebra and tiling theory in the modeling of
viral capsid assembly; and (d) spatial graphs and topology in DNA-DNA, and DNA-
RNA interactions and splicings. There are a number of intriguing connections
between these techniques, and they are all essential tools in developing a
better understanding of structures and processes in molecular biology,
especially nucleic acids and proteins. This meeting will bring together
researchers with complementary expertise, who are interested in very similar
biological processes and molecular interactions. New collaborations will be
initiated through the exchange of ideas and development of new models and
mathematical techniques.

This workshop will bring together a wide range of speakers; from leading
theoretical mathematicians through mathematicians who actively collaborate with
experimentalists to molecular biologists and biochemists whose experimental work
depends on theoretical observations. A large component of the workshop will be
aimed toward junior-level researchers and graduate students through tutorials,
poster sessions, panel discussions and software demonstrations.
