In this doctoral dissertation enhancement project, scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) will be used to examine flurorophillic self assembly as a means to control
the morphology of thin films that are grown for use in organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The doctoral student,
Hayden Black, will combine his expertise in synthetic polymer chemistry with the
expertise in the modern analytical technique of STM in the laboratory of Prof.
Dmitrii Perepichka of McGill University in order to provide insight into
morphological control in the fabrication of thin-films of both OFETs and
OPVs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods of growing organic semiconductors
utilized in these studies may offer transformative pathways to fabricate organic
semiconducting devices having improved performance and reliability. These
methods might also have a significant impact on the fabrication of organic
semiconductor devices in general. The graduate student will benefit greatly from
being part of this synergistic international collaboration, which further
strengthens the student's ongoing studies of these organic semiconductors.
Providing first-rate international research experiences for U.S. students is a
major goal of the Office of International Science and Engineering.
