The award provides funding for a workshop to critically review and discuss
successful science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs, and
the institutional, policy, programmatic, pedagogical and curricular lessons to
be learned from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate
Program (HBCU-UP) and Tribal College and Universities Undergraduate Program
(TCUP) to inform Hispanics Serving institutions (HSIs). Minority Serving
Institutions share similar issues, including having communities of underutilized
talent with students often under-prepared to engage in higher education. HSIs
can learn lessons from the two undergraduate focused programs as a means to
increase the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates for Hispanic students
pursing STEM degrees and careers, assist HSIs to strengthen their institutions,
and innovate to better serve the Hispanic community and the nation.
Recommendations from the workshop will aid the NSF?s efforts to broaden
participation of all underrepresented minorities, and facilitate the development
of a diverse and competitive STEM workforce for the 21st century as mandated by
the America Competes Act.
