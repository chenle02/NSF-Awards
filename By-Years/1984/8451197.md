This project addresses basic sensor and actuator research for robotic
manipulators. A key goal for this effort is to determine if it is possible to
achieve the same behavior from a single transducer that was previously believed
to require many transducers operating in parallel. Several types of sensors
using new, flexible, and lightweight transduction materials will be evaluated.
