9417005 Riser This project is to analyze of a set of float data being collected
in the Western North Pacific. Over the past couple of years, 98 floats were
deployed at 1,000 and 3,000 m between 10 degrees and 40 degrees N, 140 degrees E
as part of the Kuroshio Extension Regional (KERE) and World Ocean Circulation
(WOCE) Experiments. These floats will be popping up to the surface in August
1994 through July 1995. The funds granted for this project are for tracking the
floats and processing the data. The data analysis will include combining the
data with other WOCE data sets from the North Pacific and model results to
produce a synthesis of the state of the North Pacific during the WOCE observing
period.
