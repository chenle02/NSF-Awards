Drs. Robert Blumenschine and Fidelis Masao will conduct exploratory
paleoanthropological research at the site of Olduvai Gorge in Northern Tanzania
to test a series of survey and analytic techniques. They wish to determine
whether it is possible to distinguish materials in primary undisturbed context
from those which have been eroded from elsewhere, higher up the stratigraphic
sequence, and then redeposited and reburied. They will use three techniques -
broad scale surface collection, intensive surface collection from squares of
different size, and finally, controlled excavation - to collect series of animal
bones and stone tools. These then will be analyzed and compared. The Olduvai
Gorge provides crucial evidence on the development of humans because its strata
contain archaeological materials which span almost two million years. Although
much paleoanthropological research has been conducted at the Gorge, it has
focussed, for the most part, on "sites" or dense concentrations of lithic and
faunal remains. This has provided a biased picture of the prehistoric landscape
and how early humans fit into it. Archaeologists have come to realize that to
provide a balanced picture, areas of medium and low artifact density should be
examined as well. At Olduvai, however, this may be difficult or impossible to
do. Because the Gorge is so steep, materials tend to be eroded from their
primary context and carried downward. To acquire distributional data which will
shed light on human behavior, it is necessary to separate derived from in situ
materials. Drs. Blumenschine's and Masao's work will show whether, in fact, this
can be done. This research is important for several reasons. It will, hopefully,
serve to develop and test analytic techniques which will be applicable in many
archaeological situations. It will set the stage for a larger research project
and may, in itself, increase our understanding of this important site. Since one
investigator is American and the other Tanzanian, it will also foster scientific
cooperation between these two countries.
