Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process underlying important phenomena in
nature, including solar flares, magnetospheric substorms and disruptions in
laboratory fusion experiments. The topological change in the magnetic field
which occurs during magnetic reconnection requires the breaking of the ideal MHD
frozen-in flux constraint. Classical resistivity is not adequate to explain the
observed energy release times. As a consequence, collisionless processes such as
electron inertia or turbulence induced dissipation must mediate reconnection.
The central goal of the proposal is to understand the structure of the
reconnection region near the magnetic x-line, including the development of
turbulence, and to understand how it controls magnetic reconnection.
