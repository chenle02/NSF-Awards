The College of Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota, proposes an eight
week High School Summer Science Research Program. The program is designed for
twenty high ability, high achieving students, grade 11. Each student will select
a faculty mentor and the majority of the student experience will occur in the
process of pursuing a research topic within the problem area being investigated
by that research team. However, all students will attend seminars dealing with
scientific methodology, ethical issues in science, philosophy of science, and
careers in science. In addition, they will be participating in a program of lab
safety. The students are expected to assume responsibility for a full work week
of forty hours, accepting the demands placed on a regular member of a research
laboratory team. The academic load is rigorous with considerable background
reading required by the individual mentors. Evidence of progress in the lab
issurveyed in the student seminar at the midpoint of the program and the final
results of the project is displayed and discussed at an end-of-term symposium.
