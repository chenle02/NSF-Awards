With the recent acquisition of several major pieces of instrumentation, the
Environmental Health Department at West Chester University is establishing a
computer-aided environmental laboratory which will be integrated into the
University's undergraduate environmental curriculum. The instruments include an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer, a gas chromatograph, and a UV/visible
spectrophotometer with appropriate computer interfacing to provide instrument
control and data analysis and reporting. The project is providing a stimulating,
advanced learning environment in which students study environmental pollution
and methods of control. Ten environmental courses are being improved, a new
advanced environmental monitoring and analysis course is being developed, and a
laboratory manual will be written and published. Significant improvements in
undergraduate instruction in environmental science are being implemented, and
scientists better able to solve the Nation's complex environmental problems are
being educated.
