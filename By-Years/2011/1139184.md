Intellectual Merit: Molecular and genetic studies have shown that proteins work
in multimeric complexes to direct cellular events, and that transcription
factors, in particular, can use selective interactions to differentially
regulate gene expression. Existing methods for detecting these interactions are
limited in the information that they provide, usually because the method of
detection is most appropriate for studies done in cell culture or in single-
celled organisms. This project involves developing a transformative method to
detect transient interactions among transcription factors within the nuclei of
the cells of living animals. The project will use the model organism,
Caenorhabditis elegans, a small multicellular worm commonly used for
developmental and genetic studies. Fluorescence imaging will be used detect
interaction between a transcription factor tethered to the nuclear membrane and
a fluorescently-labeled partner. Proof-of-concept experiments will be carried
out with known interactors and,once established, the method will be applied to
discover novel interaction partners. The research is novel and potentially of
high significance because it would allow unprecedented in vivo detection of
interaction between transcription factors throughout the life cycle of an
organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD
students from Georgia State University, an ethnically and racially diverse urban
institution, will participate in all aspects of this project. In addition to
providing research training, this project will provide an international research
experience for two college students. The project will also enhance the research
infrastructure at Livingstone College, a historically black college, through a
combination of summer research experiences for Livingston College faculty and
students and academic year lectures/visits to Livingstone by Georgia State
University faculty. Furthermore, a postdoctoral fellow will gain supervised and
guided teaching experience in both undergraduate and graduate classrooms.
