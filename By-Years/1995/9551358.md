Capitalizing on the students' interest in computers and modern scientific
equipment can lead to exciting experiments for the introductory laboratory.
Microprocessor-based laboratories have the potential to treat complex and
interesting physics problems at the lower levels through enhanced data taking
and analysis and through computer-aided instruction. This project introduces
modern physics into the laboratory curriculum of the calculus- based, the
algebra-based, and the "physics for poets" levels. Modern Physics and Quantum
Mechanics are being taught at these introductory levels through the use of
energy level diagrams and other conceptual devices. Spectroscopy and laser
physics offer a way to bring these concepts into the laboratory. Such
laboratories as lifetime measurements, optogalvanic effect, and fluorescence
studies are being modified for use at these levels. Monochrometers with computer
interfaces and dye lasers serve as the basis for this request since the
microprocessor- based laboratories are already integrated into the curriculum.
This project has the potential to affect more than 300 students per year
directly.
