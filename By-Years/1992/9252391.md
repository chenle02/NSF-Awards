Westmoreland County Community College's introductory physics and chemistry labs
and the electronics engineering technology program are being enhanced by
interfacing computers with existing laboratory equipment to provide new and
expanded experimentation opportunities for the students. Students are involved
in computer-controlled experimentation in chemistry and physics laboratory
classes; industry or university-level lab experiences in chemistry, physics, and
electronics engineering technology; hands-on experiences in transducer design
and construction for electronics engineering majors; and chemistry laboratory
experiences involving gas chromatography.
