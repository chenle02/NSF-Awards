The major goals of this collaborative project are two-fold: (1) To
&lt;br/&gt;obtain high resolution images of inner core anisotropy, through a
&lt;br/&gt;proposed PASSCAL experiment; (2) To develop a geodynamic model for
&lt;br/&gt;the origin of the observed seismic anisotropy. The investigators
&lt;br/&gt;plan to deploy two linear arrays of 15 new stations in the interior
&lt;br/&gt;of Alaska, coded as Alaska Receiving Cross-Transects for the Inner
&lt;br/&gt;Core (ARCTIC). New data from earthquakes in South Sandwich Islands to
&lt;br/&gt;the arrays will provide critically needed lateral and depth samples
&lt;br/&gt;of the inner core for determining the inner core rotation and for
&lt;br/&gt;resolving the structure of the inner core transition zone and the
&lt;br/&gt;depth-dependence of inner core anisotropy and attenuation. the team
&lt;br/&gt;plans to develop a geodynamic model for the formation of anisotropy,
&lt;br/&gt;using the new and existing data as a constraint. The major objective
&lt;br/&gt;of the modeling is to identify and investigate physical processes,
&lt;br/&gt;including effects of plastic deformation, inner-core growth and
&lt;br/&gt;recrystallization, and anisotropy in the thermal conductivity, that
&lt;br/&gt;can account for the observed depth and lateral variations in
&lt;br/&gt;anisotropy. The developed model will serve as a physical context for
&lt;br/&gt;interpreting the seismic observations. Predictions of the model will
&lt;br/&gt;be used to calculate synthetic waveforms, which are subsequently
&lt;br/&gt;compared with the observations to refine the model. The new data
&lt;br/&gt;collected will also be used to elucidate crustal and upper mantle
&lt;br/&gt;structure of the Alaska interior. The north-south line from
&lt;br/&gt;Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay will cross the Brooks Range in northern
&lt;br/&gt;Alaska, and The east-west line between Fairbanks and Nome will cover
&lt;br/&gt;parts of western Alaska in a known, but nearly unstudied, region of
&lt;br/&gt;extensional tectonics.&lt;br/&gt;
