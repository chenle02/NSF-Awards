The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
theoretical nuclear physics between Vladimir Paar of Zagreb University and
Richard Meyer of Montgomery College and Department of Energy and Richard Casten
of Brookhaven National Laboratory is to study statistical properties of nuclei,
interacting boson model, and quantum chaos. Paar's emphasis will be on the
theory underlying these physical phenomena and systems while Casten, Meyer and
others will provide the experimental expertise. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The award, except for funds for
U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav institution.
