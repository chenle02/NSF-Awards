This grant provides support for the acquisition of surface analysis equipment
for research on metal-ceramic film growth and student training at the University
of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. These surface analytical tools will become
permanent and scientifically important attachments to our ultra-high vacuum
facility for thin film growth. This project is focused on the development of low
temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) routes to deposit metallic ceramic
thin films for use in electronic devices and hard coatings. These compounds are
classified as metallic ceramics because they have high melting temperatures, low
electrical resistivities, excellent performance as barriers against impurity
(metal) diffusion, and high mechanical hardnesses. The cluster of surface
analytical tools will be used to analyze the film growth processes by providing
powerful insights into the chemical reactions responsible for deposition, as
well as the morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the films. The
knowledge gained from these in situ analyses will guide our efforts to grow
metallic, ceramic, and other thin film materials, and to achieve epitaxial layer
growth on suitable substrates.

Our current research project is the first to successfully produce metal boride
thin films with bulk-like properties at low growth temperatures. The new
equipment will provide excellent capabilities for improving our scientific
understanding and for further developing these low-temperature chemical vapor
deposition processes. The instruments will become part of a multi-user facility
available for use by undergraduate students, graduate assistants, and post-
doctoral scientists. We are engaged in recruiting new students from
underrepresented groups and routinely involve students from the classroom in the
research project.
