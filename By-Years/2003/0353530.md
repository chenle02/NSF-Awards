&lt;br/&gt;This proposal from UCLA requests funds to send junior researchers to
the International Conference of the Learning Sciences and to provide them with
specialized sessions to develop their research skills. The proposal will fund
travel for 15 graduate students who will be chosen to represent a range of
institutions, individuals and areas of specialty. Participants will be expected
to prepare a short summary of their research goals as part of the application
process and to prepare a presentation for the meeting itself.&lt;br/&gt;
