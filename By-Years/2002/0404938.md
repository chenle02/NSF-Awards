The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Sylvia E.
McLain to work with Dr. Alan K. Soper at Rutherford Appelton Laboratory in the
United Kingdom

The focus of this project is to study the local structure of interactions
between amino acids and water in aqueous solution, with an emphasis on hydrogen
bonding. Neutron diffraction, augmented where possible with hydrogen and
nitrogen isotope labeling, is used to determine the hydrogen bonding in these
systems. In addition, the diffraction results are analyzed with a computer
simulation models to enable a three dimensional description of the hydrogen
bonding present. This work, hitherto unparalleled, is likely to significantly
advance our understanding of how hydrogen bonding in solution drives protein
structure and function. This work is performed in collaboration with Dr. A. K.
Soper, Disordered Materials group leader, at the ISIS neutron spallation source
located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom.
