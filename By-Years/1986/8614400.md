Anoxic basins provided extreme oceanographic coniditions caused by the absence
of oxygen and the presence of reduced substances. Furthermore, the boundary
between the oxic and anoxic waters is useful for studying the rates of oxidation
and reduction reactions. The Black Sea is the definitive anoxic basin. It is the
world's largest permanently anoxic basin because unlike other stagnant basins
that are intermittently anoxic, the Black Sea provides a steady state system
with an anoxic water replacement time of 2000 years. There have been periodic
cruises by U.S. research vessels and U.S. scientists to the Black Sea and these
provide the data base for this expedition, no U.S. research vessel has visited
the Black Sea since 1975. This expedition will apply the latest analytical
techniques for trace elements and gases, some new sampling devices, new
techniques for studying microbially medicated oxidation and reduction rates.
Current models of elemental cycling in an integrated study of the water column
and sediments of the Black Sea.
