Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is an exploratory research
effort to automatically extract parallelism from sequential program and to
schedule the resulting fine-grained computational elements on manycore
processors. The goal is to allow existing sequential programs to run on many-
core processors efficiently and build the foundation to enable a hybrid
approach, involving message passing and&lt;br/&gt;shared memory, to address
petascale programmability&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research will attack the
following issues:&lt;br/&gt;? Design a compiler to decompose the code running on
a single node into fine-grained computation tasks to utilize the collection of
cores on a single chip.&lt;br/&gt;? Develop a highly-efficient runtime system to
schedule fine-grained tasks to optimize for available parallelisms and to
maximize on-chip cache locality to overcome off-chip memory latency and
bandwidth constrains.&lt;br/&gt;? Evaluate our success with a newly released
benchmark suite PARSEC which allows us to compare our success with hand-tuned
parallel solutions. We also plan to evaluate one computational science
application&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact
of this project is significant. First, the success of the proposed research
would advance knowledge and understanding in parallel programming to exploit the
power of future parallel machines. Second, the success of the project will
accelerate software developmentfor petascale computing. Third, the proposed
compiler and runtime systems will provide the&lt;br/&gt;capability to run
existing large-scale computational science programs on petascale computers
without burdensome programming efforts.
