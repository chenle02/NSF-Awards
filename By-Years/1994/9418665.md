9418665 Packard The Principal Investigators will study two questions related to
superfluid helium 3, a phase which exists below 2 x 10-3 K. The first area of
research involves understanding the nature of helium 3 when it is in the form of
films whose thickness is less than the superfluid coherence length. The
Principals Investigators will determine if these films will exhibit
superfluidity when deposited on helium 4 covered substrates. The initial thrust
of the program is to develop tools to study surface waves on the film, so called
third sound. These waves will be used as a probe of the films properties. The
second area of activity will develop helium 3 dc Josephson junctions. These weak
link structures should exhibit a nonlinear current pressure characteristic.
These devices may permit the detection of macroscopic quantum interference
analogous to the effects seen in dc superconducting quantum interference
devices. % % % The rare isotope helium 3 forms a superfluid state at
temperatures below 0.002 K. The Principal Investigators will determine if very
thin films of this materials will continue to exhibit superfluid properties as
the thickness of the sample is made progressively smaller. To answer this
question we will develop techniques capable of detecting surface thickness
waves. These acoustical techniques will provide insight into the properties of
thin films. The properties of the superfluid when it flows through very small
apertures will also be studied. It is believed that the fluid passing through
submicron apertures will exhibit peculiar behavior which may lead to the
development of very sensitive superfluid gyroscopes. ***
