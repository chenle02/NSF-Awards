Tropical landscapes account for about one-fifth of the global land mass, produce
most of the Earth's streamflows and influence global as well as regional
climates. Additionally, tropical landscapes are undergoing rapid changes due to
both climate change and deforestation. The effects of these changes on water and
biogeochemical processes, at a range of scales, are large but poorly understood.
This Chapman Conference will examine current understanding of tropical
ecohydrology and identify critical research needs in tropical systems.

This Chapman Conference on "Emerging Issues in Tropical Ecohydrology" meeting
will be held in Ceunca, Ecuador with three days of meetings and one day of field
work. Themes will include (1) the influence of ecosystem degradation and
recovery; (2) ecohydrological approaches and techniques for linking plant
ecophysiological responses with watershed hydrology; (3) new concepts related to
mechanistic assessment of the water balance across scales and across biomes
(e.g., distributed modeling); (4) new techniques for measuring plant- and
stream-water fluxes (e.g., stable isotopes, dendrochronology, sapflow, remote
sensing, eddy covariance, distributed modeling); and (5) methods for building
explicit linkages between ecophysiologists and ecohydrologists. The conference
will result in a set of synthesis papers that lay out critical questions for
ecohydrological research in the tropics and a cohesive strategy for addressing
the most urgent ecohydrology research needs.
