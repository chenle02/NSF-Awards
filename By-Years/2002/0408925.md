OISE-0408925&lt;br/&gt;Jiang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-China
cooperative research project between Dr. Zhong-Ping Jiang, Polytechnic
University of New York and Professor Lei Guo, Chinese Academy of Sciences to
study control of complex nonlinear systems to analyze complex interconnected
systems such as networks and applications to fleets of aerial or space vehicle.
This is an exciting project researching issues in the forefront of control
theory. The success of this project will benefit the U.S. and Chinese students
involved in this study. Both the U.S. and the Chinese scientists are experts in
this area, and their skills are complementary. This research project will be
jointly supported by the NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
