The Winter Gordon Research Conference on Fibronectin and Related Macromolecules
will be held February 11-15, 1991, on Oxnard, California. Fibronectin and
related macromolecules are involved in many basic functions of cells and
tissues, impacting on embryogenesis, tissue organization, hemostasis, wound
healing, the immune system, hematopoeisis, and other normal life processes. The
recent progress in this area has been explosive. The challenge to the field over
the next several years is to comprehend, organize, and make use of this large
amount of new information. This conference will bring together research leaders
in diverse aspects of the structure and function of fibronectin and related
macromolecules, and will serve as a valuable forum to present and discuss new
information, identify problem areas, and plan new approaches.
