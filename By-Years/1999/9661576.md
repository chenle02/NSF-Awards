*** 9661576 DeMenthon This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will test a novel instrument for tracking the hand and the head of a subject,
and has particular application to user-system interfaces for interactive 3D
graphics and virtual reality. A novel optical tracker using infrared Light
Emitting Diodes (LEDs) mounted on the hand and head of the user and a fixed
camera equipped with a position sensing diode (PSD) will be developed. The
system will modulate each LED at a distinct characteristic frequency from
several kHz to several hundred kHz. The contributions from the LEDs to the PSD
signal will all be measured simultaneously and separated by digital filters,
each tuned to extract the contribution of a single LED. Sunlight and
incandescent light sources do not produce components in the kHz range and will
be rejected by high pass filters. This design will obtain accurate translation
and rotation measurements at high rate, and with a low phase lag during rapid
hand or head motion. The proposed technology will result in the development of
optical tracking systems which perform reliably in unconstrained lighting
environments, while providing high update rates and high responsiveness.
Potential commercial applications include 3D mouse systems and Head Mounted
Display trackers for the interactive 3D graphics market, the simulator market,
and the entertainment market. ***
