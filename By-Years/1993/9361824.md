9361824 Smith The project addresses the key requirements for effective Software
Performance Engineering (SPE) tool support. It evaluates three candidate
architectures for SPE support that interface with both CASE tools and
performance modeling tools to capitalize on existing technology. It identifies
the key technical solutions that will make an SPE architecture feasible; a
performance meta-model that defies SPE requirements for a variety of CASE and
performance modeling tools; a Performance Model Interchange Format (PMIF) to
exchange information between various performance modeling tools. The results of
this project will enable vendors of existing products to provide true SPE design
decision support with a minimum investment in time, development and maintenance.
The resulting tools will reduce the time and effort for developers to use SPE,
thus improving reliability and reducing costs. ***
