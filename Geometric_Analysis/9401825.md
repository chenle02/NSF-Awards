9401825 Weinstein The research covers topics in the geometry of Lorentz surfaces
concerning their diffeomorphisms and embeddings into Minkowski 3-space.
Conformal structures of time-like surfaces will also be studied. The research
has potential applications to general relativity theory and string theory in
mathematical physics. ***
