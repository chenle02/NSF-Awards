The presence of a qualified and agile STEM workforce for academia, government,
and industry is recognized as central to economic progress, and the
underrepresentation of minorities, women, and persons with disabilities
particular groups wastes resources and hinders productivity and growth, as well
as raising questions of social justice, inclusion, and fairness. While a large
and rich body of research exists relevant to this issue, related policy and
programmatic interventions have faced a variety of challenges and in practical
terms, are not one-size-fits-all. Recognizing the complexity and urgency, the
National Science Foundation?s (NSF) Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science
and Engineering has recommended that "NSF should implement a bold new initiative
focused on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM." This
symposium is convened to engage the newly emerging Science of Broadening
Participation (SoBP) in response to and in the spirit of a bold new initiative.
In consideration of various stakeholder interests and positions, an important
symposium goal is the development of research and action agendas based on an in-
depth understanding of the role and interaction of stratifying forces relative
to educational and professional processes and outcomes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium is aimed at determining the scope and
analytical features of the SoBP and related policy by including the
participation of scholars, researchers, practitioners, representatives from
funding organizations, and policy analysts with relevant expertise and
knowledge. Applying an analytically comprehensive and science-based approach to
such issues is more capable of dealing with relevant antecedents and
consequences as critical features of the policy process is crucial to
determining interventions that work and to identifying promising policies and
programs for sustainable change and improvement in participation. &lt;br/&gt;
