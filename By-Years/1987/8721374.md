It is proposed to complete ongoing studies of a contact metamorphased zone
around a well studied granitic intrusion. A variety of analytical methods will
be used to evaluate the effects of calcareous wall rocks by a hot intrusion and
to quantify (1) the consequent mineral reactions, (2) the origin and evolution
of infiltrating fluids, (3) the scale of heat and fluid transport in the wall-
rock contact zone, and (4) the extent of chemical exchange between the intrusion
and country rocks.
