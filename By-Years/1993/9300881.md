The research entails considering problems concerning conformally equivalent
metrics on classes of Riemannian manifolds, classes of spectral invariants of
metrics and conformally invariant energy functions of maps. Related to these are
m-powers of the energy density of maps between Riemannian manifolds. Extremals
of these integrated densities lead to the notion of harmonic maps, generalizing
the case m=1.
