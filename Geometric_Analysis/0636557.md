Abstract

The UT Geometry Group Research Training Grant is a vertically integrated program
to enhance the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral
associates at the University of Texas and, through publication on the web,
beyond. The nine faculty members of the Group will initiate new activities at
all levels. Included is a new distinguished lecture series, Perspectives in
Geometry, which will be widely disseminated. The Geometry Group at UT has long
taken a unified perspective on the field. Our seminars reflect our approach:
they include a healthy mix of ideas from algebraic geometry, differential
geometry, global linear and nonlinear analysis, representation theory, and
topology. Often concepts and inspiration from theoretical physics play a role as
well. The RTG training activities are designed to promote this view of geometry
and, more broadly, of mathematics and science to young mathematicians.

Mathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the foundation of science
and technology. Geometry, the study of Space, has long had connections with and
applications to the real world. In the ancient world measurement was introduced
to facilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as trigonometry, were
introduced to understand the stars. In our modern world advanced ideas in
Geometry underlie abstract theories in physics and also have more immediate
practical implications, for example in coding theory, computer graphics, etc.
Effective training of the next generation of Geometers is vital for the
continued development of this field, both within mathematics and for external
applications. The University of Texas Geometry Group Research Training Grant
(RTG) promotes a unified view of the field. Through local activities in Austin,
and via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training at all levels.
