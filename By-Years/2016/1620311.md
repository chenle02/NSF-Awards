This award funds the research activities of Professor Louise Dolan in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in theoretical particle
physics have shown how the fundamental constituents of matter are described by
novel constructions that provide a deeper understanding of space and time. In
particular, new methods of calculating how these fundamental constituents of
matter scatter off each other have recently been developed which transcend the
previous, well-established techniques. These new methods facilitate calculations
of the kinds of scattering that are measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
In her research, Professor Dolan will pursue these methods in order to acquire
knowledge of the underlying theoretical structure responsible for understanding
the fundamental forces of nature. This work thus serves the national interest by
contributing to progress in our understanding of fundamental physics. The grant
will also partially support a postdoctoral researcher, and will enable Professor
Dolan to continue her outreach to female high-school science students in which
she discusses with them certain exciting aspects of her
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Dolan will seek to
understand massless field theory tree amplitudes in arbitrary space-time
dimensions in terms of an algebraic expression associated with the polynomial
form of the scattering equations. Precise results at tree level are likely to
extend to loop level via polynomials of elliptic functions. Pursuit of a robust
understanding of Yangian invariance in planar gauge theories and aspects of
quantum gravity in flat space and anti-de-Sitter space will strengthen our
knowledge of these structures.
