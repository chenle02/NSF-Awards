Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is developing project-based
laboratories (PBL) for the General Chemistry sequence as a means to foster a
more learner-centered environment. Projects presented to students must be solved
through experimentation, with individual student teams contributing experimental
results to the larger, class pool of results. As the students progress through
the two-semester sequence, they are becoming less dependent on instructor
directions, more independent in their ability to modify suggested procedures,
and are eventually required to have significant input into their own
experimental design. Computer-interfaced laboratory equipment is providing
continuity, reduced data-collection times, and networking capability necessary
to implement this proposal. Specific experiments have been adapted from the
education literature and are being implemented in a PBL format. Twenty-four
student workstations, four computers, four printers and two networked diode
array visible spectrometers are present in the teaching laboratories.
Approximately 600 students in General Chemistry are using this equipment during
Fall, Spring, and Summer terms, with nearly two-thirds of the General Chemistry
laboratory curriculum affected. Given the extent of the proposed change, this
process is being phased into the curriculum over a three-year period. It is
anticipated that these changes will enhance scientific reasoning skills since
the students are actively applying and modifying their laboratory skills to
solve problems in which they have an interest.&lt;br/&gt;
