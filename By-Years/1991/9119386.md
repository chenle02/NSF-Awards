Thick layers of high mobility electron gas are produced by remotely-doped
GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructures in which the aluminum (Al)
concentration is graded in a parabolic profile. The electron mobility in the
resulting structures can be quite high, because donor ions are located outside
the wall. More complex electron profiles can be made using potentials other than
simple parabolas. Such work will be carried out in this project, in which both
the charge and spin density profiles will be spatially modulated. This will be
accomplished in thick layers of high-mobility electron gas by using
superlattices superimposed on parabolic wells, and by using periodic electric
and magnetic gate structures fabricated with electron-beam lithography. The
resulting structures and materials have very interesting electron- magnetic
properties, of current interest from the fundamental solid state physics
perspective, and of future interest for use as advanced semiconductor device
materials.
