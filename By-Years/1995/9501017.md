9501017 De Graef This research program is aimed at an in-depth understanding of
the effect of hydrogen on the stability and properties of selected phases in
intermetallic alloys, identifies and evaluates stable and metastable hydrides in
these systems, and develops appropriate microstructures for applications in high
temperature hydrogen-rich environments. This is accomplished by gas-phase
charging of selected alloys, characterization of the microstructural changes,
and measurement of changes in the mechanical properties. The program attempts to
evaluate the hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) model for hydrogen-
induced embrittlement by using energy filtered transmission electron microscopy
to study hydrogen segregation to the core region of dislocations. Results of
this research program will be of interest to the engineering community since
novel microstructures will be created with improved resistance against the
detrimental effects of hydrogen environments. The educational part of the
program consists of three parts: (1) creation of an Undergraduate Vision
Laboratory and adaptation of the current laboratory courses to fully benefit
from the novel experimeltal opportunities offered by the lab; (2) development of
Multi-Media Courseware for use in the sophomore level undergraduate core-
classes; and (3) creation of an interactive courseware facility for the graduate
level electron optics class. The Undergraduate Vision Lab will be the
integrating factor in this educational development plan and will provide new
opportunities for outreach activities. %%% Degradation of structural properties
of the intermetallic alloys in a hydrogen atmosphere is a major concern for the
application of these alloys in hydrogen-based propulsion systems. The initial
focus is on titanium aluminide intermetallics, which have potential applications
in aircraft engines and hypersonic vehicles. ***
