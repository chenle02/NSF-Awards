The proposal seeks to develop a novel method for the analysis of radiation
scattering data from a broad class of materials, ranging from atomic to
supramolecular. The method seeks to obtain the details of the effective
interatomic or interparticle forces to an extent which has not been possible
previously, and is useful at conditions at which such forces dominate
interfacial phenomena and macroscopic behavior and properties of the materials.
The focus of the work is in the study of colloidal materials and micellar and
microemulsion systems. However, the potential impact of the work is broader and
can be applied to the study of simple liquids and liquid metals as well as
structurally arrested materials such as gels and glasses. This work will be
coordinated with x-ray, neutron, and light scattering studies currently in
progress.
