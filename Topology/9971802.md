Proposal: DMS-9971802

Principal Investigators: Jerome Levine and Daniel Ruberman

Abstract: This proposal discusses problems in several areas of knot theory, and
low-dimensional topology. Ruberman will undertake a comprehensive investigation
of the topology of the diffeomorphism group of a 4-manifold using tools of gauge
theory. Ruberman will continue to work on cutting and pasting operations on
3-manifolds, with the goal of understanding how these affect Seiberg-Witten
invariants of 3-manifolds. He will also begin an approach to classical knot
cobordism, using tools of foliation theory. Levine will continue his work on the
theory of finite-type invariants. He will investigate several new proposals for
extending the notion of finite-type, which was originally confined to the class
of homology-spheres, to general 3-manifolds. This will also involve further
investigation of the relation between finite-type invariants and the structure
of the mapping class group of a surface. In another direction Levine will also
continue work on the concordance classification of linksin 3-space. Ruberman and
Levine will jointly investigate link cobordism in even dimensions.

Modern geometric methods, some of which originate in theoretical physics,
continue to have a major impact on the study of topological objects such as
knots, links and 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds. Conversely the understanding of
the structure of these geometric objects, in their role as modeling the real
world, has important applications to theoretical physics. The research proposed
concerns the study of numerical and algebraic invariants of each of these
categories of geometric objects and the use of such invariants in the study of
the structure theory of knots, surface symmetries and 3-dimensional manifolds,
and in the study of symmetries and deformations of 4-dimensional manifolds. The
diverse mathematical tools involved in our projects involve techniques from
partial differential equations, differential geometry, combinatorics,
representation theory, group theory and classical cut and paste techniques for
the construction and analysis of 3-dimensional manifolds.
