Drs. Samuels and Rogerson of the New York Botanical Garden will continue their
studies of saprophytic and pathogenic fungi of the ascomycete group Hypocreales,
emphasizing tropical taxa in the Americas. Members of this important group of
fungi are found on decaying wood, leaves, and on other fungi. The species, as is
true of many fungi, have a life-cycle with a sexual stage and an asexual stage;
each is represented by a distinct spore-forming phase. The phases may occur
independently of each other in nature and often have been given separate names
in various taxonomic schemes, when the link between the two has not been
analyzed. Asexual forms (so-called anamorphs) of several taxa are used as
biological control agents. The Principal Investigators will conduct field
collecting in northern South America and will employ traditional and modern
herbarium studies, including artificial culturing of single-spore isolates.
Their results will provide clear circumscriptions of the many species of these
fungi, reliable identification keys, maps of geographical range, and basic
knowledge about the sexual-asexual forms of fungi.
