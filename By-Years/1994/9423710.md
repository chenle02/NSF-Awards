The principal investigator proposes a workshop to be held January 8-10, 1995,
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This workshop will involve
scientists that were engaged in the analysis and interpretation of measurements
made during the 10 day World Day Run in January, 1993. Potential topics include
coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere; determination of the spectral
content of the winds and temperatures from 80 to 300 km; multi-day waves;
gravity waves and electrodynamics.
