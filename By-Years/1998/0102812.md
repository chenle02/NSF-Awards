Tougaloo College seeks to increase the number of majors in science, math, and
computer science who ar successful in their courses, who complete undergraduate
studies with honors, and who attend graduate school in the sciences and
technology. The college has an excellent track record for placing students in
medical and health professional schools, and has also recently been cited as
among the top five undergraduate sources of African-American doctorates.

The program has three strategies. The first is to improve student success in
introductory courses in biology, chemistry and mathematics. To our tutorial
drop-in center we are adding three people (two supported by this grant) to
provide weekly supplemental instruction sessions for the first two years of of
instruction in these disciplines. In addition test practice sessions will be
held to familiarize students with standardized test questions from examinations
such as the Graduate Record Examination and the Medical College Admissions Test.

We will also build the enrollment in our physics, pre-engineering, and computer
science programs. We will sponsor a six-week summer program to introduce
students to both fields, along with reading and English skills. We will offer a
number of scholarships to talented students in computer science or physics who
maintain a 3.3 science GPA.

Finally we plan to stimulate interest in science and in graduate school by
supporting research as an integral part of of the life of both faculty and
student scientists. Contrary to its past tradition, the college will provide
time for older faculty and new faculty to set up a viable on-campus research
program, through either released time or sabbatical leaves. This program will
continue to be supported by the College after the grant, as faculty acquire
outside funding.

These initiatives will provide a rich, stimulating environment for students
which will provide a unique window on the reasons why people become scientists.
