U.S.-Venezuelan Dissertation: Acquisition of Vocal Signatures in Wild Parrots
&lt;br/&gt;0825675&lt;br/&gt;Jack W. Bradbury, Cornell University-State
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support dissertation research for Karl
Berg, a Ph.D. student at Cornell University-State. The Principal Investigator
for this award is Dr. Jack W. Bradbury from Cornell University-State. The
research will be done in collaboration with Dr. Virginia Sanz of the Instituto
Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, Venezuela. Dr. Sanz is a well known
ornithologist who has expertise in the area of dispersal of juvenile parrotlets.
The present study complements the PI?s research on vocal learning in wild
parrots by incorporating Green-rumped Parrotlets in Venezuela. The proposed
activity will address two questions: how do nestlings acquire their signature
contact calls, and how are dynamic changes in call structure used in "social
negotiation" within mated pairs. This research into the early learning phase
could be helpful to conservation programs that target threatened parrot
populations.
