9513167 Scheraga This work is a three-part attack on the protein folding
problem. First, the statistical mechanics of the problem will be elucidated.
Simplified lattice models of proteins (with realistic but easily computable
procedures) will be used to provide fundamental statistical mechanical insight
into the protein folding problem. The Entropy Sampling Monte Carlo method
(augmented by a conformational-biased chain regrowth procedure and a jump-
walking method) is used to determine the density of states of the protein, from
which the properties related to conformation and folding are reduced. The method
is being extended to an off-lattice treatment. Second, in order to be able to
use energy as a criterion to distinguish the global minimum from other local
minima in the multidimensional energy surface (the so-called multiple-minima
problem), a new force field is being developed. Third, the multiple-minima
problem is being surmounted by the diffusion equation method. %%% This
theoretical approach will provide the basic understanding of the folding
properties of protein. This problem is currently at the frontier of protein
research. The basic understanding to be acquired will be applicable to the
biotechnology industry. Finally, this approach will provide training for the
research associates carrying out this research, and also for several graduate
students working together with these research associates. ***
