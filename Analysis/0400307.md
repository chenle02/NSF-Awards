This proposal will focus attention on a variety of problems in interpolation,
invariant subspaces, and model theory on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
analytic functions on domains in Cn. These problems connect operator theory and
function theory. Examples of such problems are the corona problem on symmetric
Fock space on the unti ball of Cn and the corona problem on Hardy space of the
unit polydisc in Cn.
