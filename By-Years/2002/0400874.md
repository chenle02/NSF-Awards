This award provides partial support for purchase of a device used for rapid
freezing of samples for electron microscopy. Following fixation at low
temperature, cells preserved through use of high pressure freezing have improved
ultrastructure and are suitable for immunocytochemistry. Use of high pressure
permits the freezing of thicker samples than alternative procedures, and is thus
useful for reliable freezing of whole organisms with cuticles, such as nematodes
and flies, and for freezing of yeast and plant cells that have thick cell walls.
The instrument will be used for study of synaptic ultrastructure in nematode
mutants, protein localization at membranes of muscles and neurons,
ultrastructure of yeast mitochondria, and developmental defects in plant
mutants. The equipment will be housed in an imaging facility at the University
of Utah where it will be available for other research and training use by
students and faculty from the University and from throughout the Great Basin
area. &lt;br/&gt;
