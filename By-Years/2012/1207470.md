The principal invesitgators are members of a committee convening a planning
workshop to prepare for the rare total solar eclipse that will traverse the US
continent on 21 August 2017. The workshop will be held April 9-11, 2012, at the
High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado, and will bring together eclipse
experts and scientists to plan for this 2017 event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop wii allow plans to be developed to capitalize on the unique scientific
and public outreach potential of the 2017 eclipse. By traversing the extended US
landmass, the shadow band of the 2017 eclipse will provide almost uninterrupted
observations of the solar corona over 90 minutes, from its start in the
northwest to its end in the southeast. Such a span will provide the opportunity
to capture the temporal variations and spatial characteristics of coronal
structures on times scales of fractions of seconds, to minutes, to over an hour.
Since a number of identical experiments can be set up along the path of totality
to maximize chances of success, the 2017 eclipse promises an optimal scientific
yield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this activity will be in its
ability to spark the interest of the public at large and to entice them to take
part in exploratory and discovery opportunities. This workshop will provide the
first meeting for specialists to collectively develop ideas for public
experiments and outreach that would fully exploit the 90 minute duration of this
2017 event across the USA, and involve a significant fraction of the national
population, as well as a large number of visitors from abroad. In addition, the
workshop will allow planning for eclipse observations that will test new
technologies and concepts for later incorporation in ground-based and space-
based observatories.
