Transfer phenomena in porous media are involved in several fields of
considerable practical importance: geology, hydrology, chemical engineering,
petroleum engineering, drying, etc. An international seminar in Dubrovnik,
Yugoslavia is being organized by the International Centre for Heat and Mass
Transfer and sponsored by UNESCO with the objective to present up-to-date
research and to provide a forum for interaction by the porous media scientists
from various parts of the world. The one-week seminar will feature invited
lecturers and presentations by recognized experts in the field on both
fundamental as well as applied topics. This travel grant will enable the PI to
present an invited review based on his contributions on non-Darcy convection in
porous media, research which was previously supported by the National Science
Foundation.
