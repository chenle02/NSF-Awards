Investigations in the theory of Markov processes are to be done with
concentration on branching measure-valued processes and related processes in
spaces of functions. The general form of branching, the relationship between
path properties of superdiffusions and positive solutions of nonlinear
differential equations and modeling of "a random cloud" with interacting parts
are among the principal objectives of the investigation. Measure-valued
branching processes have been studied since the late 1960s and have attracted a
great deal of attention during the last five years. This is a remarkable class
of processes, which provide a tool for the investigation of spatially
distributed populations. They also make it possible to extend important
connections between probability theory and the theory of partial differential
equations.
