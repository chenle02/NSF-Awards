Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1247356&lt;br/&gt;Rogan,
Elizabeth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Biomedical Optics Topical
Meetings (BIOMED for short), organized by the Optical Society of America (OSA),
is the premier meeting in the area of biomedical optics both in breadth and
depth. Since the very first meeting in 1994, these meetings have grown in size
from a few tens to over 500 attendees, and the majority is graduate students
including female and other underrepresented students. Most of the technical
sessions at the BIOMED meeting are relevant to the mission of quite a few
programs at NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting offers a unique opportunity
for the biomedical optics community to share the exciting state-of-the-art
technological developments, stimulate new ideas, learn new challenges and
directions, and explore/promote new collaborations. The meeting also offers an
effective platform to educate our students, future scientists and engineers in
multidisciplinary fields and facilitate them to develop skills of collaborating
with people from different backgrounds. This means bringing physical science and
biological science students together, giving them opportunities to be informed
about other disciplines, and finding ways to convince students to break out of
the discipline-specific boundaries in which they often find themselves.
