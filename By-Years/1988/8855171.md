This project, to be carried out on the campus of GMI Engineering & Management
Institute, consists of two parts, an intensive three-(3) week summer workshop
and nine (9) monthly follow-up activities during the school year. Students with
high interest and potential will be identified and recruited from the schools of
Genesee County. Emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of minorities and
women. GMI has established two minority pre-college science and engineering
programs, ASPIRE and AIM, with strong participation from school districts within
the County. The workshop will involve a maximum of forty (40) students who
willcommute daily to GMI, where they will participate in activities that involve
basic mathematical concepts, communication skills, computer science, engineering
design projects, science investigations, and simple research projects. The
activities will focus on chemistry as an essential scientific discipline. A
portion of the workshop (30%) will involve career awareness activities and field
trips. Participants will observe scientists and engineers in the research and
teaching environment. The follow-up activities involve nine (9) monthly meetings
with students and teachers from Genesee County schools. These activities,
consisting of dynamic speakers, films, field trips and competitive events, are
designed to motivate and guide interested persons toward science and science-
related careers.
