This project will develop portable, reusable array piezoelectric microcantilever
sensors (PEMS) for rapid, accurate, and direct quantification of chemical
terrorism agent (CTA) using electrical means. The proposed PEMS 100 micrometers
in length with an oxide adsorbent selective to a target CTA will quantify the
presence of the CTA with femtogram sensitivity and reusability. To reduce false
alarms, multiple PEMS, each with a different and selective oxide adsorbent, will
simultaneously detect and quantify a target CTA. The ultrahigh sensitivity of
the proposed sensors and the multiple PEMS with different selectivities provides
for a robust sensor with fewer false responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches
to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with
the potential to contribute to national security.
