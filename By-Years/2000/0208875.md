Henzinger, Thomas CCR-0208875 "Towards Predictability and Portability in
Embedded Software"

This project develops, implements, and validates platform-independent
programming models for embedded software with hard real-time constraints. For
high-performance control applications, the time-triggered programming language
Giotto is implemented by targeting the Embedded Machine. The Embedded Machine is
a virtual machine that mediates in real time the interaction between software
processes and physical environment processes. The Embedded Machine is ported to
single-CPU and distributed platforms. Embedded Machine code is validated by
schedulability analysis.
