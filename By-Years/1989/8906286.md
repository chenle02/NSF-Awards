A new program of research will be initiated in the dynamical evolution of
strong gravity systems in cosmology and astrophysics. This will involve the
study of effects of quantum matter near the end point of a stellar gravitational
collapse including backreaction effects in spherically symmetric spacetimes. The
quantum behavior of the early universe will also be investigated by study of the
boundary condition of its wave function in an alternate approach. The universe
will be described by a density matrix consistent with some partial knowledge, in
the same manner as any other ordinary quantum systems. The goal of this research
is to: 1) explore the limitations to the presently known laws of physics, and 2)
uncover the need for possible modification to extend them outside of their known
range of validity.
