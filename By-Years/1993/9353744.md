9353744 Harris-Perkins The goal of the Fresno Unified School District self-
study/planning grant is to collect data and analyze existing policies in order
to develop a process for systemic change. The proposal seeks to develop a system
that will monitor and assess student achievement; improve existing science and
mathematics curricula; design a plan for on-going professional development and
collaboration with local colleges; and establish the community as a classroom. A
Steering Committee consisting of key stakeholders and community representatives
will guide the planning process. ***
