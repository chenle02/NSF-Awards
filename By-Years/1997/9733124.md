DMI-9733124 Kasarda Active magnetic bearings are a proven technology in
turbomachinery applications, but their use in manufacturing equipment has
received surprisingly little attention. These bearings are feedback mechanisms
that support a spinning shaft by levitating it in a magnetic field. They
increase operating efficiencies, improve control of rotor dynamics, and reduce
equipment maintenance and waste associated with the replacement of used
lubricants. The feedback nature of the magnetic bearing also allows for the use
of the bearing as a load cell to measure shaft forces. The research plan of this
CAREER project will investigate a new and innovative use of the force
measurement capability of active magnetic bearings to supply information for
statistical process control in manufacturing applications to improve the
process/quality control of such products as textile fibers and photographic
films. Research tasks include the investigation of the design of active magnetic
bearing systems for optimum shaft force measurement, development of on-line
system calibration procedures, and the design and construction of an active
magnetic bearing test rig for experimental verification. Components of this
research are linked to the educational portion of the career development plan to
promote the integration of engineering practice and engineering science. This is
accomplished partly through the development of a new "hands-on" undergraduate
course in predictive/preventive maintenance with an innovative utilization of
the resources at the Virginia Tech Power Plant. The impact of this career
development plan includes improving the design of active magnetic bearings for
use in manufacturing equipment and enhancing the ability of US manufacturers to
improve process/quality control. This plan also impacts education by the
incorporation of engineering practice into engineering education, resulting in
the increased effectiveness in the preparation of graduating engineers for
industry's needs.
