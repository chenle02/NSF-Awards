This work will focus on the total synthesis of a diverse group of important
natural products and on the development of new synthetic methodology. Synthetic
targets include: oleanolic acid, miroestrol, paeoniflorin, prostaglandin H2,
lactacystin, ovalicin, cassioside, epibatidine and brefeldin A. The methodology
topics chosen include: enantioselective addition of vinyl and alkynyl groups to
aldehydes and ketones, enantioselective reduction of ketones, syntheses of
chiral oxiranes, catalytic syntheses of new chiral controller groups,
exploratory chemistry of chiral oxazaaluminolidines and chiral cationc
oxazaborolidines, exploratory research on new titanium (IV) complexes as
enantioselective catalysts, use of amino-acid derived catalysts for
enantioselective synthesis and new methodology for the preparation of medium-
and large-ring terpenoids. %%% With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Elias J. Corey of the Department of
Chemistry at Harvard University. Professor Corey will focus his work on the
synthesis of several naturally occurring and biologically active complex organic
molecules. He will also pursue the development of new synthetic methodology
