9600411 Sculli This grant supports research in elementary-particle physics by
three NYU faculty, 2 postdoctoral research associates and a graduate student.
Two disparate research activities are supported. First is the continued study of
collisions of antiprotons with protons at 2 TeV in the Tevatron collider at
Fermilab as members of the DO collaboration. The group's analysis focuses on
determination of the W boson mass; its contribution to the detector upgrade is
to the new fiber-tracker front-end and trigger electronics. As members of the
team constructing the MILAGRO cosmic gamma-ray detector at the Los Alamos
National lab site, they are preparing to study cosmic-ray energy distributions
and search for sources of photons in the high-energy interval from 1 to 100 TeV.
