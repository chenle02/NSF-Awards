Highway bridges are becoming old and as a consequence are deteriorating at a
rapid rate. To plan a program of repair, retrofit or replacement, it is
necessary to evaluate the current capacity of the bridge. This project will
investigate and develop a rational approach to the evaluation of the safety of
existing highway bridges and subsequently to develop a decision model based on a
reliability analysis.
