This work is concerned with the study of adaptive nonlinear filters and their
applications. While the concept of linear filtering has had enormous impact on
the development of various techniques for processing stationary and
nonstationary signals, there are several applications in which the performance
of linear filters is unacceptable. Channel equalization and echo cancellation
and echo cancellation in high performance communication systems, image
processing, characterization of semiconductor devices, and modeling biological
phenomenon are some of the examples of applications in which nonlinear filters
have been successfully employed. Possibly because of the computational
complexity associated with adaptive nonlinear filters, it is only recently that
active research on such systems have begun. The work deals with the following
four closely related problems in adaptive nonlinear filtering: 1) Development of
efficient algorithms for adaptive nonlinear filters using nonlinearities modeled
with finite Volterra series expansions; 2) Development of numerically stable
fast recursive least-square Volterra filters based on QR-decomposition
techniques; 3) Study of adaptive nonlinear filtering algorithms for systems
where the nonlinearity is modeled using recursive, nonlinear difference
equations, with relatively few parameters to adequately represent a large class
of nonlinearities; and 4) Analytical and empirical performance evaluation of the
algorithms developed. These are all challenging and important problems that when
solved will result in substantial advances in our nonlinear signal processing
capabilities.
