This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new capability for robust system identification that will enable more effective
neurocontrol. This research will specifically address control of complex
nonlinear dynamic systems. It will develop figures-of-merit for system
identification, useful to translate quality-evaluation metrics into terms that
can be readily used for computation of a strategic utility function in an
adaptive-critic neurocontrol architecture. It will explore biologically-based
approaches to system identification that will permit modeling of more complex
systems, including systems which evolve or change over time. It will also
enhance cabilities to build system identification with complex temporal
associations, allowing more complex processes to be controlled. One or more of
these innovations will be hosted in an adaptive critic architecture. Feasibility
demonstrations will select and use an appropriate function for optimization and
use of context-dependent processes in producing a system model. The improved
system identification methods developed in this project will, when inserted into
a robust neurocontrol system such as an adaptive critic, permit adaptive control
of a wide range of systems with applications to flight control, control of
electric cars, control of biomedical devices, robotic motion control, and many
others. This capability will be applied to a currently developing commercial
flight control technology in hypersonic waverider as well as potentially to the
next-generation `clean car.`
