The Physics/Physical Science Instrumentation project has four major objectives:
1) to acquire important equipment for the project, 2) to integrate computer data
gathering and analysis experiences into the physics/physical science curriculum,
3) to develop and implement a laboratory incorporating newly acquired equipment,
and 4) to present a project review at the area AAPT meeting (all materials and
experiments relative to the project are being disseminated to other
physics/physical science instructors.)By meeting the objectives of the project,
the physics/physical science department is strengthening its offerings to
students and preparing students for more of the requirements necessary to enter
physics, physical science, engineering, medicine, or other science related
classes in the four-year institutions.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
