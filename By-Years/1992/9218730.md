9218730 Renne This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
cryogenic magnetometer that is to be installed and operated in the Geochronology
Center at the Institute of Human Origins (IHO). The IHO is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the purchase and installation of the
equipment. The Geochronology Center is engaged in a broad spectrum of research
activities in the earth sciences that use paleomagnetism (measure of the earth's
ancient magnetic field orientation as recorded in the magnetic minerals of
ancient rocks). The sensitivity of the new cryogenic magnetometer is needed in a
number of research projects that include: (1) Refinement of the geomagnetic
polarity time scale ... when in the past did the earth's magnetic field reverse
itself? (2) Stratigraphic studies. (3) Tectonic studies, and (4) The research of
non-IHO scientists who will be encouraged to utilize the new facility. ***
