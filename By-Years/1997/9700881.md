9700881 Levine This project is concerned with the study of motivic categories
and other related constructions. The principal investigator will extend the
computation of motivic cohomology of varieties over a field to the case of a
smooth base scheme of arbitrary dimension. He plans to attempt a construction of
a filtration on the Chow groups of smooth projective varieties (along the lines
of the conjectural filtration of Beilinson and Bloch) by constructing a
triangulated tensor category satisfying a universal property with respect to
motivic cohomology and Hodge cohomology; he also will consider a relative
version of the results of Resnikov on the vanishing of Chern classes of flat
bundles. The principal investigator will extend the Bloch-Gabber-Kato theorem to
a partial computation of K-theory with mod p coefficients in positive
characteristic p. He will compute the motivic cohomology and K-cohomology of
reductive groups and their classifying spaces, giving rise to new invariants for
etale G-torsors for reductive groups G. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
