Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators (ICDs) are at the forefront of preventing
sudden death in patients suffering from ventricular arrhythmias. ICDs have
evolved into complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)which tightly sensing,
hardware, and software to diagnose arrythmias based on electrogram signals and
control cardiac excitation. These devices are life-critical, yet the
Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) techniques used for establishing their
safety have remained somewhat informal, and rely largely on extensive unit
testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been a number of exciting developments
in formal verification technologies. This proposal introduces these techniques
into the ICD verification process, and will demonstrate their suitability for
application in other medical devices. The project will develop a model-based
framework for ICDs, and will apply formal verification techniques, such as model
checking and reachability analysis, to high-fidelity cardiac
electrophysiological models that capture the electrical excitation induced by
the ICD's control software. Through extensive collaboration with FDA research
staff, the proposal will demonstrate the effectiveness of formal verification
technology and suitability in medical device applications.
