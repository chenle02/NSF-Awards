Kinetic theory describes the dynamics of a large number of particles, such as
flows of air particles passing an airfoil, or neutrons' collisions in a nuclear
reactor. In a statistical manner, the kinetic description bridges the micro-
scale modeling of motion of particles by Newtonian mechanics and the macro-scale
modeling by continuum fluid mechanics. This research project aims to develop
novel mathematical methods to quantitatively characterize these multi-scale
models. The investigation focuses on the motion of rarefied gas, neutrons,
electrons, and ions, in spatially bounded regions under the influence of the
surrounding environment. Its applications range from high-tech fields like semi-
conductors or nuclear fusion, to daily-life devices like water sprays or
fluorescent lamps.

Specifically, this project concentrates on the hydrodynamic limit of the
Boltzmann equation or transport equation, i.e. how the solution varies
asymptotically when a small parameter, either the Knudsen number or the Strouhal
number, approaches zero. In bounded domains, kinetic boundary corrections (i.e.
boundary layers), play a crucial role. The investigator intends to justify the
validity of the asymptotic approximation in the presence of singular boundary
layers. Moreover, the initial-boundary interactions and nonlinear effects are
taken into consideration. To tackle the non-standard asymptotic expansions, the
investigator seeks to develop general theories of geometric correction in
boundary layers, rescaled remainder estimates, Milne regularity analysis, non-
local energy methods, and boundary layers decomposition. These techniques can be
further applied to Vlasov systems and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations.
Also, the rigorous derivations of fractional diffusion and stochastic diffusion
are involved.
