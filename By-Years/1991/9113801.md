This project is in the area of manufacturing processes to develop a long-term
research collaboration between the University and a leading United States
printer and manufacturer of printing equipment. The training part of the project
is aimed at acquiring an in-dept knowledge of heat-set web offset lithography
and the scientific and engineering issues involved in the design and manufacture
of printing equipment, in particular ovens and chill roll stands. In the second
phase of the project preliminary research will be initiated with the goal
characterizing the process parameters. This work will attempt to understand the
complex heating and cooling processes in the web as well as the stability of web
motion as it moves through the press. The ultimate goal is to identify the key
scientific problems that need to be solved in order to alleviate the condensate
streaking problem that currently limits high quality high speed printing. On
site experiments will be explored under realistic press operating conditions to
acquire a basic understanding of the dynamic flow of heat, moisture and solvent
in the web as well as to verify preliminary modelling efforts.
