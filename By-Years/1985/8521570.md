The objective of this program is to develop a new method of analysis of the
chemical composition, size, and number density of gas-suspended solids and
liquids. The program will have the following specific objectives: (1) to develop
an improved instrument; (2) to improve the theoretical basis of the method
through measurement of the optical constants of candidate materials and
extension of the theories to non-spherical samples, and to include multiple
scattering; (3) to optimize the data reduction procedures and develop the
analysis for extracting data from spectra of mixed sizes, mixed compositions and
non-dilute samples; and (4) to validate the methodology on a wide variety of
materials, particle sizes, and number densities.
