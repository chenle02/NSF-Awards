Dr. Takamiya will use the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter telescope, and the
new 0.9-meter telescope dedicated to UH-Hilo, to take images of 30 nearby
galaxies in the light of hydrogen gas that has been heated by nearby young
stars. Young stars are generally surrounded by dusty gas, out of which they have
formed. The dust absorbs some of the light from the hot gas, blocking blue light
more strongly than red. Dr Takamiya will compare images of her galaxies in both
the red line of H-alpha and the green line of H-beta, to estimate how strong the
blocking effect is. A further check will come from maps in the mid-infrared made
from space observations, and maps at radio wavelengths, since these are almost
unaffected by dust. The results obtained in nearby galaxies will be extrapolated
to distant disk galaxies, where in general only lines such as H-alpha at optical
wavelengths can be measured easily for large samples. This extrapolation will
yield better estimates of the rate at which galaxies have formed their stars
throughout cosmic history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide
research opportunities to undergraduate students at Dr. Takamiya's institution.
Six undergraduate students will be hired to participate in writing observing
proposals to gain access to telescopes on Mauna Kea, to carry out the
observations, reduce and analyze them, and to present the results in
professional meetings. The University of Hawaii at Hilo is located in the most
ethnically diverse county in the USA, and members of under-represented groups
will be encouraged to participate in this research. Dr Takamiya will also
continue her outreach work to local elementary schools.
