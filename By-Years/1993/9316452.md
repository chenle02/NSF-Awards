9316452 Moore The woodpeckers are a large group of birds, numbering about 171
species, and are distributed over four continents. Despite this diversity, the
fossil record and the degree of genetic differentiation in the group suggest the
woodpeckers are young in age, originating only about 6 million years ago. In
addition to being specialized for chiseling and drumming on wood, woodpeckers
are characterized by bright and contrasting plumage patterns that are highly
distinctive among species. Our present understanding of the history of this
group is based largely on plumage similarities. Reconstructions of history based
on molecular, DNA structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate that
there is substantial misunderstanding of woodpecker relationships, and there are
numerous cases where plumage patterns are similar due to independent history
rather than common ancestry. The PI will expand his preliminary work to
reconstruct the genetic history of the woodpeckers based on a long sequence of
the cytochrome b gene for approximately 200 specimens representing all the major
groups of woodpeckers. In addition to clarifying our understanding of the
genetic history of a major group of birds, the study will serve as a model for
understanding the relationship between the histories of individual genes
(cytochrome b) and species (the woodpeckers). ***
