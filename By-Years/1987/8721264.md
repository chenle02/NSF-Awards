Continental rifting is characterized by structural asymmetry of the earth's
crust as evidenced by the predominance of tilted fault- blocks in most extended
terranes. Accommodation zones facilitate periodic reversals in the sense of rift
asymmetry, including inversion in the dominant direction of block-tilting and
possibly reversal in the dip of regional detachment systems. The amount and
direction of movement of the upper and lower plate rocks will dictate the
deformational style along the accommodation zone, therefore studies of such
zones can provide constraints on the kinematic evolution of individual
detachment terranes. This project is a detailed mapping, structural analysis and
paleomagnetic investigation of a well-exposed accommodation zone in the Black
Mountains of Arizona and the Eldorado Mountains of Nevada. These investigations
of this accommodation zone may have important ramifications for the geometry and
processes attending continental rifting.
