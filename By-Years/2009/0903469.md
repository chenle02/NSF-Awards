This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project is
a multidisciplinary graduate training program in resilience and adaptive
governance in stressed watersheds at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.
Resolving complex water issues requires the best and clearest scientific
information from interdisciplinary and integrative science. This program will
train the next generation of natural resource scientists, managers, and
policymakers by increasing scientific understanding of how resilience - the
ability to withstand multiple stresses without losing critical structure and
function - is generated in complex systems of people and nature. It will provide
cross-disciplinary academic and experiential training for a diverse group of
doctoral graduate students in natural, social and computational sciences, and
provide opportunities for minority students. Broader impacts include training in
the complex interactions of ecological and societal systems affecting water
management and in the use of sophisticated mathematical and computational tools
for decision support. IGERT doctoral students will receive academic training in
resilience and adaptive management and will participate in externships and
workshops that expose them to real-world applications that transfer knowledge in
a way that is useful to policymakers. Local, state and federal agencies will
help shape curricula in natural science, policy and law by developing student
research externships. Students will benefit from an international experience
comparing compromised watersheds in the Great Plains of the United States to
similarly challenged watersheds in Europe. This program will assist in
fundamentally changing academic culture by coalescing students and faculty from
natural science, social science, computational science and law around a common
goal: the responsible management of over-appropriated watersheds. IGERT is an
NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D.
scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge
in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills
needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze
a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models
for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative
research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
