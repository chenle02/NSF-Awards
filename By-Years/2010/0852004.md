This award, jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and Chemistry a
the National Science Foundation, supports the continuation of the Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Southern Illinois University
at Carbondale. The REU Site program supports 14 undergraduates for 10 weeks each
summer during 2009 to 2011. Participating REU students work on interdisciplinary
projects in materials research with close guidance from faculty mentors in
Chemistry, Physics and/or Engineering departments. The interdisciplinary
environment encourages the REU students to think about their respective projects
in broad terms and to consider applications of their research to new
technologies and issues relating to manufacturing of new devices. REU students
have the opportunity to present their research to a diverse audience across
disciplines during the program and at the end-of-program poster presentation as
well as in regional and national conferences. Opportunities to network with
peers, faculty mentors, and other scientists and engineers are provided through
evening and week-end social and cultural activities included in the program.
Students are recruited nationally, with particular emphasis on students from
groups underrepresented in science and engineering, as well as socio-
economically disadvantaged and first-generation college students. The goals of
the REU site include: 1) creating a positive image of science and engineering as
a career choice; 2) providing a nurturing research environment; 3) improving the
participants' communication skills; 4) teaching basic research tools (including
modern instrumentation); 5) fostering collaborative research; and 6) increasing
the number of domestic students, especially those from underrepresented groups,
who choose careers in science and engineering.
