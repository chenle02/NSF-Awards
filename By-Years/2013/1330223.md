This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to make it
possible to do a better job of integrating information about entities, such as
people, companies, and products, extracted from heterogeneous data sources. This
integration problem can be challenging when different formats and terminology
are used to describe the same entity. This problem can be addressed by a
statistical learning approach that allows a system to estimate the probability
of a match between entity references, rather than computing a score based on ad-
hoc rules or weights. The research focuses on refinements to this statistical
learning approach that will enable a system to handle diverse types of real-
world data. Because the approach is based on sound statistical principles and
uses evidence compiled from large datasets, it can produce more accurate results
than existing commercial methods. Moreover, these advantages are amplified when
handling data that that has highly variable, missing or noisy attributes, such
as data extracted from websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
project lies in enabling enterprises to perform more accurate and reliable data
integration. Today, enterprises often have difficulty utilizing data extracted
from unstructured or semi-structured source because the extracted data is noisy
and difficult to integrate. This capability is critical for some of the nation's
largest companies and institutions. For instance, the technology being developed
in this project will reduce the cost of integrating data from hospitals and
health information providers. It also can help intelligence agencies do a better
job of connecting the dots, when investigating companies and individuals, and
help human resource managers do a better job of finding;and recruiting job
candidates. Ultimately the technology resulting from this project will help many
types of enterprises make better use of the growing amount of information
accessible through the Web and private networks.
