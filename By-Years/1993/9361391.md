9361391 Arya Thermal management is one of the critical aspects in the design of
the 2 and 3 dimensional multichip modules (MCM's) to ensure reliability at
increased functional densities in electronic devices. Diamond has the highest
know thermal conductivity and yet is an electrical insulator. It is proposed to
deposit high quality diamond films on high thermal conductivity metal matrix
composite heat sinks which will allow powder dissipation of several hundreds of
watts in the advance MCM packaging concepts. Recent developments in fullerene
chemistry show that the carbon atoms in the pentagons of the spheroidal
molecules of C60, C70, etc are predominantly Sp3 hydribdized and are sterically
fairly close to the diamond. MER has demonstrated that a small amount of
rearrangement of these atoms in highly energetic plasma can result in
transformation of fullerenes into diamond. This unique fullerene vapor phase
precursor process will be demonstrated and optimized to produce will bonded,
high quality thin and thick diamond films at very high growth rates and at low
temperatures on the MMC and other electronic substrates. Single, hybrid and
magnetically enhanced plasma systems will be investigated along with different
plasma gas chemistries to produce polycrystalline diamond films as well as free
standing film of geological size and quality diamond which will establish a
basis for Phase II optimization and scale-up to economically produce diamond
films. ***
