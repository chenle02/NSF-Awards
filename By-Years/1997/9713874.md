This project will undertake a systematic evaluation of the possible operational
use of global MHD simulations. This will be accomplished by simulating a broad
range of conditions using the Lyon MHD code (a very mature MHD model) and the
results of the simulations will be compared with data. An evaluation of model
simplifications and reduced resolution to enhance the computational speed will
be undertaken. The effort will concentrate on identifying the conditions under
which the model output would be operationally useful.
