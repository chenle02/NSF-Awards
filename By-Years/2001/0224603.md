The objective of this project is to metabolically engineer bacteria to produce
high levels of folic acid directly from glucose as opposed to transforming a
more expensive raw material such as para amino benzoic acid (PABA).
Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), glutamate, and GTP are
the glucose-derived precursors of folic acid. Thus, from the concentration and
formation flux standpoints, these four precursors need to be engineered to be
amply available. The metabolic engineering approach will initially focus on
increasing further the formation of chorismate, a PEP and E4P-derived
intermediate in folic acid biosynthesis. The proposed tasks are: (1) alter
regulation to increase the flux to chorismate while limiting the side reactions
from chorismate to amino acids, (2) model and map the fluxes in the folic acid-
producing candidate strain of B. subtilis using the investigators software and
NMR analyses, (3) test the strains in batch and continuous cultivation, and (4)
based on the results of steps 1-3, further fine tune the pathways. After
achieving success on the chorismate-side of the folic acid biosynthetic pathway,
subsequent work can explore whether other precursors (e.g. GTP) have become
limiting.
