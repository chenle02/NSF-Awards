ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most important theorems in mathematics
are those which&lt;br/&gt;connect up different fields, concepts or view-points.
In algebraic&lt;br/&gt;number theory many of such theorems go under the name of
reciprocity&lt;br/&gt;laws. The general framework for reciprocity laws is the
Langlands&lt;br/&gt;program. Much of the PI's work deals with issues that arise
from&lt;br/&gt;reciprocity laws especially in the context of linear, mod
p&lt;br/&gt;representations of the absolute Galois group of the rationals.
A&lt;br/&gt;reciprocity law in this case has been conjectured by J-P.
Serre.&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by Serre's conjecture and related issues the PI has
studied&lt;br/&gt;congruences between modular forms and deformations of
Galois&lt;br/&gt;representations. The PI will continue to study and develop
tools to&lt;br/&gt;approach such reciprocity laws and related questions that
have a&lt;br/&gt;bearing on the intricate relationship between automorphic forms
and&lt;br/&gt;Galois representations in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any
progress towards establishing reciprocity laws has a very broad&lt;br/&gt;impact
that is felt all across number theory. The work of the PI
on&lt;br/&gt;reciprocity laws involves coming up with new ideas and techniques
that&lt;br/&gt;impact many central areas of mathematics, like those mentioned
above,&lt;br/&gt;and potentially might be useful to applications of number
theory in&lt;br/&gt;areas like cryptography that are of great practical use. The
PI also&lt;br/&gt;expects to disseminate knowledge by involving students in
research&lt;br/&gt;project&lt;br/&gt;
