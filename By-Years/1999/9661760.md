*** ABSTRACT 9661760 Pien This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will investigate a novel approach for preparing Pt electrocatalysts for
proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Platinum clusters will be impregnated
inside carbonaceous structures protecting the active sites from poisonous gases
such as CO, CO2, etc. At least two different impregnation techniques will be
tested in Phase I including CVD deposition technique and impregnation from
liquid phase. The carbonaceous materials will be chemically treated prior to
impregnation by using oxidative treatment procedure. Prepared catalysts will be
evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray spectroscopy, AUGER spectroscopy, and
elemental analysis. The catalyst performance will be evaluated in a single fuel
cell with 5 cm2 active area. Hydrogen and hydrogen with premixed CO will be used
as reactant gases. A comparison between conventional Pt/Ru catalyst and the
novel catalyst developed during Phase I will be performed. The catalyst
developed during the proposed research program will have commercial applications
in PEM fuel cells for transportation applications as well as for stationary fuel
cell power systems operating on reformate gas and methanol. ***
