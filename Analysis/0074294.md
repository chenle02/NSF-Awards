This proposal has two parts. Mather's part concerns using variational methods to
prove the existence of "wandering" orbits in Hamiltonian systems. The sort of
thing he hopes to prove are illustrated by the conjectures which go under the
name "Arnold diffusion". Forni's part concerns area preserving flows on
surfaces. He intends to study two conjectures: an extension of the KAM theorem,
where Kronecker flows are replaced by area preserving flows on surfaces of
higher genus; and a conjecture that would imply that the convergence in
Birkhoff's ergodic theorem takes place with polynomial-like decay.

Both parts of this proposal concern generalized KAM theory, which has important
applications to questions of stability and randomness in conservative physical
systems. For example, the long-term dynamics of the solar system is far from
being understood, and this proposal could contribute to mathematician's
understanding.
