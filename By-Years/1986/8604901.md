This equipment project will provide state-of-the-science instrumentation needed
for advanced research in electronic devices and circuits; it will be used to
establish a general purpose electro-optic sampling station. The station will
allow non-invasive optical probing of devices and circuits. Electro-optic
sampling is a powerful technique for making non-invasive measurements of
voltages on circuits or microstrip transmission lines. Work on extensions to,
and on the limits of this technique will also be performed. This station will
provide support for and benefit from ongoing research programs in the areas of
millimeter-wave (mm-wave) integrated circuits, high speed GaAs devices and
circuits, and optical modulators and detectors at Berkeley.
