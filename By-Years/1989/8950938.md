Students are using Macintosh workstations and the computer algebra system
Mathematica in classroom and laboratory settings in the introductory course
Calculus with Discrete Mathematics. The computational and graphics capability of
this system is providing students with more insights and a better understanding
of this basic course. Particular emphasis is placed on experimentation and
modeling. The College will provide matching funds equal to the amount of this
award.
