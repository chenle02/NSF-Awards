A scientific program is a mathematical one so there are two
factors&lt;br/&gt;contributing to its performance. One is the time required to
perform&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic. The other is the time needed to move data through
the&lt;br/&gt;memory hierarchy of the computer. In today's large applications,
the&lt;br/&gt;latter cost often dominates. The work funded by this grant focuses
on&lt;br/&gt;efficient computational methods for solving the problems in matrix
algebra&lt;br/&gt;that arise in a wide variety of science and engineering
applications.&lt;br/&gt;Codes for such problems are typically constructed as
sequences of calls to&lt;br/&gt;the routines known as the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms (BLAS). Writing&lt;br/&gt;programs in this way promotes readability
and maintainability but can&lt;br/&gt;be costly in terms of memory efficiency
especially for matrices of&lt;br/&gt;large order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant
will be used primarily to support a Ph.D. student who will&lt;br/&gt;study ways
to combine multiple BLAS routines into a single routine that&lt;br/&gt;performs
the functions of more than one BLAS. He will examine ways to&lt;br/&gt;create
composed BLAS via novel algorithms and performance
programming&lt;br/&gt;techniques, developing a general methodology for their
creation in the&lt;br/&gt;process. His work will ultimately form the basis for a
tool that creates&lt;br/&gt;composed BLAS automatically. Composed routines can
significantly reduce&lt;br/&gt;the amount of data read from main memory.
Preliminary results include&lt;br/&gt;speedups as large as
90\%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
