The objective of this research is to develop high-rate data links (&gt;20 Mb/s)
for implanted biomedical devices that can operate in the presence of narrowband
interference from an inductive power link. The approach is to employ ultra-
wideband signaling with transmitted reference synchronization to realize low-
power, high-rate data transfer over the short distances required by biomedical
implants. A comprehensive approach to system design is employed, with
substantial effort focused on the design and modeling of the antenna and channel
so that their effects can be accounted for in the circuit
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel ultra-wideband transceiver architectures
being explored in this work will bring about an order of magnitude increase in
data rates for biomedical implants, as compared to the narrowband transceivers
that are currently prevalent. This research will advance the state of the art in
low-power, short-range wireless communications, and is expected to prove
beneficial for a range of applications beyond implantable
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-rate data links being explored in this
research have the potential to be of tremendous benefit to society, by enabling
biomedical devices that can improve the quality of life for individuals (e.g.
visual prostheses, neural control systems for prosthetic limbs) and by enabling
extensive, long term neural recordings that will further our understanding of
the brain's physiology. The educational initiatives integrated with this
research target every stage in the development of young engineers to solve
tomorrow's technology challenges, from high school outreach initiatives, to
undergraduate research involvement, to graduate course curriculum
development.&lt;br/&gt;
