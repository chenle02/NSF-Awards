American Indian Schools: Science Teacher Development, organized under the
direction of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, will enhance
the general science background of 40 teachers, grades 5-8, from schools in which
the majority of the students are American Indians. Over a three year period,
teachers will develop and test classroom materials which interface science and
the culture/tradition of American Indians. In the first summer, 20 teachers will
attend the program at the Colorado School of Mines, study general science, meet
and learn from prominent American Indian Scientists, and develop draft teacher
materials employing cultural integration in science. After using, testing and
evaluating these materials during the academic year, the teachers will return
for a second summer science program, with 20 additional teachers. After refining
the classroom materials the teachers will all use and evaluate the refined draft
edition in the academic year. During the third summer 10 teachers will return to
revise the volume of lesson plans and prepare it for distribution, through
AISES, to teachers in 1200 American Indian schools. If American Indians are to
realize increased participation in key scientific and technical positions,
programs must be developed that significantly enhance the opportunity for
American Indian youth to have high quality mathematics and science preparation.
Increasing the knowledge and motivation of teachers is the best means of
delivering a more knowledgeable students to college. This is critical to
enlarging the pool of students eligible to participate in mathematical and
scientific fields.
