Extensions of logics currently used in computer science are being investigated.
Under particular consideration are extensions of temporal and dynamic logic
which appear to be quite natural and to have considerable expressive power. A
new model of alternating automata working on trees is being used that allows
very simple and efficient decision procedures. In basic cases, proofs of
decidability of the intended logics are being given that are simpler than the
standard proofs for the unextended logics. Extensions of these methods are being
attempted to questions involving protocols where knowledge should be taken into
account for communicating systems. Also under consideration are some extremely
strong dynamic logics with infinitary run quantifiers in which essentially any
fairness condition can be expressed. The PIs propose to use tools they have
developed in recent innovative work in formal language theory to investigate
logics used in computer science. The theory program can properly devote funds
toward the development and use of such methods in theoretical computer science.
The proposed work ties together in a positive way the theory traditions of the
U.S. and France.
