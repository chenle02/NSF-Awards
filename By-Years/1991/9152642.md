The project provides a comprehensive and challenging laboratory experience in
the areas of compressible flow, flow metering and jet flows for mechanical
engineering students. The major equipment purchased includes an air-storage
tank, a nozzle flow apparatus, an electronic balance, two air blowers, and a
computer data-acquisition system. This equipment together with the equipment on
hand is used to perform experiments on pressure and mass flow measurements in
supersonic nozzle flows, thrust and flow patterns in nozzle flows, the Mach
number measurement, differential pressure flow meters, and jet flows. The
project strengthens the laboratory education in thermal sciences, introduces
experiments concerning compressible air flow, and provides better opportunities
for students in thermal-design classes and independent studies.
