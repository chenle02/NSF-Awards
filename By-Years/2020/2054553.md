Patterns in the world can be described both by geometric spaces and by algebraic
equations. It is a challenge to find how to read off the geometric properties of
a space from its defining equations. The project will make new advances on the
problem, in both conceptual and computational ways. As part of the project,
graduate students will be introduced to mathematical
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hilbert scheme of points classifies all zero-
dimensional closed sub-schemes of a given algebraic variety. &lt;br/&gt;The
principal investigator and collaborators will prove the first systematic results
about the topology of the Hilbert scheme of points on a high-dimensional
variety. In another part of the project, the principal investigator and graduate
students will explore the classification of Fano varieties by a new exploratory,
computational method, using computer calculations on a K3
surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
