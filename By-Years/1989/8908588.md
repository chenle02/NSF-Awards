This one-year Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is to
assist the PI in developing skills in the application of molecular dynamics
techniques for the study of structural and dynamical phenomena at solid
surfaces. Based on the molecular dynamics codes developed under this grant
studies of the characteristics of rare gas overlayers on the (111) surface of
Pt, Cu and Ag will be undertaken.
