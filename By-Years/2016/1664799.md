This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division. Professor Christopher Cummins of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology develops very small, often reactive compounds that occur in
interstellar space. An impact of the work is the collection of data needed by
radio astronomers to identify new molecules in space. These molecules also serve
to enable the synthesis of new classes of chemicals to generate electronic
materials or as components of catalysts for use in chemical industry. The work
is highly collaborative with study of the new substances conducted in concert
with research groups in academia and at national laboratories. The project is a
training ground for the professional development of graduate and undergraduate
students and postdoctoral scholars who work together to create new knowledge
while exploring and mapping the chemistry of reactive intermediates. Videos of
the procedures are posted on YouTube to facilitate adoption of protocols by
other researchers and to provide the public with a window into the practice of
synthetic chemistry.

This project focuses on the development of molecular precursors that can expel a
neutral leaving group, such as anthracene, upon application of a stimulus such
as irradiation or thermal activation. This provides a means to generate reactive
intermediates such as P2, HCP, SO, or an aminophosphinidene. The reactive
intermediate can be transferred to a suitable acceptor molecule for reactions
carried out in solution, or released into the gas phase to enable studies by
molecular beam mass spectrometry, microwave spectroscopy, and laser-induced
fluorescence. Isolated reaction products are characterized by multinuclear NMR
spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and the experimental work is
complemented by quantum chemical calculations designed to reveal details of
chemical bonding and to elucidate reaction mechanisms by potential energy
surface explorations.
