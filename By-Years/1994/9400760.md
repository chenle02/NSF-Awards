Biomass burning worldwide is a significant source of a number of important
atmospheric trace gases (e.g., C0, C02, CH4, NH3) and aerosols. It therefore
plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and, possibly, in the radiative
balance of the earth. The purpose of this research is to improve quantitative
estimates for the emissions of a number of trace gases and aerosols from biomass
burning in tropical forests, which is probably the largest source of emissions
from biomass burning worldwide. Airborne measuring techniques which have been
applied successfully by this research group to studies of biomass burning in
North America and the 1991 Kuwait oil fires, will be used to measure the masses
of various gases and aerosols emitted into the atmosphere per unit mass of fuel
burned from various types of fires in Brazil. These measurements will be used to
improve estimates of global emissions of the measured species from biomass
burning in the tropics. The chemical composition, cloud condensation nucleus
activity, and time evolution of the aerosols from the fires will also be
measured. These studies will form part of a larger investigations of both the
physical and chemical properties and effects on the atmosphere of biomass
burning in Brazil. The funds provided by NSF will support the chemical component
of the overall study.
