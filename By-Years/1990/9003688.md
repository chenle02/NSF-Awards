Manganese-rich, aluminum-poor modulated layer silicate minerals are to be
studied by using an integrated petrologic and mineralogic approach to assess
structural stability. This study will determine if the misfit between the ideal
sheets of tetrahedra and octahedra is a requirement to produce a modulated layer
silicate structure. In addition, the Grenfell deposit, Australia, will be
studied to determine the effect of sequential metamorphism on the mineral
phases. The work will be done in collaboration with Dr. R.A. Eggleton of the
Australian National University, the Canberra. Using ultra-high resolution
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction techniques.
