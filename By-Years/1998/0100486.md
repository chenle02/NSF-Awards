The proposed research is directed at topics in several complex variables on
entire holomorphic maps, interpolation problems, and value distribution theory.
The principle investigator proposes to continue his study on the well-known
transcendental Bezout problem about the growth of the volume of entire analytic
sets and find sharp estimates on the counting functions of zeros of entire
holomorphic maps. He also proposes to study interpolation problems for weighted
spaces of entire functions, one of fundamental and central problems in several
complex variables. In particular, he wishes to characterize interpolating
varieties geometrically, which is closely tied with his study on the Bezout
problem. In the third direction, he would like to continue his research on value
distribution theory with a special attention given to the refined Nevanlinna
second fundamental theorem for slowly moving targets and its relations to other
problems such as uniqueness problems of meromorphic functions and meromorphic
solutions of partial differential equations.

The above problems are important not just from the point of view of several
complex variables, but also from their relations and applications to other
subjects such as harmonic analysis, transcendental number theory, systems theory
and engineering. For instance, many important problems like finding and
representing solutions to partial differential equations or systems of
convolution equations arising in signal processing, image compression, materials
testing, etc. are equivalent to interpolation problems for entire functions in
weighted spaces. The proposed research aims at developing and advancing both
theories and applications for the above areas in several complex variables.
