The scope and quality of undergraduate research in experimental psychology is
being expanded and upgraded. The new equipment is allowing laboratory
experimentation in four areas: psychomotor performance; biofeedback; operant
conditioning; and perception and cognition. As a liberal arts university for
deaf students one focus of laboratory experimentation and research in the
undergraduate experimental psychology course is on the sensory, motor, cognitive
and physiological concomitants of deafness. Under the plan students are learning
the basic principles of experimental design, data analysis, and preparation of
reports by conducting experiments which are both interesting and instructive,
utilizing modern and advanced instrumentation. Psychomotor equipment,
biofeedback equipment, and operant conditioning equipment have been added as
well as a constant illumination projection tachistoscope. In addition to
strengthening the undergraduate course in experimental psychology, the equipment
is contributing to improvements in other experimentally-oriented courses, such
as perception, learning, motivation and independent study (supervised student
research).
