The past thirty years have seen a deep and surprising interplay between several
branches in pure mathematics, and string theory in physics. In particular,
physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants
which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study
of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further
develops two curve counting techniques, the "logarithmic gauged linear sigma
model" (log GLSM) and "quasimaps", and their combination, with the goal of
making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out
of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample
training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI
will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of
interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project will result in a proof
of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the
application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a
major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different
direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological
ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the
"conifold gap condition", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter
Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau
correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps,
the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps
for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete
intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more
mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to
allow for quasi-maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
