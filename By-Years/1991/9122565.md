A satisfactory theory of strategic behavior in games not only must identify the
outcomes that are equilibrium points, but also must explain the origin of
mutually consistent strategic behavior. Recently, there has been a renewed
interest in the dynamic systems approach to the origin of mutually consistent
strategic behavior. This literature can be divided into four broad categories:
learning by trial-and-error, best responding to naive beliefs, best responding
to sophisticated beliefs, and evolutionary processes. Unlike theories of
strategic rationality, it seems very difficult to select amongst the competing
theories using introspection. The research will use the scientific method to
discriminate between those abstraction assumptions underlying strategic
rationality that lead to accurate theories of strategic behavior in observable
games and those that do not. It will focus on the abstraction assumptions needed
to map an observable game into an abstract game and, hence, needed for the
extant theory of abstract games to be relevant for an analysis of strategic
behavior in observable games. The ultimate goal is to develop an empirical
foundation for a convincing and scientific explanation of the origin of mutually
consistent behavior in observable games in which the scientist can observe the
rules of the game, the actors selecting actions, the outcome of those actions,
and the resulting scores.
