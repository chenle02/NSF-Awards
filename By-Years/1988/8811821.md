Studies of the paleointensity of the geomagnetic field are essential if we are
to understand the mechanisms that generate the field. Despite its importance,
there is a general dearth of paleointensity data, in part because of al lack of
suitable materials. Obtaining data from lavas and archeological materials is
time consuming and the record cannot begin to achieve the time and space density
necessary. Marine sediments are not ideal records because only smoothed and
relative paleointensity data may be obtained. Nonetheless, they could provide
continuous, well data sequences from many areas around the globe. Initial work
on box core sediments are encouraging. Funds are provided to produce relative
paleointensity data from three widespread areas spanning at least the last half
million years. These will be used to assess possible periodicities in
paleointensity and ultimately to assess relative contributions of dipole versus
non- dipole terms. In addition to analyzing Scripps core material, a better
technique for deconvolving long core measurements than is currently available
will be developed.
