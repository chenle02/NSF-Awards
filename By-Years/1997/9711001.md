This study proposes to develop a biophysical index of the status of the eastern
Bering Sea in winter and spring which incorporates characteristics of the
seasonal ice and migratory bird behavior. NSCAT (NASA scatterometer from
satellite) data will be verified with all available satellite, ship, and land
station data for October 1996 to May 1997. Digital analysis of same-day NSCAT
images with AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) images will be made
in a GIS system. The NSCAT data will either verifgy the usefulness of the AVHRR
imagery and add to the detail of ice growth, melt and retreat, or provide a
different source of research data to evaluate the conditions of sea ice.
Detailed maps of the sea ice edge dynamics in spring will assist in studies
aimed at understanding fisheries recruitment processes on the shelf currently
being funded by other agencies. Waterbird distributions evaluated during a
period encompassing fall and spring migration will be incorporated into the GIS
models. Because these opportunities are time sensitive and because the approach
is innovative and exploratory, the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of
limited scope under the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER) program.
