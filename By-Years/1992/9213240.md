This support will enable the completion of the inventorying and computerization
of the type beetle collection at the museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard
University. This collection, one of the foremost in the world, is an essential
resource to the entomological community engaged in systematic, ecological and
biodiversity research and education. This project will make the collection data
accessible in electronic format on diskette or over a network and will
significantly enhance the use of the type collection in research and education.
