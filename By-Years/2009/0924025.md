Heterosis defines the increased vigor displayed by hybrid progeny compared to
the inbred parents. Its molecular basis is not understood, except that genetic
differences between parents are the likely cause. This work addresses the
following hypothesis: "Hybrids suffer regulatory impairment because the parental
contribution to regulatory complexes is mismatched in structure or amount.
Relaxed regulation results in activation of pathways that cause enhanced
growth". To test this hypothesis, RNA abundance, allelic contribution, and
chromatin state will be investigated using hybrids of rice. The objectives are
to: (i) compare the effect of evolutionary distance on parents and hybrid
expression differences and parental expression preference; (ii) correlate
expression changes to promoter activity and changes in repressive chromatin
state, and (iii) examine the effects of hybridity on regulatory networks to
determine if genes associated with growth are targets of hybrid misregulation.
This analysis will entail a novel technology called cDNA-RESCAN to distinguish
parental expression contributions at an effective cost, and will employ a
bioinformatic and computational team for dissection of regulatory hierarchies.

By exploring a specific hypothesis of heterosis, this work will provide
important information on the overall regulatory effect of hybridity. Because the
biological system is rice, the best understood grass genome and globally, the
most important food crop, the acquired knowledge is likely to impact both our
basic understanding of cellular function and the molecular understanding of
pathways that may affect yield in wheat, maize and other critical crops for the
US economy. Educational components of this research will involve training of
undergraduates from local and from under-represented communities. Data will be
made available on the NIH GEO expression database, and the laboratory website
