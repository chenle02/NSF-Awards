A research program for a novel electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) reactor for
dry etching and deposition is proposed. The toroidal ECR reactor (TECR) uses a
unique magnetic geometry which offers great potential benefits; (1) greatly
reduced exposure of the wafer to high- energy photon radiation and associated
wafer heating, (2) uniformity of etching over 8-inch wafers while maintaining
etching rates which are comparable to conventional ECR sources (on the order of
1 micron/minute. (3) the ability to separate the ion composition from that of
the neutral composition striking the wafer, and (4) very directional ion fluxes
that reduce pattern dependencies in the etching of submicron features. The
design permits the separation of the glow discharge from the wafer by using
magnetic field lines to guide the transport of electrons and ions to the wafer.
The etching uniformity across the wafer can be adjusted by trimming the
solenoidal magnetic field, and thus, can be controlled independently of the
process chemistry and discharge kinetics. In Phase I, the basic physics of the
reactor will be modelled, a prototype reactor be designed and engineering
drawings produced.
