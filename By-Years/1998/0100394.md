&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the purchase of instrumentation needed for
genomic DNA analysis at the Center for Marine Genomic Studies of the Mount
Desert Island Biological Laboratory. The two instruments to be purchased are a
second-generation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler with four-
channel fluorescence microplate reader that permits monitoring of reactions in
process, and a robotic microplate processor that allows efficient set up of the
96-well plates used in the PCR device. The instruments will facilitate studies
of the expression and function of genes in marine organisms with particular
emphasis on improving the understanding of physiological processes in relation
to environmental determinants such as salinity and temperature. Four NSF-funded
research projects will make major use of the requested instruments. These focus
on molecular studies of membrane transport proteins and associated enzymes in
the gills of euryhaline teleost fish and of crustaceans. &lt;br/&gt;
