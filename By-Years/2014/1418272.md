This award will support a project to examine population trends across the Arctic
in the past, the present, and into the future, using tools of demographic and
geographic analysis. The project will describe temporal and spatial trends in
the size and composition of the Arctic populations, examine the causes of these
changes, and the implications of these trends for the economies and societies of
the Arctic regions and countries. Three different time periods will be examined,
each using different data and methods and exploring different question. The
three time periods are: The Past, which examines the period from the first
International Polar Year (IPY) in 1882-1883, the time of increased exploration
of the Polar regions and start of intense interaction between the indigenous
peoples of the Arctic and outsiders, to the most recent IPY of 2007-2008; The
Present, which is an analysis of current population trends in the Arctic is
based on data from 2010 round of population censuses and other current
demographic statistics; and The Future, which is an examination of future
population trends in the Arctic that projects out one generation to 2050.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With globalization, climate change, technological
advances, as well as drivers of demographic change, which are occurring
elsewhere in the world, the populations of the Arctic regions are poised to
undergo considerable transformation over the next generation. The project will
result in articles in academic journals, a book, policy briefs and a conference
which brings together researchers, government demographers, and policy makers
from across the Arctic. This project will make these important analyses and data
easily accessible to researchers, community members, and policy makers. By
making these data and analyses easily accessible by these diverse Arctic
stakeholders, the project ensures that future decision making can be based on
actual data and analysis not just perceived trends.
