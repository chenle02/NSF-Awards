The class of planar domains which satisfy an exact Gaussian quadrature for all
integrable harmonic functions was introduced 30 years ago by D.Aharonov and
H.S.Shapiro. These rather rigid sets, with real alegbraic boundary, turned out
to be essential objects of investigation in a variety of problems related to
conformal mapping, fluid mechanics, approximation theory, potential theory,
image processing and operator theory. Top experts in these areas will attend the
conference and will discuss the future directions of research in this broad
area.

The conference will be devoted to a class of planar shapes, called quadrature
domains, which are finitely determined by indirect measurements. They turn out
to be important for applications ranging from inverse problems of geophysics and
fluid flows to tomography. The meeting will be a unique opportunity for young
researchers to meet experts in all adjacent areas and to share ideas and
information about quadrature domains.
