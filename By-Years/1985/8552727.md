This study is seeking means to increase the rate of technological advancement in
the construction industry. Research plans involve analysis and modeling
mechanisms for research and innovation in advancement. Research interests also
include two related topics: means to strengthen the engineering/construction
interface, and designing constructed facilities to support the automation of
construction operations. The project is also investigating constructibility
improvement during conceptual planning and the use of techniques such as
modularization and pre-assembly.
