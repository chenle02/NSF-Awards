The funds will be used to build a new recording system for Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Bottom Hydrophone (OBH) instruments. The
existing recording system has been extensively used for the past 14 years but is
now outmoded. The replacement system was developed with the support of US
Geological Survey and will substantially improve capability of the instruments,
extending their life by 5-10 years. 14 OBH's are planned to be updated and will
be used by a wide oceanographic community.
