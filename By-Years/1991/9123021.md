The focus of this research is the generation and characterization of antibodies
which will catalyze the Oxy-Cope rearrangement, amide hydrolysis and
macrolactonization. The work centers on hapten design and relies on Dr.
Masamune's experience in synthetic organic chemistry. %%% With this renewal
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Saturo
Masamune of the Department of Chemistry of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Professor Masamune will focus his work on the synthesis of molecules
called haptens that are capable of raising antibodies. The antibodies, in turn,
are catalysts for a number of important synthetic organic reactions.
