Dr Holroyd is working on several natural extensions of the percolation model in
mathematical probability. These are: entanglement, rigidity, random surfaces,
and percolation on transitive graphs. In the areas of entanglement and rigidity,
Holroyd's previous work provided the first rigorous mathematical treatment of
the subjects, and Holroyd is now pursuing some of the remaining unsolved
problems. For entanglement, Holroyd hopes to answer questions about the sizes of
finite entangled graphs, the effect of boundary conditions, and the value of the
critical probability. For rigidity, Holroyd is investigating the effect of
boundary conditions, and the continuity of the percolation probability. Also,
Holroyd is investigating the appearance of random surfaces in the so-called
plaquette percolation model (which has mathematical connections with
entanglement). Holroyd hopes to answer questions about the values of the
critical probabilities for the appearance of infinite surfaces, and about the
geometry of such surfaces. Finally, Holroyd is studying the percolation model on
general graphs, such as transitive graphs. There has been much recent progress
in this field, but many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Holroyd is
focusing on proving strict inequalities between critical probabilities for
different graphs, and between the critical points for uniqueness and for
percolation. Percolation is a branch of probability theory concerned with the
large-scale properties of infinite collections of independent random objects.
The original motivation for the subject was the study of fluid flow in porous
materials, but the mathematical models which arise have many other applications,
for example in material science, statistical physics, biology and epidemiology.
The models are relatively simple to describe, yet lead to challenging
mathematical problems. Percolation is a well-developed and active area of
mathematical research, boasting hundreds of papers and several books, yet
several of the most fundamental questions remain unanswered. Holroyd's work
focuses on several relatively new extensions of percolation. Two of these,
entanglement and rigidity, have particularly close connections with physical
applications in the science of materials, and have been studied previously by
physicists. Some of Holroyd's earlier work provided the first mathematical
treatment of these two subjects, and Holroyd is now pursuing some of the
remaining unsolved problems in these and other areas.
