Tooth cleaning is important in maintaining tooth and periodontal health, which
when compromised, leads to poor nutritional status as well as cardiovascular and
pulmonary ailments. However, tooth cleaning is not feasible in the very elderly,
and in many disabled individuals, because of a lack of dexterity in manually
positioning a tooth brush within the confines of the oral cavity. The purpose of
this proposal is to develop a flexible and low-weight strip that can generate
ultrasound and to evaluate its use in tooth cleaning.

The scientific and technological impact of this proposal lies in the innovative
techniques used to make inexpensive and flexible ultrasound generating strips
accompanied by the use of coupling gels in order to enable tooth cleaning and
preserve the health of bone supporting the teeth. This proposal will support
characterization of an existing device and enable development of device design
criteria (shape, etc) that will enable its use in ultrasonic tooth cleaning. The
team is in the process of developing thinner strips that can generate the
requisite ultrasonic intensities and frequencies, and developing schematics for
the moderate power - high efficiency electronic switching devices for running
the ultrasound. These solutions will allow the team to generate ultrasound
inexpensively (within the costs of current brush-based electrical cleaning
devices).
