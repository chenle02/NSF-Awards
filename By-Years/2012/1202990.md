The investigators propose to use the naturally occurring isotope beryllium-7,
which is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and has a 53.3-day half-life,
as a tracer for estimating the atmospheric fluxes of a variety of trace elements
to the surface of the Arctic Ocean. They have collected samples of snow, sea
ice, surface waters, and atmospheric aerosols through an international
collaboration concurrent with the preparation of this proposal. This project
provides funding for the analysis of Be-7 and for trace elements including
aluminum, manganese, iron, cupper, zinc, cadmium, and lead. The atmospheric
input of numerous chemical species into the global ocean has been shown to equal
or exceed that from river sources. In the Arctic, several contaminant elements
in particular are dominated by atmospheric sources, with implications for the
Arctic ecosystem and human health. The project will investigate several elements
of interest to the international GEOTRACES program, which is currently
formulating plans for coordinated Arctic work. The project will support a Ph.D.
student who will incorporate these results into his dissertation.
