The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) will join with the National
Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution to bring together teachers,
educators and scientists with a great diversity and richness of experience to
create and disseminate an innovative elementary science program for grades one
through six called Science and Technology for Children (STC). Twelve hands-on,
inquiry-centered units will be produced and disseminated by the project; these
units plus the twelve units the STC project already has produced will constitute
a complete elementary science program for grades one through six. In addition,
16 science readers will be developed to complement the 16 STC units for grades
three through six. School districts will be able to use these materials either
as a complete elementary science program or individually, as a supplement to an
existing science program. These materials will be designed to meet the needs of
elementary school children from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
