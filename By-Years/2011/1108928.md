The award for this project allow further development of the computer code
"Cloudy" to implement a new and powerful analysis technique for emission lines
in active galactic nuclei (AGN), known as Independent Component Analysis. This
will help connect the large array of existing spectroscopic measurements back to
the physical nature of the emitting gas producing the emission lines, and from
there back to the overall nature of the active galactic nucleus itself.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate
students and postdocs in AGN physics and computer code development. Cloudy is
used by hundreds of researchers in astronomy and this award will support
continued development and distribution of this important tool.
