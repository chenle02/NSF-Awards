The award will support the Human BrainMap Database: Workshop I". The support for
this workshop spans several Federal Agencies (Office of Naval Research, National
Institute of Mental Health). The workshop will be held in San Antonio, Texas,
from November 29 through December 2, 1992. The workshop will focus on issues of
functional brain mapping (identifying the locations and computational properties
of the neural populations that orchestrate human behavior) via positron emission
tomography. In particular, issues of database design, standards, interfaces with
computer software as well as data sharing and intellectual property will be
discussed. This activity follows recommendations set out by the Institute of
Medicine report: Mapping the Brain. It is anticipated that this will be the
first of two workshops, with an intervening period of testing of specific
software, BrainMap.
