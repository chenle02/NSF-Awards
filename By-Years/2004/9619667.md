Dr. Stephen Taylor and other members of the Chemistry Department at Hope College
are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, eight undergraduate students will
spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in basic research projects drawn
from the traditional areas of chemistry and biochemistry. The projects introduce
students to a variety of laboratory techniques and instrumentation, as well as
provide experience in the selection of a research problem. Communication skills
are emphasized through written and oral presentations. Participants are
recruited from a broad geographic area, as well as from Hope College.
