This project, investigating a spectrum of research topics centered in software
engineering and AI, proposes building a common infrastructure that would enable
expanding the educational program to include the production of high-quality PhD
students and to continue to conduct nationally competitive research.
Additionally, the project seeks expansion in networking expertise. Specific
goals include:&lt;br/&gt; Develop a PhD program in Computer Science,&lt;br/&gt;
Prepare productive research faculty to take on PhD students,&lt;br/&gt; Improve
faculty research, especially research with student co-authors,&lt;br/&gt;
Recruit and retain excellent graduate and undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;
Increase student support, thereby encouraging students to stay in school,
&lt;br/&gt; Increase mentoring and improve tracking of graduate
students,&lt;br/&gt; Improve departmental laboratory and research facilities,
and&lt;br/&gt; Monitor department progress towards the program goals with an
external evaluation team.&lt;br/&gt;Initially the following projects will
directly benefit from the infrastructure proposed:&lt;br/&gt; Software Reuse
Measurement,&lt;br/&gt; Reliability Modeling,&lt;br/&gt; Requirement
Simulation,&lt;br/&gt; Software Performance Engineering,&lt;br/&gt; Real-Time
Secure Processing of Data on Distributed Systems,&lt;br/&gt; Advanced Knowledge
Acquisition and Dissemination, and&lt;br/&gt; Fault-
Tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;Educational and outreach activities involve faculty
development, mentoring, curricular changes, and active recruitment. A PhD
program in CS at an HBCU should prepare more African American students in CISE
areas and fulfill some of the high demand for minority faculty. At the moment,
no HBCU offers a PhD in CISE areas.&lt;br/&gt;
