Theoretical understanding and development of realistic models for the various
physical processes that occur are required to understand how particles in the
outer regions of the magnetosphere become energized and make their way into the
polar regions to produce the aurora. This project is a continuation of
theoretical and model development research to further study the chaotic
properties of various magnetotail models and the application of these models to
tail energization processes. The project is described in four main areas of
research pertinent to the role of stochastic particle orbits in magnetotail
dynamics and the correct time scale for collisionless resistivity. These include
studies of the irreversible behavior of current sheets and neutral line fields,
the stochasticity of particle orbits, the response of ensembles of charged
particles, diffusion coefficients and their dependence on model parameters, all
directed towards understanding the evolution of particle distributions from the
plasma sheet boundary layer to the central plasma sheet. ***//
