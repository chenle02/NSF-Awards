With this EAGER award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor K.C.
Nicolaou of the Scripps Research Institute to attempt to develop the first
viable catalytic, asymmetric olefin dichlorination. Though clearly of high risk,
success across any of the olefin classes to be investigated in this study, would
represent high reward, with a likely impact on natural product, medicinal,
process and combinatorial chemistry endeavors. The Nicolaou group will explore
complementary organocatalytic and organometallic avenues toward the title
transformation, with cinchona alkaloids among the chiral scaffolds expected to
impart asymmetry, and with both relatively non-polarized alkenes and polarized
alkenes of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl variety to be explored.

If successful, a catalytic asymmetric dichlorination tranformation is expected
to have broad scientific impact, across both academic and industrial settings.
Given the diverse array of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistries to
be explored, students are expected to benefit from this broad synthetic
training. The PI plans to work to include women and chemists from traditionally
underrepresented groups in this research team undertaking.
