One of the fundamental geometric insights of the last hundred years is that
symmetry (broadly interpreted) governs a vast array of phenomena. Even many
seemingly non-geometric objects are amenable to study via symmetry, giving them
a sort of hidden geometry that can be used to study questions that cannot be
answered otherwise. This project will focus on topological aspects of this
symmetry. Here topology refers to the study of large-scale properties of spaces
that are invariant under bending and stretching; for instance, the presence of
high-dimensional holes. The PI and his PhD students will investigate an array of
questions in this area. The PI will also continue his engagement in high school
outreach, conference organization, and expository writing with the aim of
broadening participation in mathematics at a variety of levels. The investigator
will make advances in the study of the topology of mapping class groups,
automorphism groups of free groups, and arithmetic groups with an eye toward
building bridges between objects of study in geometric topology and geometric
group theory on the one hand, and algebraic geometry and representation theory
on the other. The proposed work has four main directions. In the first, the PI
will extend results on stable homology to finite-index subgroups. In the second,
the PI will make advances in the open question when are mapping class groups and
automorphism groups of free groups commensurable to the fundamental group of a
compact Kahler manifold, thus developing a novel connection between groups
arising in geometric topology and in algebraic geometry. In the third, the PI
will prove a version of representation stability for the homology of the Torelli
group. Finally, the PI will clarify the relations between the unstable homology
of arithmetic groups, and the Steinberg representation.
