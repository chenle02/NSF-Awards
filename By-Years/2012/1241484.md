This project is engaging partners from universities, industry and government
agencies to develop and deploy applications and services for ultra-fast
broadband and software defined networks. This nationwide collaboration will
nurture U.S. leadership in next-generation networking. To this end, the project
is creating a neutral forum for partners to discuss guidelines for implementing
next-generation capabilities and interoperability, cataloguing next-generation
applications, disseminating news and best practices, and selecting and
publicizing compelling applications from competitions for an annual 'Best of the
Best' showcase. This project expects to transform people's lives in five
national sectors. First, by accelerating breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing
technologies, this project provides a foundation for private sector investment
and growth. Secondly, this project fosters the next-generation of safer,
smarter, more efficient clean transportation technologies. Thirdly, by
revolutionizing education and workforce learning tools, this project is helping
to create a world-class workforce. By fostering applications that use
information and communication technologies to predict disasters, this project
can also keep Americans safe and cities better prepared. Finally, this project
seeks technologies to shift healthcare paradigms to empower patients through
information and medical knowledge to become an active part of their own care and
to allow medical experts to use data and technology to prevent medical errors,
improve the quality of care, and reduce costs.
