This award will help to support a conference on Paleoclimate and Evolution. The
conference will bring together a large number of scholars with paleontological,
meteorological and anthropological expertise in order to better understand the
interactions between paleoclimates in the Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene and
major developments in primate, specifically hominine, evolution. Particular
attention will be given to attempts to inter-relate the newer dates for
paleoclimatic events with periods of evolutionary significance in human
ancestry. It is hoped that it will be possible to resolve, or at least
crystallize, conflicting hypotheses about the phylogenetic status of earlier
hominines.
