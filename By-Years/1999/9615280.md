ABSTRACT 96-15280 Lindow Non-commensal interactions of epiphytic bacteria with
plants. The surfaces of healthy plants support large populations of bacteria
thought to exist in a completely commmensalistic relationship with plants. These
microbes are believed to passively utilize the nutrients that leak from the
plant as carbon and energy sources. This study aims to provide proof that the
effect of bacteria on the leaf surface is not neutral-that microbial activities
modify the microenvironment in ways that increase the nutrient resources
available for microbial growth. Many epiphytic bacteria produce the plant growth
regulator indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) which alters the availability of nutrients,
presumably by altering the pattern of nutrient exudation from plants, and thus
challenges the dogma that epiphytes exist in a truly commensalistic relationship
with plants. The approach will utilize molecular genetics techniques, looking
for communicating signals in both directions (to the bacteria and to the plant).
