This research project will expand the evidentiary base for our understanding of
the relationship between science and the concept of gender before they are their
relationship were transformed during the nineteenth century. By doing this the
project will also reevaluate the emergence of science as a significant source of
cultural and social authority. Much of the existing historical literature
attributes to the fields of anatomy, physiology, and psychology in the years
before 1800 a cultural power that only developed by fits and starts during the
nineteenth century. Research materials for this project include lecture notes,
correspondence, early printed materials, and municipal records that will be
obtained from university, professional and public archives in Britain and the
Netherlands. Publications likely to result from this project include a monograph
and a sourcebook for university students, which will provide them access to rare
research materials.
