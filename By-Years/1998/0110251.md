Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0110251&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Mikhail Lyubich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference on dynamical
systems at SUNY Stony Brook in 2001&lt;br/&gt;is held in honor of John Milnor
and emphasizes areas of dynamics&lt;br/&gt;close to his own work: holomorphic
dynamics in one and several&lt;br/&gt;variables, non-uniformly hyperbolic
dynamics, fluid dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;geometric function theory and
thermodynamical formalism, related&lt;br/&gt;topics in topology and in
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems are mathematical models of
phenomena that&lt;br/&gt;evolve in time according to deterministic laws. Some
aspects of&lt;br/&gt;this part of mathematics are extremely classical, since
the&lt;br/&gt;differential equations used by Newton to describe motion
under&lt;br/&gt;the force of gravity lead to a dynamical system. Although
these&lt;br/&gt;models are entirely determined by starting conditions and
the&lt;br/&gt;rules for evolution over time, detailed prediction is
difficult&lt;br/&gt;and we are obliged to seek qualitative understanding. Over
the&lt;br/&gt;last twenty-five years much attention has concentrated on
systems&lt;br/&gt;whose evolutionary rule is defined by a polynomial function of
a&lt;br/&gt;complex variable, and on the behavior of these systems as
the&lt;br/&gt;polynomial's coefficients are changed. This class of systems
has&lt;br/&gt;been found to be a universal model in some ways for the
behavior&lt;br/&gt;of families of dynamical behavior depending upon a parameter,
but&lt;br/&gt;despite their simplicity of definition much remains
mysterious&lt;br/&gt;about holomorphic dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;
