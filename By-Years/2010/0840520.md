This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor
Paul B. Hopkins and colleagues Karen Goldberg, Julie Kovacs, James M. Mayer, and
Phillip J. Reid from the University of Washington will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer to support research and education in organometallic chemistry;
models for non-heme iron, cobalt, and manganese enzymes; oxidation reactions;
materials chemistry; chiro-optical properties; as well as studies of hydride and
dihydrogen species. The diffractometer will also be used in outreach activities
involving undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Washington,
Spelman College and California State University, Los
Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.
