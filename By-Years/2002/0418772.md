The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Gregory Herzog. The co-PIs are John Krenos and
Joseph Potenza from Rutgers, Paul Schueler from Raritan Valley Community College
and Diane C. Trainor of Middlesex County Community College. The planning grant
will work towards 1) improvement of a large first-year laboratory course by
adding a research-oriented project carried out in small groups; 2) recruit
students for a second semester research project; 3) match these students with an
active research group; 4) create a new second semester 3-credit course with
research and laboratory components. The project directors will assist students
to find further research opportunities, supervise their final reports, evaluate
the program elements for effectiveness and scale up, and initiate wide ranging
discussions of the results. Student participants will be drawn from the two
community colleges and the undergraduate colleges at Rutgers. Faculty research
mentors will be drawn from several academic units at Rutgers and the University
of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Industrial scientists from
pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey will help to teach the new course.
