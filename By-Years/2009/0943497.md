&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional and back-up
instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research
vessel operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
request includes six items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Sippican
XBT data acquisition card&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
