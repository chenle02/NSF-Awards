A striking effect of some large disasters is that people may organize themselves
voluntarily into a group to respond to the disasters. One such group, the "Cajun
Navy," emerged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and re-emerged in
response to the 2016 Louisiana floods. The Cajun Navy mobilized again to help
with rescues in response to the flooding from Hurricane Harvey; this study seeks
to study that mobilization and activity. This research promises two important
impacts. First, it will provide valuable information, collected while memories
are fresh and participants are available, into how such unofficial organizations
can emerge and operate in emergency situations. This is likely to be useful to
those involved in emergency management and planning. Second, the development of
the Cajun Navy in response to Harvey is an example of the shift of an
organization from an emergent phase to an expanding phase. This research will
increase understanding of how such transitions can
occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To describe the mobilization and activity of the
Cajun Navy, this study will collect three kinds of data. One is publicly
available data, such as print and web stories, social media, and government
documents. The second is semi-structured interviews with members of the Cajun
Navy. The third is interviews with emergency managers and first responders.
These multiple perspectives will help the study describe accurately both the
activity of the Cajun Navy and the changes in the group. Analysis of the
interview data, in particular, will allow investigation of theoretical questions
concerning organizational development, such as the effects of social networks
and of technology such as social media.
