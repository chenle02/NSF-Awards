This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfield of solute extraction. Professor Echegoyen will study the solution
thermodynamics associated with the extraction of selected isotopes using
naturally occurring and synthetically prepared crown ether ionophores. This
research will use chemically or electrochemically prepared anion radicals or
dianions of anthraquinone substituted crown ether ionophores. Extraction
equilibria involving these species with selected cation isotopes from aqueous
solution will be quantified using atomic absorption spectroscopy and electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results obtained in this research would
have a profound affect on isotope purification processes.
