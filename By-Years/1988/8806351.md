This research will examine the influence of plant architecture on a predator-
prey interactions involving ladybugs and aphids. The hypothesis is that by
altering how searching predators move between plants, plant architecture can
markedly affect the impact of those predators on prey populations. This study is
made possible by the availability of mutant strains of peas that possess
strikingly different architectures. The investigation will include: observations
of individual ladybugs, data collection on how populations of ladybugs
redistribute themselves with respect to patchily dispersed pea aphids, studies
of population change in ladybug-aphid associations over moderate time periods
(3-6 weeks), and the development of behavior-based models that extrapolate
individual behavior to population dynamics. As a bonus, the two ladybug species,
Coccinella septempuncta and Hippodamia variegata, will soon be introduced en
masse to the State of Washington by the USDA. The background information on
their foraging biology that will be obtained should help understand these
"invading organisms" when they are released throughout Washington.
