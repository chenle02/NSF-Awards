Under partial funding from NSF, a workshop is to be held on the topic of small
scale fluid-sediment interactions governing coastal sand transport. The
conference will be in Florida, on March 10-14, 1993, and its title is: "Fluid-
Grain Interactions in Coastal Sand Transport". This specialty conference is
modeled on a prior one on Geophysical Grain Flows in July of 1989, and aims to
bring together an appropriate mix of interdisciplinary investigators. Coastal
sand transport governs coastal erosion during storms, it is of great concern
economically, and remedial measures are still based largely on empiricism rather
than fundamental understanding. The conference is aimed at improving this
situation.
