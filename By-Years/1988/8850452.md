This project will enable twenty-four secondary school mathematics teachers from
Iowa to integrate discrete mathematics into the curriculum. During the summer of
1988, Iowa EESA funds supported a three-week workshop in which the participants
studied graph theory, difference equations, and combinatorics, discussed methods
of teaching these topics, and prepared for inservice sessions that they will
conduct in their own school districts. The NSF award will increase the
effectiveness of the EESA-funded workshop by providing funds for follow-up
activities during the academic year and for evaluation of the project's impact.
These activities will include 2 one-day meetings and a visit to each participant
by the project staff. Evaluation will be based on examinations, site visits, and
reports from the participants. An amount equal to 183% of the NSF award is being
contributed by the University of Iowa and the state as cost-sharing.
