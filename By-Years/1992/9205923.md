Description: This project supports living expenses for four Indian scientists
and graduate students to participate in a multi-institution experiment at Fermi
Laboratory. The experiment E706 is designed to study interactions of protons,
pions and kaons in a variety of targets, triggering on high transverse momentum
(&gt;5 GeV/C) electromagnetic showers. It is a second generation fixed target
experiment using high energy beams (800 GeV protons from Fermilab Tevatron) and
with a wide acceptance spectrometer, it is intended to reach approximately 10
GeV/C. A goal of the experiment is to obtain information on quark and gluon
interactions in collisions of positive pions, negative pions and protons with
nucleons. The Indian scientists participation includes building detectors, data
acquisition and data analysis. Scope: This is a renewal of work currently under
the leadership of Dr. Peoples at Fermilab, Dr. Paul Slattery of the University
of Rochester, and of Dr. R. Shivpuri of the University of Delhi. The
collaboration is considered quite successful, and a number of joint publications
have resulted. The project fits the U.S.- India Cooperative Science Program
objectives.
