This award is made in the Special Projects Program in support of the second
Annual National Symposium on Frontiers of Science, sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences. The symposium brings together 75-85 outstanding young U.S.
scientists to discuss cutting edge research advances and opportunities across a
broad range of disciplines. Chemistry, biology, astronomy, geosciences,
materials science, mathematics and physics will be represented. Science
journalists will also be invited to attend and a science writer will be engaged
to prepare a monograph of the symposium. The central purpose of the symposium is
to foster communication and possible collaborations among the likely future
leaders of U.S. science.
