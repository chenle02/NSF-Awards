Spin systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. They provide a robust
mathematical model for studying complex systems of small interacting particles
and are thus used to tackle central scientific challenges. They originated in
statistical physics, and, in the last few decades, they have gained prominence
in computational biology, machine learning, and theoretical computer science.
This project focuses on the fundamental computational problems that emerge from
the study of spin systems. Specifically, it aims to advance the theoretical
understanding of such problems; this is well-known to improve the performance
and reliability of applications that utilize spin
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the problems of sampling,
learning, and testing, which are among the most frequently encountered
computational tasks in the context of spin systems. The first research direction
of the project concerns the study of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
algorithms for spin systems. These algorithms often rely on heuristics and
empirical approaches to certify convergence, resulting in biased samplers and
unreliable experimental outcomes. As such, the project focuses on the rigorous
analysis of the convergence rates of MCMC algorithms. For this, several
techniques for analyzing Markov chains will be developed or enhanced, addressing
the well-known limitations of the available tools for Markov-chain analysis. The
second direction of the project concerns the two closely related inference
problems of identity testing and structure learning. This project's unified
study of sampling, learning, and testing is novel. It will create essential
connections and blend ideas from machine learning, statistical physics, and
theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
