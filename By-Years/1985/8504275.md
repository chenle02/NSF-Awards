Quality aggregates for pavements are becoming in short supply and new techniques
to evaluate the behavior of these materials is needed. This project will develop
a realistic structural response model for granular pavement layers. The model
will be based on conditions at near failure stress states. Laboratory
experiments will be performed dynamically and the behavior of the pavement
granular layered sections will be studied to correlate the mathematical model.
