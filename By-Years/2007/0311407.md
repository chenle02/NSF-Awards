Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;Computability concepts are at the core of foundational concepts
for computer science, yet many undergraduates obtain only a superficial
understanding of these essential concepts due to the "textual" environment in
which they are usually taught and the lack of hands-on experience except for
paper and pencil exercises. This project enhances learning and improves the
learning experience of computer science students at the University of Houston by
increasing visualization and interaction in a theory of computation course
through adaptation and integration of the popular software tools for visualizing
various models of computation developed at Duke University including JFLAP, Pate
and PumpLemma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secondary goal of the project is to
expose students to current applications of these concepts and give them a
glimpse of the variety of finite automata including tree and DAG (directed
acyclic graph) automata. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts
&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination of the new course materials, including lecture
notes, presentations, problem sets, the adapted tools, and evaluation
instruments will facilitate interaction and visualization in other theory of
computation courses, particularly in departments with scarce resources. The
course materials developed and the visualization tools adapted will be widely
disseminated on the World Wide Web. &lt;br/&gt;
