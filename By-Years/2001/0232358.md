This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
demonstrate an attachment interface for an advanced carbon composite
transmission conductor for electrical power. The attachment will interface with
existing power transmission hardware and techniques. In the project the tasks
will involve reviewing existing techniques for composite cable connections,
possibly from other industries; initial design and analysis of interface
hardware; fabrication of hardware and structural testing; evaluation of test
reults and recommendations for final design including field installation
considerations.

Commercially, the advantages of an advanced carbon composite transmission
conductor are the lower weight and higher power capacity over conventional bare
overhead conductors. The weight savings will allow for a higher packing density
on existing transmission towers. This higher packing density will ease or
eliminate the need for new power transmission right-of-ways, which are difficult
to obtain. The higher power capacity will allow for higher peak power delivery
during power crisis and avoiding power transmission bottlenecks over
conventional conductors.
