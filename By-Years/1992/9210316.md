A Research Initiation Award will support development of an analysis of the
potential failure mechanisms of thin coatings. Three main forms of failure will
be considered: fracture of the coating or substrate or of their interface,
plastic flow in single and multiple loading, and failure by creep induced crack
growth. Interfacial fracture of brittle coatings on brittle substrates will be
modeled using interfacial fracture mechanics. For hard coatings on a ductile
substrate a shakedown limit method will be used to calculate the cyclic plastic
deformation of layered solids under repeated contact loading. In addition,
models will be developed to analyze time dependent crack and void growth in thin
films under high triaxial residual stresses.
