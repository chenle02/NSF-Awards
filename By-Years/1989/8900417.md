This program is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry and Division of
Materials Research as part of the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing
Initiative. Proposed is research on pitting corrosion in copper tubing related
to the presence of biofilms of mixed bacteria on the surface. Biofilms of mixed
bacterial populations excrete a variety of substances at the metal surface which
contribute to the formation of irregularly spaced pits that penetrate the walls
of the tubing. In this research attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
infrared spectrometry (ATR/FT-IR) is used to identify specific biofilm bacteria
species and their adhesive exopolymers which promote deterioration of the
underlying copper and copper/nickel surfaces. A reflectance-absorbance cell will
be designed for the FTIR in order to identify chemical species that accumulate
at the metal surface beneath the biofilm. A spectrochemical approach is used to
determine how the rate of biofilm development and microbial-influenced corrosion
vary as a function of the applied potential. The identity of inorganic reaction
products accumulating in the pits and around specific bacterial colonies will be
confirmed by Auger and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reactions involving the
microbial metabolites and inorganic corrosion products accumulating at the metal
surface will be identified from the experimental results. A better understanding
of these reactions should result in improved measures to combat this form of
corrosion.
