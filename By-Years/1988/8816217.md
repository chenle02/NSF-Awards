Under his previous award, Dr. Laughlin helped establish the correctness of the
theory of the fractional quantum hall effect as it is presently understood and
began the search for other examples of this behavior, particularly in certain
classes of magnets thought to be relevant to high temperature superconductivity.
He made a case that the "resonating valence bond" state of Anderson, insofar as
it is realized in real systems, is really the fractional quantum hall state in
disguise, and that the long-range gauge force between quasiparticles, known in
the quantum hall literature as "fractional statistics," is the root cause of
superconductivity in these materials. He will continue this search with
particular emphasis on the superconductor problem and on finding examples of the
behavior in three dimensions.
