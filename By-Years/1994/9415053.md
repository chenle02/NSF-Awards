9415053 Mosallam The main objective of the research project is to investigate
both theoretically and experimentally the behavior of frame connections for
pultruded fiber reinforced plastics (PFRP) using molded composite connectors.
The focus will be given to the static (short-term &amp; long-term), as well as
the performance of the Universal Connector/PFRP connections under cyclic loads.
