The research goal of this effort is to develop a comprehensive model for the
strategic analysis of materials management within large-scale
production/distribution systems. Such systems encompass the procurement of raw
materials and intermediate products, the processing of these inputs to produce
outputs, and the distribution of the finished product through a distribution
network. The emphasis of this work is on formulation of models and algorithms
which can be sued to predict the performance of a firm with respect to the cost
of products, the lvel of services provided to the firm's customers, and the
responsiveness and flixibility of the production/distribution system. This
project will focus on the interactions between production and distribution
operations in various industrial settings.
