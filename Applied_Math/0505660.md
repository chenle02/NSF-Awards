The investigator uses variational methods to study material damage, with an
emphasis on properties of damaged regions and their time evolution. Examples of
damage include brittle cracks, cracking due to fatigue, and debonding of thin
films. Some discrete-time models for damage evolution exist in the engineering
community, but these are generally ad hoc and not known to correspond to
limiting continuous-time models. The investigator studies the existence of the
limiting models, basic properties of the damage regions, and the justification
for extending numerical methods for static problems to methods for the quasi-
static, continuous-time problems. Damage to materials is of great technological
importance not only because it results in material failure, but also because it
plays an important role in building certain nanostructures, for example by
selectively debonding thin films. The project seeks to greatly improve our
understanding of these materials by improving the mathematical models and
studying basic properties of their solutions, as well as by developing and
justifying numerical methods. Mathematics Ph.D. students are included in the
project, and are trained in the mathematical modeling and analysis of important
interdisciplinary problems.
