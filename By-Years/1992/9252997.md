This project will implement intensive teacher training enhancement for
approximately 2,400 mathematics teachers of pre- algebra, algebra, and geometry
for eighth, ninth and tenth grade students. The teacher training activities,
sponsored by a partnership between the College Board and the National Science
Foundation, will take place at six sites in the United States: Fort Worth,
Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; Nashville, Tennessee; Prince George's County,
Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Jose, California. The NSF-funded
component of the partnership will involve more than 200,000 students and will
involve teachers of these students in a series of four-week summer institutes.
These teacher-oriented institutes will be followed by workshops and seminars in
the academic year subsequent to the respective summer programs. The partners in
this venture will offer new and innovative mathematics curricula for students
that focus on educational equity and design intensive institutes and workshops
for teachers to transmit the new curricula. The principal investigator of this
project is well-qualified academically and has wide experiences in managing
projects of this nature.
