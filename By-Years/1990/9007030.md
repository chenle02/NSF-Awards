The main objectives of the research planned is the analysis of large scale
structured computational problems and of the convergence of parallel iterative
methods for solving linear systems. More specifically: (i) Estimation of
condition numbers of structured maps. (ii) Round-off error analysis of
algorithms specially tailored for solving structured computational problems.
(iii) Applications of these techniques to the solution of large sparse and dense
structured systems of linear equations and integral equations as well as to
other structured computational problems. (iv) Analysis of convergence and
acceleration synchronous and asynchronous iteration algorithms for solving large
sparse systems of linear equations and their implementations on respective SIMD
and MIMD parallel computer architectures.
