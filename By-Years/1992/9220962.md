The biological consequences of increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the
Earth's surface due to the Antarctic Ozone Hole has recently been documented.
Based on direct in situ measurements of ultraviolet radiation and primary
productivity, it was estimated that ozone-related damage to phytoplankton
resulted in a minimum of six to twelve per cent reduction in primary
productivity within the marginal ice zone of the Southern Ocean. This project
will further examine this topic by developing a space and time climatology of
incident and penetrating spectral irradiance for the Southern Ocean. Also, the
magnitude and kinetics of UV dependent production of organic carbon and UV
photodamage will be determined. The data will be examined in the context of a
bio-optical model of primary productivity. Results will contribute significantly
to abilities to predict changes within phytoplankton communities experiencing
enhanced UV radiation and provide an empirical basis for developing models
attempting to assess the consequences for higher trophic levels in the Antarctic
food web.
