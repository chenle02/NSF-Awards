This proposal seeks funds for three goals: (1) to give all science graduates an
opportunity to gain knowledge of lasers and modern optics in a laboratory
setting; (2) to give all physics majors an advanced laboratory experience in
modern optics; (3) to give Engineering-Physics graduates a two-semester course
and laboratory sequence in modern optics. It is planned to achieve the above-
listed goals with five major pieces of equipment: (1) a fiber optics kit; (2) a
pulsed nitrogen dye laser for spectroscopy; (3) a complete optics kit for
interference and Fourier optics study; (4) a holography kit for holographic and
speckle study and; (5) a laser properties package to study the properties of
lasers. //
