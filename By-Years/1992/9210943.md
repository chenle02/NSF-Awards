Trypanosomes are protozoa which cause several types of disease. This proposal is
for the study of a unique type of mitochondrial DNA found in trypanosomes
(kinetoplast DNA) and its interaction with a new type II topoisomerase.
Topoisomerases alter the topology of DNA by causing transient breaks in the
phosphodiester chain and then resealing the chain. The structure of kinetoplast
DNA is very unusual. The mechanism of action of this topoisomerase will be
compared to those of previously described topoisomerases. It is known that
certain drugs used to treat trypanosomal infections interact with this
topoisomerase but not others, causing cleavage of DNA to occur but resealing not
to. Synthetic DNA substrates will be prepared which mimic bent regions in the
kinetoplast DNA, cross- over junctions, minicircles, and enzyme binding site
sequences. These results will be compared to those obtained with natural DNA
substrates. The information obtained will add to our knowledge of how DNA is
packaged and processed in cells. %%% Trypanosomes are parasitic protozoa which
cause sleeping sickness and Chagas' disease. Several drugs are available to
treat these diseases. They apparently function by inhibiting an enzyme called
topoisomerase II, which is found in trypanosomal mitochondria. This enzyme is
involved in DNA replication, and after drug treatment the DNA is cleaved but not
resealed. A variety of approaches using synthetic DNAs with structural features
similar to naturally occurring DNA will be used to determine the mechanism of
action of the enzyme and compare it to other topoisomerases.
