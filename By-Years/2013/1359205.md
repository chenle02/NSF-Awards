This award will establish a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Site at Boston University (BU). The REU program will be offered annually to six
qualified applicants, who will perform cutting-edge research with dedicated
faculty members. The Site will leverage BU?s expertise in studying magnetic
fields at all cosmic scales, in order to impart a deep understanding of the
basics of electromagnetism to the REU students. Student projects will be
selected from topics that will expose undergraduate researchers to magnetic-
field phenomena in the universe and cover topics including solar physics,
auroral and ionospheric physics, and heliospheric science, as well as magnetic
fields on stars, exoplanets, blazars, and clusters of galaxies. Potential
projects will involve both theory and data analysis from space physics missions
and astronomical facilities such as the Discovery Channel
Telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality research experiences to
students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will
contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers.
Participants must come to grips with a large corpus of existing knowledge about
the makeup, origins, and interactions of many types of physical and astronomical
objects. They will also develop the analytical skills (mathematical,
computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary
research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site
also has an active and highly developed strategy to recruit women and
underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training
opportunities to these groups.
