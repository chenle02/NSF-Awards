The proposed Instructional Co-generation Laboratory would expand our
experimental instruction in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer,
electrical generation, data acquisition, and system design. The requested system
includes a gas turbine/generator, a waste heat boiler, a condenser, an
absorption cooler, and a computer data acquisition and control system with
continuous stack gas monitoring. The system will be used to perform a series of
experiments in our Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Technology programs.
In addition to the usual general performance evaluations, the experiments would
include convection and two-phase heat transfer, psychometrics and stack gas
monitoring. Both of our programs include senior project sequences which give the
students experience in engineering design. Much of the engineering design for
the proposed laboratory would be done--with faculty supervision--as projects in
these courses. The completed system would serve about 100 students per year by
providing experimental operation and detailed performance analysis of a modern
co-generation and cooling system.
