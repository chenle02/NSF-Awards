This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Grammati Pantziou, will be working with
Professor Donald Johnson on the implementation of algorithms developed for
idealized parallel computers on real parallel computers. The main thrust of the
research is to investigate load balancing techniques. The hypothesis is that
many of the techniques will be transportable, especially those techniques that
avoid concurrent references to memory.
