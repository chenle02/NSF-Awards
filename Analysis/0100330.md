One of the basic geometric and analytic problems in several complex variables is
to determine when two real submanifolds in multidimensional complex space are
locally biholomorphically equivalent. That is, when is it possible to find a
local invertible holomorphic transformation sending one submanifold onto the
other? This problem has attracted the attention of many mathematicians since the
beginning of the twentieth century, starting with the work of Poincare and
continuing with the major contributions of E. Cartan, Tanaka, Chern, Moser and
others. The principal investigators will continue their research on several
aspects of this problem. In particular, they will focus on determining when it
is possible to reduce the biholomorphic equivalence problem to solving systems
of polynomial equations with complex coefficients. They also plan to determine
when a formal mapping sending a real submanifold into another is necessarily
convergent. In addition, they will attempt to categorize those submanifolds for
which such mappings are determined by finitely many derivatives at a given
point. They expect that this study will lead to the discovery of new geometric,
analytic, as well as algebraic invariants of these submanifolds.

The Principal Investigators will continue their study of fundamental properties
of analytic and geometric objects, such as surfaces and curves, in
multidimensional complex spaces. A complete classification of these mathematical
objects can have important implications for a number of other questions in
mathematical science. In fact, this study is motivated by the rich interplay
between several areas of mathematics and physics, including control theory,
string theory, and other areas of mathematical physics. Progress on the problems
proposed by the Principal Investigators will likely have impact on the above-
mentioned areas as well.
