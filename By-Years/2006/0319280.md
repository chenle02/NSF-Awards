This MRI award provides funds to purchase an ultrafast-pulsed laser and gated
detection system. This integrated system will be used to conduct an extensive
array of light scattering investigations and will greatly enhance the student-
centered research and research-training program at Gustavus Adolphus College.
The research addresses both fundamental scientific questions as well as offering
the very realistic expectation of significant technological application. A new
time-resolved photon correlation spectroscopic (TRPCS) technique will be refined
and its range of applicability explored. This technique will permit the
investigation of particle dynamics in systems that are beyond the concentration
range that can be successfully probed using traditional photon correlation
methods. The student co-investigators will be involved in all phases of the
research, from initial experimental setup through the dissemination of research
results.
