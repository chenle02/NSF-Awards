The nervous system must develop more intricate functional connections between
its cells that any of the other systems of the body. To understand mechanisms
providing such specificity, model subsystems of the brain often are used. The
fruit fly, Drosophila, has large compound eyes that provide an excellent model
for development because classical and molecular genetic analysis can be used,
and certain cell types are easy to identify. Within this compound eyes are
repeating subunits containing eight photoreceptor cells, labelled R1 to R8. The
first one to appear differentiated during normal development is R8, and it is
thought to play a critical role in the subsequent specification of the remaining
7 photoreceptor cells. A mutant has been found that produces a retina aberrant
in pattern, so named "rap" gene, including cloning and sequencing. Results will
clarify how inductive interactions can regulate cellular specificity, and will
have impact on developmental biology as well as neuroscience and visual science.
