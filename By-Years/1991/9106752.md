Common measures of association such as the correlation coefficient need
expanded definitions or reformulations when nonparametric or semiparametric
models replace familiar parametric ones. One expanded definition uses curves to
express these relationships. This research will develop an asymptotic theory of
estimates of such curves. Further extensions to the case of several covariates
will be considered.
