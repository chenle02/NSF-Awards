The objective of this project is to apply available observations to evaluate
whether short-term solar ultraviolet variability (occurring mainly on the ~
27-day solar rotation time scale) can influence tropical climate variability on
time scales from weeks to months. It will specifically explore whether
previously reported evidence for such an influence in the tropical Pacific
sector is indeed robust. Statistical analyses will employ a total of 20 years of
solar ultraviolet radiation measurements under solar maximum conditions when
27-day variations are especially large. Coincident meteorological fields such as
temperature and wind near the troposphere will be analyzed to determine whether
short-term solar ultraviolet forcing can significantly perturb the
stratification of the tropical upper troposphere and thereby modify the
environment condition for deep convections. Associated effects on synoptic and
large-scale circulations will be investigated. The PI will also explore whether
such responses to the 27-day solar depend on season or on the phases of the El-
Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation as well as the stratospheric quasi-biennial
oscillation. The statistical significance of any detected responses will be
assessed using standard methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confirmation of a
significant short-term solar impact on tropical convection and short-time
climate variability would (a) provide a new observation for testing climate
models that include solar forcing; (b) lead to improvements in extended-range
weather forecasting; and (c) improve our understanding of short-time climate
variability. The project will support one graduate student and one undergraduate
student.
