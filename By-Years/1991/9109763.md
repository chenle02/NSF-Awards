Prior work indicates that people are often biased toward omissions. This
proposal examines this bias. One hypothesis is that people ignore the
consequences of inaction and they compare the consequences of action to the
status quo. This research also examines the conditions under which omission bias
occurs, its effect on judgements about public decisions (such as global
warming), its relation to other effects such as the status-quo effect, the sunk-
cost effect and the extra-cost effect; individual differences in omission bias
and related biases, how people might be debiased, i.e., persuaded to ignore the
distinctionh between acts and omissions when it is irrelevant and why they
sometimes resist such persuasion. Questionaires will be given to students,
museum visitors, and citizens who are particularly concerned about the issues
addressed. The results could inform discussions of public policy concerning a
variety of issues, such as environmental risks, valuation of public goods,
vaccinations and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment.
