9322466 NASH This award provides funds for a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site project to involve students in the ongoing study of
contemporary socio-cultural change among the highland Mayan and Mexican national
(ladino or mestizo) communities of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico. The project
director is a seasoned investigator with career-long experience of research in
this area. Eight students will be selected from among applicants in the
undergraduate colleges of the City University of New York and the State
University of New York. Students will be trained in the methods of
anthropological field research. They will be involved in development projects
such as artisan cooperatives, reforestation, cash crop production, tourism,
bilingual education, midwifery, and other initiatives that the Mexican
government is now promoting. In addition to the field research, students will
attend a week of orientation classes, weekly seminars by the project director on
field techniques, and weekly meetings with field workers who are carrying out
research in the region. At the end of the summer, students will be expected to
share research findings with colleagues through publication and translation.
This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences. ***
