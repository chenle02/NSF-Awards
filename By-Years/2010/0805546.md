This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "The Role of
Mobile DNA in the Evolution of Genes and Genomes in an Extremely Diverse
Mammalian Group" for Sarah R. Schaack. The host institution for this research is
University of Texas - Arlington and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Ellen
Pritham and Dr. Cedric Feschotte.

The sequencing of whole genomes has revealed that "typical" genes coding for
essential proteins actually constitute a very small fraction of the genome in
most plants and animals. Instead, a significant proportion of the genome is made
up of transposable elements (TEs), a unique category of DNA that, unlike typical
genes, can move around the genome. Sometimes, however, when TEs move they also
bring along neighboring genes accidentally. This type of hitch-hiking can result
in new gene combinations or duplicate copies when the TE finally inserts into a
new position. Helitrons are a recently discovered group of TEs that are known
for their ability to transport neighboring genes in this way. Recently, they
have been discovered in the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and have been
shown to represent a surprisingly large percent of that genome. This research is
surveying Helitrons and their patterns of mobilization in this and closely-
related species of bats in order to identify potential cases of novel gene
formation or duplication and to understand the role of these TEs in
diversification of these species over long time periods.

Training goals include developing the computational skills necessary to take
advantage of the wealth of data now publicly available as a result of the recent
surge in whole genome sequencing projects. This training will, in turn, be used
to mentor students also interested in discovering more about the role of mobile
DNA in the genome now that its ubiquity is appreciated. In addition, it will
further illuminate the capacity of Helitrons to copy and reshuffle genes in
mammals and shed light on the potential role of Helitrons in the evolution of
the extremely diverse bat lineage.
