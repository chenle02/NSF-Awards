This grant is to study the guided-mode resonance properties of periodic
dielectric structures in waveguide geometry. Theoretical work indicates that
such structures can function as efficient switches and as arbitrarily narrow-
band lossless filters. Both theoretical and experimental work is proposed. The
rigorous coupled- wave theory will be used to study the guided-mode resonance
properties of both bulk and surface-relief grating structures in detail. The
resonances will be characterized with respect to the optical wavelength, grating
thickness, angle of incidence, grating period, bulk permittivity, incident-wave
polarization and permittivity modulation amplitude. Multiple dielectric layer
geometries will be considered and the performance of the guided-mode resonance
filters will be compared with the classical, fundamentally different, Fabry-
Perot filters. The theory will be experimentally tested. For this, bulk- grating
filters will be holographically recorded in a dichromated gelatin waveguide film
on glass and quartz substrates. Surface-relief grating filters will be produced
in yttrium iron garnet waveguides on gadolinium gallium garnet substrates.
Dynamic, turnable filters will be produced by laser-inducing gratings in
photorefractive crystal (GaAs) films. The significance of the research is that
new, fundamental phenomena associated with diffractive structures are being
explained. Many useful applications of this work can be envisioned, including
laser cavity filters, narrow-line mirrors, tunable filters, electro- optic
switches, and enhanced thin-film designs.
