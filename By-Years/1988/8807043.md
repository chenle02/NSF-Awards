This project is concerned with various aspects of artinian rings. In particular,
homological properties and decompositions of modules will be examined. Under the
first heading, the goals are to establish further steps towards a confirmation
of the Nakayama Conjecture and the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture and a
solution to the Cartan Determinant Problem. In the second category, the proposer
aims at the problem of whether the rings, all of whose left modules are direct
sums of finitely generated modules, are of finite representation type. The
research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic structure
having both an addition and a multiplication. These objects arise naturally and
are important in many areas of mathematics and physics.
