A symposium entitled use of Low-Copy Number Nuclear Markers in the Study of
Plant Evolution will be held August 10, 1992, at the 39th annual American
Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) conference in Honolulu, Hawaii in
conjunction with the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. This symposium will
foster interdisciplinary contact among scientists from genetics, agriculture and
plant biology allowing a free flow of ideas on applying the latest available
techniques for advancing the study of phylogenetic and population biology. The
selected speakers represent a broad range of disciplines and should attract a
diverse audience of plant biologists. Six presentations will be made: (1) Dr.
Tim Helentjaris--Use of RFLP and PCR strategies to understand the evolution of
the maize genome; (2) Dr. Paul Keim--Genetic analysis of hybrid plants: biotic
and abiotic factors result in genetically structured populations; (3) Dr. Thomas
Osborn--Evolution of Brassica nuclear genomes; (4) Dr. Loren Rieseberg--Genomic
consequences of diploid hybrid speciation in Helianthus (Asteraceae); (5) Dr.
Barbara Schaal--Minisatellite DNA variation in native plant populations; (6) Dr.
Jonathan Wendel--RFLP diversity in cotton.
