Quantum information processing systems are becoming practical with the
expectation that these systems will soon be commercialized within a decade, and
will be a part of our everyday life. However, our understanding of the amount of
information that can be gleaned from a quantum system is still very rudimentary.
For example, the complexity of the basic question of learning a quantum state
(called tomography) was only resolved in the past few years, whereas its
classical analogue of distribution estimation is now textbook material in any
introductory statistics course. Research under this award will be dedicated to
the study of the problem of estimating fundamental information measures, as well
as introduce new information measures for quantum systems. The project will
establish the fundamental limits of the information processing capabilities of
quantum information systems, as well as design novel algorithms that can match
these limits. The project outcomes can enable the development of efficient
quantum computer and communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will
develop a deeper understanding of a quantum system as a statistical mechanism,
and integrate ideas from various disciplines such as representation theory,
information theory, statistics, and computer science. A novel variation of the
statistical principle of maximum likelihood estimation as a general methodology
for quantum property estimation will be proposed and developed. The project will
also study the extension of representation theory results of Schur-Weyl duality
to higher dimensions to obtain optimal quantum measurement schemes for
properties of multiple quantum systems. The work includes proposing measurement
schemes that are more realistic than the theoretically-optimal ones considered
in the literature that in practice are too complex to be implemented with
existing technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
