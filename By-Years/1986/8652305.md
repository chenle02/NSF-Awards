The Franklin Institute Science Museum, a major American Science Center serving
more than 700,000 individuals annually, proposes to create a 3,700 square foot
permanent exhibition that will promote public interest in and understanding of
the concepts and principles of mathematics in concrete, tangible form. The
exhibition will consist of five clusters of hands-on devices, interactive
computer programs, models, and text on the themes of Geometry; Symmetry; Chance,
Probability and Randomness; Series, Sequences and Limits; and "Modern Math"--
Fractals, Knots and Braids and Topology. Museum staff will utilize several
mathematicians as advisors and design participants and will develop adjunct
educational materials for use by teachers, students, and family members. They
will disseminate exhibition techniques and content by providing six
collaborating museums with selected copies of exhibit devices and hardware for
their use in developing temporary or permanent mathematics exhibits. Staff of
the six museums will join advisors for a design conference during exhibition
planning, and will provide evaluation reports on their use of the exhibit
materials. Knowledge of mathematics is not only necessary for everyday life; it
is central to public understanding of science and engineering, and a key to
continued participation in science and engineering, and a key to continued
participation in science education in high school and college. Increasing
national interest improvement in the mathematical ability of americans at all
levels, pre-college and college, make this proposed exhibition particularly
timely.
