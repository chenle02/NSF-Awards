Special Teachers for Elementary and Middle School Science and Mathematics The
University of Maryland System, in collaboration with Morgan State University,
Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Prince George's County is designing,
implementing, and evaluating an innovative interdisciplinary program to prepare
teachers who can provide exemplary mathematics and science instruction in
elementary and middle schools. Design and development of the project's course
and field experience components are being guided by the following basic
principles. 1) Teachers should learn science and mathematics through instruction
that models the practices they are being expected to employ during their
teaching careers. 2) Courses and field experiences should integrate science and
mathematics so that teachers will know and can take advantage of the connections
between individual disciplines. 3) Teacher training programs should include
substantial field experiences that engage the prospective teachers in the
genuine research activities of business, industrial or scientific institutions
and the science and mathematics education activities conducted by science
centers, zoos or museums. 4) Teachers should develop their ability to use modern
technologies as standard tools for research and problem solving as well as for
imaginative classroom instruction. 5) Field experiences should be provided in
school settings that enroll children of below average and average ability, as
well as those in gifted and talented programs. 6) Teachers should receive
sustained support during the critical first years of their induction to the
teaching profession. Throughout the five year development period, continual
formative evaluation, research on the process of teacher education, and a
variety of dissemination activities are being conducted to inform others of the
outcomes of this emerging model of teacher preparation.***//
