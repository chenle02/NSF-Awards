This scholarship project is based at Northern Arizona University, Yuma campus
(NAU-Yuma), a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution. Many of the
students are recruited as a result of the 2+2 partnership which allows students
to being their studies at Arizona Western College (AWC is a community college)
and then seamlessly enroll in upper-division courses at NAU-Yuma. This
partnership provides students with diversified courses of study with day,
evening, and weekend scheduling and shared facilities co-located on AWC's main
campus in Yuma. However, only 7% of the students who complete their two-year
degree transfer to the University; cost is one of the reasons they do not
transfer. Tuition at the University is much higher than the community college
and underserved students, who characteristically have to help support their
families, cannot afford to transfer. Responding to an urgent community and
national need for a scientifically literate, technically competent workforce,
project OASIS (Opportunities to Advance Success In the Sciences) provides
scholarships to a total of 30 upper division academically promising, financially
needy, students majoring in biological or environmental sciences. Students join
a Science Learning Community and receive academic support in chemistry, writing
and statistics skills through faculty mentoring and academic coaches, and
develop individual academic plans with the assistance of a Science Academic
Coordinator. Industry and community internships are strongly encouraged to
provide the students hands-on experience. Students graduate with a degree, a
resume, and strong professional references. Best practices concerning effective
recruitment and support for these students is collected and disseminated to
other programs interested in replicating this model.
