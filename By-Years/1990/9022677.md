This is a Phase II SBIR award on the topic of relief of energy transfer
limitations in electric power networks. The results of Phase I of this award
demonstrated the feasibility of using specially defined "voltage zones" as a
basis for on-line tracking of transmission constraints relative to current
system conditions. In phase II, the Phase I results will be confirmed and
extended in the context of a realistic, large scale, system model. The new
methodology will be reduced to an algorithmic form suitable for on-line
implementation.
