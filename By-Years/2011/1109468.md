This project will provide funds to continue operations of the MEarth facility,
which consists of eight 40cm optical telescopes in Arizona, and to expand the
project with another array of eight identical telescopes in Chile in order to
provide both northern and southern hemisphere sky coverage. The telescopes will
be used to complete a 3-year all-sky survey to search for Earth-sized planets in
the habitable-zones of the 3500 nearest late M-dwarf stars. M-dwarf stars are
selected instead of solar-type stars, because their cooler temperatures, smaller
radii, and lower masses will all lead to easier detections of transiting planets
with less observing time required. Graduate and undergraduate students, and a
postdoctoral research will be funded to participate in the research. In addition
to searching for habitable planets, the project will produce useful data on low-
mass eclipsing binary stars, transiting brown dwarfs and the characterization of
the spin-down rate of fully convective stars. &lt;br/&gt;
