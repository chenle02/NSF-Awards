This Workshop will introduce teachers of secondary school science and
mathematics to recent developments in solid state digital technology and their
application. The logical terminal operation of devices will be emphasized,
rather than their internal physical behavior. The Workshop consists of an
intensive three week course in computer technology beginning with a treatment of
number systems, Boolean algebra, and logic gates and proceeds through the
applications and programming of microprocessors. It will meet daily for three
weeks during the summer of 1990. Each daily session will consist of classroom
lectures and demonstrations followed by "hands-on" experience in the laboratory.
For most of the experiments to be performed, the requisite laboratory equipment
is minimal and inexpensive. A modern logic breadboard contains all the hardware
necessary for most of these experiments in a single package. The Workshop will
use the classroom and laboratory space of the Department of Electrical
Engineering at the University of Louisville, and will be taught by members of
the Electrical Engineering faculty. Participants will receive three semester
hours of credit, with no tuition cost, a stipend and textbook. Forty
participants from Jefferson County and Kentucky, as well as in the counties in
Southern Indiana adjacent to the Louisville area will have this opportunity.
Members of minority groups and women will be encouraged to participate. A series
of follow-on sessions during the 1990-91 Academic Year will be presented to help
the participants with the implementation of the workshop material in their
curricula. Cost sharing will be in the form of monies from school districts and
local industries to provide participants with the single package, modern logic
breadboard. This cost sharing estimated to be $6,480 equals 10% of the NSF
award.
