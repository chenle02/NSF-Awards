This proposal will improve short-term forecasting of equatorial spread-F (ESF)
by the correlative analysis of radar and ionosonde measurements made at Pohnpei,
Micronesia and Christmas Island, Kiribati, two equatorial locations separated by
about 44.5 degrees longitude (about three local solar hours) in the central
Pacific. This proposal addresses prediction of the onset of ESF and the
resulting radio-wave scintillation that can severely impact satellite
communication and navigation systems. It focuses on investigating the
reliability of potential precursors for ESF onset and on the spatial-temporal
coherence of these precursors. These new radar measurements will be of
considerable importance for investigating ESF in support of the Air Force's
upcoming C/NOFS satellite mission, and will provide a valuable new data set for
the space weather research community.
