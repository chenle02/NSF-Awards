This award provides funds to establish a bioological facilities center at the
University of colorado Health Sciences Center. The instrumentation will be used
by a group of interactive investigators from the Departments of Microbiology,
Physiology, Medicine, Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Genetics in
interdisciplinary studies of membrane transport, cell surface antigen
biosynthesis, DNA replication, control of cell division, protein kinases,
regulation of gene expression and nucleic acid and chromosome structure. The
instrumentation and the interactions between investigators will lead to the use
of novel approaches to the solution of biological problems, employing approaches
not commonly used in individual research fields. The investigators are engaged
in meritorious research, are productive, and well-funded.
