ABSTRACT CTS-9424507 PARKER MINNESOTA This research deals with three problems
involving the relation between sediment transport and stream morphology. The
first consists of the pursuit of a morphologic bedload relation for gravel-bed
rivers dominated by alternate bars. A combination of numerical, experimental and
field work will be used to move from a local relation for gravel transport to a
global one that inherently includes that bar structure. The second is concerned
with the formation of fluvially-dominated alluvial fans. Here theory and
experiment are to combined to obtain a mechanistic, predictive model of alluvial
fan structure and evolution from considerations of the individual distributary
channels. The work will be augmented by avaiable field data. The third topic is
cyclic steps. This newly-recognized bedform headcuts and chute-and-pool
topography. Experiments will be combined with theory for a complete explanation
of the form in question.
