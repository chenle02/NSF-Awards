This project develops a new certificate program to provide innovative training
in the high demand area of web technology, including network fundamentals,
client-server architectures, interactive dynamic multimedia human-computer
interfaces and relevant development tools and languages. The program is unique
in its coverage of the complete end-to-end web technology spectrum, from
multimedia user clients to information servers. The project involves a regional
collaborative partnership including a community college, four year colleges and
universities, a public school district, and industries. The objectives are to
develop, implement and evaluate new courses and educational materials, to
develop a program web site to be shared by industry and academia, and to develop
and implement "train the trainer" workshops for faculty. Undergraduate students
are the primary target audience of the newly developed certificate course
offerings. The project also provides professional development opportunities for
college and university faculty, high school faculty and industry representatives
as well as outreach to high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
