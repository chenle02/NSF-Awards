Over the past decade, iterative decoding methods have received a great
&lt;br/&gt;deal of interest due to the astonishing error performances achieved
first by &lt;br/&gt;turbo codes, and more recently by low-density parity check
(LDPC) codes. The&lt;br/&gt;importance of these methods can be best realized by
the fast integration of&lt;br/&gt;turbo codes in several standards and last
year, an LDPC code was first selected&lt;br/&gt;in a standard meeting. Although
this last decision clearly indicates maturity, &lt;br/&gt;several issues remain
problematic in the implementation of LDPC codes, &lt;br/&gt;especially for
moderate lengths, which are required in many communications &lt;br/&gt;systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main problem associated with the implementation of
LDPC codes is related&lt;br/&gt;to the difficulty of evaluating the occurrence
of an error floor, often&lt;br/&gt;too low to be simulated. This research
involves the development of a &lt;br/&gt;postprocessing technique which
eliminates these non MLD errors once they have &lt;br/&gt;been
identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, new decoding methods which
both reduce the number &lt;br/&gt;of iterations and improve the error
performance of current approaches are also&lt;br/&gt;investigated. In addition,
an iterative determination of the low weight profile&lt;br/&gt;of an LDPC code
is proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iterative decoding of codes rich of four-
cycles in their graph representation&lt;br/&gt;has also been shown to perform
well if a sufficiently redundant set of&lt;br/&gt;check sums is used. This
research develops a model to evaluate the number of &lt;br/&gt;redundant check
sums needed for iterative decoding to succeed on a graph with &lt;br/&gt;a
certain proportion of four-cycles. This study is also useful
to&lt;br/&gt;cryptanalyse an iterative attack attack of the long standing
McEliece public &lt;br/&gt;key cryptosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
