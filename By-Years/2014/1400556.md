This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is investigating how
emissions from forests and plants might react on the surfaces of the small
particles in the atmosphere to change their optical properties. These changes
can alter the extent to which the particles absorb or scatter solar radiation,
and influence their impact on climate. The research takes place at an
undergraduate institution and the experiments are being performed by an
undergraduate team of researchers and one local high school science teacher
under the guidance of the Principal Investigator.

The objectives of this research are to: (1) Measure the reactive uptake of
biogenic VOCs on mineral substrates; (2) Quantify the impact of ?atmospheric
processing? on BVOC uptake by mineral interfaces; (3) Investigate the
heterogeneous oxidation of surface adsorbed BVOCs; and (4) Quantify the impact
of BVOCs on the climate-relevant properties of mineral aerosol. The results of
this research are useful for improving models of the formation and impact of
secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere. This project supports an active
research program in physical atmospheric chemistry for undergraduate students at
Drew University, a small liberal arts college with 1,600 students.
