9710601 Riley In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project, the
proposer will scale-up a novel deformation processing scheme discovered in the
Phase I feasibility research. Commercially viable high-temperature
superconductor (HTS) wire must have high Jc performance and low cost. In the
Phase I feasibility research, the proposer determined the relative and absolute
importance of materials and process hardening on the superconductor performance
and microstructure of Bi-2223 composite tape using a fundamental approach and a
simple conceptual framework. This effort was successful, leading to performance
improvements of up to 40% for multifilamentary composites appropriate for
commercial application. In the proposed Phase II program, the proposer will
scale-up the innovative deformation process scheme to fabricate long and
continuous lengths of Bi-2223 composite with performance superior to that of
conventional Bi-2223 composite. ***
