This project revisits the basic design principle for constructing secure hash
functions, block ciphers, and various important cryptographic primitives which
are built from them, by investigating new types of constructions that are based
on firmer theoretical foundations, and yet are still efficient enough for
practical use. In particular, the project focuses on analyzing and improving the
use of hash functions and block ciphers as message digests, key derivation
functions, message authentication codes, stream ciphers, commitment schemes and
random oracles. Additionally, the investigators study novel modes of operation
to build complex variable-length primitives from simpler, fixed length
components, such as block ciphers and fixed-length compression functions. The
project also examines the feasibility of provably immunizing cryptographic
algorithms and standards against potentially unknown backdoors. Finally, the
project builds firmer foundations for analyzing cryptographic schemes in the
idealized security models, such as the random oracle and the ideal cipher
models.

The project aims to yield more secure hash functions and block ciphers, and more
secure and/or efficient usage of hash functions and block ciphers in important
cryptographic applications. Besides advancing the theory of cryptography, this
project also impacts the real-world design of secure systems, by suggesting more
sound use of various cryptographic building blocks for such applications. The PI
regularly teaches courses in cryptography and network security, and is actively
incorporating the new results into the courses he teaches. In addition, the
proposal has a significant graduate student and postdoc training component.
