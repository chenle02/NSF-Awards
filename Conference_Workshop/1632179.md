This award will support the UNCG Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference
annually for three years, beginning in November of 2016. The main goal of the
University of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG) Regional Mathematics and
Statistics Conference is to provide a venue for students at all levels to share
and experience research in the field of mathematics and statistics. The
opportunity for personal interaction among students and, between students and
faculty is a hallmark of our conference. These interactions enhance the research
infrastructure and are essential for the success of student research and for
training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, due to
the funding of NSF the principal investigators will be able to focus support on
those currently underrepresented in mathematical research. Students from
underrepresented groups accounted for about half of the supported participants
in prior years.

This conference started as an annual undergraduate student conference in 2005
and has now expanded to include graduate researchers since 2009. The research
sessions concentrate on topics in statistics, mathematical biology, graph
theory, and computational biology but are open to other topics as well. The
conference will entail a faculty development workshop to provide training for
faculty to increase their effectiveness at mentoring undergraduate researchers.
The conference has established a tradition of attracting active student
researchers and their faculty mentors from North Carolina and Virginia. The NSF
support will allow the conference to attract participants from the entire
Southeastern Atlantic region. The conference website is:
