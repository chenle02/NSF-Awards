A 5-year program is outlined to use GOES-5, -6, and -7 geosynchronous magnetic
field observations to determine the characteristics of the solar wind-
magnetosphere interaction. A linear prediction filter analysis of the dayside
magnetospheric magnetic field strength will determine the time scales and lags
associated with the response to variations in the north-south component of the
IMF, the IMF cone angle, and the solar wind dynamic pressure. A Fourier
decomposition of the geosynchronous magnetic field observations will determine
the effects of these solar wind parameters upon the diurnal variation of the
magnetospheric magnetic field. We will use the results so obtained to
discriminate between several suggested modes for solar wind- magnetosphere
interaction and to extend models for the dayside magnetopause to more extreme
values of solar wind parameters. We propose a plan to use variations in the
east-west component of the magnetospheric magnetic field to distinguish between
component and antiparallel modes of dayside merging as a function of solar wind
conditions. Finally, we combine solar wind, geosynchronous, and ground
observations to study the effects of north/south IMF turnings and solar wind
dynamic pressure variations upon low- latitude dayside ground magnetograms in an
effort to determine the cause of the enhanced H components seen in low-latitude
ground magnetograms during DP2 convection pattern variations.
