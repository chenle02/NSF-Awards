This is an interinstitutional collaborative project. Combinatorial data
consisting of sequences, trees, and graphs arise in many scientific disciplines.
For example, the primary structure of proteins is a sequence, whereas the
tertiary structure is a graph. Comparing such data to find similarities entails
the use of a "distance metric" that mea sures the difference between two data
items. Numerous distance metrics are possible. This work consists primarily of
(i) inventing efficient ways to compute known distance metrics; (ii) developing
a data structure to decide which of a set of data items is "closest" (according
to a given distance metric) to a new data item; (iii) techniques and s oftware
for discovering patterns with minimum or near-minimum distance to a given set of
data items with respect to a given distance metric; and (iv) software to solve
such discovery problems on networks of occasionally idle workstations. This work
will help every field in which approximate matching is important. Significant
applications are expe cted to molecular biology and rational drug design, as
well as to finding patterns in linguistic strings.
