Title: Collaborative Research: tuning libraries to effectively exploit the
memory hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Misha Kilmer, Tufts
University&lt;br/&gt;co-PIs: David Kaeli and Gene Cooperman, Northeastern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;We propose to improve the
performance of library codes as run on a multi-level memory hierarchy using
three different approaches to optimization. We will target blocking and
preconditioning methods to increase the locality of reference in sparse and
structured matrices. Next we employ cache-conscious data structures to further
improve memory hierarchy utilization. Finally, we perform code and data layout
transformations that effectively remap library to the underlying memory
hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our initial target applications include a
variety of Krylov iterative solvers. While we plan to produce optimized versions
of these library codes, we will also pursue additional classes of libraries. Our
optimizations will address the need to effectively migrate code to new hardware
platforms and exploit the novel architecture features provided on the new
platform. &lt;br/&gt;
