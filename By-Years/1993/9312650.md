This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Gable at Oregon State University to investigate mechanisms and synthetic
applications of organometallic reactions relevant to catalysis. The key question
to be addressed is whether olefins react with only the oxygen of metal oxides in
a concerted fashion or whether an intermediate metallaoxetane is formed. Based
on preliminary data on ethylene, norbornene, and norbornadiene, the initial
systems to be studied are reversible reactions of olefins with various rhenium
oxides. The objective is to determine quantitative structure-reactivity
relationships, which include the thermodynamics, kinetics, isotope effects, and
the Thorton analysis to probe the symmetry of the transition state. These
mechanistic studies will then be extended to other alkene oxidants, in
particular osmium tetraoxide. %%% In this project Professor Gable will
investigate the mechanism of the oxidation reaction of olefins with metal oxides
and thereby provide much needed insight into an area which is of fundamental
importance. The main targets are to develop quantitative structure-reactivity
relationships and probing transition states for rhenium oxides, which studies
will then be extended to other oxidants in the pursuit of new catalysts for
application in high volume industrial processes.
