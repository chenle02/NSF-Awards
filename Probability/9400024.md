This continues research involving limit theorems for real and vector valued
random variables. Problems related to the central limit theorem and the law of
the iterated logarithm motivated by trimming and self-normalizations will be
studied. Limit sets for random samples of processes, as well as coverage
problems will be examined. A primary focus will be to further examine the link
between the small ball problem for Gaussian measures and metric entropy
problems. Empirical processes and precise large deviation probabilities will
also be considered. A central theme in probability, and throughout its diverse
applications to problems in engineering, physics, and statistics, is the study
of limit theorems for partial sums of independent random variables in both
finite and infinite dimensional settings. This research place emphasis on the
infinite dimensional situation and involves a blend of functional analysis and
probability theory. Current work has fallen into several different areas, and
includes small ball and large deviation probabilities for Gaussian measures,
limit sets for random samples and related coverage problems, and Gaussian chaos
applications to multiple Wiener-Ito stochastic integrals.
