This project aims to upgrade the education of chemistry majors and minors at
Shepherd College by providing an infrared spectrophotometer- data station
combination for student use. The computer-controlled equipment will be utilized
by students in Organic Chemistry and in a Computers in Chemistry course, and
will expand substantially the opportunities for undergraduates to conduct
research. In addition, the project will provide an opportunity to introduce
infrared spectroscopy (IR) in local high schools and to teach IR theory and
operation to area high school teachers.
