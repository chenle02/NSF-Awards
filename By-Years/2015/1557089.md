Earlier research by the Principal Investigator introduced the concept of a
"dignity taking," linking the unconsented taking of property rights with the
deprivation of dignity. Seeking to further understand the relationship between
property and dignity, this research project extends the earlier analysis to the
case of squatting. Among other things, the research will help illuminate why
some populations choose to squat instead of pursing alternative accommodations,
and how these risky and illegal actions may enhance or degrade their
dignity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field-based research will focus on a case
study of squatters in Detroit. Methods include semi-structured interviews, focus
group interviews, and photo elicitation interviews. The study will 1) expand
research on property rights, property takings, and squatting; 2) contribute to
and extend scholarly work on legal consciousness; and 3) deepen scholarship on
how and why people navigate illegality.
