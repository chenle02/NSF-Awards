Laminated structures comprised of mostly brittle constituents offer promise in
a wide range of applications of national interest. These include: Hot section
components in aircraft engines, pavement materials for airfields and roads, and
electronic packaging.&lt;br/&gt;A combined fabrication, experimental and
theoretical study of the mechanical properties of bioinspired MEMS
(microelectromechanical systems) composites will be supported under an SGER
award. The results will impact the development of improved synthetic ceramic-
based laminates. The inspiration for this proof-of-concept effort comes from
mollusk shells, which are naturally-occurring ceramic/polymer composites, with a
very high volume content (95-99%) of the ceramic phase, a small quantity of
organic (proteinaceous) "matrix" (1-5%), and which show impressive and unusual
strength, toughness, and hardness.&lt;br/&gt; The microarchitecture of mollusk
shells will be approximated in MEMS structures by alternating layers of silicon
carbide (to imitate the ceramic phase in the shells) and carbon (to imitate the
relatively weak protein interphase). This part of the research not only will
verify that the experimentally-identified shell microarchitectures and
fracture/deformation mechanisms can be utilized to make bioinspired strong,
tough and hard materials, but will also contribute to the development of MEMS
fabrication technology, and to other electronic devices with superior mechanical
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research involves the following
tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Task 1: Fabrication of model brittle matrix
composites with bio-inspired laminated architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; MEMS
technology will be used to design and fabricate a silicon carbide/carbon
composite that mimics the crossed-lamellar structures of the shell of the giant
pink conch, Strombus Gigas. The strength and toughness of this structure will be
measured experimentally to assess how close the biomimetic design is to the
natural design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Task 2: Theoretical modeling of mechanical
response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The interpretation of experimental results, and
determination of the essential features of the natural designs that lead to
optimization of mechanical properties will be supported by micromechanical and
global models to be developed as part of the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
