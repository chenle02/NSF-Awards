The goal of this project is to develop and study a special class of multilevel
methods that combine techniques from the Geometric Multigrid (GMG) and Algebraic
Multigrid (AMG) methodologies, which we refer to as the "single-grid multilevel
method" (SGML). The focus is discretized partial differential equations, for
which detailed information on the underlying geometric grid is generally
available to the user. The research team is designing solvers that use
information from the finest grid (hence termed the single-grid method) to select
a simple and fixed coarsening that allows for explicit control of the overall
grid and operator complexities of the multilevel solver. The central new idea
that we are investigating concerns the design and analysis of algorithms for
adaptive construction of the MG relaxation scheme when used as a smoother. In
contrast to existing AMG methods, in which the smoother is fixed and coarsening
is the key component in the setup phase, SGML will construct the smoother in the
setup phase to complement its simple geometry-based coarsening process. It
should be noted that the algebraic construction of the smoother can also benefit
from using properties of the geometric grid, for example, to obtain a suitable
partitioning of the unknowns in parallel. The SGML approach (together with the
many of the promising algebraic techniques for constructing the MG
interpolations developed over the last decade) is also under consideration. The
PI and co-PIs, though, are focusing on the SGML method because of its ability to
explicitly control complexity, which in turn allows for (nearly) optimal load
balancing and predictable communication patterns, such that the method is well
suited for parallel computing.

Overall, the iterative solvers under development are designed to be implemented
in open source parallel codes and made available to the scientific computing
community. This will provide a computational framework for future algorithm
research and development in related areas as well as powerful tools for
simulation. In summary, the proposed methodology constructs solvers using all
the information available to increase the efficiency of numerical modeling and
simulation of physical phenomena on parallel multi-core computing architectures.
Educational activities include the training of graduate students.
