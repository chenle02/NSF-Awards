Rathjen intends to work on the following four problems and related issues. (1)
Give an ordinal analysis of Pi-1-2 comprehension. (2) Develop strong ordinal
representation systems on the basis of recursively large ordinals in lieu of
their large cardinal analogues. (3) Determine the proof-theoretic strength of
restricted foundations in weak set theories. (4) Is Feferman's theory T-0
together with least fixed point axioms for monotone operators conservative over
T-0 with respect to arithmetic sentences? Proof theory concerns itself with
axiomatic systems and methods of proof within them, particularly with the
relative strength of different systems. The system A is said to be properly
stronger than the system B if every proposition that has a proof in B also has a
proof in A but the converse is not so. The investigator is pursuing a number of
questions along these lines, varying in technical difficulty and degree of
interest to the experts, but none is really susceptible to a brief discussion in
laymen's terms.
