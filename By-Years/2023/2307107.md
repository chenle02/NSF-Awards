Gasses of ultracold atoms can be used to controllably explore physics concepts
relevant in many fields beyond that of atomic physics. This project will explore
time-dependent fluid flow in a new designer quantum system, comprising an
ultracold gas of atoms confined in an “optical box” made entirely of laser
light. The atoms used in these tabletop experiments will be controlled to
attract or repel each other as weakly or as strongly as desired to simulate
exotic quantum systems in nature. Measurements in this system will impact
theories of nearly perfect fluid flow, which existed just after the Big Bang,
and theories of new materials, such as super-high temperature superconductors
that operate far above room temperature. The latter may one day enable energy-
saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. Students and post-doctoral
associates will design new optical systems, new computer control and mechanical
systems, and study electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, broadly training them
for challenges arising in science and technology.

The PI, post-doctoral associate and graduate students will study uniform density
Fermi gases of 6Li atoms, trapped in the “optical box.” A micromirror array will
be used to project a dynamically controlled optical perturbation that creates a
static, sinusoidal density profile. Hydrodynamic transport properties, such as
the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity, will be measured directly from the
time-dependent evolution of the sinusoidal density profile after the
perturbation is extinguished. With controllable density, temperature, spin
composition and interaction strength, these experiments offer new opportunities
to explore concepts that cross interdisciplinary boundaries, including
independent measurement of transport properties in normal and super fluid
strongly interacting quantum fluids and new tests of recent conformal field
theory predictions for interacting scale-invariant systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
