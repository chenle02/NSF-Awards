The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in science and engineering research.
The program provides support to strengthen the research capabilities of
institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments. Eligible
institutions must also have graduate programs in sciences or programs in
engineering. Investigators at Meharry Medical College will use RIMI support to
continue research in hybridoma and flow cytometry technology. Hybridoma
technology permits the development of hybrid cell clones and monoclonal
antibodies while flow cytometry allows the sorting of cells into populations and
subpopulations. This work will lead to the continuing development of a
competitive and productive hybridoma laboratory facility. The hybridoma and flow
cytometry research laboratory is a centralized facility that assists researchers
with the generation, production, and application of hybrid cell products by
providing tissue cultures, media preparation, cell harvesting, and monoclonal
antibody detection. The laboratory will meet the research needs of a productive
institution that educates minority students in cellular and molecular science.
The principal investigator was part of the Meharry team that received earlier
Foundation support to design and establish the hybridoma laboratory. He has
published several articles in refereed journals on cell biology. This RIMI
project will use a hybridoma laboratory facility to encourage more minorities to
select careers in science.
