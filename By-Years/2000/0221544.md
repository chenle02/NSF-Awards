0221544&lt;br/&gt;Drezek&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project leverages recent
advances in nanoparticle technologies to develop innovative contrast agents
which can be optically interrogated using noninvasive approaches and targeted to
specific molecular signatures of disease. The contrast agents proposed -
nanoshells and nanoemitters - possess ideal optical and chemical properties for
optical imaging. The optical response of these particles can be precisely and
systematically varied over a broad band including the visible and infrared
spectral regions. The extremely agile. tunabilityof the optical resonance is
completely unique to nanoshells: in no other molecular or nanoparticle structure
can the resonance of the optical extinction properties be systematically.
designed. Moreover, the nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and proteins
(such as antibodies) are readily conjugated to their surfaces. To develop the
potential of nanoparticles as contrast agents for optical imaging, the
investigators will study a novel class of exogenous contrast agents designed and
optimized to address the clinically important problem of detection of
pre.invasive neoplasias.&lt;br/&gt;
