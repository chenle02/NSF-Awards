Basic research on MeV energy Si, Be, and B implantations will be performed. MeV
energy implantations will be performed at room temperature into semi-insulating
or semi-conducting InP and GaAs substrates in the energy range 1 -20 MeV and
dose range 5 x 1012 - 2 x 1015 cm -2. The effect of tilt from normal axis, and
rotation angle from the major flat, on the shape of the MeV energy as-implanted
SIMS atomic density depth profiles will be studied. SIMS measurements will be
performed on the variable energy Si, Be, and Fe as-implanted samples to find the
four statistical moments of the atomic density depth distributions namely,
projected range (Rp), straggle ( Rp), skewness (y), and kurtosis (B). These four
statistical moments will be used in profile reconstruction using the Pearson IV
distribution. Experimental statistical moments found in our study will be useful
to predict the MeV energy implant profiles required for device and modeling.
