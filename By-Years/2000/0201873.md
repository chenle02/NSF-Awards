In response to the national need for information technology workers with
expertise in information systems security, this project is developing an
associate degree program in computer security and data assurance at Norwalk
Community College. The new program leads students either to immediate employment
or to a related four-year degree at Western Connecticut State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In developing the curriculum, investigators are
examining existing computer security curricula and standards in order to adapt
and build on exemplary resources. The investigators are also introducing a
faculty externship program, which provides faculty members with relevant
workplace experiences so they can better prepare their students for careers in
the computer security field. Although the project's primary audience is two-year
college faculty and students, the goal is to create a computer security career
pathway from secondary schools to two-year colleges and on to universities.
Objectives and activities in the project include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
adapting computer security curricula to create a career pathway from secondary
schools to two-year colleges and four-year universities;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
implementing an externship program for faculty;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* creating
practical lab experiences with a Unix/NT "anti-hackers" lab and teleconferencing
equipment for distance learning;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* utilizing a faculty
externship and student outreach coordinator to administer externship placements
and recruit students for the computer security program;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
disseminating the computer security materials, curriculum, and model throughout
Connecticut; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* hosting an annual cybersecurity
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is guided by an advisory committee
of representatives from business and industry, professional associations in the
computer security field, other colleges and universities, and law
enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;
