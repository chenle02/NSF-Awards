The microcomputer hardware and software provided through this project are
adding versatility to existing laboratory equipment and providing a new
dimension to the science curriculum. It allows for the interfacing of
microcomputers and transducers with existing hardware so that these two-year
college students can perform laboratory experiments with greater rapidity, thus
gaining more time for the interpretation of data, for better data analysis and
for critical evaluation of the experimental designs and scientific methods being
employed. Students are able to pursue independent problems and projects closer
to the true nature of work done in professional scientific laboratories. The
video camera supplements students' individual use of lab microscopes, enabling
the instructor to illustrate important microscopic concepts by projecting
permanent or wet-mount slides so that they may be examined and discussed by all
students at the same time. Life activities of microorganisms also can be
observed simultaneously in the group setting. All the new equipment provides
students with greater opportunities to experience inquiry-centered instruction,
thus helping them to build critical thinking skills. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
