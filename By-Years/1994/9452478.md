The use of Georgraphic Information Systems (GIS) is expanding rapidly throughout
the world, creating an extraordinary demand for professionals well versed in
that technology. The aim of this project is to develop and institute a new and
innovative method for introducing GIS to undergraduate engineering and non-
engineering students. Being developed are a series of GIS laboratory exercises
which maintain a balance between software training, and the conceptual and
intellectual basis for GIS. The laboratory exercises are being produced in a
multimedia format and are available in a CD ROM or compact diskette medium. The
programming strategy used yields a student centered, non-linear approach to
learning and mastering GIS concepts and usage. The courseware developed can also
be used for the initial training of other faculty, and to disseminate project
results. While the major impact of this project involves the civil engineering
curriculum, there is keen interest and support for a new GIS laboratory and it's
attendant innovative method of instruction shown by the College of Arts and
Sciences, and the College of Education.
