Brian Smyth and Frederico Xavier will continue their work on the theory of
complete minimal surfaces. This is a subject where great advances have taken
place in the last decade. These were to a large extent based on the conformal
character of such surfaces. In the current project attention will be focussed on
more general surfaces. Many of the important unresolved problems in this area
depend on an understanding of the analytic properties of the Gauss map. In
particular it is important to investigate which meromorphic functions on the
unit disc arise as Gauss maps of complete minimal surfaces. One of the principal
motivations for this work arises from Efimov's result that any complete surface
in three dimensional space which has negative Gauss curvature must have points
where this curvature is arbitrarily close to zero. This in turn is related to
the conjecture of Caratheodory that every compact surface in three dimensional
space which has positive Gauss curvature must have at least two umbilic points.
Smyth and Xavier have already made substantial progress towards this conjecture
and will continue their efforts in this direction. Other problems which will be
investigated include the question as to whether there are bounded non-compact
complete surfaces with negative Gauss curvature.
