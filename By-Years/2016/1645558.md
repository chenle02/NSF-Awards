The Advanced Accelerator Concepts (AAC) Workshop is a biannual topical meeting
under the auspices of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The
AAC series of workshops is a major forum for the U.S. accelerator physics,
engineering and technology community for the exchange and promulgation of the
most advanced new ideas and concepts over the widest areas of application. An
important part of maintaining this long term mission is the strong participation
of students in the Workshop, where they become a part of the larger community of
experts working for the continued evolution of new and unique accelerator
physics concepts and technologies.

This award will enable student participation for approximately 14 US PhD
students to attend and present the results of their work at the 17th Advanced
Accelerator Concepts Workshop at the Gaylord Hotel and Conference Center,
National Harbor, Maryland from July 31 thru August 5, 2016. This meeting is
expected to attract more than 250 accelerator scientists and engineers. Critical
aspects of a vigorous and productive research community are communication of
progress, stimulation of innovative approaches, and training of students. This
is done in part through conferences and workshops, where the AAC series of
workshops has been a world recognized forum for communication on progress in
accelerator development and innovation bringing together mature scientists, post
docs and graduate students from all over the world.
