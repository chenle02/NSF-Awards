Funding for a new-infrared CD/MCD instrument is requested. Spectroscopic and
magnetic studies of metalloprotein active site will be the focus of the research
undertaken with this instrument. This research will continue the ongoing
research on the electronic and geonetric structure of copper and non-heme iron
active sites. Other researchers will use this instrument to investigate
photosynthetic reaction centers, mixed valence molecular, and conduct chemical
and spectroscopic studies of urease.
