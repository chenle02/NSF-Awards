Colicin E3 is a toxic protein secreted by certain strains of E. coli in order to
eliminate related strains of bacteria living in the same ecological niche.
Colicin E3 carries out three functions: it binds to the BtuB receptor on the
target cell envelope, it is internalized into sensitive cells across their
cytoplasmic membrane, and once inside the cell, it inactivates the protein
biosynthetic machinery of the infected cell by nicking 16S ribosomal RNA between
A1493 and G1494 at the ribosomal A site. The producing organism is immune to the
toxicity of colicin E3 by virtue of an "immunity protein" (IP), which tightly
binds to colicin E3 in a 1:1 complex, and thus renders it inactive.

The goal of this project is to understand the interaction of colicin E3 with
proteins that facilitate its translocation across the outer and inner membranes
of E. coli. The research will focus on the crystal structure determination of
three ternary complexes: (i) colicin E3, IP and a C-terminal fragment of TolA;
(ii) colicin E3, IP and TolB; (iii) colicin E3, IP and the BtuB cell surface
receptor. Another part of this work deals with the dynamic aspects of the
colicin E3 structure by itself and in the presence of either IP or the Tol
proteins or the BtuB receptor. The degree of flexibility, either segmental or
global, will be measured by Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET). The crystal
structure of the colicin E3-IP binary complex suggests the formation of flexible
hinges at the domain junctions in the absence of IP. This will be tested by FRET
experiments. These studies will shed light on the mechanism of action of this
multifunctional protein.
