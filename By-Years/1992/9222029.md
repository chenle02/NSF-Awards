This is a proposal for a collaboration with two outstanding Russian
investigators to study the principal mechanisms of modulation and integration of
neuronal networks involved in the control of feeding behavior in the mollusc
Clione limacina. This preparation serves as a model system for posing general
questions concerning the modulation and control of motor output and behavior by
the central nervous system. The mollusc central nervous system is particularly
favorable for this study because neuronal networks involved in the control of
feeding behavior have been identified. The main idea is that neuronal networks
are not rigidly wired formed by fixed connections between neurons, but are
flexible polyfunctional structures that generate a broad range of motor outputs.
The flexibility of the networks is determined by nervous and hormonal inputs
that modify the properties of neurons and their connecting synapses. The
properties of single neurons, synaptic connections and the feeding network will
be studied by recording the responses of neurons during feeding behavior in the
presence and absence of various neuromodulators found in molluscs.***//
