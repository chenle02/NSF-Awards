Yam is a major source of dietary starch for smallholder farm families in many
tropical and sub-tropical countries. Despite its global importance, use of
modern genomics tools that can facilitate the fundamental understanding of how
to increase yam productivity and nutritional quality has lagged behind that of
other major crops. The overall goal of this project is to address this missed
opportunity and establish robust genetic and genomic resources for yams. The
ultimate beneficiaries of these genome-enabled platforms for crop improvement
are the female farmers who depend on yams for their livelihoods.

This project will develop effective tools for the fundamental understanding and
genetic improvement of yam (Dioscorea rotundata), an important African staple
crop. The specific objectives include (1) establishing an efficient genome
editing platform using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) based site-directed
mutagenesis system; and, (2) producing and characterizing
CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenized yam plants. In addition to providing research training
of postdoctoral associates and students, the project will develop and organize a
two-week study abroad course in cooperation with IITA-Tanzania to provide Iowa
State University undergraduate students practical exposure to the needs and
opportunities in global agricultural research. The project will also provide
short-term laboratory training experience for African female scientists as well
as conduct a focused workshop at the International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA-Kenya) to share the latest transformation developments and
genome editing protocols with African scientists. All genome-enabled resource
for yams, including vectors, methods and plant materials, generated in this
project will be distributed through the Iowa State University Center for Plant
Transformation and IITA-Kenya.
