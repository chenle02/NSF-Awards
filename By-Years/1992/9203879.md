The nature and origin of fluids and digenetic solids in accretionary complexes
can be inferred from geochemical, isotopic and mineralogical studies of
convergent margins. The Barbados Ridge, Peru margin, Nankai Trough and New
Hebrides island arc to be studied in this project are different in structure,
thermal regime, sedimentology and geochemistry. The objective of the project is
to constrain the fluid-rock interactions in these four contrasting settings and
to quantify the flow of water and solutes through the accretionary prism. Fluids
being expelled from such settings play a key role in controlling the
deformational, thermal, and geochemical evolution of these margins. A synthesis
of the fluid systems will be important in planning future ODP drilling in
accretionary wedges.
