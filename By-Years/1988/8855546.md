The purpose of the proposed project is to provide one week of intensive
inservice during the summer of 1989 and follow-up supportive activities to 60
high school mathematics teachers. The goal of the inservice activities is to
prepare the teachers to use a computer and calculator based approach to the
teaching and learning of high school algebra, trigonometry, and analytic
geometry. This approach is consistent with the new Standards for School
Mathematics Curriculum and Evaluation of the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics. The techniques and technology used in the currently funded (Ohio
Board of Regents, British Petroleum of Ohio, and NSF) Ohio State University
Calculator and Computer Precalculus Project (C2PC) are almost directly
applicable to other high school mathematics courses and will be used to focus
the week's inservice activities. Most mathematics teachers have not used an
approach that require them to use computer and/or calculator based graphing to
enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. There is a great need to
provide mathematics teachers inservice supportive of the classroom activities
and the approach to mathematics that is a consequence of the use of technology.
This project has a budget of $103,335 and has cost sharing of 66%.
