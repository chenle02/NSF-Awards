A Significant body of empirical studies indicated that continental-scale
climate anomalies play an important part in determining the variability of the
African climate. One of these decadal-scale climate anomaly regimes concerns the
simultaneous phase reversal, in the precipitation anomaly distribution, between
equatorial and tropical Africa. This continental-scale concurrence happens
despite the fact that the rainy season in each latitudinal band over the
continent comes at different phases of the annual cycle. Clearly, a continental-
scale teleconnection mechanism appears to be involved in the development and
maintenance of these climatic conditions. The PI's solutions obtained form a
steady-state multi-level linear model, indicate that the interaction between the
large-scale African orography and the climatic fluctuations in the basic state
could help to produce the observed teleconnections in the African climate. The
PI will extend his previous investigations by performing a series of numerical
simulations based on the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM). This investigation
will be aimed at two distinct but closely related and complementary objectives
which may be stated as follows. (1) Employ the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) to investigate the observed three-
way connection between the global sea surface temperature (SST), the
continental-scale teleconnections in the African climate, and the regional
Sahelian droughts. The numerical integrations will be based on two versions of
the NCAR GCM, an earlier model designated CCM1, and a new version CCM2, in which
extensive enhancements have been implemented. (2) Introduce and test a new
hypothesis concerning the role of the interaction between the large-scale
orography of Africa and the mean zonal flow in promoting the observed
teleconnections in the African climate. Through this investigation the PI hopes
to clarify some of the important physical mechanisms responsible for the
continental- scale teleconnections in the African climate. In addition this
study will help to assess the relative performances of CCM1 and CCM2 in
simulating the variability of the tropical climate, thus contributing toward
further improvements in the models.
