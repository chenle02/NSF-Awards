This proposal partially supports U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics travel
costs to attend a Doctoral Consortium at the International Symposium on Robotics
Research (ISRR). ISRR, which in 2017 is held in Puerto Varas, Chile, is one of
the oldest and most prestigious symposia on robotics, bringing together top
researchers from around the world to discuss technological breakthroughs and the
roles and status of robotics in society. Supported participants will be able to
present their own research to eminent researchers, receive mentoring from them,
and have opportunities to network with fellow robotics researchers. Special
efforts will be made to include students from under-represented groups and from
institutions with fewer opportunities to participate in such a venue.
