We shall study the dynamics of quasiparticles in the cuprate superconductors,
as revealed by scattering upon photon absorption. Determining the temperature-
and frequency-dependence of these processes should help reveal the nature of the
transition to the sc state, the spectrum of low-energy excitations and the
symmetry of the pairing wave function.
