This project is identifying cognitive and neural mechanisms by which early
numerical learning occurs and using this knowledge to improve numerical skills
in children before entering school. In addition, it is developing and
empirically validating a methodological framework for enhancing early numerical
development. Building on work previously conducted with NSF support, the
investigator is conducting a full-scale, randomized, experimental training study
of the effectiveness of five different PC-based, in-home training interventions
on numeracy in pre-school children. The study has a mixed cross-sectional and
longitudinal research design that will yield both correlational and causal
(quasi-experimental, experimental) evidence.
