This award will support a theoretical project to model neutron star structure
and to explore the consequences for observations of such objects. Neutron stars
are the dead remnants of moderately massive stars, and have extremely high
densities. The main goal of the work is to develop realistic models of the
rotational and crust dynamics of neutron stars, and to explore (1) the
observable effects of superfluid turbulence, (2) the coupling of the crust to
the interior of the neutron star, and (3) how the deep crust responds to shear
stresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Link will also continue his longstanding
efforts to enhance in teaching and training, improve infrastructure for
education and research, and undertake outreach and engagement activities with
the local community. The project is also expected to have an impact in the
theoretical understanding of matter at high density and of nuclear interactions
in conditions not achievable in terrestrial laboratories.
