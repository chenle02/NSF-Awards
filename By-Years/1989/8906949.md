This project investigates algorithmics for parallel computation. There are two
thrusts to this work: 1. The development of a core of parallel algorithmic
design paradigms and the designing of parallel algorithms for problems arising
in major application domains. Prior work in this area is only a first stage and
much remains to be done. This project studies many unresolved issues fundamental
to parallel algorithms from an algorithmic and data structures, along with
probabilistic and randomized algorithms from an algorithmic perspective.
Specific areas for algorithmic research include parallel algorithms for key
problems from computational geometry, pattern recognition, and programming
languages. In this connection, it is crucial to develop fundamental techniques
and design paradigms for parallel algorithms in application areas such as
computer vision, construction of retargetable compilers, molecular biology, and
rewriting systems. 2. The investigation of principles for mapping parallel
models of computation onto parallel architectures. The mapping of parallel
algorithms onto available and emerging technologies has to be better understood
so as to gain new insights into the opportunities and constraints of parallel
computing. On the algorithmic side, this calls for developing general techniques
for coping with problems like synchrony, memory granularity (and memory access,
in general), and communication load.
