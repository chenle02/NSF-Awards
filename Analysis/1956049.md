The goal of this project is to understand the origin of stochasticity in
deterministic systems, with particular attention to extended systems that can be
used to model transport phenomena in physical and biological systems and to
systems whose evolution laws change with time. The principal investigator will
use tools from probability and geometry in order to develop methods to predict
the statistical behavior of complicated systems. The project provides training
for graduate students, and a significant portion of the research will be done in
collaboration with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early-
career mathematicians.

The project consists of four parts: (I) The rate of convergence in the Central
Limit Theorem; (II) Dynamics of systems preserving infinite measure; (III)
Flexibility of statistical properties; and (IV) Transport of random media. The
unifying theme of the project is the interplay between dynamics and probability.
Probabilistic techniques, such as refined limit theorems and coupling, are used
to the study of deterministic systems, and dynamical methods including spectral
properties of transfer operators and renormalization dynamics on the space of
lattices are used to handle probabilistic questions. Results obtained in parts
(I) and (II) will be applied in parts (III) and (IV) of the project.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
