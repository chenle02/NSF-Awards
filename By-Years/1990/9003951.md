This program involves experimental studies of the partitioning of siderophile
and other elements between lithophile phases and silicate melts at pressures
varying from 1 bar to in excess of 200 kbars and temperatures varying from
1300oC to in excess of 2300oC. Knowledge of these partition coefficients is
essential to the interpretation of elemental systematics in the mantle and
mantle- derived materials and specifically bears on the question of the early
differentiation of the Earth. These experiments also bear directly on the
thermodynamics and economic geology of the platinum group elements (PGE). During
the next award period, the P.I.'s (i) continue ultrahigh pressure experiments
between olivine/melt, majorite/melt, and Mg- perovskite/melt phase pairs,
including ultrahigh pressure reversal experiments; (ii) continue the systematic
study of noble melt solubilities in silicate melts and partitioning between
coexisting phases as functions of intensive variables; and (iii) conduct
experiments investigating the partitioning of Ga and Ge between garnet/melt and
clinopyroxene/melt pairs. The results f the experiments will be applied to
understanding the early thermal history and differentiation of the Earth and to
the thermodynamics and economic geology of the PGE.
