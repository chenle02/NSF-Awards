This award provides funds for the investigator to make several research visits
to the Czech Republic to develop further background and understanding of factors
affecting energy policy and regulation there. The particular research focus is
the upgrading of the Temelin nuclear plant. This upgrading is part of the
commitment of Western nations to respond to the legacy in Central and Eastern
Europe (CEE) of unsafe nuclear plants built by the former Soviet Union. The
research will place the Czech experience in the context of nuclear power
development in the CEE, focusing on problems common to these states. The goal is
to increase knowledge about the influence of scientific/bureaucratic elites and
the role of citizen participation. The research will identify the significant
stakeholders, stages in the decision-making process, relevant legislation and
regulations, institutional authority and bureaucratic influence. During these
trips, the investigator will meet with her Czech collaborator. She will
interview representatives of the non-governmental organizations involved in
Temelin, and spend time in Brussels interviewing officials of the European Union
concerning nuclear standards and reviewing documents. The second trip may also
provide an opportunity to work with the European Environmental Bureau or DGXI of
the European Commission. Research findings will be reported in a chapter of a
co-edited volume under production.
