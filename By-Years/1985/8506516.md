Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) equipment is being purchased for measurements of
velocity and turbulence in transparent flowing fluid. There are a number of
research projects involving a variety of fluid flow problems, the understanding
of which is enhanced by LDV equipment. These projects include: fundamental
research related to fluid flow and mixing in metallurgical processing
operations; basic studies of coherent motion in turbulent shear flows; and
examination of the effect of hydrodynamics on corrosion of metals.
