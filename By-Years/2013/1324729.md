IEEE 802.11 is an evolving standard used throughout the Internet. Recent
advances in wireless communication have been incorporated into IEEE 802.11-based
standards. IEEE 802.11n and 802.11ac, for example, offer new mechanisms that
enable a multifold increase in transmission speeds relative to 802.11a/b/g.
Newly available features make configuring a network, and the devices which use
it, a critical challenge. The performance of even the most sophisticated
networks suffer debilitating degradation if the network is improperly
configured. This project is focused on the following questions: 1) What gains
can be achieved by closed-loop 802.11n/ac rate adaptation solutions? 2) How can
IEEE 802.11 features better be utilized in a rate adaptation solution? 3) How
responsive and adaptive should a real-time channel monitoring solution be? and
4) How can the cost of expensive Channel State Information be minimized? By
designing new network configuration mechanisms and observing the performance of
these mechanisms in a wide variety of real-world deployment scenarios, wireless
network performance and robustness are being improved.

As the scale of wireless network deployments grows, the need for effective
network configuration mechanisms is critical. The work in this project is
developing highly flexible protocol enhancements that are adding significant new
performance and robustness capabilities to wireless networks running the newest
IEEE 802.11 standards. Through scientific publications, conference
presentations, and industrial collaborations, the outcomes of this project will
be made available to wireless equipment vendors, thereby achieving tangible
improvements in Internet performance.
