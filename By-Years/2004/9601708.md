This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Boston University to acquire a mass spectrometer.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1)photoinduced electron transfer in synthetic peptide reaction
centers, (2)antifreeze polypeptides and mineral binding polypeptides, (3)T-cell
signalling proteins, (4) test of the feasibility of using estrogen receptor
protein , (5) synthesis of N-bearing aromatic heterocycles, (6) the structure
and mechanism of function of membrane and some other proteins, (7)the isolation
and structure determination of new, biologically active natural products, and
(8) basic iron acetates in catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons and biologically-
related substrates. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
organic,bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique
of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic acid molecular
weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in
combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in
mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
