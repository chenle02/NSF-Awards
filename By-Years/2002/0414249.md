Abstract : Student Travel Support for 6th International Congress on Biology of
Fish&lt;br/&gt;PI: Redding. Institution: Tennessee Technological
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to request funding to support
travel by students and&lt;br/&gt;recent postdoctoral researchers to participate
as presenters at the 6th International&lt;br/&gt;Congress on the Biology of Fish
for August 1-5, 2004 in Manaus, Brazil. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;biennial
series of meetings is to communicate basic knowledge about the cellular
and&lt;br/&gt;organismal physiology of fish and its implications for fish
culture and management of&lt;br/&gt;natural populations. This unique meeting
highlights new research in the biology of fish and how it can be used to address
societal issues such as food production, pollution, global climate change, and
species diversity. The meeting is attended by the top fish physiologists
representing about 40 nations from around the world. Symposia planned include
presentations relating to fish reproduction, growth, nutrition, ion regulation,
development, health, and conservation among other topics. As for previous
Congresses, extended abstracts based on the presentations will be published in
hard-copy for all attendees and in an electronic format available free-of-charge
to the public via the Congress website (www.fishbiologycongress.org). Some
special symposia may be published in primary journals, such as Fish Physiology
and Biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
