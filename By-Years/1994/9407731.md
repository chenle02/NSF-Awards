Hershey Fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) dominates macroconsumer food webs
in most stream ecosystems. However, dissolved organic matter (DOM), thought to
be available only to microconsumers, is often the largest pool of organic matter
present. Dense aggregations of black flies, which often occur at lake outlets an
on bedrock cascades, appear to filter a very large portion of the FPOM entering
the aggregation, but mass of this pool does not decrease as it passes across the
aggregations; it increases. Preliminary data suggest that the FPOM entering
these aggregations is augmented by DOM, via black fly feeding and egestion. The
objectives of the proposed work are: 1) to determine the importance of DOM and
FPOM feeding to FPOM and DOM pools in streams; and 2) to evaluate the role in
black fly feeding. To meet these objectives, a series of upstream and downstream
comparisons, stable isotope and dye tracer experiments, filter-feeder removal
experiments, and laboratory feeding experiments will be used to measure: 1) FPOM
passing through a filter-feeder aggregation, including mass, size distribution
of particles, and chlorophyll concentration; 2) transformation of DOM to FPOM;
and 3) availability of different size fractions (molecular weights) of the DOM
pool to black flies. The same processes that occur in these dense aggregations
could also occur in more diverse stream communities; however, effects would be
harder to detect. Thus, although these experiments focus on special cases, they
may have broad applicability to stream organic matter dynamics.
