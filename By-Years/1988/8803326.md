Drs. Burton Jones, Arnold Klemola, and Robert Hanson at the Lick Observatory,
University of California, Santa Cruz will continue work on the Lick Northern
Proper Motion program. Observatios for the second epoch in this program are
nearly complete, and the emphasis will shift toward plate surveys and
measurements over the next three years. The study of the motions of various
classes of stars is fundamental to an understanding of our Galaxy. Proper
motions provide the observational basis for the study of solar motion, galactic
rotation, and velocity dispersions, and for the statistical determination of
stellar distances and luminosities. The lick Northern Proper Motion program will
meet many of these basic observational needs by providing absolute proper
motions for some 300,000 stars covering the northern two-thirds of the sky.
