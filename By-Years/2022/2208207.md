The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will contribute to the advancement of the US’s competitiveness in
Semiconductor based products, while also enhancing the national defense and
minimizing the electricity requirements of next-generation wireless
communications infrastructure equipment. This project will develop state-of-the-
art Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuit Power Amplifiers (RFIC-PA), Mixers, and
Switches through a leading U.S.-based semiconductor foundry. These innovated
circuits will contribute to modernizing the U.S.’s 5G communications
infrastructure while restoring the country’s prominence in semiconductor-based
technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will significantly enhance the output power and
efficiency of RFIC-PA technologies over the present-day/competing state-of-the-
art products. The RFIC-PA is the most voluminous, costly, and power consumptive
component of emerging 5G macro and small cellular base stations, and the
wireless devices connected to them. For this reason, this project will apply
innovative RFIC-PA design methods at the very forefront of high-efficiency RFIC
design techniques toward the design, fabrication, test, and commercialization of
five discriminating RFIC-PA products at the conclusion of this NSF Phase-2
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
