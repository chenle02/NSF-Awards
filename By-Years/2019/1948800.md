Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributional consequences of trade are manifold
and are at the forefront of major policy debates. There are insufficient
mechanisms to insure against trade losses while preserving the gains for the
winners. Similarly, labor has limited ability to move to the locations, sectors,
and firms that gain from trade. All these factors contribute to inequality as a
result of trade shocks. This project contributes to this debate in three ways.
First, the project develops a quantitative framework to examine the
distributional effects of trade. Second, the project uses this framework to
evaluate the extent to which households can adjust through migration, labor
supply, and self-insurance to changes in trade exposure, and, thus quantify the
welfare effects of trade. Third, the project empirically examines how households
adjust consumption in response to trade shocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project develops a dynamic quantitative framework with incomplete markets,
Ricardian Trade, and frictional labor markets. The framework is calibrated to
match aggregate and difference-in-difference evidence for the US and then study
the transition dynamics of the economy in response to a trade liberalization.
The calibrated model is used as laboratory to answer questions on the aggregate
effects and the heterogeneity in the gains and losses from trade. The
quantitative framework further highlights an open, unstudied issue regarding the
labor-market-induced consumption effects of trade. This project provides new
evidence on these effects by focusing on recent trade policies between 2017 and
2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
