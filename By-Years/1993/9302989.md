Ruan will continue his investigations in operator spaces. This will include the
connection with Banach spaces and the application to C*-algebras and von Neumann
algebras, non-self- adjoint operator algebras, and applications of operator
spaces to quantum groups. The general area of mathematics of this project has
its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be
thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of
operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator
algebra. These abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. For
example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being
used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in
noncommutative geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
