Lipoxygenase is a distinctive non-heme iron dioxygenase. It was first observed
in the seeds of leguminous plants because of its relative abundance there and
its ability to carry out certain easily observed catalytic transformations. In
spite of this, a physiological role for the enzyme from these sources has been
difficult to pinpoint. Evidence that lipoxygenases are involved in two stages of
plant growth and development, germination and senescence, has been recently
presented and the discovery of mammalian lipoxygenases has led in recent years
to a renaissance in investigations of the enzyme. Dr. Funk is trying to
characterize a component structure of the enzyme that is critically related to
its proposed mechanism of action. While non-heme iron is believed to play a key
role in the expression of catalytic activity of lipoxygenase, very little is
known about the binding site for the atom in the protein. The structure of the
iron site will be studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy, a uniquely selective probe
of the electronic environment of metals in proteins. The iron site will also be
investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in order to provide confirmation
of the structural features revealed by other techniques.
