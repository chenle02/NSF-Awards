This award is being used to convene a three-day workshop on the ethics of
geospatial privacy, bringing together experts from the fields of geography,
information technology, law, anthropology, sociology, economics, and philosophy.
The primary focus of this workshop is to develop a curriculum framework for
addressing the ethical issues associated with geocoded data. The workshop is
identifying current and novel methods for teaching information ethics and
assembling relevant resources from an array of disciplines that could have
relevant applications. The goal of this workshop is to create a broad curriculum
for legal, social, and ethical implications for creators and users of geocoded
data, to identify foundational literature upon which the curriculum would be
built, and to create and/or identify relevant instructional tools and teaching
resources that would be incorporated into the curriculum.
