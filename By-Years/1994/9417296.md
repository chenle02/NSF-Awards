9417296 Ogelman The observations of radio pulsars and accreting neutron stars
yield information on the dynamics and structure of neutron stars. The aim of
this proposal is to learn about neutron star structure from observations
pertaining to neutron star dynamics. A dynamical model for radio pulsar
glitches, developed by the PI and collaborators, will be used for fitting the
glitches and postglitch timing data. An evolutionary picture, with young and
older pulsars exhibiting different glitch behavior, will be explored, along with
a statistical study of the distribution of glitch sizes and interglitch
intervals. The radiation of the energy dissipated by internal torgues will be
searched for in X-ray observations of radio pulsars. A comparative study of
luminosity power spectra from different types of accreting neutron stars as well
as timing noise from accretion powered pulsars will be attempted. ***
