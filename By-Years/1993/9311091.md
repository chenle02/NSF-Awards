9311091 Wei This project will study scaling behavior near the metal-insulator
transition in the integer quantum Hall effect. Of interest is length-scale
dependent scaling of universality expressed in the behavior of the fundamental
critical exponent and the overall scaling function. In addition, the relatively
new regime of dynamic scaling will be addressed. The materials used in the
project are InxGa1-xAs heterostructures which have short-ranged background
potential fluctuations and homogeneous transport properties. Experimental
investigations, involving magnetotransport and noise measurements, will be
carried out in the temperature range from 0.05 K to 100 K and in magnetic fields
to 14 T. %%% This project will study the behavior of electrons confined to two
dimensions in semiconductor layers, or heterostructures. The transport
properties of these materials turn out to be extremely complicated and require
low temperatures and high magnetic fields as tools to sort out the phenomena.
The behavior is of fundamental interest and necessary to test recent theories of
the complex behavior. The semiconductor materials present special fabrication
challenges and the results of the experiments are of technological relevance in
materials synthesis and characterization. ***
