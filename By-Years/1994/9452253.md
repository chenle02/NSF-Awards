This project involves a new computerized laboratory that students use in all
psychology courses. This lab engages students in active learning through a new
program of Research Across the Curriculum that parallels the department's
successful Writing Across the Curriculum program. The project also builds on the
revised introductory psychology course. Research experiences are integrated in a
developmental sequence across all four years of the curriculum. Experiments
include computer simulations, data collection, statistical analyses, computer
modeling of psychological processes, computerized psychological tests, on-line
access to scientific information, and graphic analyses. The project has
particularly enabled the department to offer a newly approved year-long
neuroscience laboratory course and innovative research lab components in other
psychology courses.
