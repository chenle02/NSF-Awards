The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division supports Professor Yan Zhao of Iowa State University to study synthetic
molecules made of amphiphilic building blocks. These molecules fold and unfold
cooperatively, mimicking proteins in their conformational change and molecular
binding. Different functionalization of the foldamers makes them soluble in
either nonpolar media or aqueous solutions. Their conformation and molecular
recognition are studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The research aims to advance fundamental
understanding of conformationally mobile supramolecular hosts and enable
chemists to design synthetic hosts with protein-like binding capabilities.

The broader impacts of the project include training students in biomimetic
research, outreaching to underrepresented students and middle-school students
interested in scientific careers, and familiarizing graduate students with
industrial research. Because molecular recognition is at the heart of biology,
the project is expected to impact a number of important fields including enzyme
catalysis, drug development, chemical analysis, and supramolecular chemistry.
