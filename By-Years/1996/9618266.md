9618266 Glotzer The Video Encyclopedia of Physics Demonstrations, previously
funded, is well-regarded for use in high school and middle school physics and
physical science classes. It has been translated into other languages for use in
other countries. There have been requests to provide a Spanish/English edition
to provide Hispanic students a tool to improve their science education, their
scientific literacy, and their language skills. There is evidence that
supporting limited English proficient students with both primary and secondary
language materials increases their academic understanding. Professors and
teachers of physics fluent in Spanish and in English do the intellectual work of
translating narrations and accompanying written materials and supervising the
recording and synchronization of the Spanish narrations. Narrators are chosen by
a committee of Spanish speaking high school and university educators to ensure
that the accents of the narrators are universally understood. Distribution will
be through the Edgroup Publications.
