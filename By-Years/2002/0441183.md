Both fundamental and developmental work will be carried out in the scattering
and attachment of ultralow energy electrons to atoms and molecules. The goal is
to develop within five years a hand-held instrument for detection of nerve
agents and explosives with extremely low false alarm rate. This system is based
on the Wigner s-wave attachment of zero-energy electrons to the terrorist
substances. This system has been demonstrated at JPL/Caltech, and is the basis
of commercial instruments now in production. The fundamental research will be on
the species Cs, CH3I, CD3I, DIMP and DMMP. The developmental work will be in
miniaturizing the charged-particle optics (with minimal loss in space-charge
limited current) and electronics for a handheld system. Also demonstrated will
be the use of a low-power, high current density carbon nanotubes assembly as an
electron-ionizer source. This work is leveraged by similar requirements in NASAs
planetary programs requiring miniature mass spectrometry. The flexible, broadly
applicable hand-held tool will assuredly become a major part of the
infrastructure for protecting against terrorist incursion facilities such as air
and sea cargo containers, air and railroad terminals (personnel and luggage),
nuclear power sites, and border crossings.
