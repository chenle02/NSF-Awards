This research will study stochastic models in mathematical population genetics.
The first set of problems concerns measure- valued diffusion processes that
generalize the usual K-allele diffusion model of population genetics. The
investigator will study the ergodicity of the selective infinitely-many-alleles
model, properties of the two-locus model, and existence of the infinitely-many-
sites model with recombination. The second set of problems relates to Gaussian
diffusion approximations of genetic models with two time scales, and convergence
of an ancestral Markov chain related to the coalescent.
