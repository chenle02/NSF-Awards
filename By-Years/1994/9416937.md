9416937 Sanford This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Sanford's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The focus of the research
is the design and synthesis of substituted 1.1.1 propellanes and their
polymerization to novel rigid-rod polymers. Synthetic targets for the monomers
will be tri-substituted propellanes to enhance polymer solubility, bridged
propellanes to force regiospecificity, and spiro-linked propellanes to make
comb-shaped polymers or induce helical polymer structure. Once made, the use of
rigid-rod polymers in self-assembling systems and as building blocks for
nanotechnology will be explored. Apart from the intrinsic interest in propellane
rigid-rod polymers as novel materials, this award will provide synthetic polymer
experience to undergraduate students which should serve them well either in
graduate school or in industrial careers.
