Henry Kaiser, composer and guitarist, is creating original music inspired by his
being in Antarctica in 2001 under NSF's Antarctic Artists and Writers Program.
Photography and videography collected under this award will add intellectual
merit by helping to establish the context of the music. The music will reach
audiences who may not otherwise be attentive to antarctic research.

An injury obliged Mr. Kaiser to curtail the 2001 visit. His separate work in
Antarctica in 2004 with a research group headed by Samuel S. Bowser, New York
State Department of Health (NSF award OPP-16043), meant he would be in McMurdo
Station, where he needed 4 extra days to complete the music-related work begun
in 2001. The extra time at McMurdo Station for videography is the subject of
this award.
