EEC-9700537 ABSTRACT The award provides funding to West Virginia University
under the direction of Dr. Julio Davalos, for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Advanced Composite Materials
in Civil/Mechanical Engineering Curricula: Combined Analytical, Experimental,
and Computer-aided Approach to Active Learning." The objective of this project
is to develop primarily undergraduate courses in design analysis of advanced
composite materials (ACMs) and hybrid materials for civil/mechanical engineering
students. The instructional program will consist of self-contained modules on
introductory and advanced courses in ACMs, reinforcement of concrete, wood, and
steel.
