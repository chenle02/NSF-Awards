This action funds Adrienne George of the University of South Florida to conduct
a research project, entitled "Cataloguing coral diseases and parasites in
Taiwan," during the summer of 2012 at Biodiversity Research Center, Academia
Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Chaolun Allen Chen.

The intellectual merit lies within identifying the health issues of Taiwan's
coral so that management practices can be implemented to protect one of Taiwan's
most important natural resources. This will be the first comprehensive study to
characterize and identify the coral diseases of Taiwan.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
