CMS-0229020&lt;br/&gt;PI: Keri Moore&lt;br/&gt;Institution: National Academy of
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Geological and Geotechnical Engineering in the New
Millennium: Opportunities for Research and Technological Innovation"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In response to a request from the National Science Foundation, the
National Research&lt;br/&gt;Council will provide advice on future research
directions in geological and geotechnical&lt;br/&gt;engineering. A study will be
conducted by an ad hoc committee under the aegis of the Committee on Geological
and Geotechnical Engineering, a standing committee under the Board on Earth
Sciences and Resources. The study will concentrate on techniques for
characterizing, stabilizing, modeling, and monitoring the subsurface. In
particular, the committee will examine&lt;br/&gt;current technologies and
methodologies and will identify research priorities, opportunities for
interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation, and applications
of information and computer technology advancements.&lt;br/&gt;
