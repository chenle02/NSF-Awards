Physics (13)

This multi-institutional project is developing novel cyberlearning exercises
involving computation for introductory, calculus-based mechanics. The exercises
provide students with rich dynamic setting to gain experience with solving a
wide variety of mechanics problems and build correct physical intuition by using
computation to visualize motion and to model more physically realistic
situations (e.g. visualize 3D motion dynamically and calculate a wide range of
quantities describing the motion). The exercises are also intended to help
students overcome anxieties associated with using computation, thereby
reinforcing the importance of computation as a key tool for solving today's
science and engineering problems.
