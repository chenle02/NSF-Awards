With a few exceptions, the current role of database knowledge is to assist in
the evaluation of data queries. This project applies database knowledge in two
new tasks: knowledge queries and intensional answers. When database knowledge is
of substantial volume and complexity, there is genuine need to interrogate it
directly. Moreover, since users of the database may not be able to distinguish
between information that is data and information that is knowledge, both should
be available for querying, preferably by means of a single instrument that would
blur the distinction. Database knowledge can also be used to characterize the
extensional answers issued by the database. Knowledge statements that apply to
an extensional answer are inferred from the global knowledge and presented as an
intensional answer, thus providing extensional answers with additional meaning
and insight. This project extends the role of knowledge, to provide answers that
contain knowledge, either in response to knowledge queries, or in response to
data queries. As these two topics have much in common, they are investigated
within a common framework, logic databases, to provide a unified solution: a
query language for both data and knowledge, and an answering mechanism that
responds with both data and knowledge. The results of this research are expected
to improve the expressivity of query languages and the meaningfulness of
database responses.
