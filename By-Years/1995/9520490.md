This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Huntley-Fenner
to obtain training in cognitive psychology at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana. A central problem in cognitive science is to discover the
nature of our capacity to organize perceptual input such that it may be stored
and recruited to guide action. There is considerable evidence that infants have
a sophisticated understanding of the physical world. Such capacities implicate
the existence of well-developed physical models. Dr. Huntley-Fenner's research
is directed at the question of whether the physical models infants construct are
based on the properties of objects or whether they are more general. These are
other issues in visual cognition will be addressed during his postdoctoral
tenure. The physical distinction between objects and non-solid substances
reflects a deep conceptual distinction between kinds that are quantified as
individuals (anything that can be counted) and those that are not. Mastery of
this distinction is crucial to our knowledge of language and our capacity to
count.
