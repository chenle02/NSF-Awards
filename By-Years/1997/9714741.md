Through climatological studies of the mesospheric wind latitudinal variation,
the investigator clarifies wave activity coupling from the tropopause to the
mesosphere, and differential forcing of the mesosphere by gravity waves. She
uses one year worth of data, collected from a chain of medium frequency radars
spanning sub-tropical and mid-latitude regions. Her comprehensive study compares
the climatological variability of mesospheric wave activity at each station in
the latitude chain. These compares provide quantitative measures of the
latitudinal variation of wave activity. Simple models, assessed for their
accurate reproduction of the mesospheric wave activity's characteristics,
incorporate wave propagation, saturation and critical layer filtering. Thorsen
is aiding future modeling efforts, by clarifying the dominant mechanisms
controlling wind variance (when observed by radar).
