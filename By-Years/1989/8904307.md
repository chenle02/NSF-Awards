This research examines strategies for the integration and testing of large
software systems. Experiments will be conducted in which modules from large
artificial systems are seeded with defects and then integrated and tested by
several different strategies. Measurements of the effectiveness of these
strategies will be obtained in terms of the percentage of defects detected at
each level of testing and reliability of the completed systems expressed as the
percentage of successful runs when test cases are chosen from several
hypothetical user distributions. The measurements of defect propagation from the
unit level of testing through the systems level should provide quantitative
insight into some of the issues involved in current debates about the value of
isolated unit tests, top-down vs. bottom-up integration, and the selection of
test data and scenarios.
