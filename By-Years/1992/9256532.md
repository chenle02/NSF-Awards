This award to a group including 10 faculty in 4 departments (Applied
Mathematics, Botany, Statistics, Zoology) provides 6 positions for graduate
students enrolled in an interdisciplinary training program in applied
mathematics and biology. The students are to be divided among three areas of
biological research: cell and developmental biology, physiology and morphology,
and ecology and evolution. The progrm will emphasize the role of mathematics in
understanding and guiding experimental observations. As part of its training
activities, the program will offer a new "super-course" that will bring in
distinguished outside faculty to give series of lectures on specialized topics.
