This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a non-
transgenic approach for genetic improvement of crops by using a zinc-finger
nuclease strategy for homologous recombination in plants and a strategy for
selection of non-selectable phenotypes. The commercial application of this
project will be to enable the production of new crop varieties, including those
that better withstand pests, have enhanced food value, and produce compounds of
industrial importance. The proposed approach is expected to produce genetically
modified (GM) plants requiring less regulatory oversight than existing
technologies for plant genetic engineering, facilitating faster and less
expensive marketing of GM plants.
