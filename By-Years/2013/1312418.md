The goal of this collaborative program is to use the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of infrared luminous galaxies to study
galaxy formation and evolution. The SED will allow inference of the physical
conditions in a galaxy such as the role of an active galactic nucleus in heating
the dust. Together with the observed morphology, the program will determine the
mode of star formation, and whether it occurs primarily through galaxy mergers
or by continuous gas accretion onto the galaxy from the intergalactic medium.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students, a
publicly released SED library, and a publicly released galaxy evolution modeling
code.
