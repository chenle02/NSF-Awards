This project designs, develops, pilots, and validates a test, the Calculus
Concept Inventory (CCI), that measures conceptual understanding of the few most
basic principles of differential calculus. Both the framework for the CCI and
its development and validation are rooted in the experience of the Force Concept
Inventory (FCI) in physics. Both tests are based on the most common student
conceptual misunderstandings that block any meaningful ability to understand and
apply the subject. It is essential that schools and faculty have a validated
test to measure whether students leaving calculus have conquered these
misconceptions.

The great intellectual merit is in the use of modern scientific methods to both
develop and validate such an instrument, and the investigators are well versed
in these methods. The FCI has had a dramatic effect in improving physics
education, and is abundantly shown to be able, in a reproducible way, to
document results dramatically better from Interactive-Engagement methodologies
than from standard Lecture-Demonstration approaches. It is very important to
know whether this critically important finding remains valid in calculus (and
other math courses). The CCI is able to do this. Such an instrument is needed in
mathematics. The ability to document convincingly whether a given teaching
methodology really does what it claims to do (in mathematics as well as physics)
has a broad national impact. Without such documentation, decisions on how to
teach are based largely on the personal faith of faculty, and subjective
decisions. A well-validated CCI, which this project provides, gives an
independent and reproducible measure of whether teaching methodology is the
dominant factor for conceptual understanding in calculus that the FCI has shown
it to be in physics. The CCI lends itself to greatly improved teaching of
calculus to thousands of college and high school students and spawn similar
conceptual tests, also needed, in other parts of the math curriculum.
