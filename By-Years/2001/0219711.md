With the rapid emergence of Internet-based techniques and
the&lt;br/&gt;explosive growth of pervasive computing, there will be an
exponential increase of customers accessing information through battery powered
mobile devices. Data access techniques proposed for wired networks may not be
feasible for mobile environments due to the limitations of bandwidth and power.
Therefore, it has become necessary to re-evaluate and possibly redesign data
access strategies to efficiently utilize bandwidth and power considering the
limitations of mobile environments. In single-hop mobile environments, the
research will address the issues associated with broadcasting and caching
techniques, i.e., the energy consumption issue, the query latency issue, the
bandwidth utilization issue, and the scalability issue. The research in multi-
hop mobile environments concentrates on designing and evaluating cooperative
caching techniques to reduce the bandwidth and power consumption, and to address
scalability, cache consistency, and security issues. A testbed will be used to
evaluate the proposed data access mechanisms in an integrated manner and
evaluate the effects of various techniques on the overall system performance.
The research results will have significant impacts on making pervasive computing
more affordable to the increasing customer demands and more amenable to
commercial, civilian, and military applications.&lt;br/&gt;
