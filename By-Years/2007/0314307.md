An International Symposium on Polymer Brushes: From Synthesis to Functional
Microstructures is being organized in New Orleans, LA during the Spring 2003
National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), March 23-28,2003. This
Polymer Chemistry Division (POLY) sponsored symposium will be devoted
exclusively to polymer brushes and will include sessions on synthesis,
characterization and applications. The topical area of this symposium is an
excellent fit with the current nanotechnology thrust of the National Science
Foundation. Funds will help defray travel costs of young scientists who will be
speaking at this symposium.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
