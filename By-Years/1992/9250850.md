Seniors in electrical engineering and microelectronics courses at San Jose State
University are using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development systems as
a design tool in their digital systems laboratory experience. New laboratory
modules are used in teaching computer organization and digital system
interfacing courses. The FPGA laboratory facilities also support senior student
projects, providing a more interesting learning and teaching environment by
enabling rapid prototyping and concurrent engineering.
