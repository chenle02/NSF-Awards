9550561 Eaton The proposed research would define the effects of metallicity,
extreme stellar evolution and atypical internal rotation on magnetic activity by
studying populations of stars less common than those used previously to define
the relationship of stellar rotation to magnetic activity. Populations being
considered are (1) old metal-poor (population 2) stars (2) rapidly rotating
single giant stars, (3) cool, windy giants and super giants, and (4) large
numbers of nearly constant stars. The immediate impact of this research will be
a better understanding of how magnetic activity varies with convective
properties and rotation of cool stars. Four undergraduate students will
participate in the proposed work. ***
