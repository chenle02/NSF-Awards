9553515 LeBlanc This proposal seeks support for a three week residential, Young
Scholars project in chemical engineering for 40 students entering grades eleven
and twelve. The workshop will be located at the University of Toledo and has
been designed to introduce high school students to career opportunities
available to them in engineering. The workshop will involve a variety of
experiences including laboratory experimentation, hands-on computer instruction,
independent group investigations and field trips. Follow-up activities planned
for the academic year include conducting planned engineering experiments in the
participants' home schools.
