This award supports the research of Professor Grant to work in number theory,
specifically, the theory of Gauss sums. Gauss sums are ubiquitous in number
theory, playing a role in class field theory. The argument of the quadratic
Gauss sum was found by Gauss himself in 1805 after a four-year search. No
progress was made on the arguments of cubic Gauss sums for 170 years, when
Cassels and Mathews related the argument to elliptic functions. Professor Grant
proposes to study the argument of quintic Gauss sums using the arithmetic of
curves of genus 2. Specifically, he plans to apply his previous work on the
arithmetic of curves of genus 2 and their Jacobians. This is research in the
field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it hlas become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
