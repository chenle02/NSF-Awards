9731031 Fulthorpe This award will support a marine seismic reflection program to
examine the interplay of global (eustacy) and local (tectonics, sediment supply
rate and ocean currents) controls responsible for continental margin sediment
deposition and cyclicity. The Canterbury Basin, on the eastern margin of the
South Island of New Zealand, is an excellent location in which to study these
controlling environmental factors. High rates of Neogene sediment supply have
resulted in the preservation of an unusually high frequency (0.5-1 m.y.
periodicity), seismically resolvable record of depositional cyclicity.
Progradation and aggradation have produced depositional sedimentary geometries
with internal structures that are well-preserved and unplaned by erosion. High
resolution multi-channel seismic data will be collected and analyzed during a
field program using the R.V Ewing operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
In addition to basic scientific analysis to be derived from the data, this
research will also be used to plan future drilling by the international Ocean
Drilling Program. ***
