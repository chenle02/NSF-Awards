A conventional scanning electron microscope will be acquired for use in a
multiuser, campus-wide facility at Mississippi State University. The high
resolution achievable with a research-grade scanning electron microscope is
essential to the projects of six major users and six minor users from diverse
disciplines. The former projects deal with the morphology of (1) fossil
ostracods, (2) sensory receptors of water mites, (3) scent organs of moths, (4)
seed coverings, (5) moth sensory organs and organs of host plants, and (6)
fossil and recent diatoms. The projects of the six minor users deal with (1)
intestinal nutrient transport in piglets, (2) particle sizing, (3) fungal
infection of plant tissue, (4) paleomagnetism, (5) fungus and nematode
colonization of roots, and (6) crustacean blood clotting and wound healing.
