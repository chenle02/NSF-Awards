ABSTRACT: 9301992, PI-Rao: This work aims at developing a fuzzy finite element
for the analysis of imprecisely defined systems. The development of the present
methodology starts from the basic concepts of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy arithmetic
and implements suitably defined fuzzy calculus concepts such as differentiation
and integration for the derivation, manipulation and solution of the finite
element equations. The approach is applicable to all types of analyses including
stress analysis , fluid flow and heat transfer. Representative stress analysis
problems involving vaguely defined geometry, material properties, external loads
and boundary conditions will be solved to establish and illustrate the new
procedure. Simple experiments will be conducted to verify some of the results
predicted by the fuzzy methodology. The approach developed will be applicable to
systems which are described in linguistic terms as well as those that are
described by incomplete information.
