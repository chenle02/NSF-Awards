9502705 Hall New optoelectronic structures will be fabricated using a
revolutionary new oxidation technology for aluminum-bearing alloy semiconductors
(the "native" oxide of aluminum-gallium-arsenide (AlGaAs)). The planar waveguide
lenses, buried strip waveguides, and integrated laser sources to be developed
will be useful "building block" components broadly applicable in the further
evolution of OEICs. These components will be applied for the realization of
novel and higher-performance integrated master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA)
devices." Two new optoelectronics/photonics courses will be developed at Notre
Dame by drawing on the PI's background of experiment research in semiconductor
lasers at the University of Illinois, and research on high-power MOPA devices
and new optical techniques for their characterization as a Postdoctoral Fellow
at the Naval Research Laboratory. The aim of the new undergraduate Modern
Photonics laboratory course is to expose seniors to the broad span of photonics
technologies important in today's commercial sector, while introducing them to
current optoelectronics research advances (to be incorporated as special
projects) which promise to be the leading technologies of the future. The
graduate Optoelectronics Devices course will fill an important need in the
curriculum at Notre Dame and serve as a core course to prepare graduate students
to join in the new optoelectronics research efforts. ***
