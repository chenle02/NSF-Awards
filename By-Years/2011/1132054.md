This project will apply theoretical simulations of glacial flow to the
understanding of surface structures on Mars. The Principal Investigator is
currently modifying the computer code TEKTON, which simulates the flow of
elastic materials using the finte-element method. The modifications center on
the addition of a thermal model that allows the medium to have a varying
temperature with depth; heating and cooling mechanisms include radiative heating
by the Sun and the dusty Martian atmosphere, radiative emission from the
surface, and subsurface conduction. Effect of slope and time-variable heating
are also to be included. In this project, the Principal Investigator and an
undergraduate student will analyze the properties of craters showing concentric
crater fill, using images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and use the
resulting data with the improved code to simulate glacial flow in craters. The
goal is to test the hypothesis that concentric crater fill results from the
interaction of converging debris-covered flows, and to connect fill morphology
to the stresses operating on the flow. This project addresses the history of
water on Mars, which is directly related to the possibility of Martian life. The
work involves the participation of an undergraduate student, and the award will
support an early-career, female Principal Investigator.
