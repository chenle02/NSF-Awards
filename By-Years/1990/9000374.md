The contractor will manage the Higher Education Survey System (HES) which is
used to respond to the Government's need for up-to-date information on higher
education not readily available from other sources. The contractor maintains a
panel of 1,100 higher education institutions and conducts up to five "quick
response" surveys a year. These limited-item surveys are done on topics
submitted by the three sponsoring federal agencies (NSF, NEH, and DOE) and cover
issues that relate to their operations. Survey results are used to provide
timely responses to specific high priority, programmatic, policy or
Congressional reporting needs. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
amended (Public Law 81-507, 42 U.S.C. 1962) in Section 3(a)(6) directs the
Foundation "...to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection,
interpretation, and analysis of data on scientific and engineering resources and
to provide a source of information for policy form- ulation by other agencies of
the Federal Government..." Also, Section 2 of Executive Order 10521 charges the
Foundation to "make comprehensive studies and recomen- dations regarding the
Nation's scientific research effort and its resources for scientific activities
involving facilities and scientific personnel..."
