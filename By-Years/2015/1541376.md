As HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College, and its computing and network
infrastructure continue to mature, the College needs to expand available
bandwidth for its science and technology programs. The infrastructure connecting
HACCÃ­s science and technology programs at two physical locations and to the
Internet is limited to 100Mbps. At each of these connection points, HACC is
replacing switch equipment, core routing equipment and the wide area network
(WAN) connection. To support large science datasets and their flow across the
network, HACC must re-architect the network infrastructure and redesign the
virtual local area network (VLAN) architecture. This redesign of the VLAN
architecture supports segmentation of the science and learning programs,
including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Computer Information Systems
(CIS), and allows these programs to be situated on their own 1Gbps VLAN
connections with expanded science and technology classroom connectivity from 100
Mbps to 1Gbps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this project, HACC students
and faculty will have access to online educational materials in one place,
accessible from anywhere, and the ability to learn remotely and use time on
campus efficiently. This project supports the implementation of HACC's science
and technology symposia, current and potential grant-funded projects, service
and research projects and mobile learning course-content production. HACC will
be better able to prepare an educated workforce for Pennsylvania's key
industries, including energy, technology, manufacturing and agribusiness. This
model can be a foundation for HACC's other campuses and other regional
institutions to implement similar projects and programs to support STEM
education.
