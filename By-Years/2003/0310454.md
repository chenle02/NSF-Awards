Chemistry (12) Laboratory experiences in polymer and plastics preparation and
characterization are being introduced into several existing upper-level courses
in chemistry, physics and mechanical engineering. For each discipline,
laboratory materials are being adapted from educational and research literature.
Three instruments for mechanical testing of polymeric materials are located in
different teaching laboratories to allow students multiple exposures to the
theory and techniques of materials testing as seen from different disciplines.
Each laboratory experience integrates a chemistry component, a materials
component, and an environmental component.
