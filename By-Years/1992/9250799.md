The Chemistry Department of Drew University will incorporate a 200 MHz NMR
spectrometer with 1H, 13C and variable temperature capabilities as a major step
in enhancing the chemistry curriculum. Laboratory experiments, including
original ones in catalytic decarbonylation, stereochemistry, and cisplatin
binding, will be introduced to illustrate the use of NMR as an essential tool in
structural analysis, determination of physical measurements, and modern
techniques of data manipulation. Acquisition of this instrument will also have a
significant impact on our program of undergraduate research; student
publications are expected to increase substantially.
