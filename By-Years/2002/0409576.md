This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Understanding the early evolutionary
radiation of placental mammals through dental development, morphology, and
function." Ecologically generalized Cretaceous mammals rapidly evolved into an
array of body sizes and ecologies, following the extinction of non-avian
dinosaurs. Patterns and process of this episode are being investigated using
computer-simulated models based on developmental and ecological principles and a
fossil database from North America (80-50 million years ago). The training
component includes developmental biology, quantitative-analytical methods, and
theoretical modeling.
