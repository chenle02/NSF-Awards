The Physics Department is acquiring instrumentation which provide students in
the Optics Concentration with hands-on exposure to the principles and
application of optical crystallography above and beyond the level normally
discussed in undergraduate optics and solid state physics courses. The
department is purchasing a temperature controlled fluid bath, a polarizing
microscope, crystal models, a high voltage power supply and crystal polishing
equipment. These instruments allow students to grow high quality water-soluble
crystals and to characterize their optical properties. It enables them to
construct and study a Glan-Thompson polarizer, a nonlinear frequency doubler and
an electro-optic modulator. This project is singificant because it brings to the
undergraduate laboratory more extensive exposure to the properties of
birefringent nonlinear and electro-optic crystals. These materials are currently
the object of a great deal study in graduate, government, and industrial
research laboratories. The project enables devices constructed from them at an
earlier stage of their careers. Finally, it serves other institutions through
the publication of student lab experiments which are being developed.
