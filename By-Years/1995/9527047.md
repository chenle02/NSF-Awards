This award supports a study to determine the sequence and chronology of events
that led to the development of the Antarctic ice sheet. A continental-scale ice
sheet probably first developed in East Antarctica close to the Eocene-Oligocene
boundary under temperate climatic conditions. The purpose of this project is to
determine, from landscape analysis (with a numerical chronology), when (and why)
these early temperate conditions gave way to a polar environment in Antarctica.
From previous field work and recent photographic analysis, an extensive relict
landscape (older than 17 million years) with landforms and erosional features
characteristic of temperate glaciation has been delineated. This relict
landscape has been called the Sessrumnir erosion surface and it extends over
three degrees of latitude and covers almost 10,000 km2 in three fault blocks of
the Transantarctic Mountains (Convoy, Dry Valleys, Royal Society). It is on this
relict land surface that data will be collected which record Middle and Early
Miocene glacial history and paleoclimate. The results should allow an
identification of the transition from temperate to polar conditions. This work
will involve landscape analysis, stratigraphy of glacial deposits, and
Argon-40/Argon-39 dating of volaanic ashfalls. Denudation rates will come from
fission-track analyses and from exposure-age analyses of bedrock surfaces and
erratic boulders. The overall results will elucidate the origin and stability of
the polar Antarctic cryosphere.
