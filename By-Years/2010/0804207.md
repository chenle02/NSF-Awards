The PIs are organizing a workshop at the Centre International de Rencontres
Mathematiques in Luminy, September 1-5, 2008 on the subject of Representations
of fundamental groups of surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be organized
around minicourses, covering the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)
Hitchin's connection over Teichmueller spaces, conformal field theory, and the
finite dimensional unitary representations of the mapping class
group;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Positive and tropical geometry of Teichmueller
theory, higher Teichmueller-Thurston theory in the sense of Fock and
Goncharov;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Infinite-dimensional representations of
mapping class groups arising through cluster algebras;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4)
Translation surfaces and moduli spaces of holomorphic quadratic
differentials;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(5) Hyperbolic geometry and 3-dimensional
Lorentzian conformal geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This subject has been
extremely active in recent years, with many connections opening up with
mathematical physics, low-dimensional topology, dynamical systems,
representation theory and algebraic geometry. This conference follows several
conferences in related fields, although this one has a somewhat different focus.
The PIs hope to bring together researchers from different fields, and many
different parts of the world. The format of this conference will be inspired by
that of the American Institute of Mathematics where a related workshop was held
last year.&lt;br/&gt;
