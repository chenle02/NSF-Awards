This project will consider invariants and normal forms of control systems under
feedback, observability transformations, and dynamic feedback. These topics will
be investigated using the method of equivalence, exterior differential systems,
and the theory of infinite pseudogroups. Major improvements of the exact
linearization of Brunovsky's normal form are expected. This project has
immediate applications to nonlinear autopilot design as well as other industrial
processes; increase in computational speed will hopefully overcome flight
problems of aircraft like the Harrier.
