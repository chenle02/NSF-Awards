An integral part of the current effort to completely overhaul the four-year
undergraduate curriculum is the creation of a Virtual Laboratory, which
integrates real-world experimentation, through the design and construction of
electronic and digital systems, with theoretical and simulation-based analyses
of the system being designed. The laboratory experience accomplishes two
important goals: first, it gives the student a feel for working with real
hardware and creates an awareness of the discrepancies between theory and
practice; second, it provides an opportunity for developing intuition that comes
only through practice. The laboratory includes PC equipment for data acquisition
and real-time control, PC-based analysis and simulation capabilities, and
network connections to allow further offline analysis outside of laboratory
hours.
