During the late 1800s the eminent anthropologist, Franz Boas, conducted an
anthropometric survey of nearly 200,000 native North Americans. This is the
largest and most comprehensive set of data ever assembled on North American
Indians. Boas even recorded the genealogical relationships among individuals in
most of the tribal samples. However, no systematic compilation or analysis of
these data has ever been carried out. In their present form the data are of
limited value for research. The goal of this research is: (1) to enter the
information from Boas' study into a computerized data base; (2) to preserve the
data sheets by microfilming; and, (3) to catalog and cross- reference the data
sheets, microfilm, and data base so they will be a useful research tool for
students of human biological variation. These data offer the only opportunity,
with historical depth, for a continent-wide synthesis of anthropometric
variation among North American Indians.
