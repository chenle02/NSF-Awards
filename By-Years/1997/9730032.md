An Intelligent CSCW Workbench: Personalized Analysis and Visualization This is
the first year of a three-year continuing award. The goal of this research is to
develop an intelligent workbench for Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW),
that will be used to explore research issues related to coordinated work.
Promising information analysis and information visualization techniques are used
to address such CSCW problem as: idea convergence difficulty, information
overload, vocabulary difference, increased cognitive demand, and
interface/display problems. Evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of
these technological mixes is carefully performed in lab experiments. The results
of this research will provide insights to designs for human-computer interaction
and collaboration, with possible applications in groupware, digital libraries,
and Internet searches. http://ai.bpa.arizona.edu
