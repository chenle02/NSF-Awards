This project provides the faculty from Maryland Alliance in Information Security
Assurance (MAISA) with the training, education, and laboratory expertise and
equipment needed to create and teach courses in ISA and establish appropriate
program in ISA at undergraduate and graduate level in their respective
universities. Towson University (TU), an NSA CAE since May 2002, has already
developed courses, programs and special labs in ISA at both graduate and
undergraduate level. With the help of this project TU will disseminate its own
experience and specialty in ISA throughout higher education in Maryland. The
workshops are the primary tools for preparing other faculty for implementing ISA
courses and curriculums at their universities. TU faculty is qualified to offer
the workshops and has access to international experts in the field to invite
them to give some of the workshops. The project also funds members of MAISA to
fully develop ISA related courses and programs at their own institution.
