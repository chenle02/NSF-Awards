This project will provide travel funds for 15-20 US-based students to attend the
2018 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER) in Buenos Aires,
Nov 5-8, 2018, and participate in the doctoral consortium. The symposium
features both invited and selected research presentations that focus on robotics
research that has been validated through experimental results. This unique
conference presents the latest advances across various fields of robotics, with
ideas that are not only conceived conceptually but also explored experimentally.
It has a high visibility in the international robotics research community as
well as a high relevance to applications due to its emphasis on experimental
validation. ISER 2018 will provide excellent opportunities for students to learn
about the latest advances across a wide spectrum of robotics research,
development, and applications and to network with seasoned researchers and
practitioners in the worldwide robotics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
