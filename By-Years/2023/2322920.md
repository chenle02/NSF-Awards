In recent years, there has been an explosion of data across virtually all areas
of science and engineering. This has been paired with an increase in the
availability and complexity of statistical and machine-learning methods to
analyze these data. However, a major challenge arises in validating the
resulting models, i.e. in making sure that they capture signal rather than
noise. In this project, the project will develop a new framework to split up a
dataset into two separate parts, so that one part can be used to fit a complex
model, and the remaining part can be used to validate it. Graduate students will
be involved in this project, and the PI will carry out efforts to diversify the
workforce in statistics.

This project explores “data thinning,” a new idea for splitting a dataset
arising from a convolution-closed distribution into two or more independent
components that sum to yield the original dataset. The PI will generalize the
data thinning framework beyond convolution-closed distributions to a much
broader class of distributions, by allowing for a dataset to be thinned into two
or more independent components that can be re-combined to yield the original
dataset via a function other than addition, using principles of sufficiency.
Once two or more independent components have been obtained, a model can be fit
to one component and validated on the other(s). Connections to sample splitting,
data fission, and other related proposals will also be explored. The PI will
also collaborate with biomedical researchers to tailor this framework to data
from diverse domain areas and will release high-quality software. Ultimately,
the data thinning framework will enable rigorous validation and inference after
model fitting for a host of problems in science and engineering. Broader impacts
include the involvement of graduate students in this research, as well as
ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts by the PI.
