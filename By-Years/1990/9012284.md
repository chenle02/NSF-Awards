A workshop/conference concerning the establishment of a national parallel code
repository will allow the scientists involved to exchange ideas and views about
the issues necessary for the successful implementation of such a resource. It
will allow a focal point of well documented and structured, significant code
kernels to be used by scientists and engineers as a starting point in the
development of optimally designed parallel code.
