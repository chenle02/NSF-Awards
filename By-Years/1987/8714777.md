The basic theme of this proposal is the study of control laws in the presence of
many controllers, each one of which has his own objective, the decisions of each
one influence the information and objectives of the others, and where each
controller has noisy measurements and not necessarily the same with those of the
others. The overall system evolves in discrete time. Such problems belong to the
area of Dynamic Stochastic Game Theory. Two types of models are considered. In
the first, the evolution is described by linear discrete time stochastic
difference equations with linear noisy measurements and quadratic costs. In the
second, the evolution is described by a finite dimensions Markov chain in
discrete time with average expected value costs. Control laws which solve these
game problems and have desirable characteristics are sought. Such a study,
besides its own theoretical interest, could be useful in several engineering
economic or military applications.
