Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0236326&lt;br/&gt;Nicolaysen&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is an SGER to support reconnaissance
studies of Mt. Cleveland, a remote, hazardous, and poorly studied volcano in the
Aleutian arc. The PI will sample and analyze the volcano's eruptive products to
determine their age, composition, and origin. Study of this volcano is important
because it may offer unique insight into the generation of magmas at convergent
margins. The ocean floor subducted beneath this volcano contains a fracture
zone, a rare occurrence that will help constrain the contribution of the
subducted slab to magmatism. This volcano is also a hazard to aviation and
erupted last year. This work will aid in hazard assessment. This SGER fulfills
the merit review criteria in terms of intellectual merit and the broader impact
of the research, as the data obtained will help the community at large. The
award also promotes an early-career female scientist.&lt;br/&gt;
