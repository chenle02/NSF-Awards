The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an in vitro, articular cartilage model for osteoarthritis (OA).
This model is designed to increase the likelihood of successful clinical
translation of research on the causes of OA into potential treatments. OA often
occurs with age or injury and affects over 32.5 million US adults. There are
currently no known disease-modifying treatments to stop or reverse the
progression of OA â€“ all current treatments are limited to either various methods
of pain management or surgical tissue replacement. The proposed technology will
advance the translation of OA research by facilitating studies of chondrocytes,
the primary cells that cause OA, using traditional and state-of-the-art genomic,
proteomic, and imaging techniques. It is expected that the proposed technology
will bridge the gap between the 2D and 3D cell culture markets, represented by
an annual market of ~$1 billion in the US. Due to the prevalence and crippling
nature of OA, joint replacements represent a $19 billion industry annually in
the US. In addition to its role in OA treatments, the model may clinical
implications in improving outcomes for autologous chondrocyte transplantation,
increasing its commercial impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the development of a cell culture platform that improves control over
the differentiation of chondrocytes. This control is enabled through the
regulation of cell shape via a novel combination of nanotechnology,
micropatterning, and mechanically-tunable, thin-film composite materials.
Chondrocytes rapidly transform into non-physiological cell types in standard 2D
culture systems. More advanced 3D culture systems prevent this problem but
introduce difficulties in compatibility with analytical techniques. The proposed
technology may act as an egg crate for individual cells, nesting each one in an
environment that allows it to maintain its physiological nature without
restricting their ability to be studied. The technology may maintain the
physiological cell shape of chondrocytes for at least 28 days, four times as
long as competing micropatterned technologies. The technology has potential
applications in drug development, gene therapy, stem cell medicine, tissue
engineering, the elucidation of molecular pathogeneses, and other biomedical
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
