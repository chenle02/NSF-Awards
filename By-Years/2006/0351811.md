This study will determine whether religious and non-religious appeals used by
lawyers in closing arguments affect the decision-making of jurors. Cognitive-
experiential self-theory (CEST) predicts that affect caused by religious appeals
will lead individuals to process information experientially (i.e. relying on
emotions) instead of rationally (i.e. relying on logic). This study will use
CEST to determine whether religious appeals influence processing type and lead
to decisions made in legally impermissible ways. Finally, the project will
investigate the effects of directives regarding how to make the sentencing
decision. The experimental methodology employs a written trial summary, edited
jury instructions, and a verdict form, all of which are based on an actual
trial. Participants will read the summary and instructions and will indicate
their sentencing decisions on the verdict form. Participants will also complete
a written task designed to measure type of decision-making strategy used.
