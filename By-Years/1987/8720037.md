In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, Ronis is
developing new statistical mechanic theories for static and dynamic properties
of condensed systems. This project involves a diverse set of topics ranging from
developing theories of phase transitions and critical phenomena in condensed
media to modelling micelles, membranes and biological systems such as
gramicidin-A. Ronis is developing new and extending existing theories in
statistical mechanics to static and dynamic problems in condensed systems. The
immediate goals are 1) to study the effects of solvent and backbone flexibility
on time correlation functions which determine the alkali-ion permeability in
gramicidin-A; 2) to calculate the ionic potential of mean force near the mouth
of a model gramicidin-A/membrane pore system; 3) to develop an improved theory
of the ionic double layer near highly charged polarizable surfaces; 4) to extend
his microscopic theory of membrane transport to diffusive transport in zeolites;
5) to study the effect of inter-particle correlations on phase transitions and
size distributions in ionic micellar suspensions; 6) to develop a kinetic theory
of binary mixture phase transitions in porous media; 7) to improve his theory of
critical phenomena in turbulent flows by solving a self-consistent theory of the
coupling of critical dynamics to the fluid motion flow; 8) to develop a theory
of instability mechanisms and fluctuations in colloidal crystals; 9) to develop
a theory of enhanced radiative energy transfer in small particles; and 10) to
develop a theory of spinodal decomposition near the critical point.
