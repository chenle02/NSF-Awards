The proposal develops classification based approaches to prediction and
statistical inference. Examples of statistical problems considered are change
point problems, histograms, mode identification, reticulate evolution, and
quantization of probability ditributions. A particular classification problem
studied is the problem of types, the family of classes that most succinctly
describes a primitive given family of classes. One way of predicting the future
is by recognising circumstances that are similar to circumstances already
experienced, that is, by placing the present circumstances in some established
class of circumstances, from which we can infer other aspects of th future. Our
method of classifying experience will determine how we predict the future. Thus
we need to study classification to study prediction. We can't simply seize on
some scheme of classification and use it permanently; we must develop new
classifications adapting to the success or failure of predictions. Thus
classification is needed for practical probability judgments, and practical
probability judgments are needed for classification.
