The chemical applications of lasers is being introduced throughout the chemistry
curriculum. Laser experiments using modern chemical instrumentation are
replacing traditional wet chemical procedures in the first-year
General/Analytical Chemistry sequence. Chiral product characterization using
laser polarimetry following microscale synthesis is being introduced in organic
and inorganic Chemistry laboratories. In the analytical and physical
laboratories lasers are used to probe excited states, to study chemical events
taking place on the nanosecond timescale, and to investigate nonlinear
spectroscopy via two-laser multiphoton excitation, Raman scattering, and
harmonic generation experiments.
