9704912 Hager This proposal concerns the numerical analysis of infinite
dimensional variational problems such as variational inequalities involving
ordinary differential equations, differential inclusions, and optimal control
problems. Using recent stability results, errors estimates will be derived for
discrete approximations of state constrained optimal control problems. For
linear/quadratic problems with control and state constraints, efficient
algorithms will be developed for computing a solution. In addition, the
stability theory will be applied to generate both a priori and a posteriori
estimates for the errors in the computed solutions. For differential inclusions,
discretizations will be developed with sufficient generality to encompass
problems with discontinuous right sides and state constraints. The algorithms
and theory that will be developed in this proposal are applicable to a variety
of problems in industry such as those associated with the optimal performance of
robots, flight control in aerospace, the design of thin films with desired
properties, or the optimal engineering of chemical processes. When any of these
problems is solved on a computer, the continuous process is decomposed into tiny
time steps. This proposal studies the errors that are caused when this
continuous process is discretized in this way.
