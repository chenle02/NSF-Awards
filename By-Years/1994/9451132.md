9451132 Heidcamp A computer network for cell biology laboratory instruction is
being established. The network will contain laboratory exercises designed for
three levels of activity. Level I contains exercises designed for minimal
equipment and budget. Level II is consistent with curricula placing a high value
on hands-on laboratory experiences. Level III will be advanced work leading to
independent studies or team research efforts. The exercises are written for
standard cell biology laboratories or for inquiry-based education. The network
serves as a source of computer simulations as well as data. The data may be in
the form of graphs, tables, or images. The network also serves as a
communications device to link teachers of cell biology from high schools,
colleges and universities. It will also allow for instructor input and revision
of existing exercises.
