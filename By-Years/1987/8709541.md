It is proposed to make a numerical study, both classically and quantum
mechanically, of the stability of distorted Coulomb orbits under the influence
of stochastic perturbations. The primary goal of the investigation is the study
of the atomic dynamics under the influence of strong noise. The method we will
use is the numerical Monte-Carlo solution of a classical Langevin equation and
the solution of a quantum master equation for the reduced atomic density matrix.
The comparison between the classical and the quantum treatment should provide
novel information on the degree of suppression of indeterministic (stochastic)
diffusion due to discreteness effects of quantum states. Applications will focus
on the dynamical evolution of excited states of fast atomic particles
penetrating solids under the combined influence of stochastic collision
processes and dynamical screening in the many-body target.
