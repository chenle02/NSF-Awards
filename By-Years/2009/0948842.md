0948842&lt;br/&gt;Ketcham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides continued
support for the University of Texas Computed X-ray Tomography (UTCT) Facility
over a three year period. The CT scanner at UT was specifically designed to
enable x-ray tomography of a range of geological materials and sample sizes. The
technology was developed from commercial biomedical CAT scanners with the
adoption of a higher energy x-ray source and higher resolution CCD detectors to
allow micron-scale imaging of non-living geological samples. The technique
allows for completely non-destructive imaging of the exteriors and interiors of
samples. Differences in x-ray attenuation that occur due to variations in sample
density and the elemental composition of the material along the x-ray path are
digitally recorded by a CCD. Samples are mounted on a rotating table in front of
the x-ray source. Radial 2-d slices of the attenuated x-rays are stacked by
vertical translation of the sample table. Resultant x-ray ?sinograms? are then
reduced via computer algorithms to render high resolution 3-D images of the
density distributions within samples. Research applications spanning the
geosciences, biology, engineering and anthropology are routinely supported. Data
and images from UTCT scans are web-accessible data and extremely useful for
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
