Kennesaw State University (KSU), in collaboration with Georgia Institute of
Technology (GT), forms the Increasing Mathematics Teachers for ALL Students
(IMTAS) project. This project is recruiting, preparing, and retaining 36
teachers of secondary mathematics for high needs areas of diverse populations.
Junior and senior level students are recruited primarily from GT and KSU. These
recruits then enter KSU's Master of Arts in Teaching degree program for
mathematics education. This program is designed to increase the number of
teachers for high needs areas, and instructs teachers specifically in how to
work with students for whom English is a second language.

Intellectual Merit The faculty team consists of professionals with expertise in
culturally relevant pedagogy, and mathematics. This combination provides an
innovative approach to preparing mathematics teachers for all students. The
Master of Arts in Teaching degree program also takes into consideration the
backgrounds of a variety of students that may apply, and provides several routes
for students to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to be effective
mathematics teachers for diverse student populations. This innovative approach
is also combined with the partnership's previously successful Noyce project's
strategy of tapping an engineering-focused student population as a source of
recruits for KSU's historically strong teacher preparation unit.

Broader Impacts Georgia's need for mathematics teachers is ever growing in
number and diversity. This project is providing mathematics teachers to help
address this need.
