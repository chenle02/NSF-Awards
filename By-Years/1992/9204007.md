This research examines the roles of first-order saturated, supersaturated and
minimal level change designs in the problem of minimizing the number of
experiments required to differentiate the influential factors from those only
contributing noise. Optimal experimental design in an industrial setting may
also have as an objective the minimization of the number of experiments.
Theoretical solutions have often depended upon unrealistic assumptions about the
likely number of influential factors and their interactions. This research
focuses on an efficient and effective approach to the design of a minimal series
of experiments to identify those factors with the goal of predicting the optimal
combination of factors or factor settings for full-scale production.
