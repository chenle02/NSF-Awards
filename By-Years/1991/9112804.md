Professor Bennett will continue his research on "elementary inequalities," i.e.
those involving matrices with non-negative entries. The main objective is to
find norm estimates for various matrix transformations between sequence spaces.
Applications are to probability theory, function theory, orthogonal series, and
the general theory of inequalities. Mathematical analysis at the working level
is often a matter of the ingenious manipulation of inequalities. For instance,
there is a famous inequality asserting that the sum of products of two sequences
of positive numbers is not greater than the square root of the sum of squares of
the first sequence times the analogous expression for the second. This fact and
countless others like it constitutes the basic information out of which analytic
arguments are spun. The research of Professor Bennett aims at fundamental
enrichment of this store of facts.
