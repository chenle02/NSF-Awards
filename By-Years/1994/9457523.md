This is the first year base funding of a five-year National Science Foundation
Young Investigator Award. The overall goal of this research is to establish a
science base for automated assembly by analyzing its basic components. The
research involves development of algorithms and interactive systems that analyze
the low-level geometry of assembly lines and their components, such as part
feeders, sorters, and fixtures. An underlying theme is the use of simple sensors
and actuators such as light beams and parallel-jaw grippers. Although the
hardware bears a close resemblance to existing "hard'' automation systems, this
research introduces computational methods to rapidly configure and reliably
control this hardware. At a higher level, modular components such as flexible
feeders and conveyor belts are interactively configured to facilitate the design
and evaluation of assembly lines prior to installation. The research addresses
basic theoretical questions such as the complexity and completeness of
algorithms and involves several companies in efforts to transfer basic results
into industrial practice.
