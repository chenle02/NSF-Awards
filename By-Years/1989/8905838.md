Evolution equations describing the dynamics of oscillatory and spinning flames
in solid fuel combustion are to be derived and studied in this
analytical/numerical research project. The mathematical flexibility of the basic
model will be increased by adding a free parameter to the boundary conditions.
This enables one to bring the system to a low frequency limit without altering
its mathematical nature. The temporal and spatial scales are separated and an
asymptotic solution is sought which does not require expanding the nonlinear
kinetics term. Preserving the transcendental nonlinearity is crucial in
obtaining qualitatively correct oscillatory dynamics. A totally new technique
has been devised to tackle the highly nonlinear problems associated with the
dynamics of oscillatory and spinning flames. The problems to be tackled will
help to explain the physical observations made in solid and gaseous fuels
combustion, and will be particularly useful for advancing our understanding of
the combustion synthesis of new high temperature materials.
