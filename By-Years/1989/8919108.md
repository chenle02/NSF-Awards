The main objective of this work is to develop a practical mechanism and
methodology for the analysis of low frequency power system dynamics. This main
goal is to be accomplished through the development of a power system simulator.
The methodology is expected to enhance capabilities for research particularly
regarding low frequency analysis related to dynamic phenomena, in education, and
in practical power system engineering. The latter is expected for automatic
generation control (AGC), control system synthesis, and AGC evaluation. Advances
are contemplated in modelling, data base management, graphics, power system
representation, and report generation. The end product will be a prototype
simulator for the next-generation power system AGC. The simulator will have
extended capabilities for the full representation of active and reactive power,
system voltages and currents, and parameters used by the AGC.
