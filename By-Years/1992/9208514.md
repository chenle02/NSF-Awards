Work supported on a previous NSF grant has demonstrated that the development of
craniofacial systems in placental and marsupial mammals is characterized by
large scale changes in relative rate and timing. Specifically, the development
of the central nervous system and skeletal system are both dramatically slowed
in metatherians relative to eutherians, however, the development of the muscular
system is greatly accelerated. These results confirm hypotheses that suggest
metatherians possess specific developmental adaptations to the requirements of
their life history and suggest, somewhat surprisingly, that the development of
craniofacial systems is quite plastic. In the current project these results will
be extended in two major directions. First, craniofacial development will be
examined in other mammalian species to ask whether the variation is limited to
characterizing the two largest mammalian groups, eutherians and metatherians.
Second, preliminary studies on the cellular and molecular bases of the
developmental patterns observed will be initiated and the development of the
nervous system will be examined in detail. This study will combine comparative
information with data on gross, histological, cellular and molecular processes
to allow an integrated approach to craniofacial development. The results
obtained will address specific and significant problems on mammalian
biodiversity and provide opportunities to examine the mechanisms of and
constraints on developmental patterns.
