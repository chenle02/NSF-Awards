"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Nanotechnology Undergraduate
Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled "NUE: A Nanotechnology
Certificate Program for Engineering Undergraduates", at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (UWM), under the direction of Dr. Wendy C. Crone, will create,
implement, and evaluate an interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Certificate Program
in the College of Engineering by an interdisciplinary team of engineering
faculty, staff, and graduate students. New course modules will be created to
modify existing courses on nanoscale science, engineering, and technology
(NSET), institutionalize newly proposed courses specific to the Nanotechnology
Certificate, and train graduate student interns and faculty in developing and
assessing new simulation-based interactive learning materials in collaboration
with faculty from the School of Education. The Nanotechnology Certificate will
provide a mechanism for training undergraduate engineering and physical science
students at UWM in NSET.
