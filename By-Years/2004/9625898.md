Postdoctoral Program: Diagrammatic Reasoning in Hardware Verification This award
supports CES associate Kathryn Fisher. Diagrams are fundamental to hardware
design. Designers use them extensively to convey details, to express properties,
and to reason informally about designs. Despite this, little attention has been
paid to supporting diagrammatic reasoning in verification. As a result, a
substantial gap exists between design practice and verification methodology that
makes performing verification difficult for designers. The project aims to
bridge this gap through a logic developed around common hardware
representations. The logic has five syntactic representations: three
diagrammatic and two sentential. The inference rules support reasoning with
information from multiple representations, thereby providing formal support for
how diagrammatic information is used in practice. The practical objective is to
investigate whether this logic makes verification easier for designers. A
verification tool based on the logic will be implemented and evaluated alongside
existing methodologies by both novices and experienced practitioners. The main
theoretical objective is to examine how diagrammatic information can help refine
the current boundaries between automated and interactive verification
methodologies. The integration of these approached will be an important feature
of the tool ***
