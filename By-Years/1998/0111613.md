It has long been known that crosses between species often fail to produce
offspring and this failure occurs due to problems with fertilization; sperm of
one species are incompatible with the reproductive tract or eggs of the other
species. However, only recently have biologists begun to study in detail the
rapidly evolving genes and proteins that govern fertilization incompatibilities
between species. The aims of this highly ambitious and multi-faceted project are
to identify and analyze the fertilization proteins in several groups of insects,
distinguish the factors that govern the rapid evolution of these proteins,
evaluate the role of the proteins in isolating closely related species, and
develop mathematical models of the protein divergence process.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the research focuses on insects, it will have
broad application to other invertebrates and to vertebrates, including humans,
since the patterns seen in insects match those of other animal groups. Problems
with fertilization plague many human couples. This research will provide new
insight into the processes that can give rise to these problems and the
molecular response to these processes in groups of model organisms. &lt;br/&gt;
