The primary objectives of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Tatsuro
Ichiishi of the Ohio State University and Dr. Adam Idzik of the Institute of
Computer Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences involve research in three
areas: fixed point theorems; cooperative games in a Bayesian framework; and
cooperative solutions to general models involving economies of scale in
production. This project in economics fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
