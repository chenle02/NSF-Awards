This longitudinal study investigates the simultaneous acquisition of English
and Turkish by a child between the ages of 1 year, 8 months and 4 years, six
months. Comparisons will be made with the monolingual acquisition of each of
these languages as well as the successive acquisition of English and Turkish,
followed by the loss of Turkish between the ages of 2 years, six months and 3
years, 3 months in a child previously studied. The project is of special
interest among case studies in bilingual acquisition, because the two languages
involved are typologically different. It also provides one of the few
comparisons of simultaneous and successive bilingual acquisition using the same
pair of languages. Findings will be relevant to theories of language acquisition
and socialization, bilingualism, and relations between language and cognition in
development.
