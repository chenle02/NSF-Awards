The structural features of M1 RNA and C5 protein (the catalytic RNA subunit and
the protein subunit, respectively, of RNase P from E. coli) which are required
for catalysis and the accurate cleavage of tRNA precursor molecules will be
investigated by utilizing subunits of the enzyme that have been altered by
chemical and enzymatic methods. In addition, nucleotide sequences of the analog
of M1 RNA from several eucaryotic organisms will be determined using a technique
based on the PCR reaction in order to test a universal model of the secondary
structure of these RNAs. Subunits of the enzyme, in combination with certain
modified substrates, will be used to improve the yield of enzyme-substrate
complexes, and, thereby, to facilitate identification and study by chemical
techniques of the active site of the enzyme. Model substrates with
phosphorothioates located at the site of cleavage by the enzyme will be used to
test predictions concerning the reaction mechanism. Model substrates will also
be synthesized to elaborate the features of substrates that determine the site
of cleavage by the enzyme. Attempts to crystallize RNase P from E. coli will
proceed concurrently.
