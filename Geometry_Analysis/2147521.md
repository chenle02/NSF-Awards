Differential geometry is a modern version of Euclidean geometry that studies
shapes inside curved surfaces in any number of dimensions. Two key notions in
differential geometry, besides "length" and "angle," are: "minimal surfaces,"
which generalize the concept of a straight line, and "curvature," which measures
how a surface is bent. The early development of differential geometry is partly
attributable to physics. In the early 20th century, Einstein formulated a
geometric theory of gravitation, general relativity, asserting that we live in a
curved four-dimensional world ("spacetime") where energy and mass are
manifestations of the curvature of spacetime, and minimal surfaces are
indicative of black hole boundaries. Nowadays, differential geometry and minimal
surfaces are at the heart of several physical theories and active mathematical
research directions. The principal investigator (PI) will study problems
regarding minimal surfaces that are motivated by general relativity and by the
van der Walls--Cahn--Hilliard theory of phase transitions for multicomponent
alloy systems. This project will also support the proposer's efforts to promote
student learning, inclusion, and training through summer schools, workshops, and
conferences, as well as via expository articles and notes.

This project spans three related active research areas of minimal surface theory
in differential geometry. First, the PI will investigate the construction of
minimal surfaces as limiting min-max phase transitions. This construction has
been recently shown to exhibit certain desirable stability properties that led
to the proof of the "multiplicity one min-max conjecture" in three dimensions by
the PI and Chodosh. The PI will continue this program, to produce surfaces with
different curvatures and in different dimensions, as well as to better
understand geometric implications of stable phase transitions. Second, as a step
toward understanding limits of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, the
PI will study smooth and non-smooth three- and four-dimensional manifolds with
nonnegative scalar curvature via the inherent bending effects of their embedded
minimal surfaces. Third, the PI will apply this study of bending effects of
minimal surfaces to investigate conjectured relationships between different mass
notions in general relativity, where time-symmetric initial data sets are
precisely manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
