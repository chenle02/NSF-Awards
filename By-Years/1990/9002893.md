Accurate modelling of the global distribution of trace gases in the atmosphere
is necessary to understand the sources and sinks (chemical , physical or
biological) that control the global budgets of the radiatively and chemically
important gases. This effort continues the basic studies in theoretical modeling
of the global composition of the atmosphere. First an investigation of how to
improve the manner in which the physical / chemical process in global 3-D models
(e.g., chemistry, transport and diffusion) are coupled with the high-order
numerical methods used in calculating the transport of tracers, will be
undertaken. Second, the developments of current research on three-dimensional
chemical transport models (CTM) for stratospheric ozone will be used to examine
how stratosphere-troposphere exchange controls the abundances of O3 and NOy in
the upper troposphere.
