95-26300 Reyes As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Reyes will reduce, analyze, and
interpret radio observations carried out before, during, and after the event.
Most of the observations were carried out with the University of Florida Radio
Observatory, the University of Chile Radio Observatory, and Caltech's Owens
Valley Radio Observatory. These data will be complemented with data gathered
during the week of the collision at radio observatories in Japan, Tasmania, and
Australia. The objectives are to investigate possible effects of the collision
of the comet fragments on the mean peak flux densities of the normal Jovian
radio emission, and to determine the locations of sources of mechanisms for
emission of radio bursts. Finally, Dr. Reyes will compile and publish a catalog
of the observations. **
