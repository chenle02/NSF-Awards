One of the unifying concepts of space (and astrophysical) plasma science is that
of explosive energy conversions (EPCs). This project is a systematic attempt to
uncover a universal process underlying the occurrence of EPCs through a
comparative study of its most well known examples: coronal mass ejections and
magnetospheric substorms. One potential candidate for such a universal process
is the loss of equilibrium between repulsive and attractive forces operating on
a magnetic bubble. A tail-like configuration forms, creating a "champagne-glass"
magnetic structure. The investigation will use three different, global, MHD
simulation models available at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC)
to simulate substorms and test whether the loss of equilibrium signature is
present. If the signature is present then the simulations will be used to
determine how the evolution of the magnetosphere under suitable solar wind
conditions leads to the emergence of the loss of equilibrium. The use of three
different and independent MHD codes will be used to test the robustness of the
result.

A second goal is coupled with the basic research effort. The simulation results
will be used to construct a comprehensive set of unit lessons in basic solar-
terrestrial physics. The lessons will be routinely updated through growth and
user feedback and will be accessible interactively through the CCMC web site.
