Introduction to Technical WritingThis project is designed to significantly
improve the introductory physics laboratory at Saint Anselm College. It has two
specific aims: 1) new sets of experiments allow engineering students and biology
students to follow distinct pathways, each suited to the later academic and
professional emphases of the individual; and 2) new computer facilities, both
hardware and software, allow a new and more modern emphasis on data processing
and data analysis, together with special attention to technical writing skills.
The introductory physics laboratory is a combined one - it handles students from
the calculus-based course (engineering and chemistry students) and from the
algebra based course (biology students). The new two-path concept exposes
engineering students to experiments dealing with properties of materials,
aerodynamics, and the Stirling engine. The biology students follow a track
intended to achieve a firm grounding in x-ray properties. The new computer
facilities equip an already existing suite of rooms where students gather for
study, and pre- and post-lab work. The laboratory reports stress modern
technical communications skills, both as to content and form.
