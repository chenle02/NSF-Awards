This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER. Nanoparticle-supported (10-100 nm in
diameter) catalysts that can be removed by the application of a magnetic force
will be developed. The magnetic capability of the nanoparticles provides a way
for simple and efficient recovery of the catalysts by using a magnetic field.
The required features of magnetic nanoparticles for use as effective catalyst
supports include chemical inertness, weak inter-particle interaction, large
magnetic permeability, high saturation magnetization, and flexibility for
surface chemical modification. Spinel ferrite nanoparticles offer an excellent
platform for design and control of magnetic properties to satisfy these
criteria. These materials derive their unique magnetic properties from their
nanoscopic size, which prevents the formation of multiple domains within a
nanoparticle, allowing each nanoparticle to behave like a single paramagnetic
atom with a giant magnetic moment. Furthermore, it is possible to control the
magnetic properties of these materials by adjusting their composition at the
atomic level. Therefore, it is possible to tailor the magnetic properties of the
nanoparticles for specific applications. Each nanoparticle will have a thin
silica coat, which is functionalizable and chemically inert. If successful, this
research would lay the groundwork for an entirely new class of highly active
polymerization catalysts that could allow for the recovery and reuse of these
organometallic catalysts.
