This project will investigate the influence of disorder on superfluid 3He, one
of an important class of quantum fluids that includes ruthenate superconductors,
heavy fermion superconductors, and high temperature superconductors. These
unconventional systems are formed from pairs of fermions in BCS states. They all
have the common important characteristic of spontaneously broken symmetries
beyond gauge symmetry. As such they are particularly sensitive to impurity
effects, which must be investigated if the underlying behavior of these systems
is to be understood and if the potential for their application is to be
realized. The proposed research will bring precise experimental tools,
transverse high frequency acoustics, heat capacity, and thin film methods, that
are available for 3He in aerogel glass, to determine order parameter suppression
and the density of low-lying excitations and to compare with recent theoretical
predictions for gapless superconductivity. The results will have broad
implications for unconventional superconductors, Bose-Einstein condensation, and
exotic vortex matter. The participation of graduate students in this work will
provide them with technical training relevant to basic research and industrial
interests. Undergraduate projects on acoustics will give opportunities for
learning complementary to, but outside, the classroom.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the influence of disorder on
superfluid 3He, one of an important class of quantum fluids that includes high
temperature superconductors. These systems exhibit a high degree of fragility,
that is, they have extreme sensitivity to all forms of imperfection and
impurities. Investigation of disorder is crucial to their basic understanding
and to a realization of their potential for applications. 3He is an ideal choice
to study such effects since its pure state is well understood. This is in
contrast to many superconductors which have physical and chemical complexity
that is difficult to control. The proposed research includes, thermodynamic and
acoustic measurements while systematically controlling disorder introduced with
highly porous silica aerogel. The work is relevant to theoretical models for
neutron star matter, quark Cooper pairs, and exotic vortex states for which 3He
is often a reference point. Undergraduate students will participate in the
proposed research using phase modulation acoustics and second sound propagation.
Training of graduate students in the technically sophisticated areas of magnetic
resonance, low-temperature methods, and high frequency acoustics will prepare
them for a range of professional career opportunities with a significant
potential impact to our society.&lt;br/&gt;
