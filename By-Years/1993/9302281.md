9302281 Bosscher The objectives of this proposal are to advance the
understanding of the interface behavior based on micro structural studies and to
develop a quantitative theory and a constitutive law capturing the physics of
the interface behavior. The constitutive law will be couched as an incremental
history dependent law applicable for numerical simulation. The quantitative
theory will be developed based on experimentation and the use of distinct
element method (DEM) simulations. The use of massive parallelization of the DEM
code will enhance the number of particles and the complexity of particles and
surfaces that can be modeled. Experimental verification of the derived interface
constitutive law will also be performed. *** g ` e g ! ! F g g 3 Times New Roman
