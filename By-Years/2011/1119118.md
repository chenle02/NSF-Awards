In this full research and development project, a team of learning scientists and
media researchers at Education Development Center and SRI International will
collaborate with educational media producers at WGBH to develop, test, and
refine a curriculum supplement (a hands-on technology) that (1) promotes
childrens' understanding of number (counting, comparing, and ordering) and fair
sharing (equipartitioning); (2) uses interactive media on an emerging handheld
platform (touch screen tablets), integrating new multi-touch activities with
existing hands-on activities; (3) enhances opportunities for learning with
interactive media through shared use with adult guides and peers; and (4)
provides professional and technical support materials for preschool educators.
The project investigates if and how engagement with activities in a media-rich
curriculum supplement improves low-income young childrens' early learning of
number and equipartitioning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on sound
research about learning trajectories to develop materials for fostering young
childrens' learning. In addition, this project will generate new research
findings about how engagement with activities in a media-rich curriculum
supplement can improve low-income childrens' learning. The project uses use
mixed methods (ethnographic observations and interviews and HLM analyses) to
answer the research questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a
critical need to develop quality early childhood mathematics curriculum,
particularly that aimed at low-income students. This project involves two
important content areas. Both the content and the mode of delivery make major
contributions to curriculum development and research. This project can provide
much needed insights about how to effectively use technology for improving
student learning.
