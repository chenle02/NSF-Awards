This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. The research deals with the growing phenomenon of contingent work of
four kinds: part-time, temporary, out-sourced, and independent contract. It
relates to theories of employment and labor force inequality. A number of
existing data sources will be used to compile a comprehensive data set for
analyzing the determinants of contingent work and its effects on inequality. %%%
This research will contribute to sociological understanding of social
stratification, work, and economic sociology. It will be of help to policy
makers concerned with labor force inequality and employment policies. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
