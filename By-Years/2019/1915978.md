Recent developments have made large-scale multidimensional data readily
available in science and engineering applications. Examples include multi-
tissue, multi-individual gene expression studies, in which gene expression
profiles are collected from different individuals' tissues. Another example is
the DBLP database, which is organized into a three-way tensor of author-by-word-
by-venue, and each entry indicates the co-occurrence of the triplets. Despite
the popularity of tensor data, there are many challenges to using statistical
methods for analyzing higher-order tensors. Indeed, the classical spectral
theory for matrices is not directly applicable to tensors, and the computational
problem becomes NP-hard in the worst case. Therefore, analyzing tensor data with
increasing dimensionality and ever-growing complexity requires the development
of novel statistical methods, which is the aim of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI plans to develop a
framework of statistical models, scalable algorithms, and relevant theories to
analyze tensor-valued data. This will allow researchers to examine complex
interactions among tensor entries and between multiple tensors, thereby
providing solutions to questions that cannot be addressed by traditional matrix
analysis. The project will focus on three major areas: (i) spectral theory for
specially-structured or random tensors; (ii) estimation of low-rank tensors from
non-Gaussian observations; and (iii) joint estimation of mean and covariance for
tensor-valued data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
