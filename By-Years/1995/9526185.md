DMS-9526185 PI: Kenig This award will give partial support for a conference on
harmonic analysis and partial differential equations to be held in Chicago in
February, 1996. The symbiosis of these two subjects and their applications to
other branches of mathematics will be emphasized. Implications of the scientific
program of Calder n for contemporary and future mathematical developments will
be the principle theme. Goals of the conference are to spark new developments in
harmonic analysis and partial differential equations through the interaction of
leading researchers having diverse interests, to educate young researchers and
advanced graduate students on these two fields and their interrelationship, and
to encourage and facilitate greater participation by minorities and members of
underrepresented groups in mathematical research.
