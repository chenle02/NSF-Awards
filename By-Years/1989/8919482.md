Professor Edward C. Lim is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to study intramolecular energy flow in excited electronic states.
Professor Lim uses molecular beam and laser excitation techniques to prepare
molecular systems in very specific excited states which are then probed as a
function of time. These studies are motivated by a desire to find a route to
mode-specific or bond-specific chemistry through controlled localization of
absorbed laser radiation. The experimental approach employed by Professor Lim
utilizes time-resolved photoionization and laser-induced fluorescence in seeded
molecular beams. Picosecond and nanosecond lasers are used to probe structural
and dynamic properties via frequency- and time-domain experiments. These
experimental techniques are being used to explore a large variety of interesting
chemical systems including: aromatic carbonyls, halogenated anthracenes and van
der Waals molecules.
