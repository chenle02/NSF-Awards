Dr. Garside in collaboration with Dr. McCarthy of Harvard University will study
nitrogen cycling and particulate matter and nitrate isotopic signature in the
northern Sargasso Sea. The researchers will use the chemoluminescent nitrate
technique and improved ammonium analysis to provide the most sensitive analysis
to date of nitrogen cycling in oligotrophic waters. Nitrogen is a plant nutrient
that is thought to limit biological productivity in much of the world ocean. The
question of nitrogen cycling in oligotrophic oceans will be advanced by the
application of the state of the art techniques applied in this work.
