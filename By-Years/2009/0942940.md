Chemistry (12) Two instruments, a handheld X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (XRF)
and an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) are
being integrated into undergraduate laboratories in the departments of
Chemistry, Geosciences, and Biology at Trinity University. This integration of
analytical tools into undergraduate curricula is helping address three primary
goals: improving science and non-science major learning by engagement in
interdisciplinary endeavors; improving student depth of understanding of
elemental analysis methods; and increasing multidisciplinary interactions among
faculty and students which in the long term will fundamentally transform STEM
education on the Trinity campus. Project faculty are developing new, engaging
laboratories for non-science and science majors that involve hands-on use of
these sophisticated, research-grade instruments. The strategy of using relevant
(environmental water samples), unique (museum paintings and artifacts), and
interdisciplinary samples and problem frameworks (distribution of metals in
soils and plants and ecosystems) is intended to better capture student interest
than traditional isolated experimentation within a discipline. Elemental
analysis methods are being explored at a variety of skill levels across a broad
range of disciplines. The impacted courses and programs are affecting a large
percentage of female and minority students. This equipment is being used by at
least three departments and by two community partners. An outside, experienced
consultant is performing formative and will be performing summative assessments
of the project. The dissemination plan includes conference presentations, peer-
reviewed publications, and web based materials (sites hosted by both Trinity
University and the NSDL) that target multidisciplinary audiences.
