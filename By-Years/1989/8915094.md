In studies of midwater trawl samples, large numbers of endemic bathypelagic
calanoid species have been found in the Antarctic, all of which were more
abundant than the cosmopolitan species found in the same area. These findings
are contrary to the general perception that the bathypelagic calanoids are are
cosmopolitan and rare because of the uniformity of physical condition and the
scarcity of available food in deep waters throughout the world's oceans. A
possible explanation is that the Antarctic bathypelagic endemic species are
those adapted to euthrophic conditions of the Antarctic, whereas the
cosmopolitan species are those adapted to oligotrophic conditions. The study
proposed here is to test the hypothesis by investigation of the deep-living
calanoids concerning their morphology, geographic distribution, and relative
abundance at many different locations of the world's oceans. Both eutrophic
upwelling and oligotrophic oceanic areas will be examined for comparison of the
effect of general productivity of overlaying surface waters. The calanoid genera
selected for the study are Euchaeta, Pseudochirella and Onchocalanus. These
genera have already been studied in the Antarctic and found to be important
constituents of the bathpelagic calanoid assemblage, with many endemic as well
as cosmopolitan species. The samples for the study will be selected mainly from
midwater trawl collections available at the Smithsonian Oceanographic sorting
Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The study will accomplish two
objectives: 1) Answering the question of whether the bathypelagic calanoid
assemblages comprise, as in the epipelagic communities, eutrophic endemic
species confined to waters of high productivity and cosmopolitan oligotrophic
species ranging widely in the world's oceans. 2) Clarifying the systematics and
biogeography of some bathypelagic calanoid taxa, important but poorly known
groups in the zooplankton.
