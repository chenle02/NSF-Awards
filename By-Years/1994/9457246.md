9457246 Alvarez-Cohen This is an award to support research through a National
Science Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the Principal
Investigator who was nominated and selected through procedures contained in NSF
93-148, Young Investigator Awards FY 1994 Program. This investigator's research
plan includes work directed toward enhancing our understanding of microbial-
mediated cometabolic degradations, reactions carried out by microorganisms
without yielding significant benefits to them, necessitating an alternate
substrate for their growth. Her plan includes simultaneous dual-labeling of
compounds using stable isotopes and radio-labeled compounds. Results of this
work are expected to be used in devising mathematical models that can be used in
engineering design of bioreactors. These models are expected to be used in
formulation and validation of mathematical models that can be used in the
engineering design of bioreactors for decontamination of water.
