Large stochastic systems and other interacting processes are increasingly
conspicuous in scientific discoveries and decision making. Scientists in a
variety of disciplines have unprecedented access to massive data which hinge on
structures with complex interactions. Decision makers also need to optimize
social welfare involving a large population full of randomness. Traditional
models of low dimensional nature are no longer adequate for these scientific
problems and as a basis for decision making. The project will address these
problems by developing mathematical and computational tools for analyzing
complex interacting systems that will have far-reaching public health, economic
and scientific implications. The project will focus on developing several
innovations in mathematical theory and algorithms, which will inform basic
science and policy questions arising in diverse disciplines. The results will be
disseminated broadly across diverse scientific and social communities. The
project will provide training opportunities for graduate students.

The project will investigate long-time behavior and large population limit of
stochastic processes. The project will address three specific topics. The first
topic will concern stochastic models involving hitting times to understand the
long-time behavior on the mean-field limit and design an optimal strategy to
control the large complex system. The main tools that the investigator plans to
develop will be from probability theory and partial differential equations. The
second topic will involve accelerating gradient methods for escaping from saddle
points of a non-convex high-dimensional objective function. The third topic will
investigate the sensitivity of some probabilistic ranking models when the number
of observations is large. In both the second and third topics, the investigator
plans to develop tools from probability theory and combinatorics.
