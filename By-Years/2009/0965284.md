This project, "NSF Scholars: Training Tomorrow's Scientists Today", demonstrates
the effectiveness of a scholarship program for students based on a cohort model,
providing a combination of financial aid and integration into the academic and
social environment of the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
The university has previous experience with a cohort model for urban minority
and low income students though the Act Six program, which has had a 94%
graduation rate. The NSF Scholar program utilizes existing student academic
support and mentoring services, tested with six years of Act Six students, such
as a bridge program, tutoring, and faculty and peer mentors. It adds two new
elements: 1) peer facilitated Supplemental Instruction in the foundational
sequences and 2) an interdisciplinary course entitled "Preparing for a STEM
Career" designed to guide students toward learning and understanding their own
specific strengths and values, so that they can see what kinds of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities are
consistent with their own strengths and values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: This project impacts the national need for scientists by encouraging and
mentoring undergraduates, particularly minority students, who will become
tomorrow's scientists. The project is impacting the university itself by 1)
advancing the 2005-2010 Strategic Plan, that calls for an intercultural campus
and improved science education, 2) training a larger number of peer facilitators
and faculty and peer mentors, resulting in a greater number of students and
faculty with intercultural competence, 3) improving science education for all
students, and 4) developing a career course for all science students, which
provides the opportunity for them to explore different science careers that
might be the best fit for the life they envision.
