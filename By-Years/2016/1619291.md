This project will expand the methodologies and applications for computer-based
haptics, by investigating how remote tactile communication, functioning in
partnership with other contextual channels like speech, may facilitate
supportive discourse for at-risk individuals. The research enhances
infrastructure for research and education by building a testbed to study a
heretofore unexplored mode of computer-assisted perception between people. It
will advance science while promoting teaching, training, and learning by
providing unique cross-disciplinary educational and learning opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students. Potentially, this new technology will
facilitate greater partnership and emotional interaction among people, over long
distances. This will help people understand the meaning of the other person's
communications, maintain valued relationships, and enhance each other's well-
being. It could usher in a new dimension in telecommunications that has
significant economic potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hardware and software
testbed will be developed to study this sub-space of human-computer interaction,
including tactile modalities and parameters (e.g., compression, pattern, and
onset dynamics) and the timing between a tactile stimulus and the accompanying
contextualizing channel. Input and output devices will be developed through
iterative design, and evaluated by means of: (1) usability and characterization
studies; (2) in-laboratory affective communication studies including a one-way
controlled study to assess affect conveyance and a dyadic communication study
for the range of communication dynamics supported; (3) in vivo extended
communication studies. One connection to general communication theory is the
hypothesis that tactile interaction conveys affect immediately without
interposing any explicitly coded symbolic message. More generally, this research
will take an interdisciplinary approach that draws from and contributes to each
participating discipline. Broad dissemination will enhance scientific and
technological understanding through publication of results and insights in the
journals and conferences of the various fields represented in the project. All
software developed will be shared in open source form.
