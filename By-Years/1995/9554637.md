Radford University will host a five-day conference for approximately 55-60
college biology teachers. The focus is introductory biology courses for majors
and non-majors. The primary objectives of the conference are threefold. First,
it will serve as a forum for presenting curricular innovations in biology
teaching, including the ones developed with NSF support at Radford University.
Participants will have extended opportunities to explore these new approaches
through hands-on workshops, group discussions, and critiques. As a result, the
conference will promote adaptation and adoption of model activities that have
proven successful at various colleges and universities around the country.
Second, the conference will provide a forum for participants to share their own
laboratory and classroom activities. This will be accomplished through poster
sessions, group discussions, and collaborative work sessions. Finally, the
conference will provide a vehicle for establishing and strengthening informal
information networks linking committed biology teachers throughout the country.
Using conference activities as a springboard, participants will contribute to a
volume of new teaching materials. This informal publication will be distributed
to all conference participants and other interested biology teachers.
