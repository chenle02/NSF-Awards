The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, is
augmenting and extending for another two years the work of its Washington Center
Calculus Project. The goals for the project are to build sustainable
institutional commitment to calculus reform efforts already initiated, to deepen
understanding of assessment tools appropriate to some of the new pedagogies
being used in teaching calculus, to increase the number of institutions using
reform calculus curricula, and to document the dissemination model they are
using for statewide calculus reform. This proposal broadens the scope of the
work in which they are currently engaged, and focuses more upon sustaining and
institutionalizing curricular reform, rather than initiating it, and upon
developing and documenting assessment and dissemination methods appropriate to
regional initiatives. Activities include assessment workshops, an Assessment
Task Force with a seed grant program for assessment projects, curriculum
workshops for faculty members, site visits, newsletters, and follow-up
workshops.
