Experiments directed at understanding various aspects of the electronic
structure of solids using two primary techniques are described in this proposal:
soft x-ray emission spectroscopy and inelastic electron scattering spectroscopy.
They have designed and built a soft x-ray emission spectrograph with a number of
unique features. The sample chamber is a UHV system with an argon ion gun for
cleaning and an Auger spectrometer to check sample surfaces. The toroidal
holographic diffraction gratings focus the emission spectrum onto a high quantum
efficiency- position-sensitive detector. They have recently added a sample entry
airlock so samples can be changed without letting air in the chamber. The
pressure in the sample chamber is in the 10 to the minus ten range. The
inelastic electron scattering spectrometer was built several years ago, and has
been used for a wide variety of projects. They are able to measure the momentum
transfer dependence of spectral features revealing dynamical effects. In
addition a wide energy range can be covered allowing a Kramers-Kronig analysis
to be carried out.
