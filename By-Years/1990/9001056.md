Professor Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the density, heat capacity and phase equilibria of
polymerizing liquids; she will also be testing a number of theoretical models
that may be applicable to them. This work will help us to understand how and why
polymerization occurs ultimately allowing us to design and produce better
plastics, synthetic oils and clothing materials. Greer is pursuing a two pronged
attack to find out firstly, if certain theoretical models that have been
proposed do in fact correctly predict the behavior of reversible polymerization.
These systems often refered to as "living polymers" because the polymer-monomer
equilbrium can be reversibly shifted by temperature changes; thus, mimicking
chemical equilbrium behavior. Secondly, Greer will examine the concept of
Wheeler et al. that the static properties (density and heat capacity) can, in
fact, be treated as critical phenomena. Moreover, Greer hopes to see whether or
not the theories used to predict and describe phase transitions in magnets can
also be used to describe her "living polymer" systems' reversible equilibria
properties.
