Orbifold is the space with simplest kind of singularity where it is locally
modeled on the quotient of a smooth manifold by a finite group. They appear
naturally in many subjects of mathematics and physics. A classical theory due to
Satake has been existed for half of century. But it fails to capture the true
nature of orbifolds. In this proposal, the principal investigator proposes to
systematically study "stringy" geometry and topology of orbifolds, i.e., stringy
properties of orbifolds arisen from string theory.

The principal investigator, Yongbin Ruan, proposes to systematically study what
is called the stringy geometry and topology of orbifolds. These are important
geometric objects arisen from geometry in mathematics and from string theory in
physics, and involve with many branches of mathematics. This proposal seeks to
develop close and fruitful interactions among those fields. The project is
interdisciplinary in its conception. Both physical and mathematical ideas are
used in an essential way. Through research seminar, organizing and participating
at national and international conference this proposal will also enhance the
training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral
fellows.
