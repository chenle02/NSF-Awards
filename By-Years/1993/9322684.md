This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, seeks to develop methods for the characterization of chiral compounds
using lanthanide ion based chemical shift reagents in nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR). Cyclodextrins are used as chiral complexing agents, and
lanthanide chelates are chemically coupled to the cyclodextrins. Chemical shifts
are observed in the NMR spectra which are dependent on which enantiomer is
complexed by the cyclodextrin. This study addresses an important problem in
biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. Many physiologically active drugs are
only effective in one configuration; the chemically identical mirror image of
the compound may be totally ineffective. It is therefore critical to be able to
determine the composition of mixtures of these mirror image compounds
(enantiomers) that result from the synthetic procedure. The methodology based on
magnetic resonance spectroscopy being developed at Bates College will allow two
enantiomers to be distinguished, and may also allow the absolute configuration
of the compounds to be determined.
