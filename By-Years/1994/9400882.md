9400882 Lieman This award funds the research of Professor Daniel Lieman on
properties of zeta functions of specific elliptic curves. This work is in
keeping with a major theme in modern number theory, that discrete geometric
information can be studied analytically. This approach seems to be very
effective for problems in number theory, particularly diophantine problems. This
work falls in the general area of Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of
properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of systematic
mathematics. Number theorists often study diophantine problems where equations
are required to have exact numerical solutions. In modern days, these
diophantine problems have furnished the driving force to creation of new
theories in many other parts of mathematics. Recently Number Theory and
diophantine methods have found astonishing applications in theoretical computer
science and communication.
