Mathematicians frequently illustrate proofs with an accompanying diagram. The
aim of this endeavor is to investigate the hypothesis that these diagrams serve
as a proof plan - a high level description of how the proof is to be carried
out. This will be done by building a computer program which can interpret
diagrams as plans to be followed by an automated reasoning program. Preliminary
results suggest that the automated reasoning task is much simplified by the
presence of guidance from the diagram. The work will proceed by identifying new
theorems to be proved using the system, and diagrams that may be associated with
them, and by implementing rules for interpreting these diagrams as proof plans
which will then be passed to our automated reasoning system. Weaknesses in the
existing automated reasoning system have been identified, and these will also be
addressed.
