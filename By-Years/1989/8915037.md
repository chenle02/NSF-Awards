The thermotolerant nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhodospirillum centenum, isolated
in 1987, is unique among photosynthetic prokaryotes in that it produces
desiccation- and heat- resistant cysts. R. centenum is the only Rhodospirillum
species known to be amenable to facile genetic and molecular biological
analysis. More than 100 mutants with defects in photosynthetic metabolism have
been isolated, and these will be characterized biochemically as part of a major
objective, namely, mapping the order of the photosynthesis genes of this
organism. Determination of the gene order will provide data of importance for
future work on "photochemical reaction centers" and for assessing the possible
significance of "lateral gene transfer" in the evolution of photosynthetic
systems. Control of expression of photosynthesis genes in R. centenum will also
be investigated, especially in regard to effects of molecular oxygen. Because
the availability of an increased range of unusual phenotypes provides
experimental systems of value for study of a number of fundamental problems,
searches for previously unknown biotypes of non- oxygenic photosynthetic
bacteria will continue using various selective enrichment and other procedures.
Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are widely distributed in nature and have
been isolated from a great variety of ecological niches. In certain locales they
have been identified as primary producers of organic matter and they are
prominent catalysts in various geochemical cycles. They have also emerged as
outstanding experimental systems for analysis of the basic mechanisms of energy
conversion in all types of photosynthetic organisms. It is important to decipher
the evolutionary relationships between these organisms. Using both classical
genetics and molecular biology, these relationships will be explored with the
recently discovered bacterium, Rhodospirillum centenum.
