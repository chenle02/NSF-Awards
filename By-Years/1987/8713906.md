The goal of this research is to develop polymeric precursors for TiN and related
transition metal nitride ceramic fibers. This work will involve a detailed
exploration of the synthesis and chemistry of titanium-imido polymers (Ti(NR)2)x
prepared by the reaction of Ti(NR'2)4 reagents with primary amines. Preliminary
experiments indicate that these polymers can be drawn into fibers and the fibers
then converted into TiN ceramic fibers. The in- depth characterization of the
polymer to ceramic conversion will constitute an important part of the proposed
research as will the materials characterization of the TiN ceramics which result
from the polymeric precursors. Extensions of the research to developing
polymeric precursors for other transition metal and rare earth nitrides and
phosphides is also planned.
