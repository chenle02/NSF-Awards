Ashworth 9701752 This award supports a 12 month Hapan Society for the Promotion
of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Michael Ashworth at the Tokyo
Institute for Technology, Okayama, Japan. Dr. Ashworth will be working with Dr.
Akio Hosoya, Professor in the Department of Physics, on a research project
entitled, "Quantum Tunneling between Different Topologies." Over the past
several decades scholars have attempted to unite two fundamental theories of
current physics - quantum mechanics and general relativity - in that although
they describe two different extremes of the universe, there are indications that
they should be considered limiting cases of a broader theory. One of the
analytical areas that these two theories have equal footing is in the early
universe. Research suggests that if the universe was exclusively a quantum
object it would have a complicated topology with wormholes - something like a
sponge. A research question that arises is: why has the universe not frozen into
one of these exotic typologies? One likely explanation suggests that a process
of "quantum tunneling" occurs between different topologies, similar to that
which occurs as electrons tunnel through a potential energy barrier. The
proposed research will focus on the process of quantum tunneling, the goals
being: 1) a more complete understanding of quantum gravity theory and universal
topologies, and; 2) an attempt to consolidate currently competing theories. ***
