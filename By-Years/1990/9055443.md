The goal of this project is to transfer new assessment technologies from
researchers to education practitioners. This would enable curriculum development
teams to align curriculum and assessment within the classroom, and provide
teachers the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use new assessments
embedded within the curriculum. To accomplish this, the project will produce
hands-on training materials for enhancing teachers' and other educators'
capabilities to use, and for some to construct, new forms of student assessments
--such as portfolios and hands-on investigations--that are aligned with
curricular reform in science and mathematics education. To this end, prototype
hands-on training materials will be developed and field tested. Prior to
developing the prototype materials, the project will create new assessments, in
order to study the steps involved in producing the assessments, and then work
with teachers and other educators to find out how best to transfer new test-
development technologies from research staff to those involved in classroom and
school test development. The final product will be two hands-on training
packages, one for providing preservice and inservice teachers with the knowledge
and skills to use new assessments and another, building on the first, to provide
teachers, graduate students in science education, supervisors, and other
educators the knowledge and skills to create and evaluate new assessments. The
cost sharing will be a minimum of 13% of the NSF portion.
