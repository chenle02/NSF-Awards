The aim of this project is the integration of macromolecular science throughout
the undergraduate chemistry core curriculum, culminating in an advanced
experimental survey of polymer characterization and synthesis in senior level
physical and polymer chemistry courses. Major instrumentation will be purchased
for senior undergraduate level laboratory experiments focusing on modern
instrumental techniques used for polymer molecular weight determination and
physical characterization.
