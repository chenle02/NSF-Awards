Vrijenhoek and Avise will survey mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and
phylogeny in unisexual Poeciliopsis fishes and their bisexual progenitors in
order to capitalize upon the unique advantages afforded by these atypical
genetic systems for addressing two questions of broad significance to
evolutionary biology: (1) is the inheritance of mtDNA strictly maternal? and (2)
what are the evolutionary longevities and phylogenetic relationships of
vertebrates that reproduce by asexual or semi- sexual means? The hybridogenetic
strains will be studied for evidence of paternally-derived mtDNA indicative of
occasional, low-level "paternal leakage" of mtDNA into zygotes. Both gynogenetic
and hybridogenetic Poeciliopsis will be studied in terms of mtDNA phylogeny. By
comparing mtDNA variability within and among the unisexual strains and their
sexually-reproducing progenitors, the investigators will estimate the ages,
clonal diversities, and phylogenetic origins of fishes complex. Results should
help in addressing long-standing concerns about the evolutionary longevities of
unisexual taxa, and hence about the evolutionary consequences of asexual
reproduction.
