This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and registration expenses of
10 young scientists and 20 invited speakers selected to participate in the
Structural, Functional and Evolutionary Genomics Gordon Conference which will be
held on June 19-23, 2005, at Bates College in Lewiston,
Maine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will provide formal and informal
opportunities for the participants to interact to share ideas and to stimulate
collaborations. This provides the young scientists with invaluable exposure to
outside perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and
also enables them to explore their career objectives. This conference
contributes to the professional development of young scientists who will lead
this growing field in the coming decades.&lt;br/&gt;
