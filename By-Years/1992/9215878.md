Brunvand This research merges two efforts in asynchronous circuit compilation.
These are the work of Gopalakrishnan on the language hopCP and its use in
verification; and the work of Brunvand on asynchronous circuit compilation. The
research is: 1. enhancing the expressive power as well as the semantic clarity
of concurrent hardware description languages for asynchronous circuits and
systems; 2. extending the formal basis for compiling from HDL's to circuit
designs; 3. formally characterizing and improving the optimizations used in
asynchronous circuit compilation; and 4. studying the performance of implemented
circuits with regard to a variety of parameters.
