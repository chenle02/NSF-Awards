9734491 Wang This research project is supported under the Early Career
Development (CAREER) program. This premier program emphasizes the importance the
National Science Foundation places on the early development of academic careers
dedicated to stimulating the discovery process in which the excitement of
research is enhanced by inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning. It combines
in a single program the support of research and education of the highest quality
and in the broadest sense. The research activity involves the use of ultrasound-
modulated optical tomography (USMOT), a novel system combining an ultrasonic
transducer and a laser system, to study the acousto- optical effects in liquid
and gel turbid media (e.g. biological tissues). The specific tasks of the
activity include: 1) computer modeling of turbid acousto-optics; 2) effects of
the ultrasonic wave on the ultrasound modulation of light; 3) effects of the
light source on the ultrasound modulation of light; 4) effects of the relative
configuration between the ultrasonic wave and light on the ultrasound modulation
of light; 5) effects of the acoustic and optical properties and geometry of the
media; and 6) characterization and optimization of images of turbid media. The
educational plan aims to directly involve students in the research, with
specific goals including the development of a new course in Optical Imaging,
expansion of an existing course in Medical Imaging, and outreach to pre-college
students through the Texas A&amp;M Summer Student Program. It is conjectured
that the development of turbid acousto-optics as a new field in optical
engineering may lead to applications in medicine, underwater detection, and
atmospheric optics. ***
