&lt;br/&gt;This research involves two applications of graph algorithms; the
first&lt;br/&gt;regards communication in networks, the second involves solving
flow&lt;br/&gt;problems in structured networks. The investigators study
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for finding paths connecting many communicating parties in
a network.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is that the paths do not overutilize any
particular link in&lt;br/&gt;the network. The second item the investigators will
study is&lt;br/&gt;the famous problem of routing the maximum amount of flow
through&lt;br/&gt;a network. This problem is itself interesting and has
numerous&lt;br/&gt;applications in fields as diverse as transportation and
computer vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the
investigaters study low congestion routing in&lt;br/&gt;networks. This problem
is easy in a relaxed fractional setting but&lt;br/&gt;notoriously difficult in
an integral setting. Recent work has&lt;br/&gt;established relationships between
a cut based upper bound and the&lt;br/&gt;fractional lower bound on this
problem. These results will lead to&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the
integral version of this problem.&lt;br/&gt;Research on this problem has made
use of techniques from linear&lt;br/&gt;programming, randomized rounding,
combinatorial graph theory, as well&lt;br/&gt;as geometric embeddings of graph
metrics. For the maximum flow&lt;br/&gt;problem, the investigaters study ideas
in a recent maximum flow&lt;br/&gt;algorithm in order to extend them to the
minimum cost flow problem.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators also study the maximum
flow problems on planar and&lt;br/&gt;other restricted classes of graphs.
