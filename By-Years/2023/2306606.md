The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a motion sickness mitigation technology for passengers in moving
vehicles. Any passenger in a moving vehicle is subject to inertial forces
associated with accelerations (e.g., speeding up, braking, turning, etc.). These
inertial forces cause the passengerâ€™s head and body to sway, which along with
visual inputs, may lead to motion sickness and discomfort. One in three adults
in the US is prone to motion sickness in moving vehicles. The goal of this
project is to validate the need and commercial potential of a new motion
sickness mitigation technology for the automotive and trucking industries that
makes use of predictive algorithms to anticipate impending actions of a moving
vehicle and their impact on the passenger.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel technology that
makes use of predictive algorithms that employ real-time and historical data to
predict the actions of moving vehicles, specifically those actions that lead to
passenger discomfort and motion sickness. These predictions may be used to
provide preemptive cues to the passenger via auditory, visual, and/or haptic
stimuli to make them aware of the impending motion events. The goal of this
research is to determine which combination of these cues and what time horizon
of preemption is ideally suited to provide the passenger sufficient forewarning
that can lower motion sickness. Preliminary results have shown the efficacy of
such preemptive cues under specific conditions. This project may enable the
development and testing of key hypotheses related to commercialization of this
motion sickness mitigation technology in the automotive and trucking industries.
