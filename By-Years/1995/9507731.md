This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology from the City University of New York. The student will study the
factors leading to the expulsion of some rural Mayan Indians from their
traditional communities in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. The student
will measure the impacts of proselytization, political conflict, poverty,
marginality, illness and alcoholism as causes of religious conversion in this
one community. Using a combination of a survey of a community of resettled
Indians, ethnographic research in their community of origin as well as their
community of residence, the student will estimate the strengths of the distinct
factors leading to religious conversion as well as the importance of conversion
compared with political factionalism in the expulsions. This research is
important because it will add to our expertise about this important area of the
world, as well as shed light on the multiple factors leading to religious
changes, local community conflict and urbanization in an under-developed
society. This case study will be valuable for the construction of general theory
on these issues.
