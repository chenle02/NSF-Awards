This award supports work related to the combinatorial, geometric and
representation-theoretic aspects of semi-simple algebra groups. In particular,
the principal investigator will determine the singular loci of Schubert
varieties; will determine the multiplicity of a singular point on a Schubert
variety; will establish Postulation formulae for tangent cones at singular
points on a Schubert variety; and will write the equations of the conormal
bundle of a Schubert variety. She will also develop a Standard Monomial Theory
for Quivers; and will devise a combinatorial construction for quantum groups.
The research supported involves invariant theory and algebraic groups. In
general, invariant theory involves the actions of linear algebraic groups on
manifolds or linear spaces and the determination of the mathematical invariants
of the space under these group actions.
