Scientific Systems Co. Inc. propose to develop an active model-based control
system for commercial scale combustors. Active control of combustion processes
is needed to operate high performance, low emission burners, gas generators,
power turbines and waste incinerators, in industry sectors such as power,
aerospace and waste management. Theoretical and experimental methods will be
developed to validate analytical models of combustion dynamics. Specifically,
Scientific Systems, Inc. will use experiments and innovative System
Identification tools for constructing dynamic models of combustion process,
fabricate and test fuel injector and flame stabilization mechanisms and use the
framework of fuzzy supervised Model Predictive Control and Adaptive Control.
Experiments will be conducted at the combustion facility in the Adaptive Control
Laboratory at MIT.
