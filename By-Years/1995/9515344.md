9515344 Scholz Why do citizens obey democratic laws? Consider, for example tax
laws to collect money for desired public goods or environmental laws to minimize
widely-recognized public bads. Obedience would leave everyone better off, but
the temptation to free ride and shirk citizenship duties makes obedience an
uncertain proposition. Is Hobbesian deterrence essential to gain compliance, or
can social cooperation support compliance with laws designed to resolve
collective action problems? Scholz's prior NSF research suggests that compliance
behavior can only partly be explained by deterrence, and that a theory of
cooperation in collective action situations is needed to understand obedience
with democratic laws. His proposed "trust heuristic" explains cooperation in
terms of trust in government, trust in other citizens, and other civic attitudes
that reflect the positive and negative experiences the citizen has with the
cooperative. Tm the extent that the individual's likelihood of cooperation
increases as attitudes become more positive toward the collective, these
attitudinal heuristics replicate the "nice, retaliatory, yet forgiving"
characteristics associated with robust cooperative strategies in prisoners
dilemma games, and hence may provide the basis for social cooperation. The trust
heuristic represents "social capital" which dramatically increases the ability
of weak enforcement agencies to maintain compliance (cooperation) with laws
resolving collective action problems. To further develop and test this
hypothesis and also to provide a more solid foundation for the theory of
cooperation in large-scale collective action settings, the current research: 1)
extends existing results based on 2-person, full information prisoners dilemma
games to investigate the generic properties of robust strategies capable of
supporting cooperative solutions to n- person collective action problems. 2)
utilizes laboratory experiments to test the correspondence bet ween formal
strategies and heuristics used by human subjects in collective action settings.
The research integrates the diverse approaches of five productive researchers
essential for tackling the challenging problem of cooperation in large-scale
collective action settings. The combined methodology can be applied to numerous
other collective action problems and should be of great interest to a variety of
social science researchers. ***
