This project is concerned with two problems in the theory of modular forms. The
principal investigator will study bounding the norm of the Poincare theta
operator. She will also study modular integrals with rational period functions
using a cohomological approach. Modular forms arose out of non-Euclidean
geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and
physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental importance
are non- Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is principally concerned
with questions about the whole numbers. However, in its use of geometry and
analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems in
areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in
information theory.
