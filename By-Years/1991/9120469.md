The enzyme aspartokinase plays a central role in bacterial amino acid
biosynthesis. It catalyzes the first step in the aspartate pathway, whose
products include four of the eight amino acids that are essential for the
nutrition of the adult human. The control of the aspartate pathway depends
largely on the presence of isozymes of aspartokinase, which differ in the
regulation of their synthesis and activity. Our major research accomplishments
in the last two years include the general definition at the genetic, enzymatic,
and physiological level of the complete aspartokinase isozyme pattern of
Bacillus subtilis and the detailed characterization of the operon that encodes
one of these isozymes, aspartokinase II (AKII). The primary aim of the proposed
research is to study the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the
AKII operon, the mode of allosteric regulation of AKII by its feedback inhibitor
L- lysine, and the physiological function of the two non-identical subunits of
AKII. A parallel line of investigation, to be begun while the studies on AKII
are in progress, will focus on the other aspartokinase isozymes of B. subtilis,
of which one (AKI) is inhibited by the cell wall constitute diaminopmelate and
the other (AKIII) by threonine and lysine. AKI functions primarily in the
synthesis of diaminopimelate during growth in rich media and in the production
of diaminopimelate and dipicolinate during sporulation, whereas AKII and AKIII
serve in the biosynthesis of lysine, threonine, and methionine in growth cells.
Initial experiments will involve the cloning and sequencing of the genes
encoding AKI and AKIII and will be following by the study of the mechanisms that
regulate the synthesis and activity of these enzymes. The in-depth study of the
control of these important regulatory enzymes will contribute fundamentally to
our understanding of the principles and strategies of metabolic regulation.
