9400746 Crannell This program provides opportunities for undergraduate students
to be active participants in solar physics research in the Laboratory for
Astronomy and Solar Physics (LASP) at Goddard Space Flight Center. The LASP
group is at the forefront of current research in the development and
implementation of Fourier-Transform imaging for the hard X-ray and gamma-ray
emission sources in solar flares. The projects available for student
participation in the Solar Physics Branch in LASP include an instrument to be
flown on a small satellite, a shuttle payload, a rocket flight, and a balloon
flight. The potential computer modeling and data analysis projects are supported
by a growing number of data sets available through the Solar Data Analysis
Center and the participation of Goddard scientists as mentors for students. ***
