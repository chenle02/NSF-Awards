The Tiospaye program increases the number of Native American students graduating
from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology with bachelor's degrees in
engineering through providing financial, academic, professional, and social
support structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiospaye is a Lakota word meaning
extended family; the extended family of engineering supports Native American
students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social activities. The
engineering extended family includes scholarship recipients as well as other
students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni/alumnae, employers, community
leaders, student family members, tribal members, and our tribal college
partners, most notably Oglala Lakota College. The implementation of financial
support through awarding scholarships, in combination with the web of student
support efforts facilitated through one-on-one and one-on-small group contact
with the engineering extended family concept significantly increases the
pathways to success for Native American students.
