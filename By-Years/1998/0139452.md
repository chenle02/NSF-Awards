This research is focused on investigation of single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The one-dimensional structural
characteristics of SWNTs could lead to novel correlated electronic states which
is one of the most fundamental issues in condensed matter physics. NMR will be
used to examine the correlation of electrons in SWNTs. The properties of SWNTs
can be modified by Li and K intercalations and NMR will be used to investigate
the intercalation mechanism and characterize changes of electronic properties.
This could lead to new methods for tailoring the properties of SWNTs with
applications including Li batteries. Finally, the accessibility of SWNTs by gas
molecules and the characteristics of adsorption will be investigated. This study
provides insight into the nano-confinement effects on nanofluids and could
provide crucial information for the development of SWNT-based molecular sensors
and filters. This research provides an excellent opportunity for students to
acquire a broad knowledge and research capabilities including novel materials
synthesis, state-of-the-art spectroscopy, fundamental physics, and applications
suitable for a wide range of careers including in academe, industry, and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on investigation of
single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), a seamless cylinder formed by wrapping a
graphene sheet. The study aims at understanding the electronic properties,
especially novel characteristics associated with the one-dimensional nature of
the structure. Modifications of SWNT properties by lithium and potassium
intercalations will also be explored with potential applications such as high-
density lithium batteries. Trapping of ambient gas molecules inside the tubes of
SWNTs will be studied. This could lead to sensitive molecular sensors and
efficient gas filters. The main technique to be used is nuclear magnetic
resonance, which provides detailed information on structures, molecular motion,
and electronic properties. This research provides an excellent opportunity for
students to acquire a broad knowledge and research capabilities including novel
materials synthesis, state-of-the-art spectroscopy, fundamental physics, and
applications suitable for a wide range of careers including in academe,
industry, and government. It will also attract high school and undergraduate
students to the exciting field of nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
