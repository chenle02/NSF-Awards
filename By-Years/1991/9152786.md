The Geology Department is purchasing equipment to capture polarizing microscope
images for use by students in several undergraduate courses, including physical
geology, mineralogy, petrology, economic geology and independent studies. This
equipment will enhance teaching by allowing better communication of ideas and
direct participation of students in the study of the properties of minerals in
both thin and polished sections.
