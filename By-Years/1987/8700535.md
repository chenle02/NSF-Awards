The program of the ASU Facility for High Resolution Electron Microscopy, within
the Center for Solid State Science, maintains a balance between the two main
functions of the Facility operation. The program of developmental research, on
the one hand, involves the exploration of new possibilities for instrumentation
and operational techniques, and for these purposes new types of microscopes are
being built, tested and further evaluated. On the other hand the Facility
provides a service for many user groups, to make the most advanced current
techniques and operational modes accessible for their research and to establish
and maintain the highest standards of performance and interpretation in high
resolution electron microscopy and associated techniques. The electron
microscopes currently used in the Facility for this latter purpose are now out-
dated, overworked and inadequate in relation to the quality and quality of the
work demanded of them. A new microscope which is more appropriate for the
purpose will be acquired. The new microscope is essential also in relation to
the educational role of the Facility. Through its annual Schools and Workshops
and continuing interactions with the scientific community the Facility has
considerable impact on the standards of electron microscopy practice and must
maintain its instrumentation at, or beyond, the state of the art in order to
perform this function adequately.
