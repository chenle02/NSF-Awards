The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue an oceanographic
instrumentation development project to develop, construct, and test a multi-
channel, in situ flow injection chemical analysis system. The objective of the
device is to make autonomous in-situ colorometric measurements of nitrate and
phosphate to full ocean depths for periods of up to six months. Simultaneous
measurement of additional inorganic nutrients is planned for he future. A
shallow water prototype has been constructed, but is depth limited because it
relies on an umbilical cable to provide power and to control the various pumps
and motors. This new effort will develop the electronics and mechanisms to
enable the analyzer to function autonomously in depths of down to 6,000 meters.
Anti-fouling measures will be developed and reagent stability tests will be made
to allow long-term unattended deployments. The analyzer is ideally suited for
testing a new scientific hypothesis about primary productivity in oligotrophic
waters being driven by sporadic and short-lived injections of nutrients. The
analyzer is also intended to have numerous applications in time-series
investigations relating to GOFS Global Geoscience initiative.
