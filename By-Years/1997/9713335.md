9713335 Swan Integrated analysis, design, and production methods are developed
for new generations of composites with continuous, three-dimensional fiber
reinforcing geometries. Continuous three-dimensional reinforcing geometries
(textiles) hold the possibility of providing new generations of FRPs with
dramatically enhanced mechanical performing characteristics. Systematic analysis
and optimization techniques are employed to determine the topology of fibrous
textile in polymer matrix composites which can maximize their three-dimensional
stiffness and strength performance characteristics. ***
