The Computer Science and Physics &amp; Astronomy Departments at Siena College,
through their Scholarships for Tech Valley Scholars in Computational,
Mathematical and Physical Sciences (CMPS), are providing scholarships for a
total of forty talented undergraduates with financial need who are majoring in
Computer Science, Mathematics, or Physics. By increasing the number and quality
of STEM majors through focused recruitment, retention, and career placement
practices, the Tech Valley Scholars (TVS) program is helping to meet regional
workforce development needs in New York's greater Hudson
Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key project elements include cohort support
activities centered on a TVS one-credit seminar each semester, continuous
mentoring and guidance of students throughout the program, and creation of an
innovative learning environment using the latest developments in STEM education
research. As TVS participants, undergraduate students gain experience working on
teams and developing skills and perspectives that are necessary for innovations
in the application of STEM technologies.
