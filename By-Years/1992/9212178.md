This project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program is for the continuation of studies by Professor Rauchfuss in
the area of transition metal-sulfur chemistry. Topics to be pursued include a
variety of studies on ruthenium-sulfur clusters with the cubane skeleton.
Special emphasis will be placed on their reactions with electrophiles and on the
investigation of the mobility of metal-metal bonds within the clusters.
Syntheses of mixed metal versions will be undertaken to provide further
information concerning the mobility of metal-metal bonds in the clusters. Newly
discovered donor solvent promoted reactions of elemental sulfur and oxidizing
sulfur compounds (carbon disulfide and organic disulfides) with metals and zero-
valent metal compounds will be explored for their synthetic utility in the
preparation of new sulfur containing transition metal compounds. %%% This
research involves the development of new chemistry of transition metals and
sulfur with emphasis on the synthesis and reactivity of polynuclear compounds.
The results of this research may aid in the development of new catalysts for use
in petroleum refining or in new advanced materials.
