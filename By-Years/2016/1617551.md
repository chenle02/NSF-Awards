Redundancy is a fundamental system characteristic that improves productivity and
resilience. Each such system has multiple, redundant configuration options with
their specific resource requirements and cost/quality tradeoffs. This project
targets applications with three types of redundancies, namely approximation,
replication, and implementation. Applications are expressed as collections of
interdependent services that operate under varying resource availabilities,
particularly energy. Each service may offer outcomes/answers of different
quality at different costs, potentially using different hardware/software
resources. The key insight is that (1) quality and cost requirements have to be
balanced across all application services, and that (2) users need to be able to
specify and explore application cost/quality tradeoffs. The project implements a
new programming architecture that effectively manages the three types of
redundancies to produce the best application outcomes under limited energy/cost
budgets and possible service failure conditions. The project targets battery-
operated smart phones and autonomous robotic systems, but extends to cloud,
enterprise and high-performance computing domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Applications are modeled as dual-weighted, directed graphs where nodes represent
different services and their quality levels, and edges represent resource or
input/output dependencies between these services and their levels. Dual weights
model the energy/cost of a service and the importance of the service and its
levels for the user. The optimal solution of the service selection problem picks
services and their levels such that the importance metric is maximized under a
given energy/cost budget. This NP-complete problem is solved using a 0-1 integer
programming formulation and state-of-the-art integer programming tools.
