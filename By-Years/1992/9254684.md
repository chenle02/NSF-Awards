The New York Hall of Science requests $829,312 over four years to develop and
circulate a traveling version of "Hidden Kindoms - The World of York Hall of
Science in April, 1991. The traveling version will consist of: an introductory
panel; 16 Easy-View microscopes exhibiting living microbes; units dealing with
size, scale and magnification; two interactive computer programs entitled
"Understanding AIDS" and "How Your Body Fights Disease"; a video microscope for
the Microscopic Life demonstration; units on virusesand bacteria; a mosaic of
color transparencies of different microorganisms; one Optech (BYOB) interactive
video microscope; three zoetropes illustrating mcrobial movement; and a mini-
laboratory room containing all the equipment and materials necessary for
maintaining the exhibit and presenting the MICROLAB workshops to students and
teachers. The 1,500 square foot exhibit will travel to nine sites over three
years. The new York Hall of Science will provide on-site training in
estasblishing and maintaining the exhibit, a weekly shipment of microrganisms
and supporting materials, an exhibit catalog, an 11-minute video featuring
living microbes, pre- and post- visit materisla for schools with suggested
activities , and programs for student and teacher workshops. A novel feature of
this traveling exhibition will be the opportunity for the host museum to retain,
on a cost-share basis, the mini- laboratory with its equipment and four Easy-
View microscopes which can become the core of a microbiology program. Biology,
