This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a high
volume manufacturing technology for the production of InnovaLight's highly
advanced silicon nanocrystal technology. InnovaLight has discovered a highly
controlled way to make high quality, uniform, and stable silicon nanocrystals
with novel properties based on original research at The University of Texas.
This is a very important discovery, as the unique properties of these
nanocrystals will enable a host of large commercial applications. However, in
order to capture this value, a high-volume manufacturing scheme will need to be
developed from the current low-volume, batch process. The ability to produce
high volumes of crystals that are favorably characterized for use in electronic
components will enable their cost-effective use in a host of electronics
applications.

Potential commercial markets include use as pixels for use in high-resolution,
low-power flat panel displays on computers and electronic instrumentation
panels. The crystals can also be made to emit a tightly confined, coherent
stream of light. This opens them up to use as lasers for short reach optical
communications, terahertz-speed optical chips, smart cards, etc. The crystals
also have extremely unique charging behavior that enables their usage in
advanced, multi-level memory chips. Such chips would have an order of magnitude
increase in capacity over existing chips. Lastly, the non-toxic nature of
silicon, coupled with the highly controlled surface chemistry of InnovaLight's
process, opens these crystals up to many biotech uses such as in vivo cancer
cell detection and oblation.
