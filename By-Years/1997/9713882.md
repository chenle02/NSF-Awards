This grant provides funding for the development of a trade-off based robust
modeling and design methodology for identification of statistically optimal
product specifications. This research will exploit concepts from utility theory
into a robust design paradigm to quantitatively incorporate qualitative
knowledge and preferences of different attributes without loss of generality and
accuracy. Statistical exploration based design of experiment techniques will be
developed to explore and generate system behavioral information, and to identify
optimal product specifications from this quantitative representation of
attribute data. By incorporating explicit representation of higher level
modeling and design knowledge in the design process, an interactive design
system will be developed to enable designers make intelligent decisions during
the design process. Industry-driven design problems will be used as case studies
to test and evaluate the proposed methodology. If successful, this research will
result in a unified methodology that offers a rigorous treatment of design
process from an overall design perspective under conditions of uncertainty in
data. The primary goal of this research involves the determination of a trade-
off based decision model formulation for direct and simultaneous treatment of
multiple objectives and constraints in the design process, and its integration
with a statistical exploration based robust optimal design generation strategy.
This research could lead to a better understanding of the engineering modeling
process, and advance the state of knowledge by which the inherent complexities
arising from representing physical design problems using idealized computer-
based abstractions can be addressed. Results of this research will also
contribute towards the identification of a consistent body of synergistic,
integrated engineering design methods based on design of experiments, utility
theory, computer-based simulation models, finite element methods, and design
optimization principles.
