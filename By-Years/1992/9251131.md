The Department of Physical Sciences is acquiring a computerized meteorological
ground station consisting of a GOES equipment package with NOAA and super NOAA
upgrades that receives RF (radio frequency) satellite signals from GOES
satellites and supporting computers. The weather satellite station serves as a
particularly strong tool for clarifying scientific concepts to non-science
students by making it possible for them to conduct experiments that are directly
related to their everyday activities. For example, students are predicting local
weather and comparing their predictions to those of the weather service and the
actual weather conditions.
