Title: Designed Collagen Heterotrimeric Helices and Nanofibrous Hydrogels

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and
arguably one of the most important proteins in nature, playing a critical role
in nearly every tissue especially bone, skin, and tendons. Furthermore, collagen
plays a major role in many diseases such as metathesis in cancer and a variety
of brittle bone diseases. Despite collagen's critical importance, its structure
and the assembly process that leads to its final fibrous form is poorly
understood. In the work funded through this grant, the Hartgerink lab at Rice
University will focus on understanding this critical molecule through an
iterative process of synthesis, analysis, and computational modeling. Molecules,
which closely mimic collagen's structure, will be prepared and their structure
determined through a variety of analytical methods including nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and transmission electron
microscopy. Based on these findings, a model will be prepared to predict new and
more complicated collagen structures. This process will allow a blueprint to be
created that will define how natural collagen assembles as well as how one can
chemically synthesize and self-assemble structurally sophisticated mimics of
collagen.

BROADER IMPACTS: It is expected that this blueprint will enhance the knowledge
of this centrally important biological molecule as well as create a useful tool
for biomaterials researchers. The research described in this grant proposal will
also be used as the basis for undergraduate and graduate educational programs
that effectively combine chemical design and synthesis with traditional
structural biology into an exciting multidisciplinary study. Furthermore,
through a secondary education outreach program, high school science teachers
will have an opportunity to participate in a research lab over summers to
develop innovative curriculum modules based on current research that can be
directly implemented in high school level chemistry and biology courses.
