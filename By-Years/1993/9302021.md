This award supports the research of Professor A. Sommese to work on the
applications of algebraic geometry to numerical analysis and problems in
linkages. In particular problems arising from the theory of over-constrained
mechanisms. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where
it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries.
Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of
equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields, but it has applications to many areas of engineering as
well. The research supported in the present proposal shows the importance of
this once purely theoretical area for robotics and manufacturing.
