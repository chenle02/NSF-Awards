This award supports the Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting,
to be held at the University of Richmond in Fall 2023, Fall 2024, and Fall 2025.
Established in 1992, the Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting
is a one-day event which convenes researchers in Virginia, North Carolina, and
neighboring states working in various fields both within and adjacent to the
mathematical discipline of analysis. Subjects to be discussed include core areas
of analysis as well as emerging application domains such as quantum computing.
The event affords early career researchers, especially graduate students,
opportunities to meet new mathematical colleagues and to disseminate their
research ideas to a wider audience. At the same time, the small size of these
events fosters community interaction and promotes increased dialogue and
networking for the benefit of all participants.

The Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting is a regional meeting
of mathematicians working in the fields of operator theory, complex analysis,
Banach spaces, and operator algebras. The meeting also places emphasis on new
connections and interactions between these subjects and adjacent and emerging
fields such as quantum computing and mathematical physics. The conference offers
a welcoming environment for people new to the discipline of analysis and to
mathematics and promotes the exchange of ideas among researchers in analysis and
related fields in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions.
