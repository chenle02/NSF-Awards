Continued development of construction productivity, quality, and worker safety
depends on innovative technology in computational geometry, computer science,
data acquisition and monitoring, metrology, and control, in addition to
traditional construction process technology. ConSolve is developing an
operations control system for earthmoving types of construction, with the
principal focus on hazardous waste site clean up. This system exploits advanced
computer science, modern metrology technology, and computer based machine
controllers on existing construction equipment. Much of the algorithmic
development and software implementation of this site control system is complete,
but the technology needs to be physically tested. This project will exercise the
site controller system on a 1/20.scale physical testbed of an earthmoving site.
The project has four tasks: (1) to exercise the communication and location
system for vehicles, (2) to evaluate the feasibility for automated site
surveying, (3) to download cutpath instructions from a central CAE system and
control vehicles accordingly, and (4) to evaluate a dynamic surface model of
site operations.
