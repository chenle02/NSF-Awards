9412471 Wang The main objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive
control design method for automotive powertrain systems. The project will start
with the generic modelling of automotive powertrain systems such that the models
developed can be tuned to describe many typical powertrain systems in
automobiles. In particular, we will develop a modelling strategy which exploits
and extends the existing models obtained from physics and static data fitting of
powertrain components to derive control-oriented dynamic models of integrated
powertrain systems. The project will be of practical importance in providing
constructive design tools for better powertrain control and performance, which
is a central concern for producing better cars at lower cost to maintain the
competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry in the international market. ***
