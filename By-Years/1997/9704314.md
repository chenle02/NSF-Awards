*** 9704314 Jannson This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop a new mathematical model, based on the Globally Optimized Inverse
Method (GOIM), to solve inverse scattering problems in diffusion tomography
(DT). Current inverse imaging techniques for highly-scattering (turbid) media
present undeniable performance limitations. Mathematical shortcomings result in
poor global inverse problem convergence in numerous applications. Phase I
research demonstrated the feasibility of the GOIM algorithm, leading, for the
first time, to the globally convergent solution of time-dependent 3-D inverse
scattering problems (ISPS) in turbid media. The GOIM algorithm (software) and
supplementary companion DT device (which consists of Commercial Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) hardware) demonstrate one example of commercial application of the
inverse scattering problem modeling process. The GOIM concept is adaptable to a
number of other commercial and national interest applications, including
underwater search and rescue; early breast cancer diagnosis; detection by Ground
Penetrating Radar (GPR) of mines/plastic explosives; airport security explosives
detection; microwave-guided secure aircraft landing (minimized "bird strike"
risk); mail bomb detection; aging aircraft nondestructive evaluation (NDE);
earthquake prediction and plasma diagnostics. ***
