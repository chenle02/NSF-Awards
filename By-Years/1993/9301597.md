This research project deals with probabilistic methods of tolerance analysis for
mechanical systems subjected to discontinuity forcing functions. The dynamic
equations are solved using the alternating frequency/time domain method. The
statistics is evaluated by determining the partial derivatives of the Fourier
coefficients with respect to the random variables which, in this research, are
link length tolerances and pin locations. These are representative of design
variables of link length tolerances, radial clearances and associated
tolerances. A nonlinear constrained optimization problem is solved in order to
maximize the variances of tolerances, while satisfying the specified
constraints. The results of this research lead to the development of an analysis
and design tool for tolerance allocation in a dynamic system such as an internal
combustion engine.***//
