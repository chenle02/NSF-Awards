A Training Program in Adaptive Optics (AO) at the University of Chicago
Adaptive optics compensates for the effect of turbulence in the earth's
atmosphere and enables large ground-based telescopes to observe the universe
with much of the clarity of space-based observatories. The program at the
University of Chicago provides training for both Ph.D level scientists expert in
this new technology as well as for training Ph.D level optical astronomers in
the application of adaptive optics technology and techniques. The program
consists of three parts: 1) Course work in astronomy, high resolution imaging
and mathematical techniques in image processing and data analysis. 2) A
laboratory program which develops new technology. This includes building
deformable mirrors, ultra low noise detectors, and using high speed digital
computers as well as developing new algorithms to process the data. A 2 watt dye
laser will be built and used for laser beacon tests in Arizona and New Mexico. A
much more powerful new solid state laser will also be used to generate
artificial beacons in the upper atmosphere. 3) A research program which builds
adaptive optics systems and uses them on large astronomical telescopes. A SD10
69 actuator adaptive optics system will be moved to Yerkes Observatory in
Wisconsin where it will be used as the first AO system to feed a very high
resolution spectrograph to be used for research on stellar seismology and a
search for planets around stars. Two other systems are being built by students
for use at the 3.5 meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.
These will be the first laser beacon adaptive optics systems available for
astronomy. Students are encouraged to work with faculty to pursue new lines of
astronomical investigations opened up by use of data from the facility and to
improve the means of enhancing and interpreting the data.
