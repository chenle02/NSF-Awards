9322052 Rowland This award provides support to the Department of Psychology at
the University of Florida to establish an REU site in the field of
psychobiology. Applicants will be solicited from schools in the Southeastern
United States, with special emphasis on smaller undergraduate and/or minority
institutions at which students do not otherwise have an opportunity for gaining
research experience. The eight selected applicants will spend 12 weeks at UF,
during which time they will complete a small research project under the direct
supervision of a faculty mentor. Ten primary faculty, all with active research
programs in the general field, will participate along with several affiliated
faculty and graduate assistants. A variety of observational, surgical,
biochemical, computer, and other analytical techniques are available to the
students. In addition to research, students will attend a classroom course which
will cover a range of relevant issues including faculty research, ethical
issues, experimental design, and principles of psychobiology. The students will
learn communication skills by giving interim and final oral reports of their
research projects. ***
