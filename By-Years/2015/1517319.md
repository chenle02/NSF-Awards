The investigators will model the magnetic field in our Milky Way Galaxy. The
Galactic Magnetic Fields (GMF) were found to have much larger scale structures
than previously thought. The magnetic field extends far above the Galactic
plane, much as the magnetic field of the Earth extends far beyond the Earth's
surface. These investigations will precisely determine the structure of the GMF,
and better-constrain the distribution of cosmic rays (relativistic electrons and
atomic nuclei), which are deflected from straight paths by the magnetic field.

The investigators will continue their work with "WINS", a program to foster
women's participation in science, mentor high school students and expand their
public lectures on astronomy.

Knowledge of the large scale structure of the GMF and cosmic rays is of
fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies and has
implications for understanding the structure and properties of the early
universe. It is also of practical importance, for determining how the emission
from our galaxy effects Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. This research
will build on the groundbreaking work of investigators, who discovered the
extended component of the GMF by using two complementary types of available
astronomical data, namely 1) Rotation Measures (RMs) of polarized light from
distant quasars, and 2) maps of polarized emission from distant clusters of
galaxies.

In the next phase of work the investigators will: 1) Incorporate the Planck
Satellite polarized synchrotron emission maps, which will fill in a critical
region. 2) Incorporate much more sophisticated and realistic modeling of the
cosmic ray distribution. 3) Take advantage of greater computing power to
accurately model the disturbed components of the GMF. Their work will be used by
physicists studying Dark Matter, either through annihilation or decay, and for
identifying the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.
