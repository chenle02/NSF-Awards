Individuals’ lives and societal outcomes are increasingly mediated by opaque
machine learning algorithms chosen and run by multi-sided online platforms using
private data. Although the platforms often claim that their algorithms take into
consideration the interests of the sides and preserve privacy, these claims are
not well-defined. Furthermore, the platforms’ algorithms also optimize for their
own objectives, such as financial or user growth. The resulting algorithmic
decision-making systems and their outcomes may be at odds with the interests of
platform participants and societal values.

The project is following a research agenda consisting of two main thrusts. The
first aims to enable the deployment of differential privacy for data sharing in
platform-specific contexts, so as to ensure rigorous privacy protections for
platform participants while enabling the platform to pursue its objectives. We
take advantage of platform-specific capabilities to develop learning-augmented
and security-augmented frameworks for reasoning about and deploying differential
privacy.

The second research thrust investigates undesirable consequences of opaque
optimizations and proposes definitions that could encode platform participants’
or societal desiderata regarding the outcomes of such optimization. It then
analyzes algorithmic, systems, and policy approaches for achieving them and
quantitatively evaluates the impact of enforcing such constraints.

Both research thrusts advance the societally important goals of enabling data-
driven innovation by multi-sided platforms while preserving privacy and fairness
for their participants.
