Corrosion fatigue failure and methods to develop life prediction schemes for
this failure mode will be studied. The approach will be based on using the da/dN
crack growth data to establish the stress-life curves in fatigue. Special
attention will be paid to mean stress effects, rate of loading and long lives of
relevance to power plants. The research will also aid manufacturing processes
which produce different residual stress levels hence different material
behaviors. Concepts of J-Integral will be used in handling crack growth both in
the low cycle fatigue and high cycle fatigue regime.
