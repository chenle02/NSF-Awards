A Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research focused on early
development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. Heterochronic transplantation
experiments will be performed to determine whether all cortical progenitor cells
are developmentally equivalent, or whether the competence of ventricular cells
to respond to environmental cues changes with increasing age. Monoclonal
antibodies against cell surface increasing age. Monoclonal antibodies against
cell surface molecules will be raised for the purpose of purifying neuronal
precursors. The developmental potential of these purified populations of
precursor cells will be studied in culture and following transplantation into
the brain in order to identify environmental factors that are involved in the
production of specific, committed neuronal phenotypes. These studies are
fundamental to understanding the development of brain regions involved in higher
cognition.
