This dissertation will investigate the joint personality and neighborhood
determinants of juvenile and adolescent antisocial behvaior. Data come from the
Rural Substance Use and Violence Project, a longitudinal survey of middle school
students in Kentucky. Part of that survey included measures of the "Five Factor
Model" of personality; data on the child's neighborhood context are also
available. Analyses using multilevel models will focus on whether each
determinant has independent effects on antisocial behavior and whether the two
interact so that both are jointly necessary. These statistical analyses will be
supplemented by qualitative data from school personnel including their reactions
to the survey instrument and the statistical results as well as an assessment of
the school atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
