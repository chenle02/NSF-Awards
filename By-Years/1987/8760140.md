The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of a novel system
for producing grass sod using organic wastes as a substitute for topsoil. In
this system, the grass seed is germinated in organic waste spread over
polyethylene film. When ready for harvesting, the sod may be rolled like
carpeting leaving the polyethylene sheet in place for the next crop. The
proposal leading to this Phase I award was submitted in response to NSF Program
Solicitation 87-8, Small Business Innovation Research. The concept was
evaluated, if found to be technically feasible, would utilize the resource
potential of otherwise wasted materials, conserve topsoil, water and fertilizer,
and improve the efficiency with which sod is produced.
