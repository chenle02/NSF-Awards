The design of new ultra-small semiconductor is being driven by the possibilities
of atomic-scale control of fabrication. Fabrication at the Angstrom scale means
that quantum mechanical effects will be important. One of the first results of
advances in crystal growth techniques which allow atomic scale control of
heterostructure device fabrication are superlattices. In order to characterize
the device, electron transport coefficients must be obtained. Electron transport
perpendicular to the lattice structure is important but difficult to calculate
since the scale of the superlattice is of the same order of magnitude as the
atomic lattice. This Engineering Initiation project will use the Monte Carlo
simulation technique to investigate transport in superlattice devices. For the
first time, high field effects will be examined. Particular attention will be
paid to the interaction between transferred electron (Gunn effect) phenomena and
superlattice band-folding effects; this knowledge will provide ideas for new
device implementations. Furthermore, this research not only will contribute to
the area of Solid-State and Microstructures but the Monte Carlo techniques are
computationally intensive so that new algorithms will be developed which will
enhance Computational Engineering. This Engineering Initiation Award is jointly
supported by the Computational Engineering and Solid-State & Microstructures
Programs. The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is fully capable of
carrying out the research. I strongly recommend support.
