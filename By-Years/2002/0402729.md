An accurate determination of the plasma temperature distribution is an essential
first step to understanding the dynamics, density, and filling factor of coronal
loops, the closed magnetic field structures filled with hot plasma that
dominates the high-energy emissions from the Sun. These quantities are important
inputs in determining, e.g., the energy balance and heating requirements of a
region, coronal loop stability, and calculations of radiative losses and
conductive cooling in a given feature. This proposed effort will examine the
temperature profile, density structure, and temporal evolution of coronal loops.
With this information, and by using estimates of the coronal magnetic field,
elemental abundances, bulk flows, waves, and turbulent motions from previous
measurements, the dominant energy loss mechanisms can be determined for
different (and possibly different types of) coronal
loops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines high-resolution EUV spectral
line data from the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Coronal Diagnostics
Spectrometer with EUV and X-ray imaging data from other instruments. These
observational results will be compared with the temperature profiles predicted
by various coronal-heating mechanisms in order to determine which of these
mechanisms, if any, is responsible for the loop heating. The detailed
quantitative results will be made available to theoreticians studying coronal
heating. In addition, this investigation will provide improved temperature
cross-calibrations of the instruments and a quantification of the uncertainties
inherent in the use of the individual data sets. The resulting algorithms will
be made available to the scientific community by integrating them into existing
software libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students
will play a vital role in the proposed analysis. The associated outreach
project, Breaking the Secret Code of Starlight, introduces 5th graders from the
Memphis inner-city school system to the basics of spectroscopy by answering the
question, What are stars made of? Too many local students think the answer has
more to do with magic than with physics. Starlight teaches students how
scientists use spectroscopy to find the answer. Groups of 5th graders come to
the University on field trips to participate in the Starlight program, or teams
of undergraduates bring Starlight directly to the classrooms. The program
started small, with about 10 classes of 25 students each, but the number of
students and teachers who have participated in Starlight has now reached 5000.
