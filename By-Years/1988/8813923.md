The objectives of this project are (1) to extend the variability methods of
seismic analysis to situations where the soil boundary swiftness matrix is
associated with an unbounded region, and (2) to develop a set of nonlinear
constitutive equations for the soil. This will make it possible to evaluate the
effects of variation in the soil constitutive properties on the seismic ground
motions and hence on the response of soil-(embedded) structure systems subjected
to such ground motions. These results will be verified against Monte Carlo
simulations. The algebraic complexities of the formulae depicting the higher-
order statistical approximations will be handled in a digital computer by
symbolic manipulation languages germane to artificial intelligence procedures.
Automated sequential refinements of the final results of the statistical
correlations will be explored. A major effort will be expended to develop a
computer code which implements an appropriate stochastic equivalent
linearization method within the framework of a finite element analysis to
achieve this objective. Efforts will also be made to develop analytical outlines
as to how the variability and nonlinear response analyses can be combined. This
project will seek to fully extend the applicability of stochastic methods in
earthquake engineering so that the inherent randomness and uncertainty existing
in these problems can be rationally dealt with.
