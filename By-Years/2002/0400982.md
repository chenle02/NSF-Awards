I propose a program of research in the general area of &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial
set theory, with an emphasis on "singular cardinal&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics" in
the style of Shelah. An example of the sort of &lt;br/&gt;questions that I
propose to work on is the question (due to Woodin)&lt;br/&gt;whether failure of
SCH at a singular cardinal implies the existence of&lt;br/&gt;an Aronszajn tree
at the successor of that cardinal. I am interested in&lt;br/&gt;obtaining ZFC
results as well as complementary consistency results: &lt;br/&gt;the methods
that I plan to use include PCF theory, inner models, Radin forcing&lt;br/&gt;and
some recent generalisations of proper forcing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial set theory can be seen as an attempt to take some
very&lt;br/&gt;elementary mathematical ideas (counting, ordering, permuting)
and&lt;br/&gt;make sense of them in the context of infinite sets. Typical
problems might&lt;br/&gt;involve finding an infinite path through an infinite
tree, or colouring &lt;br/&gt;the vertices in an infinite graph so that no two
adjacent vertices have &lt;br/&gt;the same colour. Problems of this kind turn
out to be surprisingly&lt;br/&gt;deep and have found applications in many areas
of mathematics. The focus&lt;br/&gt;of my proposal is problems involving so-
called "singular cardinals",&lt;br/&gt;which (by some measure) are the hardest
infinite sets to understand.
