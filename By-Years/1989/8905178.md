U.S. and Polish physicists have collaborated informally for several years in
the areas of quantum optics and atomic physics. The re-establishment of formal
programs for cooperation between the United States and Poland makes it possible
to renew and continue these collaborations. The partnership between Joseph H.
Eberly of the University of Rochester and Iwo Bialynicki-Birula of the
Instsitute of Physics ofthe Polish Academy of Sciences has been particular
fruitful, focusing on the study of atoms and photons in interaction with each
other. Among other achievements, members of the U.S. and Polish teams have been
responsible for the first observations of the statistical enhancement of
multiphoton transitions in two-photon ionization, and of intense coherent light
beams carrying large-scale quantum flucations. This project will extend the
collaboration to include the involvement of experimental workers, particularly
J.E. Bayfield of the University of Pittsburgh and C. Radzewicz of Warsaw
University. It is expected that this project will result in futher important
contributions to our fundamental understanding of quantum and nonlinear optics
and atomic physics. The project fulfills the NSF U.S.-Eastern Europe Cooperative
Science Program's objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interset and competence.
