The team will investigate the dynamic restructuring of the magnetic field and
plasma within coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and background solar corona, as CME
disturbances propagate and expand through the heliosphere. In this study, the
Principal Investigator (PI) will exploit a recently developed technique which
enables, for the first time, the isolation of a CME signal from the background
corona in space-based and ground-based coronagraph images at fine resolution. By
clearly separating the CME disturbance from ambient coronal plasma structures,
the PI's team expects to determine the response of the coronal magnetic field
and heliospheric plasma to such disturbances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this
new method, the PI will greatly improve the detection and classification of CME
events, from large CMEs down to faint plasma blobs at the level of instrumental
noise, enabling a more detailed statistical study of CMEs. He will also be able
to create 3D plasma density maps of the corona over a solar cycle, and such maps
will be extremely useful for coronal modeling, for interpreting heliospheric
plasma observations, and for direct study of the height of the corona and its
temporal evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation of the initiation
and propagation of CMEs will increase our understanding of the fundamental
properties of astrophysical shock development and propagation in general, and
enable the development of predictive tools for when CME disturbances could have
a significant impact on the Earth's space environment. The PI's online CME
database will be made accessible to the public, with special sections designed
for explaining to non-scientists the nature of CMEs and their potential impact
on the Earth. The techniques developed here for CME separation and detection
will be useful to the wider image processing community.
