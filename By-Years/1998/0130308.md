With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will upgrade
a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will facilitate research in the
following areas: a) microscale determinations of structures, stereochemistry or
ligand/receptor interactions using nano- to micro-gram amounts of ligands; b)
studies of helical conjugated molecules; c) development of a genetic screen for
proteins in vivo based on catalytic activity; d) de novo protein design; and e)
synthesis of molecules with interesting properties, such as a catalyst that
selectively binds and hydrolyzes cocaine in vivo.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and
synthetic chemistry.
