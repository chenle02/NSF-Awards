This research will study the role of the family in the adaptation of
contemporary immigrant-minorities to American Society. Through in-depth
interviews with a sample of recent Asian immigrants, the researchers will
examine experiences in the labor market and in housing. The aim is to develop a
better understanding of how family bonds affect the various adaptation
strategies of contemporary immigrants and to predict the consequences of these
strategies for socioeconomic attainment. The study will generate new insights
about the links between ethnicity, the family, and economic success.
