Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College (LCOOCC) will enhance the ability
of rural and minority populations on and near the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa
reservation in northwestern Wisconsin and at two outreach sites that serve the
Bad River and Red Cliff bands of Ojibwa to succeed in careers in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The College will undertake a
comprehensive assessment of community needs as well as institutional strengths
and weaknesses in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment outcomes will
drive systemic reform strategies, lead to more effective use of limited
resources and further the development of the nation's technologically based
workforce. Primary goals of the project are threefold: (1) assessment of
community and employer needs and opportunities for STEM-related education and
professionals; (2) identification of strategies for increasing student
enrollment, retention and graduation in STEM foundation courses and program
areas; and, (3) evaluation of STEM student performance to eliminate bottlenecks
and strengthen STEM competencies.&lt;br/&gt;
