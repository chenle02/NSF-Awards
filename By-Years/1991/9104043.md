Partial evaluation is a program transformation technique for specializing a
program with respect to some known part of its input. The resulting residual
program has the property that when applied to the remaining part of the input,
it will yield the desired result. Since many problems can be shown to be
"specializations" of a more general problem, this provides the basis for a
simple, automatic, formal methods approach to program development. This research
comprises a comprehensive, in-depth study of the theory of partial evaluation.
Expected results include: (1) a better understanding of the mathematical
principles upon which partial evaluation is based, (2) better strategies for
implementing a partial evaluator, including various static analyses to enhance
performance, (3) plans for applications of partial evaluation, including: (a)
semantics-based compilation (the automatic generation of compilers from
denotational semantics specifications), (b) incremental computation (the
automatic generation of incremental programs from non-incremental ones), and (c)
program execution monitoring (the automatic generation of monitors - debuggers,
profilers, etc. - from a standard continuation semantics).
