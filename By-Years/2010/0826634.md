The objective of project is to develop a method for estimating structural
parameters (e.g., stiffness and damping), which will facilitate monitoring of
structural health and detection of damage. This research will utilize the
substructure identification method for accurate damage localization. The error
analysis will be conducted to indicate sources of estimation inaccuracies,
thereby suggesting approaches to modify structural behavior via the utilization
of structural control techniques optimally to reduce the estimation errors. The
approach will accommodate lack of excitation information and large measurement
noise. The research will provide easy, quick and accurate structural parameter
estimation methods that can be used for significantly improved characterization
of the health of structures and the detection and localization of damage,
whether from acute events such as natural disasters or long-term degradation due
to environment and human use and abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods
developed will have applicability to mechanical and aerospace structures as
well. The results will be disseminated to research community and industry
through publications and conference presentations. Undergraduate and graduate
students will be exposed to, and will explore, topics in structural health
monitoring and structural control, preparing them to be leaders in their future
careers. The results of the experiments will be used to develop a course
materials for courses in structural dynamics.
