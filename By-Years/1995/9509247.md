9509247 Figge The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Regina A. Figge to work with Dr. Thomas F.
Stocker at the University of Bern in Switzerland. The objective of this research
is to improve understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle dynamics using the Bern
2D coupled ocean-atmosphere model. It is important to understand the processes
that control the cycling of carbon to be able to assess future climate change
associated with past and continuing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is
one of the major "greenhouse" gases. The Bern model's strength in studying the
cycling of carbon by the ocean is its computational efficiency combined with its
ability to resolve the global features of the ocean thermohaline circulation
which may be a critical driving mechanism behind the Earth's natural atmospheric
CO2 concentration, especially on brief time scales. Dr. Figge will help to
modify the Bern model by adding an organic carbon cycle to the ocean's existing
inorganic component. She will use this version of the model to investigate the
important features and processes involved in the Earth's natural carbon cycle as
observed in the geological record. And she will measure stable carbon isotopes
on a peat core to be collected from a Swiss peat bog to verify a new method for
reconstructing atmospheric CO2 concentration. ***
