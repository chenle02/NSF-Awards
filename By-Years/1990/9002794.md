Work on this project will focus on problems arising in the theory of orthogonal
polynomials. These are polynomials in one complex variable which are orthogonal
with respect to some density (measure) defined on the complex plane. Particular
emphasis will be placed on those measures which are supported on bounded sets.
The setting is more general than the study of polynomials defined on a circle.
It is motivated by studies of the Schrodinger equation and dynamical problems
which have led to polynomials orthogonal on Julia sets and on spectral questions
concerning Jacobi matrices with unbounded or periodic entries which are
orthogonal on several intervals. The latter questions emerging from statistical
physics. Two primary goals in the work involve the location of the roots of
orthogonal polynomials and analyzing certain asymptotic relationships involving
successive roots of polynomials as their degrees increase. The method to be
employed involves a potential theoretic approach by which asymptotics are
measured by the Green's function for the support set. Other work will involve
Pade approximation and weighted polynomial approximation in Lebesgue spaces
defined on plane regions.
