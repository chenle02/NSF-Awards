With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern
Illinois University will acquire a liquid chromatograph - ion trap mass
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including a) characterization of heme protein samples; b) photochemical studies
of autofluorescent pigments; c) development of new analytical tools based on
protein-ligand interactions; d) studies of carboranes and metallacarboranes; e)
investigations of reaction rates and thermodynamics for ions in the gas phase;
and f) the development of reusable ruthenium carbene catalysts for olefin
metathesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric
detection (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research in a wide variety of projects, ranging from the measurement
of physical properties of ions to biochemical structural analysis.
