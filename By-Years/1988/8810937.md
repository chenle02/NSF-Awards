A major puzzle in economics is why the equilibrium rate of unemployment is much
higher now than it was twenty years ago. For example, in the case of men in
their prime working years, the unemployment rates of the early and mid 1980s
were more than triple the rates experienced by this group in the 1960s. Other
groups show similar increase in their equilibrium rates of unemployment. Under
the previous grant, the authors characterized many of the key features of the
evolution of unemployment over this period, which caused them to reject existing
theories of unemployment because they were inconsistent with the facts. It was
found that rising unemployment over this period was associated with much longer
periods of unemployment and declining sectoral mobility of the labor force. In
addition, unemployment cut much more deeply into the population of prime aged
workers. Using various sources of micro data on individual unemployment and
unemployment duration, the authors will extent this earlier empirical work to a
more thorough study of unemployment dynamics at the individual level, including
the key role of mobility. An optimizing model will be developed and tested which
emphasizes the importance of specific skills and specialization of workers,
along with optimal individual mobility decisions by specifically trained
workers. Existing theories of labor markets cannot adequately explain the
secular increase in equilibrium unemployment rates observed over the past twenty
years or so. This project will develop and test a theoretical framework for
doing just that. It is hoped that the results of this study may suggest ways of
reducing the long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and the duration of
unemployment spells.
