The investigator and his colleagues study the representation theory of p-adic
groups in topological vector spaces over p-adic fields, with the goal of
relating such representations to arithmetic by means of a "p-adic analytic local
Langlands correspondence." Though still in its early stages, work of the
investigator, his collaborator Peter Schneider, and others including Robert
Coleman and Barry Mazur, and more recently Matthew Emerton and Christophe
Breuil, have provided evidence that such a correspondence exists. The
investigator has the hope that this approach will provide a conceptual link
between p-adic L-functions, p-adic Galois representations, and p-adic
automorphic forms, in the same way that the classical Langlands correspondence
does for complex L-functions, automorphic forms, and ell-adic representations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One principal of current research in number theory is the
Langlands program, which proposes a deep relationship between certain complex
analytic functions related to algebraic groups called "automorphic forms" and
the number of integer solutions to classes of polynomial equations, through the
medium of functions called "zeta functions." The power of this idea was
strikingly demonstrated by Wiles' proof of Fermat's theorem, which proceeded by
establishing one very special case of the Langlands conjectures. A second
important principal in this field is the idea that a full understanding of
number theory requires the study, not only of the geometric behavior of
equations over the real and complex numbers, but also over the less widely known
fields of p-adic numbers. Indeed, many of the important classical objects of
number theory, such as modular forms andL-functions, that are important in the
Langlands project, have p-adic versions. These p-adic versions capture important
information not accessible from the classical situation. This project proposes
to extend our understanding of the p-adic versions of automorphic forms and zeta
functions by extending the philosophy of the Langlands program to the setting of
p-adic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;
