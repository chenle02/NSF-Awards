This grant provides travel support for students wishing to attend the 2014
Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) conference, which is to be
held in Broomfield, Colorado, from Oct 6-8, 2014. OSDI is the leading
international conference on both research and industrial innovations in the
field of computer systems, which includes operating systems, mobile computing,
distributed systems, file systems, computer security and reliability, and the
management and debugging of complex computer systems.

This grant supports up to 30 US-based graduate students to attend and
participate in the conference, to learn about the latest research directions,
and to meet and discuss their research with leading experts in the field.
Students have an opportunity to participate in workshops on special topics or on
workshops intended to support students with diverse backgrounds, to present
research posters and/or talks, and to volunteer as scribes for the conference
sessions. This grant support enables attendance of students who would not
otherwise have been able to attend.
