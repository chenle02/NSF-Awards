This project on the interface of mathematics and physics will enhance the
qualitative and quantitative understanding of complex phenomena occurring in
nature by mathematical methods. It consists of several models which are
motivated, for instance, by the study of exotic states of matter,
superconductivity, and fluid mechanics. The methods used in this study come from
techniques in mathematical analysis, which itself is a sophisticated abstraction
of calculus. While the models are specific, they show certain general properties
and the methods that need to be developed will be relevant beyond the context of
these concrete cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the PI intends to
quantify dispersive properties of a Fermi gas by novel forms of so-called
Strichartz inequalities, via exploring their connection with the restriction
problem in harmonic analysis. It is intended to rigorously derive the
macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity from the microscopic BCS
theory with particular emphasis on the Meisner effect. Mathematical tools
include semi-classical analysis and a non-commutative calculus of variations.
Ground states of non-linear, non-local equations and their stationary and
dynamical role will be studied, in particular, their global and local uniqueness
properties will be analyzed.In addition, an attempt will be made to find the
sharp form of two functional inequalities which display conformal invariance and
have both physical and geometric content.
