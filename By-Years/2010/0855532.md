This project is on the process of gravitational collapse of an object to form a
black hole. In particular, the project is concerned with what happens in the
regions of extremely strong gravity inside the black hole. The method used in
the project is numerical simulation: computer programs that simulate the
equations of general relativity that describe gravitational collapse and black
hole formation. In particular, I will try to find out the detailed behavior of
the extremely strong gravitational field. I will also try to see whether the
collapse can be followed by a re-expansion, and if so whether a process of this
sort can account for the big bang explosion in which our universe started.

This work concerns a fundamental physical question and thus has intrinsic broad
intellectual interest. I have written a book on black holes and dark matter for
a general audience and have tried in that book to express the excitement
inherent in research on these topics. In addition, the computer methods
developed for gravitational problems can have a broader application in other
areas of science.
