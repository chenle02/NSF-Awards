The work to be undertaken in the area of atmospheric and spray icing of
structures consists primarily of experimental studies conducted within the
framework of parallel analytical studies. The main objective is to develop
improved predictors of loading (icing weight, aerodynamic drag and lift)
associated with icings, and formulation of collection efficiency, and freezing
fractions, n. Two sets of experiments will be conducted using the Iowa Institute
of Hydraulic Research (IIHR) Icing Wind Tunnel. The first set will consist of
measurements of icing accretion rates, icing forms, and structural loadings due
to major icing types (glaze, and hard and soft rime). The second set of
experiments will focus attention on: the dynamics of droplet trajectory through,
and deposition from the local flow field around a structural element undergoing
icing; and the heat transfer processes associated with icing accretion. These
measurements and the analysis of the obtained data will help in improving the
understanding and formulation E and n. State-of-the-art force transducers and
measurement, and flow- visualization instrumentation will he used in carrying
out this work. The pioneering use of laser-sheet and holographic methods for
image- processing will be an important contribution to droplet trajectories and
deposition measurements. The P.I. is highly qualified to perform this research
and the facilities at his disposal are among the best in the world. An award for
two years is recommended with the proviso that a third year of support can be
granted only upon the presentation of a satisfactory report on findings together
with an updated workplan.
