9361151 CABRERA This proposal requests Phase I funding to demonstrate the
feasibility of developing a low-cost acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)
suitable for shallow water applications, up to 50-m depth. In addition to lower
instrument cost, the new system will provide a number of significant advantages
over existing ADCPs such as: ability to measure closer to the surface, more
rugged transducers, lower power consumption, smaller size, and a much simpler
operation and deployment. In Phase I we will investigate the use of state-of-art
electronics and application specific hardware to minimize cost, size and power
consumption. New transducer design and transmit/receive schemes will be
evaluated for reducing sidelobe interference thus permitting velocity
measurements closer to the surface than what is common with commercially
available systems. New materials will be evaluated for the construction of
transducers and pressure vessel to improve the ruggedness of the instrument in
areas of high biological activity. The system will be designed such that it can
function autonomously with internal batteries and data recorder, or as a module
that can be easily integrated into a larger instrumentation package.
