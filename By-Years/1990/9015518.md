This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Professors Surendra Shah and J.
Francis Young, of the Advanced Cement-Based Materials Center at Northwestern
University, to Japan to survey university, government, and industrial
laboratories for advances in cement- based materials and concrete construction
and to investigate future cooperation and exchanges of researchers. Japan's
public sector and construction industry spend considerably more on research and
development than do their United States counterparts, resulting in significant
advances over the past twenty years such as super- plasticizers. The two
investigators intend to explore possible arrange ments for U.S. faculty members
and post-docs to spend time in Japanese research institutes.
