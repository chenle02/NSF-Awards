One of the most intriguing and, at the same time, practically useful features of
quantum mechanics is quantum entanglement. It is now known that entanglement
allows the accomplishment of operational tasks that are impossible to perform by
using classical resources alone. Nonlocal games, originally studied from the
perspective of theoretical computer science, have proved to be a useful tool for
the study of its power and limitations. This project is aimed at pursuing
further the organic links between these combinatorial and probabilistic objects
and mathematical analysis on noncommutative structures. The project will
contribute to the current large-scale quantization program in mathematics and
focuses on the passage from classical to quantum nonlocal games. The work of the
project will serve directly the enhancement of interdisciplinarity in pure
mathematics, while contributing to the quantum initiatives currently pursued at
a number of levels nationally. The project provides research training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

The backbone of the project is formed by finitely presented operator systems and
C*-algebras, and their tensor products. It develops core operator algebraic
techniques and applies them in areas of quantum information theory, studying new
operator algebraic concepts arising from quantum and classical graphs,
hypergraphs and partial orders. The main objectives are to (i) identify quantum
versions of the graph isomorphism games and some of their useful
generalizations, and characterize their perfect strategies using operator
theory; (ii) develop operator algebraic methods of strategy transfer between
games and study a new notion of game equivalence; and (iii) provide closed
formulas via operator tensor norms for the optimal probability of winning a
given quantum game when the players have access to a strong degree of
entanglement. The techniques that will be used to achieve these goals include
operator theory, completely bounded and completely positive maps, tensor theory
for operator algebras as well as von Neumann algebra theory. The project reveals
analytical features of discrete structures with a broad spectrum of
applications, such as hypergraphs, introduces a new operator space tensor
product, and studies novel operator systems arising from isometric and unitary
operators.
