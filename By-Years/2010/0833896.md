2008 Gordon Research Conference: MAGNETIC
NANOSTRUCTURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide supplemental support
for graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty who could not otherwise
attend the 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Magnetic Nanostructures, held at
the Centre Paul Langevin in Aussois, France, August 31- September 5, 2008. The
conference will consist of a week of invited talks aimed at defining the state
of the art of research in the field, and in identifying future directions.
Another important purpose of this meeting is to provide a stimulating and
welcoming atmosphere for more young scientists and members of under-represented
groups to learn about hot fields and trends in their area, and to develop
collaborative contacts with worldwide experts. Session topics will include
semiconductor spintronics, complex oxide heterostructures, bio-nanomagnetism,
magnetic nanowires and nanodots, domain wall excitation and motion, magnetic
imaging, and ultrafast dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
