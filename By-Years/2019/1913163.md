Mathematical modeling methods based on partial differential equations are widely
used in engineering and scientific applications, which have been one of the most
important tool for mankind to understand a large variety of phenomena
originating from human activity and technological development. The stochastic
partial differential equations generalize the partial differential equations by
taking into account the uncertainty, which is ubiquitous in reality. In this
project, we focus on the simulation and quantification of rare events in
stochastic partial differential equations that can model some important
phenomena such as regime change in climate, rogue ocean waves, abnormal weather,
etc, which may occur rarely but have major impact on our
life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to develop efficient
numerical algorithms to capture rare events in infinite dimensional systems. We
will integrate the techniques for numerical solution of partial differential
equations, such as finite element method, reduced basis method, etc, (for the
space-time dimension), with the ideas from large deviation theory, statistics,
and deep learning (for the random dimension). When the large deviation principle
is applicable, we will consider numerical solution of a nonlocal variational
problem to seek the most probable event. The algorithm will be developed and
analyzed in the framework of finite element method and calculus of variation.
When the large deviation principle is not applicable, we will develop a strategy
to seamlessly couple the reduced-order modeling and the generative models from
deep learning, based on which a more general cross entropy method will be
constructed for rare event simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
