The establishment of a REU Site (Research Education for Undergraduates) is
proposed for the University of California at Santa Barbara as part of the Palmer
Station Antarctic Marine LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) project. The
purpose of the REU Site is to involve undergraduates in both the field seasons
in Antarctica, and in the laboratory at UCSB during sample analysis, data
analysis and preparation of publications. The LTER and REU programs have several
common objectives which are achieved by undergraduates participating in research
activities. Undergraduates with an interest in marine sciences will have the
opportunity to experience all aspects of an interdisciplinary project with
strong hypothesis testing, and which involves current and evolving techniques.
During this experience we expect that students will move from a broad overview
and dependent status to a narrower focus and independent projects.
