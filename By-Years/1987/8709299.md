The primary goal of this study is to further develop using analytical and
computational procedures, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
shear strain localization during the plastic deformation of both metals and
polymers, as well as to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the computational
algorithms used to simulate shear band formation. The so-called "thermo-
mechanical mechanism" is primarily considered the mechanism responsible for flow
localization at high rates of deformation. Efficient numerical algorithms are
developed for the integration of the full tensorial form of strain-rate
dependent constitutive relations. These numerical algorithms specifically
account for strain softening phenomena by either thermal softening or by
"fractures in progress" due to void growth or microcrack formation. Two main
stages of the deformation are considered; namely, the pre-initiation regime (I)
and the post- initiation regime (II). The study of regime I is concerned with
the necessary and sufficient conditions for the onset of shear bands and the
influence of several factors on the critical strain level at which bands may
initiate. Such factors include heat conduction, thermal softening, strain rate
sensitivity, elasticity, imperfections, and boundary conditions. The study of
regime II is concerned with the phenomenon of band narrowing and the loss of
local adiabaticity that leads to a quasi-steady-state condition within the
bands. A model is constructed to derive the characteristic band thickness and
the characteristic band spacing. Further, the change in material properties is
accounted for within the bands, and the influence of any local phase
transformation on the macroscopic behavior of the body is analyzed.
