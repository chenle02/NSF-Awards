This is a comprehensive, national, 5-year Teacher Professional Continuum (TPC)
project to develop a learning community model that spans the educational
continuum. It connects teacher research participation experience (TRE) projects
and science, technology, and mathematics (STM) industry and university
scientists/professionals to research the factors that contribute to the success
of such a model. The TPC educational research will mine both the Principal
Investigator's and other national TRE projects, education and industry (E/I)
partnership immersion projects, and provide new education/workplace experiences
for STM participants covering the teacher continuum. The project includes Local
Learning Community cohorts that include two preservice science/mathematics
teachers, two middle school teachers, a 7-12 science, mathematics and/or
technology teacher, one middle/high school guidance counselor, a two-year
Community College faculty member, and a four-year IHE science educator and/or
science STM faculty member.
