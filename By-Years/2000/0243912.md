S.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: AURA/NOAO/National Solar
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Solar Observatory (NSO) will
continue their Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in solar
physics. Six students annually will work on research projects at one of the two
NSO sites in Sunspot, NM or Tucson, AZ. The NSO performs research aimed at
understanding the Sun as an astrophysical object, as a laboratory where the
fundamental interactions between plasma and magnetic field can be viewed first
hand, and as a driver of space-weather. Students will be given a choice of
research projects such as measurement and analysis to help understand solar
activity processes; solar seismology; physics of coronal heating and solar wind
acceleration; hands-on experience with developing new instruments at the
forefront of solar astrophysics such as real-time image enhancement, development
of ultra narrow-band filters, synoptic telescopes, infrared filters and cameras.
Other student activities will include presenting a seminar, creating an
electronic presentation, giving occasional public tours, social activities, and
a field trip to visit other astronomical research facilities in the southwest.
Students whose research results in a viable paper will present findings at an
annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society or American Geophysical
Union. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with
the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSO will also support four K-12
teachers annually in Research Experiences for Teachers (RET). The teachers will
choose from the same set of research projects available to the REU students. In
addition to their research projects and all of the REU activities, the RET
participants will develop a classroom activity directly related to their
research. &lt;br/&gt;***
