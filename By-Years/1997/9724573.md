An MRI award will support the acquisition of low-vacuum scanning electron
microscope wit EDS capabilities for a multidisciplinary microscopy service
facility. This facility is the sole provider of scanning electron microscopy
services to the entire Syracuse academic community. The microscope will replace
an outdated piece of equipment. Research projects which will benefit from access
to the instrument encompass the disciplines of chemistry, engineering, and
biology. They come from three different institutions. With respect to chemistry,
the proposed projects involve polymer membranes and the analysis of atmospheric
and water-borne lead particles. With respect to engineering, the projects
involve the mechanical behavior of wood, characterization of recycled fibers,
strength properties of individual fibers, and fiber-to-fiber bonds in paper.
With respect to biology, the projects involve the cochlea and the vestibular
sensory epithelia of the auditory system, mechanisms of wood decay, decay
identification and prevention, and fungal morphology. The instrument will also
be used in training of students from a number of departments and institutions.
