99-11894&lt;br/&gt;OTUONYE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unusual five-year Teacher
Student Development through Research Experience (TSD) project brings together
real life miners, research scientists, and teachers in a working mine and
inactive mines to participate in mining activities and the associated laboratory
research activities surrounding minerals. In year-one, 24 teachers from the
Upper Peninsula of MI will participate in a six-week program that includes:
content and skills preparation; working with scientists and engineers, in
working and inactive mines, collecting specimens and cataloging them; and, hone
leadership and change agent skills to enhance the transfer of the research/high
tech mining experience back to the classroom. The six-week summer research and
field experiences are complemented by professional development activities over a
12-month period. In years two and three the participant pool will include
teachers from neighboring states: WI, MN, IN, OH, and IL. Each year 24
additional middle and high school teachers will participate. In years four and
five teachers will come from a national pool focusing on those regions that have
extensive mining activities. Teachers may earn five (5) graduate credits from
MTU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
