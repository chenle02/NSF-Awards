This award supports Dr. John Edmonds' participation on one leg of the scheduled
expedition of the R.V. KNORR to the Mediterranean and Black Sea in 1988.
Measurements of temperature, salinity, nutrients, oxygen, freons and several
trace elements will be carried out and water samples collected for futher
laboratory analysis. The Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea are among the least
known areas of the ocean geochemically, and this program is aimed at determining
the composition of deep waters in the Black Sea, the rate of vertical mixing,
and the vertical gradients produced by processes occurring in the Black Sea.
Information gained can be used to address time constraints on redox processes at
the oxic/anoxic transition zone, evidence of precipitation reactions and/or
aluminosilicate diagenesis. In addition, this work may help resolve such
problems as scavenging versus settling of Al and Be in the Mediterranean and the
Pacific.
