Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Transient Measurement
of Multi-component Permeation in Zeolite Membranes&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0340563&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: John
Falconer&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeolite membranes can be
prepared reproducibly with high separation selectivities for
&lt;br/&gt;difficult-to-separate mixtures such as organic isomers. A new method
for characterizing the transport pathways of gases through zeolite membrane
pores is being developed. This method measures the adsorption isotherms, heats
of adsorption, diffusivities, and effective thickness of these pathways non-
destructively. Transient permeation measurements with mass spectrometric
detection will be used for gas mixtures. A mathematical model of the mixture
transient behavior will be developed and used to analyze transient experimental
results for mixtures. Measuring the adsorption and transport properties of
mixtures under conditions where the membranes are used for separations is
critical for understanding the separation behavior of these novel membranes.
Several types of zeolite membranes with a range of pore sizes and thickness will
be prepared as membranes for these transient studies. Transient experiments will
be carried out for single gases and for mixtures. In terms of the broader
impacts, transient permeation measurements have the potential to significantly
increase our understanding of the relationship between zeolite membranes
structure and separation performance. Understanding the adsorption and transport
properties and the role of the support will allow systems to be designed for a
given separation. This research will prepare graduate students in preparation
and characterization of zeolite membranes. Undergraduates will also be involved
in this research through the department's REU site grant on functional
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
