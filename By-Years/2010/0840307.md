FETCH with Ruff Ruffman, produced by WGBH, is a daily half-hour PBS television
series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to 6- to 10-year
olds. The program brings science learning to young children by uniquely blending
live-action with animation, game show convention with reality programming, and
humor with academics. The intended impacts of this new season are to 1) help the
target audience, especially girls and minorities, develop an interest, knowledge
and skills necessary to do science; 2) help kids develop the math skills and
knowledge necessary to solve science and engineering problems; and 3) bring
FETCH's unique brand of informal science learning to camps across the country.
The requested funds will allow the project to expand the science curriculum with
20 new half-hour episodes and expand the Web site, focusing on three new science
themes that highlight topics of interest to this age group: "Animal Universe,"
"Science of Art," and "Adventure Science." The Web site will include four new
science-based Web games that will allow kids to create and post content of their
own design and interact with other FETCH fans online. In addition, funds will
support new educational resources for camps, including a Camp FETCH Guide. The
project will continue to work with the project's established collaborators like
the Boys and Girls Clubs, Girl Scouts of America, and YMCA, as well expand the
outreach via new partnerships with the Center for Summer Learning at Johns
Hopkins University and the American Camp Association. Christine Andrews Paulsen
&amp; Associates (CAPA) will conduct summative evaluation of both the television
show and the Camp FETCH Guide.
