Transcription attenuation in the Bacillus subtilis trp operon is regulated by a
trans-acting RNA binding protein, the product of the mtr locus. In the presence
of tryptophan, Mtr recognizes, and presumably binds to, a site in the trp leader
transcript. This binding influences the attenuator to form a transcription
terminator. The mtr locus contains two structural genes, mtrA and mtrB; both are
required to regulate the trp operon. The objective of this work is to determine
how Mtr recognized its RNA target and how it influences the attenuator to cause
transcription termination. Specific objectives are to: 1) purify Mtr and
determine its subunit structure. 2) develop in vitro assays for Mtr function
including RNA binding and transcription regulation. 3) characterize the RNA
target site in the trp leader transcript and demonstrate that Mtr binds this
site. Features of Mtr required for RNA-binding will also be studied. 4)
determine the mechanism of tryptophan activation of Mtr. 5) determine if Mtr
regulates other genes. The importance of RNA-binding proteins as gene regulators
is clear. Sequence- specific RNA-protein interactions regulate a wide range of
cellular processes. This work will provide information about how proteins
recognize RNA and how RNA-binding proteins regulate gene expression.
