Nancy Makri of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is supported by an
award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for
research in the development of simulation methods for dynamical processes in
quantum clusters and liquids. Fully quantum mechanical calculations of such
systems present a major challenge because the numerical effort required
increases very rapidly with system size. Makri and her research group are
developing an iterative Monte Carlo (IMC) methodology that combines the
precision of iterative grid-based propagation algorithms with the advantageous
scaling of Metropolis Monte Carlo. The use of lattice representations and grid
sampling techniques motivated from the high-temperature and semiclassical limit
will further increase efficiency, while maintaining the fully quantum mechanical
nature of IMC. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The IMC methodology will enable for the
first time fully quantum mechanical simulation of the dynamics of quantum
clusters, fluids and doped helium nano-droplets, offering new physical insights.
The work will also impact a broader scientific community by offering researchers
the ability to generate much needed benchmarks for the assessment of approximate
simulation methods. Makri's work is also having a further broader impact through
the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.
