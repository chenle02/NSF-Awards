This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for research to
design large, high precision, high field ( 1.8 T) iron-yoke/rare-earth (Charge
Sheet Equivalent Material) dipole magnets. The few large permanent dipole
magnets that have been designed have used traditional electromagnet techniques
and so have unsatisfactorily large parasitic flux and low gap fields of 0.3 T.
General design and construction methodology will be developed for the magnets
during Phase I. As proof of principle, these techniques will be applied a 1 T
tunable gap field 'box' dipole with reversed fringe field for a mobile 70 MeV
RaceTrack Microtron using the smallest magnets possible. Four tasks are
proposed: (1) Perfect the large CSEM dipole design; (2) Develop field error
measurements and correction methods; (3) Develop fringe field shaping methods;
and (4) Find a method to thermally stabilize the CSEM. TOSCA and MAFIA computer
simulations will be used to verify the design. Large high-field CSEM dipoles can
be used in industrial and research accelerators, beam transport lines, and
spectrometers, as they have simpler construction and superior performance than
similar electromagnetic dipoles. Eliminating the magnet coils, as well as their
power supplies and cooling systems, reduces the electrical power consumption,
construction costs, servicing expense, control system complexity, and space
requirements, while increasing the reliability.
