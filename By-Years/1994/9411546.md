9411546 Goldberg Research in theoretical particle physics includes a continuing
study into the dynamics driving the evolution of the early universe, and the
origins of the fluctuations observed in the cosmic microwave background
radiation. A second project examines the links between this dynamics and rare
decay processes that can be observed in the laboratory. Such links can provide
important checks on our current understanding about the early universe. ***
