Through a program of summer internships in industry followed by a range of
academic year activities, secondary school science teachers from New Jersey
schools will be given an opportunity in this program managed by the New Jersey
Business/Industry Science Education Consortium to bring up-to-date applications
of science into their classroom teaching. Forty teachers in each of the next
three years will be placed in carefully designed summer internships in industry
or in some of New Jersey's Advanced Technology Centers, joint industry/academic
centers working in forefront areas of technology. The majority will be placed in
smaller industries, since this represents an important segment of the
technological community often not as much involved in work with schools as some
of the larger industries. All the teachers will work with academic and
industrial scientists in the follow-up activities to develop new teaching
activities and materials, particularly emphasizing a "hands-on" approach. Cost
sharing by the partners will total 100% of the National Science Foundation
funding.
