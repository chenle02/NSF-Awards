Research is being conducted in the following related areas. In large scale
computation in fluid dynamics, computer simulations are being used as an
experimental tool to investigate fundamental phenomena in fluid dynamics, with
principal emphasis on unsteady flows in three dimensions. Applications include
vortical flows, shock hydrodynamics, and combustion. In advanced numerical
algorithms, new numerical techniques are under development to perform the kinds
of calculations described above. Techniques include fast vortex methods, high -
resolution finite difference methods, and projection methods, as well as various
adaptive techniques to augment these basic discretization methods. In
programming languages and environments, there will be collaboration with Prof.
P. Hilfinger of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley in developing and evaluating
new programming languages and environments for large scale scientific computing
to support the design of the algorithms used in the rest of this work.
