The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project entails the reduction of US energy demand via
accelerated adoption of wireless smart glass technologies in buildings. Smart
window technologies could save 2.19 gigatons of carbon by 2050, resulting in
$321.5 B in energy savings. The proposed project will advance a transparent
power source for wireless operation of smart windows and Internet of Things
(IoT) devices. The envisioned system will be stable, efficient, and scalable,
and will meet window aesthetic requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will explore a photovoltaic
technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that
is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar
cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart
windows over the same spatial footprint without competing for visible or
infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate. Scientific broader impacts
from this project include contributions to the understanding of structure-
property relationships governing organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layer
composition and resulting visible light transmittance. Phase II technical
deliverables will include demonstration of a NUV solar module with world-leading
visible transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
