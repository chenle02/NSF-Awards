In this RUI project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Carolyn
Anderson of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Calvin College
creates new methods for the synthesis of complex organic heterocycles. These are
substances which contain nitrogen in a ring. New synthetic routes are primarily
based on reactions catalyzed by gold (III). Challenging synthetic targets
include indolizine and isoquinoline alkaloids, heterocyclic compounds which
possess potential medicinal properties. In addition, this award supports 8-10
week summer visitations to Calvin College by senior graduate students from major
research institutions. These visitations provide training for future careers as
a PUI faculty member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research expands the suite of
chiral and achiral methods for preparing highly functionalized trisubstituted
indolizine and N-alkyl 2-pyridone structures. This new chemistry makes these
species, and their analogues, available to the broader chemical community. Basic
knowledge related to mechanistic and asymmetric gold(III) catalysis is an
important product of this research. Successful development of these
methodologies and targets impacts the synthetic community as well as those
involved in the development of organic materials, medicinal leads, and
asymmetric transformations. This research provides hands-on laboratory training
for undergraduate research collaborators and pre-college students, especially
those from historically underrepresented groups. In addition, this award enables
senior graduate students, who intend to pursue academic careers at primarily
undergraduate institutions, to spend time during a summer as a member of the
PI's laboratory. In this role, the visiting graduate students gain essential
experience in running a productive undergraduate research group, while being
mentored directly by the PI.
