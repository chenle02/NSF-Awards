CUNY City College will develop, implement, and evaluate a program for preparing
secondary science and mathematics teachers. The program includes an aggressive
recruitment campaign in the New York City Schools, a preparatory semester prior
to the freshman year for students with ability but requiring enhancement of
skills before beginning freshman work, a restructuring of the freshman science
and mathematics courses, an active system of tutoring and support, and
opportunities for the students to serve as tutors and interns. Throughout the
program there will be emphasis on the development problem solving skills,
promoting active student-centered learning, and the formation of support and
study groups. The project will continue work begun under the grant TPE-8954736.
The University's cost sharing will be 52% of NSF's contribution.
