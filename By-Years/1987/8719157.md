This project will permit Dr. Ball and his colleagues to continue their NSF
supported archaeological research. The team will undertake additional excavation
at a series of Mayan sites located in the roughly triangular valley floor
occupied by the lower reaches of the Mopan and Macal rivers in Belize. They will
focus their efforts on two major Mayan sites, Buenavista del Cayo and Cahal Pech
and conduct supplemental excavations in several other locations. As in past
work, in addition to test trenches they will open large horizonal exposures and
this will allow interpretation of the functions these areas served and how they
were integrated into a larger Mayan community. Archaeological evidence has shown
both that Mayan sites are extremely large and that extensive interaction took
place among them. Mayan society can not be understood on a small scale site-by-
site basis; large scale regional work is necessary. The archaeological situation
that Dr. Ball has discovered is unique because the Mopan region includes a
number of sites, both large and small, which are covered by only a limited
amount of overburden, which date to a single period of time - the Classic - and
which contain undisturbed remains. Through large scale excavation at several
sites Dr. Ball should be able to discover not only how each worked but also how
they interacted. Dr. Ball has adapted models from urban anthropology which
describe how cities function in order to guide his work. This research is
important for several reasons. Because of the complexity of its culture
archaeologists have long been interested in Mayan society, how it arose,
functioned and then declined. This research should provide additional insight
into the question. Secondly, the Mayans successfully adapted to a lowland
tropical environment. Such areas are much more sparsely populated today than
they were in prehistoric times. Dr. Ball's research should provide useful
information on the organizational techniques ancient Mayans employed. Hopefully
such data can be put to good use in Middle America as well as other parts of the
world.
