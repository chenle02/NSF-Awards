Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: ITR Large Scale Quantum Mechanical
Simulations of Nonomechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large scale quantum
mechanical simulations of nanomechanics of carbon&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes involving
atoms in excess of 10,000 is underway using a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative effort
involving material and computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists. Parallel software tools
are being developed to accomplish&lt;br/&gt;this. The tools are based on a novel
pipelined, parallel architecture&lt;br/&gt;designed to harness grid computing.
The goal of the simulations is to&lt;br/&gt;study the potential benefits of
nanomechanical applications of carbon&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes and use the results to
guide experimental investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
