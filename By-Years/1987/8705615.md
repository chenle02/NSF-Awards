Individuals in various cultures perceive and respond to pain differently. While
early studies of acute pain have shown how cultural ideas of what is pain and
how one should act in response to it varies, no one has yet discovered how
culture influences perceptions of the intensity of pain in chronic sufferers.
This research will analyze how individuals learn to respond to pain and how
their social experience throughout their lives influences their attitudes,
attention and past and present experience with pain. This in turn should affect
how different cultures identify pain intensity. The student will work with 200
chronic pain patients from several ethnic groups at the Pain Control Center at
the University of Massachusettes. She will test models of how culture affects
the psychological and biological response to pain in each group. Chronic pain
constitues a serious national health and economic problem. It is estimated that
chronic pain affects thirty to forty million Americans and that the annual costs
in health care, medicine, disability compensation, lost wages and other related
costs is sixty to seventy billion dollars. This research will help alleviate
this problem by increasing understanding of the role of culture in pain
perception.
