The goal of this program is to use multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy from
ground-based telescopes and with Hubble Space Telescope to measure the M-sigma
relation locally and at high redshift (z~1-2). This relation connects the mass
(M) of the central black hole in galaxies to the velocity dispersion (sigma) of
the stars in the galactic bulge, and allows an estimate of M from determination
of sigma, the latter being a fairly easily measured quantity. This program will
determine the scaling factor between the two quantities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate students, and outreach via workshops for local high school
teachers in astrophysical research to be used in the classroom.
