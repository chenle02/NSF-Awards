This project tests and facilitates a creative problem solving methodology
designed to produce radically innovative research agendas. This project
establishes a natural experiment to examine a process that develops multi-
disciplinary research teams in a novel collaborative process that engages
researchers in the development of potentially transformative research-based and
research-generating ideas. Specifically, the project adapts a participatory
action research (PAR) approach to facilitate the development of a problem
solving environment and to study this real world problem solving situation in
order to: (1) iteratively examine the complex social and intellectual processes
involved in collaboration and in creative problem solving and (2) develop novel
interdisciplinary research agendas in undergraduate STEM education that address
workforce needs unique to Engineering. Thus, the project's impact has potential
for serving as a demonstration of the complex process of collaboration in multi-
disciplinary research groups, as a test of social and individual processes
involved in collaboration and creative problem solving, and as a means for
documenting the development of radically innovative research agendas needed to
develop the current and future workforce in Engineering.
