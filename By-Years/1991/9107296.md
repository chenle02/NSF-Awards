The goal of the proposed research is to test the role of microorganisms in
mediating interactions among phytophagous insects, their host plants and their
natural enemies. Specifically, the proposed research will determine how
endophytic fungi (fungi that produce asymptomatic infections within plant
tissues) affect colonization, dispersion, and population dynamics of leafmining
and leafchewing insects that feed on a common host plant, Emory oak. Although
endophytic fungi are thought to be plant mutualists by deterring other
herbivores, accumulating evidence suggests that their effects on phytophagous
insects are highly variable. The proposed research will test the direction and
magnitude of these effects through a series of field and laboratory experiments
and observations. Ecologists have recently recognized that the pervasive effects
of microorganisms such as endophytic fungi may alter conventional theories of
phytophagous insect - host plant - natural enemy interactions. By rigorously
examining the effects of endophytic fungi, the proposed research will test and
modify these conventional theories.
