This award is for support for a two year program to study the origin of nitrate
in the atmosphere and surface snow at Summit, Greenland. Preliminary results
from unfunded pilot studies suggest that nitric acid (HNO3) is not the only, and
may not even be the major nitrogen species contributing to nitrate (NO3-) in
summer-time snow at Summit. Peroxy acetyl nitrate and one or more alkyl nitrate
species seem to be the most likely candidates, and they may also be contributing
to the elevated concentrations of organic acids observed just above the snow
surface at Summit. Gradient measurements of soluble acidic gases will be made
with 2 mist chamber samplers at different heights in the 1995 and 1996 seasons
at Summit. These measurements will be complemented with intensive experiments
comparing mist chamber samples to nylon filter samples and the use of nylon
filters on the mist chamber inlet, to quantify soluble nitrogen species besides
nitric acid. The primary goal of this study will be to enable improved
interpretation of the nitrate records in polar ice, but additional insights into
reactive nitrogen chemistry over snow covered surfaces are also anticipated.
