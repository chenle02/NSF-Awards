This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research program
directed by Professor Robert S. Sheridan at the University of Nevada Reno.
Photochemical generation of biradicals in matrices and in solution will be
examined. The mechanism of decomposition of the azo precursors to meta-
photoaddition biradicals will be studied in order to determine the structural
features which dictate stepwise versus concerted partitioning on the reaction
surface. Experiments designed to determine if hot molecule reactions are
important in matrices and in solution will be conducted. Photochemical pathways
to didehydroaromatic biradicals will also be explored. %%% The interaction of
light with highly energetic molecules trapped at low temperature in solid
matrices will be examined. The low temperature matrix will prolong the lifetime
of reactive species formed in these photochemical reactions by effectively
isolating these reactive intermediates from each other. The effect of adding
more energy than necessary to form these reactive intermediates will be
carefully examined. These studies will provide important information on the
decomposition pathways of highly energetic molecules and intermediates.
