The project focuses on a computational study of problems related to boundary
control and designs arising from engineering. These problems deal with optimal
designs of boundary impedance for acoustic and optical scatterers, and boundary
control of the plate equation in adaptive optics. The method of boundary
integral equations and boundary elements will be used, and some recent global
optimization techniques will be applied. Proper modelling will also be addressed
to reflect the physics of the distributed systems. Substantial efforts will be
directed toward calculations on a supercomputer fully utilizing its parallelism
and speed. This research is part of control theory and is aimed at improving
computational design methods for optimal design of structures and systems.
