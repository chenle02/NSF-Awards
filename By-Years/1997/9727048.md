Bowen 9727048 This research will use molecular genetic technology to investigate
the limits of dispersal for reef fishes among the four primary reef habitats of
the tropical Atlantic: Caribbean Sea, Brazil, mid-Atlantic ridge (Ascension
Island), and Gulf of Guinea (West Africa). DNA sequences will be compared among
populations of French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru), blackbar squirrelfish
(Myripristis jacobus) and five other species to track patterns of colonization
and gene flow across the Atlantic Ocean. Reef fish don't move much as adults, so
dispersal is accomplished primarily by drifting eggs and larvae. How far can
reef fish disperse as larvae? This question is of fundamental importance for
understanding the natural recolonization of reef habitats damaged by
anthropogenic factors. Reef habitats in Brazil and the Caribbean Sea are
separated by 2000 kms of muddy coastline (between the Orinoco and Amazon River
basins). West Atlantic reefs are separated from African reefs by 4000 kms of
open ocean. Population genetic assessments at these two geographic scales should
resolve the limitations of reef fish dispersal. A central focus of this research
is the role of Ascension Island on the mid-Atlantic ridge in facilitating
colonization between east and west Atlantic. If Ascension Island functions as a
stepping stone for colonization across the Atlantic, then this oceanic island
may play a substantial (and previously unrecognized) role in enhancing the
biodiversity of West Atlantic reef habitats.
