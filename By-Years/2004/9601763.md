U. of Colorado, Denver The research focuses upon 19th century industrialization
and regional development in the United States. The primary objective is to
determine the character and extent of rural-urban linkages and to document the
mutual construction of city and countryside in two regional settings: eastern
Iowa and northern Colorado. The research aims to trace the articulation of
extraction and manufacturing within regional economies, highlight the centrality
of resource-based industrialization to American economic growth and connect
rural social and environmental change directly to the process of urban
expansion. A comparative regional approach will be used to examine the
development of rural -urban linkages. In addition a production based approach
will be used to examine the formation and restructuring of commodity-specific
chains of production, distribution and consumption that weave rural and urban
space into a single territory. Data will be gathered from archival sources in
both locales. The project will provide new knowledge and add to our theoretical
understanding of the process of regional development and its urban and rural
bases.
