Visual hand/finger tracking and analysis has many important potential
applications, including human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and the
recognition of sign languages. The major obstacle to real-time visual
hand/finger tracking is the huge dimensionality of the configuration space.
E.g., using the finger joint angles to represent the posture, the number of
degrees of freedom is about 27. Tracking in this high- dimensional space is
computationally impossible. However, finger movement is highly constrained. We
propose to use a 3D model-based approach, where the model will include both
posture and motion constraints. Tracking is done by matching the image of the
real hand and that of the predicted view of the hand from the 3D model. The crux
is to use the constraints to reduce the search time. By the end of the proposed
period, we expect to have a good constraint representation and a good real-time
hand/finger tracking algorithm, and to have demonstrated real-time tracking for
the application of virtual object manipulation.
