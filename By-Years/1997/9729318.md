With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Thomas C. Pochapsky,
of the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University, is studying the structure
and dynamics of closed-shell ion pairs in solution. These studies are focused on
both the development of a general methodology for the characterization of
dynamic self-assembling systems (i.e., multimolecular complexes in which
individual components undergo rapid exchange on the NMR time scale) and the
development of a more complete understanding of chemical processes which involve
ion pairing. Nuclear Overhauser Effect studies probe the time-averaged
structures of ion pairs and, when combined with nuclear relaxation data, provide
information about motional behavior. Pulsed field gradient NMR methods allow
measurement of self-diffusion coefficients for the ion pairs, allowing the
determination of their aggregation state. These studies are complemented by
infrared spectral analysis and by computational methods. Through a combination
of experimental and computational studies, Professor Thomas C. Pochapsky, of the
Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University, studies the structure and
dynamics of ion pairs, molecular aggregates which display discrete interactions
between positively and negatively charged species. Such ion pairs are observed
under a variety of conditions in chemical and biological systems, have been
implicated as intermediates in many types of reactions, and are involved in
biological processes such as ion transport and molecular recognition. With the
support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Pochapsky is developing an
in-depth understanding of the structures of ion pairs and of the dynamic
processes associated with them.
