9404824 Fasano Francis Marion University requests support from NSF for
connection of its campus network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network
located in the southeastern area of the country and comprises 13 states. It will
provide operations management and information services and it will give Francis
Marion University a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high
speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
