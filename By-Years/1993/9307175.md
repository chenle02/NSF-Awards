This is an award to support conduct of a symposium on the issues involving
survival and fate of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) under various
environmental conditions. Investigators and co-investigators who have conducted
and are conducting research on this and related topics with support from the
National Science Foundation will present their findings for the purpose of
discussion, critical review and identification of further research needs on
issues associated with the survival of the HIV when subjected to environmental
stress. Participation will also include experts from the National Institutes of
Health, the United States Public Health Service, the Environmental Protection
and other Federal agencies. The Symposium will be conducted under auspices of
the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Program at the Johns Hopkins School of
Public Health and Hygiene in June of 1993.
