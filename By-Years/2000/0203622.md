In terms of marine ecosystems and climate change issues, tropical regions of the
Atlantic Ocean are among the most poorly represented in the World Ocean Database
(National Oceanographic Data Center, Washington D.C.). However, the Institute of
Biology of the Southern Seas (Ukraine) holds extensive data archives on the
region from numerous former Soviet Union expeditions carried out from 1959 to
1989. These archives include over 4,000 biological samples collected on 19 major
expeditions, the vast majority of which are enumerated to the species level for
phytoplankton, zooplankton, and mesopelagic fish. Those samples are accompanied
by detailed physical and chemical measurements.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
project will allow a team of US, Ukrainian, and Russian scientists to produce,
for broad dissemination, an inventory and database on the above expeditions. The
database will enable full accessibility, viewing, sorting, and exporting of
information by oceanographic station, location, or taxa. The project
participants will further explore the spatial-temporal variability of tropical
pelagic communities using the compiled database as a primary source for guiding
ongoing field research. Resulting data products, including abundance, biomass,
and species diversity indices will be used to elucidate general patterns linking
community structure in the tropical Atlantic and atmospheric/physical
influences. The present study will substantially advance understanding of
species diversity in the tropical ocean by providing a large, detailed database
for poorly studied regions. Future research on biodiversity and potential
climate-change influences in the Atlantic Ocean will benefit greatly from the
detailed taxonomic analyses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish species that
will comprise a major portion of the database.&lt;br/&gt;
