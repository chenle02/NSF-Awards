This is a proposal to purchase equipment for nucleic acid studies and for the
purification and preparation of subcellular components. The equipment will be
applied to research topics including gene regulation in plants, translational
regulation in spermatozoa, melanization in insects, phylogenetic relatedness of
environmentally active soil bacteria, and the effect of deforestation on genetic
variation in trees of tropical rainforests. This equipment will also benefit
undergraduate and graduate student training, as well as a Secondary School
Educator Teacher Enhancement Program.
