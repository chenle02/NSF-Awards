This award is under the International Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which
enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of
research abroad at research centers of proven excellence. The program's awards
provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will
support an eight-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Patricia Johann to the
University of Saarlands to work with Dr. Jorg Siekmann. They propose to develop
and oversee the implementation of a complete transformation- based unification
algorithm for higher-order logic expressed in terms of combinatory logic and
subject to the constraints of a full order- sorted type structure with term
declarations. Their algorithm will comprise an important component of the first-
ever order-sorted higher-order resolution theorem prover, MRKP, under
construction by the research groups of Dr. Siekmann in Saarbrucken and Dr. Peter
Andrews at Carnegie Mellon University. The award recommendation provides funds
for a stipend for eight months.
