0111575 Nagavajara

This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr. Suteera Nagavajara, AAAS, to
request travel funds to visit Thailand for discussions with key Thai officials
and researchers about developing a project on the ecosystem dynamics and human
needs of the Mekong River. The Mekong river basin is one of the most
biologically and culturally diverse watersheds. For centuries its riparian
network has supported its residents, serving as a rich source of diverse foods,
as a mode of transport, and as a source of irrigation and drinking water. This
visit will aid in the development of the AAAS long-term program on ecosystem
dynamics and essential human needs. The success of this program can enhance our
understanding of one of the most important watersheds in Asia.
