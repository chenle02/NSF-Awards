This project builds on collaborative work by Dr. Marks and Dr. Joao Zilhao, a
Portuguese archaeologist. Together they have examined museum collections of
artifacts excavated in the Estremadura region of Central Portugal and visited
and tested a number of archaeological sites. These investigations show that a
range of poorly dated and little understood archaeological cultures are present
and that they probably span the period of the Upper Pleistocene. Together the
investigators will conduct a series of field and laboratory studies with two
major goals: the definition of Portuguese Upper Paleolithic industries based on
a carefully excavated materials and secondly, the placement of these industries
into a locally derived chronostratigraphic framework based upon both absolute
dating and relative dating through associations with sequences of exposed
alluvial and eolian formations. To accomplish this they will conduct excavations
at already known sites and attempt to locate new ones. Absolute dates will be
obtained through thermolumenescent dating of burned flint artifacts. Materials
will be analyzed in Portugal at the close of each field season. The Upper
Paleolithic marks the appearance of anatomically modern humans in Western
Europe. This period is also characterized by the appearance of such uniquely
human features as art and the elaboration of complex ceremonial behavior. Most
of what is presently known derives from a rich complex of sites located in
Southwestern France, and therefore, our understanding is likely biased. This
research is important because it will provide a broader and more balanced
perspective on this important time in human prehistory.
