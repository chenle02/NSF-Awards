The rapid decline of diffusion coefficients in supersaturated solutions is
examined in terms of the formation of molecular clusters. Preliminary
experimental work has shown that diffusion coefficients in metastable
supersaturated solutions vary with the "age" of the solution. In this work, the
investigators experimentally examine the diffusion coefficients of
supersaturated solutions made from solid nonelectrolyte and solvent as a
function of solution "history" and "age." The experimental results is compared
to theoretical predictions based on theories of cluster evolution and cluster
diffusion in metastable solutions. Transport properties of low molecular weight
(non-polymer) solutions are usually considered to be functions of variables such
as concentration and temperature. Normally, the temperature "history", physical
treatment, or "age" of a solution have not been thought to affect the properties
of such a solution. Metastable solutions, however, present the novel situation
where "history" and "age" could be used to alter properties of a solution such
as the diffusion coefficient. Understanding the role of "history" and "age" on
cluster formation and the diffusion coefficient could lead to innovative methods
for crystallizer design and innovative new separation techniques.
