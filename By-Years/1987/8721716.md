This award supports cooperative research between scientists of the US and Taiwan
on the diversity and biology of the Lepidoptera fauna of Taiwan. This study of
moths is important as a contribution to the ongoing effort to correlate moth
diversity in local sites with corresponding plant associations, and to determine
the feasibility of using moths as environmental indicator species in
conservation areas. The compact nature of Taiwan, together with the rapid rate
of its population growth pressing on the natural resources of the island,
provides what may be a unique opportunity for experimentation on the theory of
using moths as an environmental indicator. The goals of the project are to
provide the groundwork of specimens and biological data to monograph Taiwan's
Lepidoptera fauna. Information from this cooperative effort will provide
detailed taxonomic studies of moths, which is expected to lay the groundwork for
further experimental studies. This project involves extensive cooperation with
scientists of Taiwan, and reflects a common concern about the ongoing effects of
environmental changes on natural ecosystems.
