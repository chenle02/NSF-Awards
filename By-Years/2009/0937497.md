This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 15 US-based graduate
&lt;br/&gt;students to attend the Fourth Workshop on Hot Topics in Security
(HotSec). &lt;br/&gt;Participation in HotSec and similar conferences is a
valuable and important part of the &lt;br/&gt;graduate school experience. It
provides students with the opportunity to interact with &lt;br/&gt;more senior
researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the
&lt;br/&gt;field. The support requested in this proposal will enable the
participation of students who &lt;br/&gt;would otherwise be unable to attend
HotSec.
