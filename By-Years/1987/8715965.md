This is an experimental study of the multiphase equilibria of selected prototype
rich-gas-plus-hydrocarbon ternary mixtures, which can contribute to the
understanding of the phase equilibria behavior of rich gas-enhanced oil recovery
systems. Specifically, the study of the liquid-liquid-vapor phase equilibria of
the ternary mixtures (1) methane plus ethane plus n-docosane, (2) methane plus
ethane plus n- tetradecylbenzene, and (3) ethane plus propane plus n-
tetradecylbenzene is under way to evaluate how additive gases expand the
occurrence of three-phase behavior in thermodynamic phase space. Compositions
and molar volumes of the three fluid phases are measured, and the location and
nature of the boundaries of the liquid-liquid- vapor regions are identified. The
studies are performed in the temperature range of 0 to 100 degrees Celsius at
pressures up to 1500 psia in an existing visual cell apparatus. The data
gathered are of fundamental interest to the simulation and evaluation of
potential rich gas-enhanced oil recovery processes, as well as of interest to
the scientific understanding of multiphase equilibria per se.
