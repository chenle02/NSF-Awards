Research conducted by Professor Kim under NSF grant ECS-8300505 has led to
development of high temperature technology for fast transverse electrical-
discharge excitation of copper vapor lasers. Such metal vapor lasers, emitting
in the green and green-yellow spectral region, are useful in applications of
materials processing and ultrashort pulse technology. The current work will
pursue development of high average power, high repetition-rate transverse copper
vapor lasers, including investigations of the laser kinetics and pumping
mechanisms. The PI will also attempt to generate coherent radiation by optical
pumping of the copper vapor system in an attempt to observe Dicke superradiance
phenomena.
