Spectra of the night sky gathered as a by-product of astronomical observations
made at two Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea, Hawaii are used to improve our
understanding of chemistry and composition in the upper mesosphere and
thermosphere. The data acquisition has recently expanded to include similar
spectrographic data from the European Southern Observatory in Chile, and from
the 9-meter telescope at McDonald Observatory in Texas. The use of the data for
aeronomy focuses on three discoveries made in a preceding research effort.
First, a ratio of the sodium D1 to D2 emission intensity is found to have a
surprising semiannual oscillation, which preliminary investigation indicates is
modulated by the O:O2 number density ratio in the upper mesosphere. This
research attempts to prove that hypothesis, and thereby establish an
unprecedented proxy for determining the density of the dominant species in the
upper atmosphere - a long standing and elusive target for ground-based aeronomy.
The second research task investigates the ratio of the O(1D):N(2D) ratio (the
latter a unique measurement capability of these large telescopes) relative to
model values that currently do not reproduce the data. The third research task
uses the heretofore unappreciated detail of the OI Rydberg series to peg ratios
that can be used for instrument sensitivity calibration throughout the airglow
observation community - and thereby improve density determinations made from
airglow data.
