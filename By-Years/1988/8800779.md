This award provides travel support for approximately 11 United States engineers
and scientists to attend the International Symposium on Thermodynamics in
Chemical Engineering and Industry in Beijing, China, May 30 - June 2, 1988. This
is the first international conference to be held in the Peoples Republic of
China (PRC) solely on thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and separations. The
benefits to the United States participants and the general United States
technical community may be: (1) establishment of joint, cooperative research
programs; (2) extended research visits by senior scholars from PRC at little or
no cost to the United States laboratories in which they work; (3) an exchange of
ideas and theories resulting in a cross fertilization of the research programs
in both countries. A maximum allocation of $1,350 per person will be made for
airline tickets only. Each recipient will provide a two-page travel report to be
included in a final report. No sub-award will be made by Purdue University to
any individual with a delinquent NSF grant final report.
