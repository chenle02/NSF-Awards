With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Furman University will acquire a Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR)/Raman spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas: a) the synthesis and characterization of polydiacetylenes; b)
novel constrained macrocyclic ligands and their coordination complexes for
studies in biocatalysis; c) synthesis and characterization of surface-mounted
porphyrin arrays; d) Raman spectroscopy of simple aqueous ions; e) Raman
spectroscopy of CO adducts of Lewis acids; f) reactive supramolecular complexes
of tris(aryl)diolefins and transition metals; and g) aging of polymer
composites. Scientists at area colleges and local industrial laboratories will
have access to this equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fourier transform
infrared/Raman spectrometer is a veritable workhorse in the modern chemical
laboratory and can provide important information about molecular and electronic
structure. Given that the instrument is robust and easy to use, it is ideal for
use by undergraduates in both course work and research. The investigators will
also develop new curricular resources for the chemical education community.
