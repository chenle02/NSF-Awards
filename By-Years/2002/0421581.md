With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Berea College will acquire a liquid chromatograph ion
trap tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including a) the analysis of synthetic peptides and amino acids;
b) the characterization of ginsenosides, active compounds found in ginseng that
are potential cancer-fighting agents; c) analysis of polyphosphate samples; and
d) the oxidation of high molecular weight alcohols by halogen complexes.

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC/MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research at Berea
College, a primarily undergraduate institution. These studies will have a solid
impact in the area of biochemistry, medicinal chemistry and synthetic chemistry.
