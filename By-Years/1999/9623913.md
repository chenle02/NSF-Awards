The research addresses object recognition from controlled industrial
environments to less restricted domains. This will require object representation
that can encode the prototypical shape of an object without requiring its exact
geometry. Furthermore, object recognition is not a single isolated task, but
rather a complex interaction of a set of closely-related behaviors, including
both bottom-up and top down recognition, localization, active recognition,
quantitative shape recovery, and object tracking. Not only must these individual
problems be solved, they must be integrated within a common representational
framework, since a complex recognition task may involve rapid transitions from
one behavior to another. Earlier research in the PI's laboratory began with the
introduction of a novel object representation integrating object-centered and
viewercentered models, this representation, a probabilistic partbased aspect
hierarchy, has formed the foundation for novel approaches to each of the above
recognition problems. The new research will extend the work along each of these
behaviors, supporting their application to more complex domains, including that
of visual aids for the disabled as well as content-based image retrieval. In
addition, this research will address the task of determining, for a given set of
3-D objects, the decomposition of the objects into parts which is optimal in
terms of recognition performance.
