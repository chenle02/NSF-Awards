This work in theoretical condensed matter physics and materials research will
cover the fields of semiconductors, transition metals, surfaces, chemisorption
systems, solid-solid interfaces and superlattices, defects, electronic structure
of novel materials, materials under high pressures, high Tc superconductors, and
many-body effects in solids. The major objective is to explain and predict the
properties of real materials at the microscopic level from first principles.
Several different approaches are employed depending on the systems and
properties under investigation. Structural and bonding properties are obtained
using the ab initio pseudopotential density functional formalism: excited-state
properties are calculated using a many-body Green's function approach;
groundstate properties of strongly correlated electronic systems are calculated
using a quantum Monte Carlo approach. A host of solid state properties are
obtained with these methods. Among these are: structural information, phase
stability, quasiparticle energies, optical and photoemission spectra, density of
states, charge density distributions, surface and interface characteristics,
phonon dispersion relations, electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interaction
parameters, magnetic properties, superconducting transition temperatures, and a
variety of other solid state phenomena. Some specific new directions are planned
in the areas of ceramics, layered and hard materials, quasiparticle energies and
excitation spectra of solids, surfaces and interfaces, clusters, quantum Monte
Carlo calculations of solid state properties, and total dielectric functions.
