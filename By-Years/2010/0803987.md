Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Liberty Science Center will organize a one-
day symposium linked to the Giant Screen Cinema Association (GSCA) International
Conference and Trade show in September 2008. The symposium will focus on the
greater potential of gian screen experiences to connect society with science,
building on the GSTA's symposium "Giant Screen Films and Lifelong Learning held
in 1999. The program will bring together science and education experts with
filmakers to stimulate and enhance more effective approaches to science learning
in future giant screen films. Symposium results will be disseminated through
publication and the internet, as well prepared for submission to peer-reviewed
journals. An industry-specific listserv focused on lifelong learning will be
created to serve as a new community-building tool for exchange among producers,
distributors and exhibitors. Emlyn Koster (Liberty Science Center) and Mary
Nucci (Rutgers University) will serve as aymposium chair/PI and symposium
manager/Co-PI, respectively; in partnership with GSCA staff, they will be
responsible for symposium management, evaluation, and dissemination of results.
