The purpose of this research is to explore a new approach to the economic
analysis of nonstationary time series data. Most currently available model
specifications assume that optimal forecasts of economic events are linear
functions of past observations. By contrast, the model developed in this project
is nonlinear in the data. The nonlinearity arises from the hypothesis that the
process governing important economic variables are occasionally subject to
discrete, dramatic changes in regime. Despite its nonlinear nature, the model is
shown to be completely tractable for many theoretical and empirical rational-
expectations applications. This research is important because the new model
holds promise for a number of interesting applications, among them; (a) an
alternative approach to characterizing the business cycle, which may enable us
to better forecast business fluctuations; (b) a more flexible tool for analyzing
financial data, for example in trying to identify and understand the dramatic
fluctuations in the stock market; (c) a better approach for analyzing the
effects of dramatic shifts in public policy within a rigorous econometric
framework.
