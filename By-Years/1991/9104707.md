The evolution of the Actinopterygii (ray finned fish) has proceeded in three
stages. The first group were the Chondrostei. This group was succeeded by the
Holostean fishes which were superceded by the Teleosts, the most diverse group
of living vertebrates. The fossil record indicates that Holostean fish were the
ancestors to the Teleosts. Only two genera of Holosteans have survived (Amia and
Lepisosteus). Amia is a "living fossil." This proposal will focus on the
biochemical characterization of several pituitary hormones found in Amia using
state of the art techniques of protein analysis and genetic engineering. These
hormones will be compared with those of more "advanced" fishes. Holosteans are
commercially important and the study may provide insights into ways to better
manage this fishery. //
