This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
mathematics and involves ten U.S. university-based investigators, including 5
recent doctorates, and an equal number of investigators in Grenoble, France. The
American and French groups, consisting of participants from different
institutions, will be led by Carolyn Gordon of Dartmouth College and Pierre
Berard of the Institut Fourier, University of Grenoble. The focus of their
research is inverse spectral problems in Riemannian geometry. They will study
the extent to which eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace operator on a Riemannian
manifold determines the geometry of the manifold. This problem is frequently
phrased as `Can one hear the shape of a drum.` General techniques for
constructing manifolds with the same spectrum; questions of spectral rigidity;
and relationships between the spectrum and the geometry of Riemannian manifolds
will be addressed. The proposal brings together mathematicians with
complementary abilities and mutual interests. The results of the project will
have important applications in all fields of mathematics and for example, in
signal processing and remote sensing.
