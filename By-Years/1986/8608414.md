The current tools for designing computer architectures are primitive and often
result in the creation of incomplete and ambiguous specifications. The products
resulting from these specifications seldom meet the original requirements.
Costly redesign cycles result increasing the development time and cost. Design
tools will be developed that will provide the following four capabilities: (l)
the capability to make certain decisions via means that are driven by a
knowledge-based system; (2) the capability to resolve design dependencies; (3)
the capability to automatically generate design documentation as the design
progresses; and (4) the capability to construct architecture and work load
models using parameterization so that the design can be evaluated as it evolves.
