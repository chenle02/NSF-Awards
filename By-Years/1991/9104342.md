This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Mechanisms of action of homeotic gene products
during floral development through chimeric plants" is to be carried out in the
laboratory of Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz at California Institutes of Technology. The
applicant received his Ph.D. training in the area of cell biology with a focus
on the protein import into chloroplasts. In his postdoctoral training, he plans
to study the molecular biology of flower development using a variety of mutants
of Arabidopsis. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to
increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
