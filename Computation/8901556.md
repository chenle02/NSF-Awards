The principal investigator will investigate estimation for semiparametric
regression models. Such regression models are useful for the analysis of large
data sets, for analyzing the data from observational studies, and for pooling
information of all relevant data in statistical analysis. The method of sieves
and the polynomial spline are used to study the semiparametric regression
models. The research will consist of finding an efficient estimator of the
parametric component in semiparametric regression models and giving a
theoretical justification for a proposed principle to handle semiparametric
models.
