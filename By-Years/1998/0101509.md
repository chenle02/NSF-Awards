This project brings together a planning team composed of stakeholders of the
Tennessee Valley Region to develop a comprehensive and systematic plan for a
regional center for information technology education. The center addresses the
need to increase the region's capacity to produce and sustain an information
technology workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on developing human
resources capacity to enable further automation and sustain the region's major
industries of manufacturing, finance, and health care. The planning process
focuses on three areas: development of plans and processes to build a community
of those with an interest in information technology education, development of a
detailed plan for academic program reform and faculty development in information
technology education in the region, and creation of a program that engages a
large population of potential information technology workers. The planning team
that manages the process has representatives from the major stakeholders in the
region including community colleges, universities, a large metropolitan school
system, and industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;
