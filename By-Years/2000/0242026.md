ABSTRACT CTS-0242026 S. Friedlander, UCLA

The proposed is on the mechanical properties of a chain aggregate of
nanoparticles using a device designed in the PI's lab. The proposal is focused
on improving the design of this device to measure (1) the dynamics of the
stretching and contraction, (2) Mechanism and time scale of fracture, (3)
investigation of the impact of polymeric matrix on the strain in nanoparticle
chain aggregates, and 4) analysis of chain aggregate deformation based on the
strain energy of one dimensional chain model.
