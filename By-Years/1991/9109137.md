Signaled occurrences of food, rivals, predators, or mates produce Pavlovian-
conditioned anticipatory responses in all vertebrates, including humans. The
ability of so many different animals to exhibit this type of learning in so many
different contexts would suggest that the anticipatory response is probably
highly adaptive. However, despite intense interest shown in the biological
function of Pavlovian conditioning over the last twenty-five years, direct
experimental investigations have been sparse. Recently, however, several studies
have demonstrated the adaptive value of Pavlovian conditioning in the aggressive
and reproductive behavior of a territorial freshwater fish. The aim of this
project is to explore in greater detail the way in which Pavlovian conditioning
enhances animals' aggressive and reproductive strategies. One study will
determine whether signals accompanying aggressive encounters predispose winners
and losers to assume different strategies in subsequent contests. Other
experiments will explore how conditioning affects the frequency and duration of
aggressive behavior. Finally, the role of signaling in females' choice of mates
will be examined. Almost nothing is known about the role that Pavlovian
conditioning plays in naturally-occurring aggressive and reproductive behavior,
despite the fact that conditioned aggressive and reproductive responses are
easily evoked in many animals, including humans. These studies will redress that
problem as well as shed light on the long-standing question of what is learned
in Pavlovian conditioning.
