Proposal Id: EIA-0120092 PI: Pascale Carayon Institution: U. Wisconsin Title:
Paths to Retention and Turnover in the IT Workforce: Understanding the
Relationships Between Gender, Minority Status, Job and Organizational Factors

This ITWF award provides support for the University of Wisconsin to conduct a
study that will identify the job, organizational and quality of working life
(QWL) factors that influence turnover intention within the current IT workforce,
and the way gender and minority status play a role in the relationships between
job and organizational factors, QWL and intention to turnover. Two different
models of the role of gender and minority status will be used and tested and
compared in a sample of IT employees across a range of companies and jobs. The
first research model postulates that gender and minority status have direct
effects on job and organizational factors and both direct and indirect effects
on QWL and intention to turnover. The second research model postulates that
gender and minority status play a moderating role in the relationship between
job and organizational factors and QWL and intention to turnover.
