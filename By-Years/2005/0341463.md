Engineering NEC (59) In response to the national need for increased mathematics
and problem solving skills among engineering students, a team of faculty members
from engineering and mathematics are creating pedagogical techniques and
curriculum to develop problem solving skills that targets freshman who are ready
to take calculus. The project is testing these techniques in one section of our
first year Foundations of Engineering course (GES 131). A goal is to promote
mastery and transfer of knowledge and skills in future coursework. The emphasis
of the course is to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Challenge students and provide them with a
high level of proficiency to solve "hard" problems, in which the method and
concepts for solution are not immediately known.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop student's
conceptual understanding of the problem solving process by learning how to
describe the methods that they used to solve the problem. &lt;br/&gt;3. Develop
self-efficacy as students learn how to solve these "hard" problems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course engages the students in collaborative learning
exercises, which provides a primary method for students to learn and practice
explanation and self-explanation techniques. Additional instructional activities
include cumulative review of mathematics concepts, hands on exercises,
instruction in metacognition, presentations to external visitors, and students
creating their own hard problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student learning within
this section is being compared to student performance in other sections using
traditional methods. Assessment techniques include pre and post course testing
of problem solving ability, pre and post course self efficacy questionnaires,
reflective papers, focus groups, observation, and specific examination questions
in subsequent math and physics courses. The success of this proof of concept
study is expected to lead to a full development effort that would develop a
textbook and an extensive list of hard problems for others to use and
adapt.&lt;br/&gt;
