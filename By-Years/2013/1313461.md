Jupiter's moon Europa may harbor a global water ocean of approximately 100 km in
depth, having 2 to 3 times the volume of all the liquid water on Earth. Despite
almost a decade of observations from the Galileo spacecraft, it is still not
clear whether Europa is merely a passive ice shell with a thin surface layer of
active chemistry, or a geologically active body with a chemically rich ocean.
One key to resolving the issue is determining the relationship between the icy
surface and the interior ocean chemistry. Recent models suggest hydrated
sulfuric acid created by ion bombardment should be abundant in the trailing
hemisphere, with hydrated salts deposited by ocean evaporation more dominant
elsewhere. Galileo data are of insufficient spectroscopic resolution to
constrain the models in detail; but modern infrared spectrographs with adaptive
optics systems on large ground based telescopes are capable of mapping the
surface chemistry. The Principal Investigator and collaborators will observe
Europa using the adaptive optics system on the Keck telescope to obtain
unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and moderate spatial resolution from
the near infrared through the thermal infrared, and will chemically map the
surface of Europa, identifying salts and radiation products and determining
their spatial distributions. They will construct a comprehensive model of the
sources and sinks of chemical species on Europa's surface, disentangle
indigenous and exogenous materials, and begin to explore the chemical
composition of the unseen ocean beneath the icy crust. The project will
constitute the Ph.D. dissertation work of a graduate student, and an
undergraduate student will be involved in the project through the Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellowship program. The Principal Investigator will
communicate research results to the public through a variety of outreach
activities.
