The principal investigator will explore a new and more unified method for
including the solvent in Monte Carlo simulations of proteins. Many of the
specific techniques are borrowed from methods currently being used in
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The computational portion of
this work will involve simulations on a 32K processor Connection Machine which
has a massively parallel computer architecture. This Small Grant for Exploratory
Research award reflects the transfer of knowledge from physics to biology and
the multidisciplinary nature of the work, involving research expertise in
physics, computation and biology.
