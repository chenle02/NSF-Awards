9508902 Minicozzi The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
are awards to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical
sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the
scientific effort of the nation. As researchers in the mathematical sciences
expand their interactions with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases
between the various areas of mathematics itself, opportunities for postdoctoral
research and training are becoming increasingly important. The Fellowships are
designed to permit awardees to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. The fellowship is
designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18 academic-year months
and three periods of two summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the
Research Fellowship option which allows for full time support for any 18
academic year months in a three year period, in intervals not shorter than 3
consecutive months or (2) the Research Instructorship option which allows the 18
months of academic year support to be taken as nine months of full time support
and 18 months of half time support. Not more than two months of summer support
from this Fellowship may be received in any calendar year. William Minicozzi
received his doctoral degree from Stanford University and will pursue research
under the guidance of Joel Spruck at Johns Hopkins University. The research will
be conducted in differential geometry, specifically the study of variational
problems and minimal surfaces.
