The Internet has been one of the proudest success stories in computer science
research; visionary researchers aided by farsighted funding agencies changed the
world in a fundamental, and unexpected, way. However, Internet research (by
which we mean networking research focused on the Internet and related networks)
is now at a crossroads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Internet itself is now fully
commercial, and less amenable to input from the research community. Many
researchers struggle with the choice between evolutionary research (which might
influence the infrastructure) and revolutionary research (which will almost
definitely not have such impact). Moreover, many outside the field consider the
Internet, at least from the networking perspective, to be a solved problem. For
those in the field, there is little doubt that there is much more work to be
done, but there is little agreement on what that work
is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on three main topics:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Are we done yet? After all the progress that has been
made in the last 20 years, we must ask ourselves if there are remaining
technical challenges that require our attention. What questions should the field
be focusing on? &lt;br/&gt;o How can we formalize what we know? While Internet
research has created an amazing artifact, it has created little in the way of
fundamental scientific foundations; Internet design lore is well accepted, but
poorly formalized. Can we create a .science of networking that applies to the
Internet and other similar networks? &lt;br/&gt;o How do maximize the impact of
our research? In the early years, Internet research had a tremendous impact on
the deployed infrastructure. Now, much of Internet research has little effect on
the commercial offerings. How can we increase the impact of our research? What
is the right mix of evolutionary versus revolutionary research? Are there
infrastructures, such as overlays or open-source routing code, that would
increase the impact?
