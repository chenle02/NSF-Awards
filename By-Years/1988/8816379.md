Dr. Schumaker is developing a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the
complement system. He plans to produce substantial amounts of C1r and C1s, sub-
components of C1 (the first major component of the complement system), using the
baculovirus, insect cell system and initiate site-directed mutagenesis studies.
He will also try to produce X-ray quality crystals of both C1r and C1s. In
addition, he will carry out a detailed thermodynamic and kinetic study of
dissociation and association rates and dissociation constants for C1, and
measure the rates of spontaneous activation. How does an antibody, through
interaction with an antigen, trigger the immune response? C1 is a soluble, well-
defined macromolecular complex, and understanding how it functions should
provide one answer to this important immunochemical question.
