This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize an
innovative high output ultraviolet (UV) lithography 0.25 mm T-gate fabrication
process to develop high yield and high throughput manufacturing of millimeter-
wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) transceivers on 6" substrates. This
effort will focus on (1) developing high quality 6" metamorphic wafers for high
circuit yield; (2) demonstrate a metamorphic field-effect transistor (FET) using
a 0.25 mm T-gate (non-E beam) process, (3) select the key MMIC to combine for
high performance transceiver functionality. Successful completing of these
objectives will serve as the basis for combining proven MMICs for the design and
fabrication of Ka-band and E-Band transceivers.

The MMIC technology market has shown great potential for applications in
telecommunications (including radar-based systems). Single function MMIC designs
require expensive machining and packaging. This effort should to a lower-cost
transceiver for the $10 billion MMIC market.
