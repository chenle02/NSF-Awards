This renewal proposal is aimed at a study of elementary photochemical reactions
at low temperatures (10-80 K) using thermal desorption and vibrational and
electronic electron energy loss spectroscopies, and photon induced desorption
mass spectrometry. Reactions to be studied include the photo-oxidation and
photo- reduction of carbon monoxide and ethylene coadsorbed with oxygen and
hydrogen sulfide on silver (110) and platinum (111).
