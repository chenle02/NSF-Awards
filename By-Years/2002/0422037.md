This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will culminate
in the demonstration of the smallest, most economical phased array system yet
developed for addressing the problem of how to traverse the "last mile" between
a broadband network and the home. During the course of the project, the state of
the art in phased array antenna technology will be advanced and networking
algorithms will be developed to take advantage of this innovative technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research project is to fulfill
the challenge to economically deliver wireless Internet access to rural
communities. This steerable technology provides a greater than 50 percent
increase in coverage and a cost savings of up to 55 percent. These cost and
coverage improvements would help meet the needs and bring the benefits of
broadband Internet into areas of the country that remain underserved.
