This award will provide funds for the purchase of an engineering workstation and
a multi-color pen plotter to be used for the design and layout of VLSI test
chips, packages, and interconnect structures. This equipment will establish CAD
capabilities of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of Arizona for the design complexities needed to support their
research programs. The workstation will greatly increase the productivity of
research personnel in designing and laying out all chips and substrates for
these programs. The predicted increase of VLSI chip complexity by an order of
magnitude every 2 to 3 years can only be realized if equally significant
advances in high-performance packaging technology and in innovative design
methods are achieved. Thus, this award is clearly consistent with the broad
goals of the NSF equipment program.
