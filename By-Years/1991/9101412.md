The investigator is developing methods for studying the structure of isolated
invariant sets that are applicable to a wide variety of problems, e.g.,
travelling waves for reaction-diffusion systems, dynamic phase transition,
magnetohydrodynamic shock waves, delay equations, to name a few. More
specifically, it is concerned with deriving algebraic invariants that describe
invariant sets, determining how they can change through bifurcations, and
determining which geometric topological structures are imposed on the invariant
sets by the algebraic invariants. The guiding philosophy behind these methods
comes from the fact that many differential equations that arise as models of
biological, chemical, or physical systems share the following three
characteristics: (1) they are derived from idealized descriptions of complicated
phenomena, (2) they are parameterized systems and exact values of the parameters
are not known, (3) they are nonlinear. Thus, from the point of view of
applications, describing the global and robust structure of the solutions to
these differential equations is of great importance. At the same time, it is
well known that nonlinear systems undergo tremendously complicated bifurcations
(e.g., the appearance of chaotic dynamics). Therefore, any general theory must
rely on tools that are indifferent to the fine structure of the invariant sets,
e.g. the Conley index theory.
