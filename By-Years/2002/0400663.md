With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor Frederick D. Lewis of the
Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. The research
will continue investigations of the interaction of light with organic molecules.
Photochemical rearrangements of styrene derivatives, involving an initial
photocyclization to a high energy ground state species that undergoes a thermal
hydrogen migration to yield a stable aromatic product, will be studied. The
potential energy surface along which these reactions proceed will be probed by
measuring the kinetics and thermodynamics of both the thermal and photochemical
steps. Molecules with geometries designed to undergo facile photochemical
rearrangement will be synthesized. The data resulting from these studies will be
fundamental to the understanding of the role of energetics in low barrier
isomerizations. Photochemical and photophysical investigations designed to
elucidate the nature of intramolecular interactions in diarylureas and
polyarylureas will be carried out. Since these molecules adopt unusual folded
structures in which adjacent aryl groups have a face-to-face geometry, they are
ideal model systems for investigating phenomena such as charge transfer and
electron transport in molecular systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are
expected to have broad impact upon fundamental understanding of electron
transport in organic molecules. Such information will contribute to the basis
for the construction of molecular wires and devices. The research will also
provide valuable training for students at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.&lt;br/&gt;
