Abstract

Bayes and frequentist approaches are the two main paradigms for statistical
inference. Of late, likelihood-based methods are also being proposed in many
inferential problems. The proposed research falls in the interface and considers
asymptotic inference in these paradigms. Higher order asymptotic expansions play
an important role in Bayes, frequentist and likelihood approaches to inference.
This proposal considers developing such expansions and using them in specific
applications such as Bayesian experimental design, small area estimation and
contingency tables. Small area estimation is becoming increasingly popular in
many federal and local government programs. Both hierarchical Bayes and
empirical Bayes approaches are receiving favorable attention from the users of
small area statistics. Hierarchical Bayes procedures rely to a great extent on
the use of noninformative priors. Indeed, the wider acceptance of Bayesian
techniques in recent years both in the theory and in the practice of statistics
is partly due to various noninformative priors. Higher order asymptotics have
been used by the PI in his past research to (i) develop second order accurate
approximations to measure of uncertainty in small area estimation, (ii)
calibrate naive EB confidence intervals, (iii) compare various adjustments to
profile likelihoods in likelihood-based inference, and (iv) obtain frequentist
validation of various noninformative priors. Specifically, the following
problems will be investigated: (a) Asymptotic comparison of adjusted likelihoods
via expected volumes of confidence sets, mean squared errors of point estimates
and other criteria; (b) Optimal Bayesian designs in variance components problem;
(c) EB interval estimation with applications in small area estimation; (d)
Frequentist validation of noninformative priors in the context of small area
estimation; (e) Higher order expansion of null distribution of score tests in
two-way contingency tables; (f) Robust estimation in small area estimation using
survey weights.

Research on small area estimation has received considerable attention in recent
years due to growing demand for reliable small area statistics by federal and
local government agencies (e.g., the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Statistics Canada, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Central
Statistical Office of U.K.). A small area usually refers to a subgroup of a
population from which samples are drawn. The subgroup may be a geographical
region (e.g., county) or a group obtained by cross-classification of demographic
factors. Reliable small area statistics are needed in regional planning and fund
allocation in many federal and local government programs. Currently, the Census
Bureau is engaged in developing small area estimates of number of poor children
in school-going age at the county level, and developing adjustment factors to
the census counts for various geographic and demographic classes. Experimental
designs play an important role in agriculture and industrial productions.
Optimal designs allow experimenters to derive maximum utility for a given
budget. Categorical data, which occur abundantly in every fields of quantitative
study, especially in social sciences, consist of frequency of counts in various
categories of interest to an experimenter. Statistical solutions to be developed
here are expected to lead to new and useful methodolgies on the research
problems considered in this proposal.
