The goal of this project is to understand at the molecular level the sequence
of events in the activation of complement by immune complexes. A variety of
mutant C1s's (a subunit of C1, the first component of the complement system)
will be expressed in the baculovirus insect cell system. Attempts will be made
to crystallize these mutant proteins for structure studies. Monoclonal
antibodies will be employed as probes of the structure of C1 and the manner in
which the subunits Cls, Clr and Clq are combined. Electron microscopy will be
also used in determining the locations of binding sites of antibody to Clr and
Cls.
