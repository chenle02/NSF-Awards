9308837 Betenbaugh This project is on research to increase the expression of
correctly folded (active) antibodies in insect cells. The expression of
functional antibodies is accompanied by the formation of abnormal protein
complexes and aggregates in which the polypeptide chains are bound together into
incorrect associations. This research will attempt to reduce the aggregation
reactions, in order to increase the yield of active antibodies, by increasing
the intracellular levels of two catalytic proteins, immunoglobin binding protein
(BiP), and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). This will be accomplished by
cloning genes for BiP and PDI into baculovirus. Also, kinetic models will be
developed to determine rate-limiting steps and to optimize the assembly of
active antibodies. ***
