There does not exist a general analytical method for solving flow through a
randomly heterogeneous porous medium. Current methods are either perturbation
methods or Monte Carlo simulations. The former can only deal with small
variances while the latter is very time consuming or expensive to compute. This
Expedited Award for Novel Research will explore the applicability of the
spectral method for computational efficiency for flow through random porous
media. Spectral methods are not new to nonlinear problems but had not been
applied to this problem. The Institutional support is adequate and the PI is
qualified to carry out the research, I recommend support.
