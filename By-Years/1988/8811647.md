The objective of this research in fluid mechanics is to increase the output and
fuel economy of an internal combustion (IC) engine by examining the exact flow
inside an engine thereby enhancing the mixture of the incoming air and fuel.
Better mixing means more complete burning of the fuel which also implies safer
emissions. Current techniques involving the fluid mechanics of engine flows are
limited particularly in capturing important information regrading fluid
turbulence. A new technique has been developed at Michigan State University
involving a laser beam which is divided to form a grid of intersecting lines in
the engine. With this new technique a wide variety of engine diagnostics and
fluid mechanics will be performed. Using the velocity gradient in the region of
the grid obtained by the new techniques, the strain rates and vorticity
quantities will be determined. Internal engine design would benefit using these
quantities since it would be possible to optimize scavenging of the cylinder of
burnt gases and minimize mixing with the burnt charge. The new technique offers
improved possibilities for pre-combustion mixing of air and fuel.
