Coral reefs are geologically ancient ecosystems that have provided excellent
historical evidence of global climatic changes and some of the best indications
extant of ecosystem response to such changes. Yet coral reefs are believed by
some to be indicators of global climate change in more than just the historical
sense. There has been considerable recent speculation in the press, discussion
among reef researchers, and testimony on the topic of coral "bleaching," a
phenomenon that some interpret as a stress reaction of reef corals to elevated
sea surface temperature (SST's) caused by global climate change. This
interpretation has been met with considerable skepticism from many in the
scientific community, yet it has nonetheless captured considerable attention in
the press and in Congress. Coral bleaching is a possible present indicator of
climate change. This workshop will meet a critical need to assess the state of
our knowledge about coral bleaching and, in the larger sense, to determine
research needs for the next decade for understanding the effects of potential
global climate change on shallow water tropical marine ecosystems such as coral
reefs.
