Virus-Inspired Declarative Geometric Computation

The goal of the project is to develop geometric computational models and tools
for virus assembly from their constituent proteins, and virus crystal packing.
Furthermore, inspiration of the above processes is being used to rethink
computationally tractable declarative geometry (DG), defined as the intuitive,
constraint-based representation and efficient realization of composites of
simple interacting geometric objects, starting from a declarative specification
of the composite's properties. In particular, a new game-theoretic constraint
model is being developed for the underlying class of algebraic-geometric
computations and corresponding algebraic varieties. Existing software in the
form of the PI's geometric constraint solver FRONTIER is forming the base for
implementing the new computational framework.

The new virus computational models is used for the studying the following
unanswered questions on carefully chosen, geometrically significant viruses: (a)
the isolation of crucial geometric events during assembly (helpful for
disrupting assembly); (b) the isolation of assembly events - such as molecular
conformational changes - that require the involvement of viral genomic material,
(helpful for understanding DNA-protein interactions); and (c) the isolation of
key geometric events during virus crystallization (as an idealized version of
molecular crystallization).

The new DG virus models is being refined and validated by checking consistency
with known behavior of viruses and their constituent proteins during assembly
and crystallization. A small number of other highly focused experiments;
selective X-ray crystallography and/or cryoelectron microscopy is being
performed. As a significant player to help with both of the above goals, use the
distinctive Maize-streak virus (MSV) will be used, whose structure and
properties are particularly suited to goals of the project. A comparison of the
new geometric virus models with other geometry-based computational virus models
is being made.
