This project supports a cultural anthropologist at the University of South
Florida in an analysis of the network structure of public and private social
service agencies in the Tampa Bay area. Using network algorithms to analyze the
function and shape of the interactions between these agencies, the project will
describe and analyze the hierarchy of interactions between about 500 agencies.
This research is important because communities in the developed world have
multiple social service agencies interacting with each other, various levels of
government, social institutions such as schools, and the general public.
Understanding how these interactions are structured in a hierarchical manner
will advance the abilities of decision makers to allocate resources efficiently.
