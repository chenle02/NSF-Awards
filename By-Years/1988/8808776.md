This proposal requests funding for a conference on "Microeconomic Perspectives
on Aggregate Phenomena" to be held at Northwestern University during August of
1988. Topics which are likely to be included are labor markets and intertemporal
contracting issues, financial markets with an emphasis on endogenous choice of
security structure, long-term growth and its determinants and macroeconomic
coordination problems. These are all areas of extremely active theoretical
research and experience indicates that bringing people together who are working
on the "cutting edge" will lead to fruitful interaction. The conference will run
for one week (five days) with three formal seminars given on each day. The set
of theoretical topics are very important in macroeconomics but they have tended
not to be adequately addressed by other week-long conferences of small size. The
ensuing publications should yield additional opportunities for interaction
between researchers with common interests.
