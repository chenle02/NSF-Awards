This proposal is for equipment to support research in materials used to make
roads, bridges and buildings. The work includes the study of materials under
varying environmental conditions and under long-term use. For example, freeze-
thaw conditions applied to composite materials and concrete, elastic constants
over wide temperature ranges. The equipment which will be purchased includes a
thermal chamber with humidity control, roller grips and extensometer, and a
high-resolution uv microscope; a dynamic mechanical analyzer; x-ray equipment; a
data acquisition board for a computer; a collection of servo's sensors, portable
computers and data acquisition systems for field work.
