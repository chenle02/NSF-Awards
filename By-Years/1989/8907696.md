Arthropods, including crustaceans, grow by molting. The individual makes a
protective body covering, or exoskeleton, underneath its old exoskeleton, and
then crawls out of the old protective exoskeleton while the new one is still
soft and pliable. The soft shell crab is a familiar example of an arthropod in
this condition. At this stage the animal can enlarge within the shell. Finally
the shell hardens again into its protective form. Arthropods are of major
interest in the world environment, not to say the world's economy, since they
make up 7/8 of all species of animals. Three-fourths of them are insects; nearly
all of the rest are arachnids (spiders, scorpians) and crustaceans (shrimps,
lobsters, crabs). Dr. Skinner has devised a method for controlling the timing of
molting in crustaceans. Working with a land crab as typical of this class of
animals, her laboratory proposes to explore the biochemistry of molting, with
emphasis on the formation of the shell and associated structures. They will also
explore the regulatory events associated with molting: the hormonal controls,
and the activation of specific genes. In addition, the experiments will examine
the generality of molting processes by looking for biochemical cross-relatedness
with similar processes taking place in insects. The understanding of these basic
physiological activities is not only of interest and importance in its own
right, but is useful knowledge for such human-related purposes as expanding the
food supply and, conversely, the development of environmentally acceptable pest
controls.
