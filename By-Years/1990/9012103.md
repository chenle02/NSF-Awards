The processes controlling the fate of particle-reactive U/Th decay series
isotopes in the oceans must be fully understood in order to ascertain their
usefulness as tracers for particle dynamics. Thorium kinetic and equilibrium
behavior appears to be the consequence of a combination of physical (particle-
particle interactions) and chemical (adsorption) processes. A colloidal pumping
hypothesis stating that Th isotopes are transferred from the dissolved state to
macroparticles via a colloidal will be tested. Research suggests that Th
"scavenging" rates most likely represent the rate of coagulation of submicron
particles with a large-particle pool rather than Th sorption itself. Laboratory
experiments will use inorganic and organic model particles in order to further
test and simulate the proposed coupling of sorption and coagulation processes.
Field experiments will test the oceanic scavenging model under experimentally
constrained conditions to better understand the applicability of results from
laboratory studies to natural environments.
