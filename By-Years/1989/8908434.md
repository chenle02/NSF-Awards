This is a travel grant award in support of the participation of thirteen U.S.
scientists at the Bilateral NSF-CNRS Conference on Molecular Recognition which
will be held in Perigord, France from August 18 through August 22, 1989. This
meeting will, for the first time, bring together American and French scientists
to discuss the progress and direction of research in both biochemical and
chemical molecular recognition. The meeting will be attended by 25-30 leading
scientists from both countries and will provide an opportunity for stimulating
discussions and the exchange of ideas and unpublished results. The conference
will generate stronger personal and scientific ties which will lead to more
extensive bilateral collaborations. Funds are provided for round trip airfare,
other travel costs and a per diem allowance.
