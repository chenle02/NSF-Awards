This award is for a conference which will survey the state of the art in one of
the dominant paradigms in mathematics -- the Langlands program. These
conjectures and partial results began as a set of elegant relationships between
number theory and harmonic analysis, and have driven progress on many stunning
results across a wide range of mathematics over the last half century. The
conference will be held on November 14-16, 2018, at the Institute for
Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University of Minnesota. Detailed
program information can be found at the conference website:

Themes for the lectures include recent advances in the trace formula; Eisenstein
series and L-functions; local, geometric, and p-adic versions of the Langlands
program; Shimura varieties; and endoscopy and beyond. The speaker list is
comprised of many of the world experts in aspects of the Langlands program, and
was determined by the scientific organizing committee of James Arthur, William
Casselman, Geir Ellingsrud, and Freydoon Shahidi. The event presents a unique
opportunity for the next generation of mathematical researchers to learn modes
of possible progress on this fundamental collection of conjectures.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
