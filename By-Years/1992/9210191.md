ABSTRACT Empirical and theoretical research previously conducted on the role of
emotion in social perception suggests that investigation of the mechanism
responsible for emotional influences in perception is essential. This research
will test an emotion network model of perceptual memory; new experiments on the
perceptual prioritizing (distortion) effects of emotion will also be conducted.
The investigator will collaborate with Dr. Russell Fazio at Indiana University
to improve her use of new methodology in state of the art equipment for
conducting perception research.
