The research of this Presidential Young Investigator is in the artificial
intelligence fields of learning and automated reasoning. Because computers
require an explicit model of a system to perform reasoning and the character of
the reasoning depends critically on the nature of the model, great leverage can
be obtained by enabling programs to reformulate their models dynamically. The
investigator has pursued reformulation in his work on aggregation and the
comparative analysis techniques of differential qualitative analysis and
exaggeration. He will now incorporate ideas from machine learning to aid in the
reformulation task. One specific project is to generalize current schemes for
model reformulation. The limits of applicability for each model will be
represented explicitly in a language based on the simplifications implicitly
assumed by the model. A second project is a restricted form of theory formation:
the automatic construction of world models. Here the approach is to generalize
previous work on measurement interpretation and view application by
characterizing the program's views with the modeling language described above.
