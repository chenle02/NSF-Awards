Engineering - Civil (54) Linguistics (84)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An on-going and
persistent challenge facing engineering faculty and students is the development
of students' writing skills to meet the demands of undergraduate engineering
programs and the workplace. A multi-disciplinary team of faculty from
linguistics and engineering, along with practicing engineers, addresses the
challenge through detailed examinations of written texts. The research analyzes
the structure of student and professional writing assignments in order to
describe and examine the mismatch between the writing skills of engineering
program students/graduates and the demands of writing in the workplace. The
innovative and multi-disciplinary approach to examine written texts by
professional engineers and engineering students has the potential of providing
new insight into the practice of writing in the workplace and the development of
writing skills writ large, as well as providing guidance in the instruction of
writing for professional settings. A rigorous evaluation plan includes assessing
the success of the project by an independent evaluation consultant and the
submission and acceptance of research articles in peer review of journals and
the acceptance of paper presentations at professional meetings.
