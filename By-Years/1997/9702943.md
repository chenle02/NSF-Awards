ABSTRACT The proposed research seeks to develop a tomographic technique for
nonintrusive heat transfer measurements in 3-D unsteady flows in complex
geometries. The technique involves combining tomographic reconstruction and
holographic interferometry. Laser beams are used to probe the flow field from
different directions. The data is used with tomograpahic reconstruction
algorithms to obtain the temperature field. As part of the educational plan, CD-
ROM based interactive course materials will be developed. The principal
investigator will also introduce opportunities for students to gain hands-on
experience and engage in collaborative projects with industry.
