This project will produce current information on the demographic and employment
characteristics of doctoral scientists, engineers, and humanists in the U.S. To
accomplish this, the contractor will conduct the 1989 Survey of Doctorate
Recipients, develop a longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work
History File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the 1989 survey.
The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining a data base of
demographic, educational, and employment information on scientists and
engineers. This data base, the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System,
requires input from three survey series: The National Survey of Natural and
Social Scientists and Engineers, the Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and
Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. Data from the
Survey of Doctorate Recipients are frequently used to determine the status of
various aspects of U.S. science and engineering, e.g., changes in research and
development activities, and are also used in conjunction with data from the
other surveys for analytical purposes.
