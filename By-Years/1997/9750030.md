Abstract DBI 9750030 Susan C. Jacobs This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of the X-linked color vision
gene in squirrel monkeys." Monkeys of the genus Saimiri possess one autosomal
and one X- linked color photopigment gene. Three alleles of the X- linked gene
have been identified. Maintenance of heterozygosity at this locus has been
attributed to foraging advantages. The hypothesis of heterozygote advantage
predicts the existence of additional alleles at this locus. This research
examines genetic diversification in the X- linked color vision gene among
Saimiri.
