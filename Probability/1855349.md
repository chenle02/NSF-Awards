How does information spread within a system over time? How is this related to
the intrinsic structure of the system? Mathematical models are developed to
understand and make predictions about the behavior of highly complex processes
and structures. Richer and more realistic models can be obtained by increasing
their 'roughness'; here we may think of the intricate branching of large
networks like the Internet. In addition, incorporating randomness can help to
better describe the interactions between the elements that compose the model,
for instance between different web servers. The area of mathematics concerned
with the analysis of random processes and structures is called probability
theory. This project aims to apply probability theory to better understand the
interconnections between the random processes, the geometry, and the analysis of
rough spaces and random geometric models. The research supported by this award
aims to investigate stochastic processes in rough spaces and functionals of
random sets. The PI will analyze the behavior of diffusion processes intrinsic
to fractal-like spaces, where classical concepts such as derivatives or
canonical measures are less straightforward or not even available. Special
attention will be paid to the study of functional inequalities and gradient
estimates to gain further insight into the connections between the process and
the geometry of the underlying space. Besides, the PI will analyze properties of
large spatial data sets modeled by point processes with long range dependencies.
Here, the focus lies on geometric and potential-theoretic aspects of random
covering sets and the asymptotic behavior of statistics employed in the
detection of rare events. The PI expects that the methods and techniques
developed will lead to progress on current questions in mathematical physics,
material and data sciences.
