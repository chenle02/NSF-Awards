The main objectives of the proposed research are to design, analyze, and
implement accurate, robust, and efficient numerical methods for partial
differential equations which model complex multiscale multiphysics systems
arising in science and engineering applications. In particular, the research
will focus on several critical components of the mathematical and numerical
modeling of coupled free fluid and porous media flows: identification of a
correct mathematical model, especially appropriate interface conditions,
analysis of the well-posedness of the model, design and analysis of stable and
accurate numerical discretization methods, including finite element methods on
non-matching grids, interior convergence and postprocessing, and a posteriori
error estimation and adaptivity, and development of efficient solution
algorithms such as parallel domain decomposition and Newton-Krylov-multigrid
solvers and preconditioners.

The numerical techniques to be developed in this research are general and
address fundamental questions of numerical analysis of partial differential
equations. Applications to coupling of groundwater and surface water flows, as
well as modeling of the cardiovascular system will be emphasized. Computer
modeling of subsurface and surface flow and transport can provide reliable and
cost-effective solutions to environmental and energy problems such as
contaminant surface water and groundwater remediation and enhanced oil recovery.
Current simulators do not take into account the complex multiscale interaction
between subsurface and surface geosystems. This research will model this
interaction, which is crucial for the accurate prediction of fluid behavior. The
research will result in the development of robust and flexible software tools
for performing accurate realistic multiprocessor simulations of contaminant
remediation of wetlands, lakes and estuaries. Mathematical and computational
modeling of the cardiovascular system is a relatively new but rapidly growing
area of research. This application has a vast importance to society. For
example, the heart attacks and strokes that result from atherosclerosis are the
major cause of death in industrial nations. The aim of the proposed research in
this area is to model computationally atherosclerosis taking into account the
recently discovered, but critical effect of inflammation. Coupled macroscopic
models of blood flow within the artery and its wall will be combined with
cellular level models of acute inflammatory response. The research will lead to
the development of optimized simulation tools which will advance prevention,
detection, and therapy of atherosclerosis.
