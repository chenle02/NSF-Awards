This research will focus on elucidation the mechanisms of agglomerate dispersion
in controlled flow fields. Mixing of solid additives into a liquid generally
involves rupture and distribution ofthe separated particles throughout the
liquid. In order to elucidate the rate determining step in dispersive mixing,
the principal investigator will develop and analyze models predicting the
dynamics of the agglomerate size distribution in controlled flow fields. Each
model will concentrate on a particular step of the mixing process and
theoretical predictions will be compared with experimental data. The results of
this investigation will advance the understanding of the mechanism of dispersion
of solids into liquids and will provide insight into the design of actual mixing
equipment. Many materials of industrial significance are mixtures of solid
additives into liquids. Examples of such materials include dispersion of
pigments of inks, as well as most plastics and rubber products. The quality of
the dispersion strongly affects the physico-mechanical properties of the final
product. This brings about the need for understanding and control of the
dispersion process.
