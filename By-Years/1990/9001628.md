This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Justin Schwartz of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct collaborative research for
six months with Dr. Kiyoshi Inoue of the National Research Institute for Metals
(NRIM) in Tsukuba, Japan. They will address some of the key development issues
for superconducting magnets. Any practical application of high temperature
ceramic supercon- ductors will require a tremendous research and development
effort. Dr. Schwartz will participate in two on-going projects at NRIM, one
involving design optimization of the coil for a high field pulsed magnet, and
the second looking at long tape, Ag-sheathed, Bi-system high temperature
superconductors. NRIM has been involved in the design and optimization of high
field research magnets for many years and should thus provide an ideal setting
for this young U.S. scientist to participate in pioneering research.
