This proposal focuses on the aggregation process used by individual Decision-
Makers (DMs) to combine probabilistic information from multiple, non-independent
sources. Typical examples are investors who combine forecasts from various
financial advisors regarding the chances of certain stocks to appreciate in
value, and patients who must aggregate information from various experts about
the chances of success of a given medical procedure.

A model is described that assumes that (a) the DM combines information by
averaging the various forecasts, and (b) the DM's confidence in the aggregate is
inversely related to the variance of the (possibly weighted) mean forecast. This
model is used to derive a series of predictions about the factors that affect
and drive the DM's confidence. They will be tested in a series of experiments
that would clarify (a) the nature of the aggregation rules used by DMs, (b) the
factors that affect the DMs' confidence in the final aggregate, (c) the nature
and level of dependence between the aggregates and the confidence they inspire,
and (d) the factors that determine the DM's preference for certain advisors.

In addition to contributing to our understanding of the basic psychological
process involved in aggregating opinions, the results have immediate
implications for several questions of considerable practical interest that arise
in many fields including, but not restricted to, financial, military and medical
decision-making. The results will provide (at least partial) guidelines for
approaching questions such as:

(a) What kind of, and how many, advisors should a DM consult to achieve a
desired level of confidence? (b) What factors make some advisors more or less
attractive in certain types of decision problems? (c) What are the sources of
the surprisingly high correlation among advisors? What is the relative
importance of the various factors and how can one use this information to choose
advisors in an optimal fashion?
