This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Petascale Arctic-Atlantic-Antarctic
Virtual Experiment (PAVE) will be a kilometer resolution, planetary scale ocean
and sea ice simulation that will first be configured to span the Arctic Ocean,
Atlantic Ocean, and Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, and by the end of the
project period will generalize to a fully global simulation. Project
implementation will be based on the Massachussetts Institute of Technology
General Circulation Model (MITgcm), an ocean and sea-ice modeling system that
contains non-hydrostatic and adjoint modeling capabilities that are applicable
to kilometer scale and multi-year simulations. Scientific questions motivating
the simulations are intended to inform sampling strategies for current and
future ocean observing networks. This is a significant broader impact. The large
volumes of model output will be managed and made available to researchers
without petascale resources, using a novel replay capability that will be
developed as part of this project.
