Interconnects are playing an increasingly important role in limiting the speed
of high performance integrated circuit chips and systems. This motivation has
fostered research to use optical rather than electrical interconnects. The
research in progress addresses the fabrication problems posed by efforts to use
the standard silicon wafer with a gallium arsenide (GaAs) light emitter
incorporated. The approach is experimental and investigates use of indium to aid
in matching lattices of different materials.
