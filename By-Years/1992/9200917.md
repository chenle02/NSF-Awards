An investigation of electron spin resonance couplings of biradical species in a
variety of different environments will be conducted. Time-resolved electron
paramagnetic resonance will be used to study the effects of substituents,
geometrical constraints, distance, solvent, and temperature between the flexible
organic biradicals. Media to be included in the investigation include organic
solvents, super critical fluids, vesicles, micelles, liquid crystals, polymers,
and zeolites. The magnitude of the size of the coupling constants will provide
critical information with respect to through solvent versus through bond
interactions in weakly coupled systems. In the case of the polymer systems,
strategic placement of the biradical sites in the polymer chain will allow
rotational barriers to be probed both at the end and at the center of the
polymer. In addition, polymers containing critical concentrations of ketones
will be synthesized and investigated to define the parameters important in
development of the next generation of photodegradable macromolecular materials.
%%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the investigation of
biradical interactions in chemical systems by Professor Malcolm Forbes at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is critical to understand the
method by which different parts of molecular systems communicate with each other
electronically in order to be in a position to design molecules that are capable
of performing specific functions in the context of a molecular device. In
addition, the synthesis of new materials with potential use as photodegradable
plastics will be guided by the results of the biradical studies. Also
photochemically reactive polymers will be designed to increase the adhesion
between traditionally non-interactive polymeric materials.
