Many techniques have been used in the past to measure the concentration of
volatile organic compounds in the soil and ground water. Some of these
techniques require chemical reactions that result in different molecules that
are then sensed optically. Other techniques measure the optical absorption of
the species to be detected. In almost all instances, a special instrument must
be used for each chemical species. This is both expensive and time consuming.
Moreover, as chemical reactions are necessary in some instances and detector
sensitivity is poor and noise sources abound in the infrared, the accuracy of
some of these systems is suspect. Lasergenics Corporation are proposing to
demonstrate the sensitivity and wide applicability of Raman scattering to the
detection of ppm or less concentrations of volatile organic compounds. This
technique has several advantages over present techniques. As the scattered light
is in the visible region of the spectrum, very sensitive photomultipliers can be
used. Also few noise sources exist. They will construct a breadboard system and
measure the sensitivity of this system for four of the most widespread volatile
organic compounds. An argon laser operating at 488 nm will be used as the light
source and photon counting will be the detection method.
