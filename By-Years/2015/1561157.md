This grant funds a workshop to bring together Materials Genome Initiative (MGI)
researchers supported by NSF's Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer
our Future (DMREF) program and those supported by the Department of Energy
(DOE). As NSF's response to the President's Materials Genome Initiative, DMREF
seeks to foster tight collaborations between materials researchers in
experiment, theory, and computation. These collaborations are founded on highly
iterative feedback loops in which experimental results directly inform theory
and computation, and vice versa, with the goal of accelerating the discovery and
development of new materials. The workshop provides researchers a forum to share
their research results and discuss cross-cutting topics related to establishing
and sustaining research collaborations, managing digital data, and supporting
long-term simulation software development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers
that are participating in Material Genome Initiative projects provide leadership
to the broader materials research community by implementing strategies to
achieve the goals set out by this Initiative, including reducing both the cost
and time it takes to bring a new material to market. The workshop addresses both
successes and challenges faced at the early stages of research, particularly for
highly collaborative projects, and helps solidify newly-formed collaborations.
Overarching themes identified through presentations, break-out sessions, and
discussions are presented in a report for dissemination to the broader materials
research community. MGI projects are developing tools that are made available to
aid research of the larger community and this workshop presents the most
effective ways to implement this task. The workshop, which will be held in the
Arlington, Virginia area on January 11-12, 2016, follows in a series of
successful workshops, the latest being held in Bethesda, Maryland January 12-13,
2015.
