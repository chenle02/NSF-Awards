Dr. Darrel Frost and Mr. Julian Faivovich of the American Museum of Natural
History will study evolutionary relationships of treefrogs of the genus Scinax,
which is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions from Mexico to
Argentina. With approximately 85 species known and several dozen awaiting
description, Scinax is the most diverse natural assemblage of Meso- and South
American treefrogs of the family Hylidae. This diversity, coupled with the local
abundance of many species, has led many researchers in behavioral ecology and
physiology to use species of Scinax as models in studies of mate selection,
vocalizations, reproductive behavior, and activity metabolism, among others. The
present study will collect evidence from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences, morphology, vocalizations, reproductive biology, and behavior for
approximately 73 species of Scinax and several related groups in order to test
the monophyly of Scinax, improve understanding of the relationship between
Scinax and other treefrogs, and resolve the relationships among the species of
Scinax. The resulting phylogeny also will be used by the authors to test
hypotheses about patterns and mechanisms of the evolution of vocalizations,
morphological diversification, habitat selection, and biogeography of the
Americas.

This study will train a doctoral student. Results of this study will provide
ecologists and physiologists a predictive historical framework for the
interpretation of the growing mass of comparative studies of Scinax. More
importantly, the results will be relevant to conservation studies. Nearly 50% of
the known species of Scinax are endemic to the Atlantic forest of southeastern
Brazil, a highly fragmented and critically endangered ecosystem. Knowledge of
the historical diversification of these species, as well as the improved
understanding of their basic biology that this study will engender, will provide
crucial information to design cogent conservation strategies.
