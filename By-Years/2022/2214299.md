The use of the pronoun “they” instead of singular “he” or “she” to refer to a
lone individual has met with mixed acceptance for a variety of purposes and can
be challenging for some listeners and speakers despite the fact that,
historically, singular-they is well entrenched in the language. For example,
many people who don't intend to misgender others still make errors in their
actual language production. Errors are particularly common with singular they,
which is becoming more common and more accepted (46% of younger Americans in
2021 know someone who uses they/them pronouns, up from 32% in 2018), but is
still new to many speakers. This project asks why errors like these occur, and
tests learning strategies and speech production
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project draws on sentence processing, speech
production, perspective-taking, and error-based learning approaches to ask novel
questions about mechanisms of language learning and production. Building on
promising preliminary data, the proposed experiments investigate how
difficulties with singular they arise during language processing, how choices
between alternative pronouns are affected by context, and what strategies
support learning to remember people’s stated pronouns and fluently produce
singular they. De-identified data and code will be made publicly available,
along with study pre-registrations. In addition to informing evidence-based best
practices for reducing misgendering, the findings of the proposed studies will
advance understanding of language learning and speech
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
