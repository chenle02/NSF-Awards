This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in biophysics
between Joachim Frank from the New York State Department of Health in Albany and
Jean Lamy at the University of Tours. The objective of their research is to
develop a methodology for localizing binding sites of antibodies on
immunocomplexes. Specifically, they will work on mapping antigenic epitopes in
A. Hemocyanin molecules. The methodology involves using electron microscopy and
three dimensional reconstruction techniques. Dr. Frank and his group bring to
this collaboration innovative technology for image reconstruction. The Albany
Lab has developed a large specialized software system for three-dimension
imaging of macromolecules and two-dimensional maps. This is complemented by the
French laboratory's extensive experience in immunochemistry and protein
chemistry of A. Hemocyanin. In addition the project will benefit from their
previous collaboration on three-dimensional reconstruction. The use of this
model system is of great interest to researchers in macromolecular chemistry.
The proposed techniques will facilitate the mapping of binding sites of
macromolecules, which cannot be crystallized and are too large for conventional
x-ray crystallography. The knowledge gained from this project will be beneficial
to researchers in biochemistry and molecular biology.
