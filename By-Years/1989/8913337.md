The PI will investigate a new, proprietary structure in the GaAs/A1GaAs material
system which will allow laser diodes to be fabricated in HEMT (High Electron
Mobility Transistor) material. This will allow easy integration of HEMT drive
electronics with low capacitance, high speed laser diodes for future OEIC
(Optoelectronic Integrated Circuit) applications. The process is based on the
MBE growth technique of Plane Selective Doping which causes Si to incorporate as
both p- and n-type dopant along different growth planes. This allows an abrupt
lateral change from p- to n-type HEMT 2-d carrier layers, thus forming a pn
junction. Very preliminary "proof of principle" work has yielded good pn
junctions with spontaneous light emission at the GaAs bandgap wavelength but no
lasing yet. The mask set proposed will contain single HEMT devices of both p-
and n-type carriers, single laser structures of various active lengths for
proper characterization, ohmic contact test structures to determine the contact
resistance to the 2-d gases, and integrated laser/HEMT driver circuits. Ion-
implanted contacts will be tried to reduce contact resistance, and TEM studies
will be done of the pn junction to determine how abrupt it is.
