9720612 McCauley-Bell, Pamela University of Central Florida POWRE: An
Investigation of Interaction Between Human and Automation Elements in Alerting
Systems The PI plans to visit the Humans and Automation Division of the
Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering Department of MIT with the objectives as
defined in the program of Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and
Education (POWRE): to achieve professional growth, career advancement, and
increased prominence. The proposed activities will be centered around the theme
of her research utilizing high risk, complex and automated systems for
monitoring and control of numerous environments. Techniques and methodologies
for successful human and intelligent system interaction with respect to
emergency alerting systems will be explored. Human performance to alarm
situations with and without the presence of the intelligent agent will be
evaluated (response time and accuracy of results).
