This project is supporting cohorts of upper division undergraduates at Eastern
Washington University (EWU) who demonstrate academic potential, motivation for
STEM, and financial need. Guiding objectives are: 1) to improve educational
opportunities in the STEM disciplines by annually awarding scholarships to nine
students; 2) to increase degree achievement by providing increased faculty
mentoring and access to specialized student support services; 3) to build
capacity in institutional practices that increase the retention of STEM students
and of first generation and/or underrepresented minority students; and 4) to
create and maintain community partnerships that increase EWU's visibility and
generate training and employment opportunities for the students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable project implementation components include
mentoring, financial support, and enrichment activities designed to increase
academic integration, motivation, identification with STEM, and retention to
graduation. Students are recruited from three majors: Biology, Biochemistry, and
Environmental Science which allows for: (1) an exploration of the
interdisciplinary nature of STEM on the part of the cohort of scholarship
recipients and (2) better matching of regional workforce needs with
agency/industry partners. Encouragement of diversity in the STEM workforce is
promoted through a combined incentive and support program to help recruit
students, many of whom are first-generation college attendees and/or members of
underrepresented groups in STEM. Finally, the project offers multiple mentoring
experiences through cohort-building enrichment activities that include
professional development, career planning, information literacy and civic
engagement.
