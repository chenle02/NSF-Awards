The project focuses on providing an understanding of the interaction between
a&lt;br/&gt;microscopic system (the electron spins) and a macroscopic system
(the dot&lt;br/&gt;environment, control or measurement) using quantum theory.
Concepts such as&lt;br/&gt;stochasticity arise out of the evolution of the
combined system, as demonstrated by measured results of control and by
experimental observation of decoherence and its reduction by active optical
control. The research is at the frontier of applied quantum physics. It involves
collaborators in the physics of semiconductor nanostructures, in high-precision
coherent optical control and spectroscopy of quantum dots, and in many-body
theory and light-matter interaction.&lt;br/&gt;
