The foci of this research are fourfold. New aromatic substrates will be screened
for oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida 39/D to broaden the applicability of this
method. Potassium permanganate oxidation of dienes will be investigated as an
alternative to ozonolysis. Syntheses of sugars, cyclitols, sphingolipids and
alkaloids will demonstrate the efficiency of the biocatalytic strategy and
fourth, mass balance of reagents and waste output will be assessed for each
preparation in order to minimize organic byproducts produced during manufacture.
With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing award, the
Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr. Tomas Hudlicky of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida. Professor Hudlicky,
collaborating with Genencor International, will focus his work on developing new
strategy for the reduction of pollution at its source. The strategy rests on the
assumption that, instead of incineration or other means of disposal, homogeneous
waste or solvents would be subjected to microbial oxidation by Pseudomonas
Putida 39/D to produce arene cis-diols which are ideally suited for short and
environmentally benign conversions to useful organic compounds
