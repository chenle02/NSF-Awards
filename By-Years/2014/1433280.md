The Acquainting Metro Atlanta Youth with STEM (AMAYS) program is designed to
engage traditionally underserved middle-school students in performance-based
relevant experiences that: (1) incorporate the STEM-related skills, knowledge
and practices represented in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
workforce and (2) motivate and build participant interest in pursuing related
ICT career trajectories. In summer and afterschool AMAYS programs in five sites,
participants will create ICT products as preparation for statewide ICT
competitions. Students will collaborate with each other and with mentors from
business and industry, who will be recruited through a partnership with the
Technology Association of Georgia. The project will be implemented through the
After-School All Stars program in Atlanta, which operates in multiple sites in
the Atlanta, Georgia in close collaboration with the public
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMAYS is a design-based research project involving
the creation, implementation and evaluation of a unique ICT-rich informal
learning environment (ILE) that combines elements of culturally relevant
pedagogy, informal STEM learning and the use of computer game design principles.
The project will iteratively design program experiences and resources and
investigate to what extent the project: (1) positively affects participant
perceptions of and interest in STEM-ICT careers and (2) develops related
disciplinary knowledge and skills. Intended outcomes will be assessed through
cognitive measures of participant ability to think scientifically and affective
measures of participant affinity for the field/profession. Qualitative methods
for data collection and analysis will also be used for formative evaluation of
the project. Research findings and resources (including curriculum and
research/evaluation tools) will be broadly disseminated to educational
researchers and practitioners.
