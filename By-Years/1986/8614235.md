The primary objective of the research is to develop a methodology for practical
and reliable identification of analytical models of engineered structures. The
methodology is based on the complex interrelationship between (1) an initial
model, (2) experimentation and data processing, (3) algorithms to extract global
response parameters and to estimate local characteristics, and (4) procedures to
update the model through an iterative process. The novel feature of the idea is
to implement step-by-step identification procedures based on test results of
several laboratory specimens. The specimens are selected with known or
controlled characteristics. In each step the source of error and uncertainty is
investigated and dealt with. Initial specimens considered will be comprised of
several cracked prestressed or reinforced concrete beams with different
distributions of stiffness, support flexibility, and continutity.
