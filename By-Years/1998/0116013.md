A collaboration with an investigator in Mexico will be fostered through this
award sponsored, in part, by the CONACyT Program. The properties and strengths
of microbial adhesives will be characterized using atomic force microscopy and
other methods. The counterpart in Mexico at the Universidad Autonoma de Campeche
will provide putative antagonists of microbial fouling. Overall, an improved
picture of biofouling will be provided as well as an exploration of using the
natural compounds as potential replacements for synthetic adhesives.
