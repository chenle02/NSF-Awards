This project focuses on an important problem of the design of protocols for con-
current joins and leaves, as well as for failure recovery for peer-to-peer net-
works. The protocols will be specified to a sufficient level of detail to enable
rig-orous proofs of correctness. Most protocols for joining, leaving, and
failure re-covery in the overlay networks are described informally or in pseudo
code. In-variant and progress properties are often stated without rigorous
proofs. As such, they are desirable goals rather than proven properties. In this
context, an objective of the proposed research is to investigate a sound
foundation for the design, specification, and verification of these protocols.
In particular, the re-search is on conceptual foundations for reasoning about
consistency to design a suite of protocols for hypercube routing. Furthermore,
the techniques for im-proving locality will also be investigated. The approach
is to devise optimization steps that are within the constraints of maintaining
network consistency. The proposed research will contribute towards designing the
next-generation re-search peer-to-peer and overlay networks and tools for
interdisciplinary collaborations, as well as shared research and education
platforms.
