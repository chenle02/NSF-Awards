Maurice Brookhart, Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for his continued work investigating olefin polymerization and
copolymerization catalysts. These late metal catalysts offer functional group
tolerance and novel polymer microstructures. Detailed mechanistic studies of
these polymerizations and copolymerizations should yield insights for designing
new catalysts. Particular foci include: (a) the reactivity of neutral Ni(II)
catalysts with functionalized olefins such as methylacrylate and vinyl acetate;
(b) the detailed mechanism of copolymerization of carbon monoxide with olefins
using various Ni(II) catalysts; and (c) the mechanistic features of Ni(II) and
Pd(II) diimine catalysts, their analogs and super-active iron and cobalt
ethylene polymerization catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intensive research has
been directed toward understanding fundamental aspects of metal-catalyzed olefin
polymerization and the results ofthese studies have been used to develop new
catalysts. These have been enormously important contributions since over thirty
billion pounds of polyolefin are produced in the United States each year. Most
of the commercial olefin polymerization catalysts are based on early transition
or lanthanide metals. In this project a series of highly versatile late
transition metal catalysts will be investigated. These studies will provide
fundamental mechanistic information on how catalysts join olefins to one another
during the polymerization process as well as guide developments of new catalyst
systems with potential industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
