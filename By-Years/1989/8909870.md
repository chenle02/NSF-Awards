Numerical models of the atmosphere provide several prognostic thermodynamic and
state variables such as temperature, humidity and liquid water. These grid box
mean quantities must be utilized in algorithms to generate the longwave and
shortwave radiation fields necessary for the computation of the diabetic heating
in the energy equation. This research involves the development of these
algorithms, particularly as they pertain to the treatment of clouds, since that
has been recognized as a weakness in current numerical models of the Earth's
atmosphere. The primary tools that will be use in the execution of this project
are: (a) classical, rigorous and approximate methods for the treatment of
radiative transfer in plane parallel absorbing and scattering media, (b) a
Monte-Carlo model of shortwave radiative transfer through horizontally
inhomogeneous clouds, (c) thermodynamic and cloud microphysical data, along with
satellite overpass observations obtained from recent field experiments, (d) a
one-dimensional version of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) that
will act as a column test bed for the parameterizations, and (e) the GCM itself,
to be used to determine the sensitivity of the model to changes in the radiation
algorithms. Past experience with the parameterization of radiation in numerical
models will form the base from which this effort will be launched. This research
is important because it attempts to improve the way climate models represent
cloud-radiation processes- a current weakness in all climate models.
