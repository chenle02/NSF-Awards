This grant provides domestic and international travel support for U.S. based
graduate student participants to attend the 22nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2016), which will be held in San
Francisco, CA, USA from August 13-17, 2016. KDD is the world?s premier
conference in data science. It is an interdisciplinary conference that brings
together ~2000 researchers and practitioners every year from all aspects of data
mining, knowledge discovery, and large-scale data analytics. A strong
representation of U.S. researchers, particularly students, at the conference is
essential in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area today and
into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is a highly selective
meeting that includes oral and poster presentations of refereed papers as well
as panel discussions and invited talks by the leading experts. It provides an
international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as
exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences.
The total number of KDD participants in recent years has been in excess of 2200,
with a majority of the participants being from the U.S., followed by Europe and
Asia. For the selection of awardees, the selection committee will put particular
emphasis on diversity. As in various STEM fields, increasing the diversity of
participants at KDD is a primary goal.
