Vitaly Rassolov of the University of South Carolina is supported by the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to
develop a novel approach for modeling electron correlation effects as averages
over two-particle universal linear operators. This approach, complementary to
the increasingly popular Density Functional Theory (DFT) and comparable to it in
computational complexity and rigor, may have advantages over DFT: (i) the
operators describe excited states with the same level of accuracy as ground
states; (ii) it is a natural formalism to model intermolecular forces; (iii) it
is compatible with multireference methods, necessary to describe such phenomena
as chemical bond-breaking, magnetic interactions in transition metals, and
excited states. Rigorous description of correlation interaction via linear
operators involves complicated mathematics, thus limiting the approach to small
systems. The PI overcomes this by expanding the operators in Gaussian functions,
which are a staple in the electronic structure field. The expansions are
performed using exact analytic expressions, leaving electronic structure codes
with an easy task of working with Gaussians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
improves and expands computational tools for better understanding and control of
chemical reactions, understanding and prediction of intermolecular forces, and
description of excited electronic states which are essential for solar energy
conversion. Implementation of novel ideas from this research in established
software packages will widen their availability to the large community of
scientists, in many fields, who utilize quantum chemistry software.
