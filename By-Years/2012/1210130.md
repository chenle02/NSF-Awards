This action funds Brian Seok of University of Colorado Boulder to conduct a
research project, entitled "Measuring ozone forming gases over the Pacific and
Arctic oceans from a South Korean icebreaker," during the summer of 2012 at
Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, Korea. The host scientist is Tae Siek
Rhee.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the answer to the
questions: Does the ocean act as a source or a sink for ozone and its precursor,
e.g., biogenic volatile organic compounds? Is this a universal phenomenon? What
factors may influence the ocean to act as a source or as a sink for ozone and
its precursors?

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
