The cyclic operation of a thermal swing adsorption system is being investigated
with the goal of minimizing energy costs. The adsorption equilibrium for a model
system of n-hexane and normal octane is measured, and process data on a
computer-controlled laboratory scale cyclic adsorption apparatus are obtained.
Optimal regeneration conditions are determined for variations of flow
directions, flow rates, gas composites, initial loading of the adsorbates,
column pressures, and feed temperatures. The adsorption equilibrium data are
correlated and used to predict the results for cyclic adsorption experiments.
The mathematical model used for the prediction accounts for heat and mass
transfer resistances and heat losses from the bed.
