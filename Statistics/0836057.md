The National Academies' Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics(CATS) is
a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that
rely on the statistical sciences. CATS organizes workshops and studies that
provide objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of
statistics, information analysis, and uncertainty management to practical
problems of national importance. In so doing, CATS strengthens the policymaking
process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the statistical
sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.

In recent years, CATS helped initiate and steer a major Academies evaluation of
the nation's forensic science enterprise, which led to a 2009 report that raised
a large number of concerns and recommended a comprehensive set of federal
actions. Late in 2008, CATS co-sponsored a cross-disciplinary workshop to help
reduce the uncertainties associated with remotely sensed climate data; a report
on that workshop is forthcoming. In August of 2009, CATS is co-sponsoring a
workshop on technical and policy challenges facing large-scale integration of
scientific data, which will also lead to an Academies report. CATS is currently
working to initiate studies to assist the National Security Agency and the
National Nuclear Security Administration in meeting their goals.
