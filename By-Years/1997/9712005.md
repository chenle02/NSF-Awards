This grant will provide funds to upgrade the Brown University Geophysics
Computer Facility. The work supported by this facility includes study of oceanic
spreading centers, study of mantle seismic velocity variations and anisotropy as
indicators of mantle flow, numerical modeling of mantle upwelling and melting
beneath spreading centers, and the development of techniques to study elastic
plate thickness and continental issoostasy.
