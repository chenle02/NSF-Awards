1438197 (Xu). The completion of this project will provide an integrated tool to
evaluate water scarcity risks for industries with global supply chains. The
results will help businesses develop strategies &lt;br/&gt;to mitigate water
scarcity risk and contribute to global water conservation. Although the results
are specific for water scarcity risk, the modeling framework will be generally
applicable for studying risks posed by other environmental challenges such as
biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. An interactive web-based
visualization tool will be developed to broadly disseminate the research results
to raise awareness of water scarcity risk for the global trade network. The
results of this research are targeted to help decision-making in trade and
environmental policies to mitigate water scarcity risk for industries with
significantly globalized supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
evaluating risks for the global trade network will be achieved by developing and
applying a probabilistic network analysis framework. Based on multi-regional
input-output models, the world economy will be studied as a trade network in
which nodes are industries in each country and links represent exchanges of
goods and services between industries. Relative risks of economic losses in
those industries due to local water scarcity at either the country level or
river basin level will be used to weight the global trade network. The weighted
global trade network will be analyzed using complex network analysis metrics and
methods to identify "hotspots" vulnerable to water scarcity risks. The
probabilistic network analysis framework will be generalized for broader
applications to risks posed by other environmental challenges in addition to
water scarcity. The project will also develop an interactive web-based
visualization tool to present research results and facilitate effective teaching
and learning.
