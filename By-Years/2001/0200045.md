The Principal Investigator studies fundamental groups and
absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of varieties, especially in finite
characteristic. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, he investigates the fundamental groups
of affine curves over&lt;br/&gt;an algebraically closed field of finite
characteristic; the absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of function fields of
curves over non-algebraically closed&lt;br/&gt;fields of finite characteristic;
and the fundamental groups and absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of higher
dimensional varieties over algebraically closed&lt;br/&gt;fields of arbitrary
characteristic. This study is in large part guided&lt;br/&gt;by possible
generalizations of Abhyankar's Conjecture for curves, which&lt;br/&gt;the
Principal Investigator has proven. A major goal is to determine
the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the fundamental groups and absolute Galois groups
in&lt;br/&gt;question, and to determine which finite groups are quotients of
these&lt;br/&gt;profinite groups, in order to obtain greater insight into the
algebra&lt;br/&gt;and geometry of these spaces. Methods include formal
patching,&lt;br/&gt;embedding problems, cohomology, valuation theory, and group
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of this project relates aspects of algebra
and geometry in a&lt;br/&gt;way that makes it possible to solve problems that
would be intractible&lt;br/&gt;in either field alone. The linkage between the
algebra and geometry&lt;br/&gt;arises from geometric spaces that are defined by
algebraic equations. &lt;br/&gt;These spaces can have complicated patterns of
symmetry, which manifest&lt;br/&gt;themselves both in the algebra and the
geometry. This project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;understand what types of symmetries
can occur in the context of these&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and how spaces with one type
of symmetry can relate to a given&lt;br/&gt;space with another type of symmetry.
These spaces are in many cases&lt;br/&gt;defined with respect to an algebraic
system in which a particular prime&lt;br/&gt;number plays a special role; and
the properties of those spaces can be&lt;br/&gt;interpreted as giving
information about the solvability of equations&lt;br/&gt;involving prime
numbers.&lt;br/&gt;
