This project aims to develop algorithms and techniques for allowing one to learn
the hidden structure of a digital or analog circuit from power, timing, and
electro-magnetic radiation measurements (so-called side-channels) of the
circuit, in a generic (applicable to arbitrary circuits) and adaptive (the
algorithm intelligently interacts with the circuit) manner. Such algorithms can
be used in various applications most importantly as tools in the arsenal of
hardware security and integrity checking. Given the rise in cyber threats
especially those that involve hardware access to such versatile adaptive tools
become increasingly valuable. The project aims to deliver the developed
technology in the form of (open-source) software, benchmarks, papers, machine-
learning datasets, and training of an expert future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores this problem along three
technical tasks: The first task is dedicated to digital circuits with a focus on
solver-based, circuit-based, and statistical/machine-learning-based solutions.
The second task is dedicated to analog and mixed-signal circuits. This involves
exploring how to model arbitrary analog circuit side-channels and having non-
linear solvers and optimizers interact with them for the learning process. The
third task is dedicated to utilization, evaluation, and demonstration. This
involves taking results from the first two tasks and using them in the context
of security analysis of various circuit protection schemes against side-channel
attacks, and the detection of malicious hardware modifications. Simulation in
software, programmable hardware, discrete components, plus two chip designs are
being used to test the proposed methods and algorithms as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
