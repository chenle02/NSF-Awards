This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical
and computational chemistry between James T. Hynes of the University of Colorado
and Thu- Hoa Tran-Thi of the Laboratory for Molecular Chemistry at the French
National Center for Scientific Research. and the French Center for Atomic Energy
in Saclay, France. The objective is to provide the first ultrafast femtosecond
spectroscopy experimental results and quantum chemical/molecular calculations
for reaction dynamics of aromatic organic acids in water. The project takes
advantage of complementary French expertise and provides U.S. access to
femtosecond experiments in Saclay.
