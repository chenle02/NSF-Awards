The Department of Mathematics at Oklahoma State University plans to purchase a
highspeed and high-volume fileserver as well as several graphics workstations
and related software. This equipment will benefit several research projects
including: A. SCHUBERT: A MAPLE PACKAGE FOR INTERSECTION THEORY (S. Katz)
Continuation of the development (with Str>mme) of a symbolic algebra package
(written in MAPLE) for research in intersection theory in algebraic geometry. B.
COHOMOLOGY OF LOCALLY SYMMETRIC SPACES, HECKE OPERATORS, AND GALOIS
REPRESENTATIONS: (m. McCONNELL) Symbolic computation of Galois representations
associated to cohomology classes for SI(3). C. KLEINIAN GROUPS AND DEFORMATION
SPACES: (D. J. Wright) Computer graphical construction of limit sets and
fundamental domains of finitely- generated Kleinian groups, and mapping of their
deformation spaces. This project requires detailed graphics as well as computing
power to show the combinatorial structure of these fractal limit sets and
deformation spaces. D. INVARIANT THEORY AND DISTRIBUTION OF NUMBER FIELDS: (A.
Yukie) Calculation of Equivariant Morse Stratifications associated with
Prehomogeneous Vector Spaces. E. COMPUTING PROJECTS IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: (H.
Burchard) Projects in computer-aided geometric design, continuation methods for
nonlinear systems of equations and optimization, and computation determination
of super box splines.
