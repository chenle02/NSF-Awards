0238721 Morrison Dr. Morrison's career goal is to promote best practices in
engineering, science and education by integrating novel air pollution research
with undergraduate coursework. His goals are achieved by: applying best
education practices to increase and improve student learning given limited in-
class contact time, integrating research and course work through projects that
introduce college, high school and non-traditional students to high-level
experimental research while allowing students to generate publishable data, and
probing the physics and chemistry of indoor air pollution, a poorly studied area
of air quality research. Building on efforts to bring research to high school
students, the PI is continuing to actively apply improved teaching practices.
Specifically, Dr. Morrison has been selected to participate in the competitive
"New Faculty Teaching Scholars" program of the University of Missouri system.
This program seeks to improve student learning by challenging new teachers to
incorporate the most successful teaching techniques in the classroom and
coursework. Dr. Morrison has been active in indoor air pollution research for
nearly eight years and, more recently, in developing new techniques for
environmental analysis. In indoor environments, ozone reacts with surfaces,
liberating volatile oxidized products into indoor air that are odorous,
irritating and may reduce personal comfort and productivity, and even contribute
to "Sick Building Syndrome". This project is well suited to the goal of
acquainting students with research while improving our understanding of indoor
pollution and exposure. Broader impact: Project results will influence product
decision-making of manufacturers, while making recommendations to consumers
regarding product usage, and providing public health officials with a database
of emissions measurements and exposure estimates for use in recommending policy.
