This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1992, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under
the direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. Students will
be members of active research groups, and participate in research projects
designed to suit their training. The program includes social events, tours, and
a weekly seminar series featuring visiting industrial speakers in addition to
faculty from the department. The seminars are aimed at the undergraduate
audience, and provide an excellent perspective on research careers and
opportunities in both industry and academics. Student participants will be asked
to write a journal style research report and speak about their work at regularly
scheduled group meetings.
