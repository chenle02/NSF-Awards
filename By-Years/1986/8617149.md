Foraminifera are single-celled animals which secrete a calcareous shell. From
previous studies of McMurdo Sound, it seems clear that foraminifera have a large
effect on the biological dynamics in shallow water populations. They are present
in great numbers, which also translates into considerable biomass, and are
capable of rapid growth on a variety of food sources. They must be an important
part of the benthic meiofauna, which is itself a vital part of the benthic
marine ecosystem. The objectives of this research are to study the distribution
and ecology of important shallow-water Antarctic benthic foraminifera, their
predatory activities, including the kinds of prey they consume, and how they
modify the structure of the benthic meiofaunal community. Their predation on the
larvae of large benthic animals will also be studied, because they may well
control the size of adult populations in this way. A series of experimental
techniques will be employed, including: manipulation of abundances in the field
to monitor effects on the rest of the system; the release and re-capture of
marked individuals in the field; and the establishment of laboratory microcosms,
which can be continuously observed and manipulated at will. The research will
provide a deeper appreciation of the role of benthic foraminifera in the
communities in which they are abundant.
