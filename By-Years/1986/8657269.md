David D. Myrold's research interests are defined by the intersection of
forestry, soil science and microbiology. A Presidential Young Investigator award
will afford him the chance to pursue these interests with greater freedom during
the next five years than might otherwise have been the case. In his previous
work, he has found that microbial denitrification (conversion of nitrates to
bimolecular nitrogen) capacity is limited largely by the availability of carbon,
rather than by availability of nitrates. Use of radiotracers and mathematical
modeling of the nitrogen cycle enabled the simultaneous estimation of
mineralization, immobilization, nitrification, and denitrification components in
the laboratory. Dr. Myrold will continue studies of nitrogen cycling in forest
ecosystems and, in addition, will initiate research dealing with actinomycete
(Frankia) strains using immunological and genetic techniques, and also the role
of microbial biomass as a sink and source of nutrients (mainly nitrogen) in
forest systems. The latter studies are especially important with respect to
questions that concern the ultimate fate of nutrients in systems subject to
forest management practices such as burning and fertilization. Laboratory
analyses will be conducted at Oregon State University, while the field portions
of research are to be done among the various forest types found in the state of
Oregon.
