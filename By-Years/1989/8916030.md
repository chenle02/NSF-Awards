This award will support Leonardo Seeber and Susan Hough from the Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory (L-DGO) of Columbia University in a research
collaboration with Renato Funiciello and Antonio Rovelli of the National
Institute of Geophysics in Rome, Italy. The principal objective of this
earthquake research collaboration is to use measurements of ambient noise to
study resonant modes of sediment-filled valleys. For high-noise urban
environments located on sediment-filled valleys, the ambient noise method shows
promise in the economical and quick identification of predominant resonance
frequencies. Awareness of and interest in resonant modes has risen dramatically
partly because of recent large earthquakes. Many of these were especially
devastating to people and property due to sediment resonances. This joint
U.S.-Italy collaboration will provide an opportunity to combine instrumentation
from the two countries as well as exchange ideas and experiences in
understanding sediment amplification and its relevance to seismic hazard.
