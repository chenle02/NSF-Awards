Gwinn, Carl AST-9731584 Dr. Gwinn will use radio-wave scattering as a tool to
learn about the structure of radio emission from pulsars. He will continue an
analysis of observations of the Vela pulsar, and investigate other pulsars that
are potential targets. He will also extend theoretical work to understand the
effects of source structure on scintillation and perform simple modeling of
magnetospheric refraction to compare with observations. He will also analyze
existing and new polarimetric observations of the Vela pulsar to test whether
magnetospheric refraction produces the observed structure.
