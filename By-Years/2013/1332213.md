This supports the 2013 Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado on
April 16-19, 2013. This annual workshop brings together representatives of
industry, academia and government to present papers and discuss issues related
to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community
interested in space weather to get together. Emphasis at the workshop is on the
impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation,
spacecraft operations and electric power.

In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather
together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This
provides the students with information on research developments and on how that
research is relevant to operations.
