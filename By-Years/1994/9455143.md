The purpose of this project is to conduct a faculty workshop to be held during
the summer of 1995 at Michigan Technological University (MTU). The focus of
these workshops is on teaching and assessment techniques for the development of
3-D spatial visualization skills in engineering students. This project builds on
and disseminates the products of an NSF project in the area of Course and
Curriculum Development. The products of this previous project are a textbook for
the development of 3-D spatial visualization ability and an accompanying
computer lab manual which utilizes I-DEAS software. The target audience for the
workshops is undergraduate faculty with primary responsibility in teaching
engineering design graphics. Many entering engineering students, particularly
women, lack background experiences which would develop 3-D spatial visualization
ability. Consequently, they are not prepared to compete on an equal basis in
their graphics classes. This workshop provides engineering design graphics
educators with the tools they need to bridge this gap in the backgrounds of many
of their students. It is estimated that with 25 participants, approximately 2500
engineering freshman per year will benefit from the use of the developed
materials and improved teaching techniques for 3-D spatial visualization. This
improvement increases the likelihood that the first experience of women
engineering students in their graphics curriculum is a positive experience,
enhancing retention of female engineering students. Dissemination of workshop
ideas is carried out by workshop participants as they implement plans for change
at their home institutions in their engineering design graphics curricula. Work-
shop participants are supported in their efforts by being networked together
through e-mail and through contact with other participants and the project
coordinators at professional meetings. An evaluation questionnaire is completed
by the participants at the end of the works hop.
