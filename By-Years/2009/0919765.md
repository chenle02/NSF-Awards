IOS-0919765&lt;br/&gt;Metabolic coupling in an obligate insect-bacterial
symbiosis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most animals have beneficial bacteria. Many of
these associations are obligate: both partners are required. This project will
establish whether the obligate symbiosis between an insect, the pea aphid, and
the bacterium Buchnera is underpinned by shared metabolic pathways, meaning that
both animal and bacteria contribute to the synthesis of nutrients needed by both
partners. In these shared pathways, the nutrients are made using enzymes, some
of which are coded by bacterial genes and others by animal genes, with
intermediates being transferred between the animal and bacteria. This project
will establish whether six essential amino acids are made by shared metabolic
pathways in the pea aphid. The investigators will analyze the protein complement
of the symbiosis, isolate candidate enzymes contributing to the shared pathways,
determine their function, and quantify the movement of intermediates in the
shared pathways by stable isotope labeling. The key results will be the
identification of animal and bacterial enzymes that contribute to the shared
metabolic pathways and the reactions they mediate, so that these shared
metabolic pathways can be elucidated. This research will provide the first
definitive evidence explaining why an animal-bacterial symbiosis is required by
both partners. It will serve as a model to investigate the many other obligate
symbioses in natural systems, and it will identify candidate targets for novel
strategies to control aphid pests of crops. The project will contribute to the
training of the next generation of scientists in insect science, proteomics and
metabolic biochemistry. It will support the thesis research of a graduate
student. Undergraduate summer students affiliated with this project will be
recruited through an established Research Experience for Undergraduates program.
