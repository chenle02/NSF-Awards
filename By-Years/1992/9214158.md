Research in photo-nuclear and in fundamental particle physics will be carried
out at the Bates and Saskatchewan cw electron facilities, at the CERN low energy
anti-proton accumulator ring, and at the BNL AGS facility. Photonuclear
reactions will concentrate on the role of the nucleon delta resonance in
intermediate energy reactions. The particle physics experiments will focus on
two areas: (1) sub-ppm measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment at the
AGS as a test of the renormalizability of electro-weak theory, with interest in
the effects of virtual production of very high mass scale particles including
the W and Z bosons; and (2), measurement of CP violating decay modes of kaons
produced at CERN in proton-antiproton annihilations, with interest in, among
other phenomena, observation of direct CP violating amplitudes in two-pion decay
of the neutral kaon, and measurement of, or limits on, CP violation in the
three-pion decay channel.
