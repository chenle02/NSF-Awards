Ethics and Values Studies supports research on the social values and mutual
obligations and responsibilities that arise in the interactions of science,
technology and society. This project takes an interdisciplinary approach to
addressing ethical concerns raised by applications of computer technology in
education. Increasingly, various forms of computer technology are being applied
in education in ways that bear on student-teacher interaction and the learning
process, on educational values toward human interaction and individualization.
In this project, a philosopher, psychologist, and human development specialist,
working with an educational computing consultant, will carry out an empirical
inquiry into the ways in which computer-assisted instruction (CAI) affects
student behavior and attitudes in a particular context. The context is the use
of CAI programs as a standard part of undergraduate courses in Deductive Logic.
Findings will help to shape future development of the CAI programs and of
computer applications in education that are simultaneously guided by ethical
perspectives on their social and psychological consequences. Results are
expected to be of interest to a wide audience, including philosophers,
psychologists, and professional educators. Findings will be written up for
publication in several journals and presented at national meetings. This project
focuses on an important issue in ethics and undergraduate science education. The
investigators are highly qualified; the institutional sponsor is appropriate;
the research promises to give us some unique information about impacts of
computer technology in at least one area of the curriculum, as well as
development and testing of a variety of data collection methods which can then
be applied to other curriculum areas. Results are likely to be of wide interest
and appropriately disseminated. The project is strongly recommended for an
award.
