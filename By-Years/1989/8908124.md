Experiments with synchrotron radiation will be undertaken to understand how
ionization and rearrangement mechanisms evolve as a function of energy. Resonant
scattering theory and relativistic multiconfiguraton self-consistent field
calculations will be used to interpret the results. In a second phase of the
project the mechanisms will be studied whereby an atom in a very strong laser
field absorbs a large number of photons through above-threshold ionization. A
model for this process, quantizing the radiation field and making the
interaction relativistic, will be developed in terms of time dependent formal
scattering theory and its predictions compared with experiment.
