This grant supports research in experimental nuclear physics by a faculty
member and undergraduate students from Eastern Kentucky University. The research
will involve precision measurements of low-energy proton-induced reactions,
primarily to determine how the variation with mass of the optical model
absorption is influenced by nuclear structure. The experiments will be conducted
using the University of Kentucky Van de Graaff accelerator.
