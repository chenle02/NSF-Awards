This community college is purchasing equipment to conduct studies on water
quality of a local lake as the major focus of an Environmental Biology course
and as an integral part of the curriculum in other biology and chemistry courses
at the institution. The goal of the project is to spark interest in science
while teaching basic scientific knowledge and research skills. The lake was
chosen as a research focus because of its declining condition, which is a
concern for students and the community as a whole. Students are developing
projects to be carried out with the requested equipment in: 1. water quality
studies, 2. algae studies, 3. bacterial studies, 4. environmental growth
studies. The equipment includes water testing kits and sampling equipment, a
spectrophotometer, video microscope system, culturing equipment, and computing
equipment with interface and sensors. The college will contribute an amount
equal to the award.
