The Department of Mathematics at the University of Toledo will purchase
graphics computer workstation equipment which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects. i) Differential geometry and soliton theory: liquid bridges;
moduli spaces of integrable surfaces (such as minimal surfaces, Willmore
surfaces), magnetic monopoles, and instantons; spectral curves and their
Jacobians; Kac-Moody algebras and the Yang-Baxter equations. ii) Mathematical
Physics: quantization methods; domain characterization; quasicrystals with
defects; nonlinear control problems; eigenvalue problems. iii) Dynamical
systems: chaotic layers in perturbed systems; the three-body problem with
collisions; integrability of two-dimensional connections.
