This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore an
improved process of manufacturing Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers. The SOI
process includes: (1) forming a hydrogen-rich buried layer in a donor silicon
wafer; (2) prebonding the donor wafer to a handle wafer; (3) cleaving the donor
wafer along the buried layer to thinner top silicon; and (4) postbonding and
surface smoothing of the final SOI wafer. An initial wafer is oxidized allowing
it to get the buried oxide of SOI. A new feature is an improved activation of
wafer surfaces to be bonded. Activation is termination of surfaces with either
hydrogen or with hydroxyl groups. Preliminary results show that the terminated
surfaces contain more than a monolayer of hydrogen. And the excessive adsorbed
hydrogen causes transfer faults during subsequent layer transfer. The Phase I
activation process allows control of the hydrogen dose. The process uses radio
frequency plasma treatment instead of wet processing. It is expected that the
yield of the SOI process will be increased.

The new process will be used in the silicon wafer market, which currently totals
$10B annually. Estimates indicate that SOI wafers will increase to around 20% of
this market within 10 years as SOI is one of the few solutions for production
wafers based on less than 0.18 micron design rules.
