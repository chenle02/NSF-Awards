The goal of this project is to use large-scale, biophysically detailed models of
the mammalian sinus node and atrium to understand dynamics of interaction
between these two systems under a variety of conditions. Among the specific aims
are: 1) development of an SA node - atrial network model incorporating recently
discovered date on the interdigitation of these two tissue regions; 2)
development of a network model of vagal control of heart rate. Model studies
will involve a combination of single cell and network analyses. Dynamics of
single cells will be studied using techniques of nonlinear dynamical systems
theory. Network simulations will be implemented on both the parallel Connection
Machine CM-5 and the symmetric multi-processing Silicon Graphics Power Challenge
XL supercomputers.
