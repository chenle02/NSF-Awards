The present x-ray fluorescence spectrometer in the Department of Chemistry in
WHOI, is 13 years old and has reached its limit of efficient operation. Downtime
due to malfunctions has increased to exceedingly high levels. This system is now
obsolete and upgrading or repairing would be too costly. In this award, a
Philips PW1404 spectrometer will be purchased which would give increased
precision and accuracy, better efficiency and cost-effectiveness, increase the
number of elements that can be analyzed and would provide a facility with wide
application and usage by other workers. Several other NSF supported projects
will be immediately benefited of this procurement.
