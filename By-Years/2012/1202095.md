Objective: The objective is to theoretically and experimentally investigate and
quantify plasma-dynamics effects, including performance degradation and long-
term failure modes, for micro- and nano-structures with RF fields in the MHz to
100s GHz. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Micro/nano-gaps are common in a wide
variety of RF MEMS such as tunable filters, varactors, and resonators. High RF
fields may induce gas breakdown and ionization leading to performance
degradation and/or failure in many of these devices. Moreover, conditions
encountered in many MEMS lead to an entirely new type of plasmas with dynamic
transition between several field-emission driven discharge regimes: electron
tunneling, ion enhancement and electron avalanche. &lt;br/&gt;As a result, we
plan to 1) Develop the fundamental understanding of the key physical phenomena
that govern plasmadynamics; 2) Quantify potential long-term effects/failure
modes of microplasma in micro/nano-gaps and the induced failure modes in
MEMS/NEMS; and 3) Create comprehensive, multiple-domain physics modeling and
simulation framework that captures the underlying microplasma effects in a
compact and efficient manner. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research is
expected to have a transformative impact on the design and understanding of
failure modes of a wide variety of N/MEMS devices. Furthermore, besides
integrating our research into curricula activities, we plan to make extensive
use of the memsHUB web portal to disseminate results from this study to the MEMS
community through online simulation tools. This is expected to be critical in
bridging the gap between fundamental plasma science and microsystems engineers.
We also plan to support undergraduate students efforts and attract/retain U.S.
minority students.
