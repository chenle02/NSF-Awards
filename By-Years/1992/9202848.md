A novel variation of the Heck palladium catalyzed intramolecular coupling of a
vinyl halide with an alkene will be developed for construction of a variety of
nitrogen heterocycles. The process allows concurrent formation of a C-C and a
C-N bond, producing a bicyclic ring system. The basic methodology will be
explored further and then applied in concise syntheses of the Lycopodium
alkaloid phlegmarine and the spirocyclic alkaloid perhydrohistrionicotoxin. The
chemistry will also be extended to allow formation of two new C-C bonds, leading
to a range of carbocyclic systems. This methodological variation will be applied
to construction of the pseudoguaiane ring system and will be a key step in total
syntheses of the magellanine/paniculatin group of Lycopodium alkaloids as well
as the spirocyclic sesquiterpene beta-chamigrene. %%% With this award, the
Organic Synthesis Program will support the research of Dr. Steven M. Weinreb at
Pennsylvania State University. The research explores new ramifications and
applications of a new palladium catalyzed reaction to construct complex
structures by new synthetic methodology that should benefit research in
biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
