This SBIR Phase I project will develop a biodegradable fabric "pod" for use in
reforestation of areas after fires or logging. The company is applying it's
expertise in fiber weaving to manufacture an innovative device that allows the
growth of seedlings on top of the soil and eliminates the need for manual
planting. This project will examine the feasibility of using the biodegradable
pods that contain all the necessary soil, fertilizers, and nutrients needed as
an alternative to traditional plastic growing containers.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be an increase in the
efficiency and reduction of the cost of reforestation projects throughout the
US. This will likely have dramatic impact on forestry businesses and ecological
diversity in the nation's forest land. Planting labor would be reduced and
products would allow effective aerial or vehicular distribution in difficult to
access areas. Loss of North American forests has accelerated recently due to a
variety of reasons such as pine bark beetle infestations and climate change.
Replacing lost trees will become an urgent need in the future. The project will
result in the eventual replacement of trees lost through natural processes and
human activities.
