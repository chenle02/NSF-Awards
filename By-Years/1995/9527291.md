This research program focuses on the coherent control of molecular dynamics
through the selective excitation of molecular states, which can then decay into
various pathways with product distributions determined by the excitation
channel. Control is achieved by varying the phase different between the multiple
photons producing the excitation. Prior work on simple molecules will be
continued in order to examine the control dynamics in more detail and to define
the limitations of the technique. At the same time, the control scheme will be
extended to other, more complicated molecules.
