0348392 de los Reyes Microbial flocs are complex microbial communities that are
of fundamental importance to a wide variety of natural processes and engineered
applications. The ecophysiology of microorganisms in floc microenvironments
ultimately determines which organisms are present, active, and dominant under
specific conditions. The research described in this proposal will apply a
multidisciplinary approach to characterize the factors that control community
structure and function in nitrogen-transforming flocs. The specific objectives
of the project are: (1) To determine the effect of microscopic floc structure
(size and shape) on rates and diversity of microbial activities and to establish
the diversity, the relative numbers and spatial arrangement of microorganisms
involved in nitrogen removal within flocs; (2) To determine the impact of
bioreactor macro conditions (DO, substrate type and loading) on floc size,
shape, and function; (3) To characterize the carbon- and nitrogen-based
metabolic interactions among ammonia-oxidizing, nitrite-oxidizing, and
denitrifying bacteria within a floc; and (4) To develop a macroscale model of
nitrogen and carbon removal in activated sludge that incorporates microscale
processes in flocs.
