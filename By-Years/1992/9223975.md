The Eighth Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars will be held at the University of
Georgia in Athens on October 11 to 14, 1993. The topic of the workshop concerns
the sun and similar stars. Issues to be addressed include angular momentum
evolution, Lithium abundances, evolution of magnetic activity and the
fundamental stellar properties of mass, age and position in the HR diagram. An
unusual feature of this meeting is the plan to include other topics suggested by
attendees. There will be a special session devoted to results from recent space
missions.
