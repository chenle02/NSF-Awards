Singular Integrals, Smoothness Spaces and Optimal Estimates for Elliptic and
Parabolic Boundary Value Problems

ABSTRACT

Recent developments in harmonic analysis have facilitated a deeper understanding
of large classes of partial differential equations, modeling a variety of
physical problems, including those arising in elasticity, hydrodynamics and
electromagnetism. This proposal is concerned with regularity aspects of
solutions to these equations. Most notably, the PI intends to develop new tools,
as well as broaden the scope of more traditional methods, in order to be able to
study how the smoothness of the data influences the smoothness of the solution,
in the presence of boundary irregularities. The natural borderline is the case
when the domains in question are Lipschitz, i.e., satisfy a uniform
(interior/exterior) cone condition. Informally speaking, Lipschitz domains make
up the most general class where a rich function theory can be developed,
comparable in power and scope with that associated with the upper-half space.

The scales of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces offer a natural functional
framework within which the issue of smoothness can be analyzed. They encompass
both the Sobolev and Hardy classes and, otherwise, exhibit features which are
generally harder to take advantage of (or are even completely lost) when working
on the more classical Lebesgue scale. One of the main questions addressed in
this proposal is the regularity of Green potentials on Lipschitz domains (with
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions) on Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.
The PI proposes to investigate this issue both in the elliptic and parabolic
setting, via singular integral methods.
