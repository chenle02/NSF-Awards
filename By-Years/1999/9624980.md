9624980 Ostertag This CAREER award project will combine education and research
in a new class of hybrid fiber reinforced composite cementitious (HFRCC)
materials in which both large and small fibers are used to achieve high strength
with better toughness. The primary research objective involves the study of
crack initiation and propagation in the HFRCC materials. A secondary objective
is to optimize the properties at low reinforcement values. The educational
project involves modernizing the civil engineering materials courses and related
activities. ***
