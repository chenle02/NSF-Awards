This proposal deals with two synthesis problems 1) design a controller of a
prescribed order to stabilize a given system and 2) design a controller of a
prescribed order to stabilize a given system containing parameters subject to
uncertainty in specified ranges. We propose to establish conditions for the
existence of a controller and to obtain a useful parametrization (from the
control system designer's point of view) of all controllers that solve the above
problems. The problems proposed constitute two of the outstanding unsolved
problems in control theory. None of the existing synthesis methods ("observed"
state feedback, LQG, H , and geometric methods of synthesis) can solve them in a
practical or satisfactory manner. They arise invariably and immediately in most
industrial applications, and the complete lack of a synthesis theory to address
this problem is a major stumbling block that control engineers encounter in
attempting to apply the results of control theory to practice. Our hope that the
difficult problems posed above can be solved is based on recent results which
extend Kharitonov's theorem and make it applicable to control systems, and new
techniques for the exact calculation of the stability ball in parameter space.
