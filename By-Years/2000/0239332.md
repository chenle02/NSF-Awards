The project aims to leverage methods from the theory of mesoscopic systems,
quantum chaos and nonlinear dynamics to advance research in microphotonics.
Microcavities as building blocks of integrated optical devices form the central
application of the proposed research: their spectral, emission and coupling
characteristics will be studied with a combination of numerical modeling and
approximation methods. Pure numerics encounters resource limitations in large,
coupled and fully three-dimensional systems, making approximation schemes
crucial for speedy, goal-oriented design. Among the most widely known such
schemes is paraxial optics, which however breaks down in the resonator
configurations of greatest interest for photonic integration.

The lack of reliable analytical treatments in this regime is the central
theoretical motivation for the proposed research. Non-paraxiality in
microcavities translates into chaotic ray dynamics when considering the short-
wavelength or large-size limit; hence, approximations relying on large size-
parameters bring insights from nonlinear dynamics to bear on micro-optic design.
This parallels developments in mesoscopic electronic physics where similar
approximations arise in systems whose size falls into the transition region
between quantum and classical mechanics.

Based on this connection, a new course to be developed within the Applied
Physics Master's program will aim at a unified presentation of photonics and
quantum mechanics, utilizing web-based teaching technology. The latter will be
tied to web-based dissemination of the numerical and analytical techniques
developed in the proposed research, in order to strengthen the student's
exposure to issues with broad interest in optics, nanoscience and nonlinear
dynamics.
