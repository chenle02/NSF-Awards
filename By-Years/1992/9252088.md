The proposal seeks funding to add computers and videodisc technology to the
laboratory component of the non-technical majors' (mostly business and education
majors) introductory biology course at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.
The new laboratory syllabus is structured around three major biological themes,
Genetics, Evolution, and Ecology. Students will work in groups in the
laboratory. Each lab period incorporates computer work, videodisc review, and
hands-on wet- lab activities. Emphasis on human aspects of biology, integration
of items from the daily headlines, and use of everyday items (e.g., foods) in
hands-on laboratory work will bring the relevance of biology home to the target
audience.
