This is a study of race-based differentials in attitudes toward voluntary
euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Previous studies find that Blacks are
much more likely than Whites to oppose legalizing euthanasia. This study will
examine the extent to which cultural factors (such as religious beliefs and
fears about abuses of euthanasia) and structural factors (such as education and
income) account for the dramatic difference. The analysis will control for the
effects of variables suggested by other theories that also may account for the
race difference. It also will assess race differences in attitudes toward two
different forms of voluntary euthanasia: active euthanasia (i.e., a lethal
injection provided by a physician); and physician-assisted suicide (i.e., a
physician-prescribed dose of lethal drugs). One focus group of Blacks and one
focus group of Whites will be employed to generate and to refine survey items
that will be administered to a random sample of 500 adult Ohioans, including an
oversample of Blacks. Selected respondents then will participate in two post-
survey focus groups, one consisting of all Blacks, the other consisting of all
Whites. The qualitative data gathered from these two focus groups will be used
to corroborate and to explore findings from analyses of the quantitative survey
data. The survey also will serve as a way of pre-testing items for further
survey research at the national level. This project will broaden our
understanding of the genesis of race differences in attitudes toward moral
issues that involve decisions regarding life and death by adding an assessment
of the roles of culture and social structure. In addition, the project will
advance sociological theory on social movements by providing insight into the
relationship between public opinion and the process through which leaders of
social movement organizations frame issues.
