ABSTRACT Klingenberg CTS-9401293 This is an experimental project on
electrorheological (ER) fluids, where the use of surfactants is suggested to
increase the fluids yield stress durability. A systematic study will be
undertaken to characterize the ER systems, test their steady-state rheological
and dynamic oscillatory responses, and identify possible mechanisms in the
presence of surfactants. Modeling efforts will be pursued to guide the
experiments. If successful, the proposed research program may lead to improved
ER fluids at a reduced cost, for a variety of applications from locomotive
industry to sensors. Another objective of the project is to reduce the
environmental impact of those fluids after their use.
