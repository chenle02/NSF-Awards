9729670 Altwicker This dissertation-enhancement award supports Mr. Shawn Ryan, a
graduate student, in Dr. Elmar Altwicker's group at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute to spend three-and-a-half months in the laboratory of Dr. Ludwig
Stieglitz of the Institute for Technical Chemistry at the National Research
Center in Karlsruhe. While there, Mr. Ryan will make quantitative determinations
of carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) bonds in various carbons. The formation of C-Cl bonds
in residual carbons at certain concentrations and rates plays an important role
in the formation of dioxins, which are undesirable by products of many thermal
processes, including waste incineration. The work done in the German lab could
aid in the development of techniques to minimize Dioxin formation in thermal
processes.
