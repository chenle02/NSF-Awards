A REU activity will be established that will offer a wide variety of
opportunities for 16 undergraduate students to perform research in a broad range
of mechanical engineering projects. These project areas include heat transfer
and fluids, design and control, manufacturing, and mechanics of materials, fluid
mechanics in rocket motors, and composite materials. The research will be
directed by the faculty who is currently active in the particular area. The
student will be encouraged to enroll for optional course credit for their work
and will be exposed, where necessary to supplemental programs such as shop
practices, instrumentation, and computer and computer graphics usage. A series
of seminars with faculty and student participation is an interval part of the
experience. A formal report will be required of each student's research.
