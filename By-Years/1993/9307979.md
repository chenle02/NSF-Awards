9307979 Boston This is a study of the maize ribosome inactivating protein (RIP).
RIPs catalytically inactivate ribosomes by removing adenine A4324 in rRNA. This
leads to inhibition of translation. Maize PRI is the only known single chain RIP
gene product that accumulates as an inactive precursor. The specific objectives
are to determine the protein domains required for proRIP processing and RIP
activity, and to separate the nucleic acid binding from the catalytic domain.
%%% Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs), which occur in the seed, root, leaf,
or sap of a wide variety of plants including maize, wheat, and barley are
extremely cytotoxic, and may serve defensive as well as food storage roles.
Understanding activation and the physiological role of these proteins are
important for development of selective cell-killing agents, including
insecticides and fungicides. ***
