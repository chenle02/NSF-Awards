This project is designed to provide information needed for more effective
monitoring of labor market conditions encountered by the nation's engineering
work force. The workshop will examinesimilarities and differences among
engineering personnel data in terms of taxonomies, data elements, and data gaps.
It will also identify areas where improvement is needed and provide a number of
options and recommendations for the planning of NSF's Scientific and Technical
Personnel Data System (STPDS) in the 1990's. The maintenance of the STPDS is a
major responsibility of the Division of Science Resources Studies (SRS). The
system is used to collect, analyze, and disseminate information on the science
and engineering population in the United States. The engineering work force
accounts for over one half of this population. The Directorate for Engineering,
which is providing one half the funding for the project, is responsible for
supporting the engineering work force through funding engineering education and
research. The workshop will identify areas where this funding may be most
effectively targeted.
