One of the best methods for studying the underlying mechanisms associated with
the properties of a material is to make measurements of the temperature
dependence of intrinsic properties of the material. This fact has been brought
home forcefully in reviewing the work currently in progress on the new high Tc
superconductors. Despite the importance of understanding the significance of
such measurements and the techniques involved in making them, many students have
had very little opportunity for laboratory exposure in this area. In this
project two systems for the measurement of temperature dependent properties will
be developed for use in the upper and lower level student laboratories. The
systems will include two Hansen High-Tran Liquid Transfer Systems, for sample
cooling and temperature control, and two Hewlett Packard 150 series personal
computer systems for data acquisition and real-time analysis. The new equipment
will be used in the sophomore-level modern physics laboratory to make
measurements of transport properties that can be explained in terms of a simple
free-electron model, in the senior-level advanced laboratory to investigate the
properties of superconductors, quasi-low dimensional conductors and other novel
materials, and also in individual student research projects.
