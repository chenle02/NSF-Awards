Changes in information technology (IT) markets and technologies over the past
decade have brought about rapid growth in competition in the computing and
communications industries. New firms have sprung up and existing firms from
related industries such as entertainment have moved into the IT sector to
compete with traditional equipment manufacturers, software firms, and service
providers. Advances in network technology and miniaturization of components have
led to increasing emphasis on distributed systems and have opened up
possibilities of convergence of computing, communications, and entertainment
products. These changes have also provided an incentive for corporations to
emphasize development of new products and expansion of market share over support
of IT research. Combined with fiscal pressures to limit government funded
research in all but the most basic types of research, these trends have led to
concerns that the United States will have increasing difficulty sustaining the
information technology base. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board
(CSTB) will establish a cross-disciplinary study committee to examine trends in
R&amp;D for information technology, determine whether a problem exists, and
explore options for preserving the research and technology base. In addressing
the issue of sources of support for future innovations in IT, the study will
examine the changing roles of industry, academia, and government in the IT
research enterprise. By consulting with industry groups, government agencies,
and representatives of successful consortia approaches in other industries, the
committee will develop recommendations as to the most effective way to maintain
a balanced IT R&amp;D effort.
