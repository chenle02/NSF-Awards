Novel approaches are needed to facilitate the dissemination and utilization of
the increased information produced in the earthquake hazard mitigation field.
This project will design, develop, and produce a prototype data storage and
retrieval system which will accommodate pages of text, line drawings, and
continuous tone images. The system will accept search requests in the form of a
sequence of keywords which can be associated with one another using logical
connectives such as "and", "or", "but not", etc., and will produce in response
to each request, a list of the accession numbers, or possibly page and word
numbers, of those documents satisfying the request. The reading system will then
present to the user on a high resolution display, an image of the required
documents, a page at a time, for review. Those pages which appear to be of
interest can then be printed on a suitable printer. This program will use
current technology, or minor extensions thereof, to create a system which will
meet all of the above requirements, have a low system cost, and allow a large
amount of information to be disseminated very inexpensively.
