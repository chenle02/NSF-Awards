The purpose of this research is to investigate how syllable structure and
phonotactic sequencing constraints affect speech perception in Nepali. Word
initial and word final consonant clusters are not allowed in Nepali. As a
result, when borrowing words from other languages, Nepali speakers often break
up clusters by inserting vowels. For example, they pronounce the English word
'slip' as 'silip'. Earlier research has found that Nepali speakers find it
difficult to distinguish between consonant clusters at word boundaries and the
same clusters broken up by vowels. In other words, 'slip' and 'silip' tend to be
indistinguishable to Nepali speakers. This suggests that these language-specific
phonotactic constraints cause Nepali listeners to perceive nonexistent vowels at
word boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates whether similar
phenomenon can be observed word internally. A perceptual experiment will be
conducted to test the hypothesis that monolingual Nepali speakers also find it
difficult to distinguish between consonant clusters word internally and the same
clusters broken up by vowels. If the results of the experiment support this
hypothesis, then such perceptual confusion would indicate that consonant
clusters at word-internal syllable boundaries, like the ones at word boundaries,
affect the speech perception of Nepali speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since
Nepali is an understudied language, this research promises to shed new light on
the role of syllable structure and phonotactic sequencing constraints on speech
perception. Additionally, this research can inform phonotactic learning models
by identifying a distinct role for syllable structure. Broader impacts of the
proposed research include introducing underprivileged Nepali high school
students to linguistic and psychological sciences.
