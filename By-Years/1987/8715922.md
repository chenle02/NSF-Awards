This is a multi-institutional study by investigators at Rice University and
Duke University. The study includes a field/laboratory program to collect/study
carbonate sediments from the Nicaraguan Rise. The field program consists of a
seismic survey and core sampling. The laboratory program includes interpreting
seismic profiles, determining sediment types, and establishing the ages of
fluctuations in sediment type. These fluctuations will reveal the climatic
controlling factors on carbonate sedimentation in an area never studied before.
