Eight different meteorological organizations ranging from a university to a
National Weather Service Office will host up to fifteen undergraduate students
during the summer months in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site visit
format. The students will attend lectures, be exposed to a wide variety of
research, academic and operational activities in the fields of meteorology,
electrical engineering and computer science. Additionally, each student will be
assigned to and work with a senior professional on a topic matched as closely as
possible with the students interest.
