This RUI award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a
group at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in collaboration with other
NSF and DOE supported scientists. The group will continue its participation in
the EVA collaboration at Brookhaven National Laboratory. They will probe the
experiment evidence for nuclear transparency, a prediction of the quantum
chromodynamic theory of nuclear forces.
