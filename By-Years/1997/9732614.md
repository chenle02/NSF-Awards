9732614 Ali Multi-electron processes in slow, highly charged, ion-atom
collisions using time of flight, triple-coincidence measurements of Auger
electrons, scattered particles and target recoil ions are investigated. In
addition, Q-values and angular distributions will be measured using recoil ion
momentum spectroscopy.
