The National Science Foundation (NSF) operates three permanent research
stations in the Antarctic. One of these, Palmer Station, is visited by over one
thousand tourists per year, traveling by ship during the relatively mild
Antarctic summer. This action will support development of an interpretive,
educational program for presentation to visitors at Palmer Station, focusing on
the natural environment around the station as well as research activities
supported by NSF. It also includes services of a National Park Service
interpretive specialist at the station for a period not to exceed eight weeks
during the current season.
