Purdue University will provide over a period of two years the opportunity for
25 teachers/per year, grades 7-12, to develop a strong foundation in the
atmospheric sciences. The Atmospheric Science Education Program will consist of
a three-week session during the summer which will cover eight key atmospheric
science topics, basic science of meteorology, school weather stations, weather
analysis, forecasting, atmospheric moisture, motions, severe weather phenomena
and applications of atmospheric sciences to other disciplines. Teachers will be
assisted in applying this science content through the development of materials
for use in their classrooms. Equipment will be constructed and provided for home
school use. Field experience will occupy the participants for one to one and
one-half hours each day at the Cherry Lane Field Observing Facility. A school
outreach program will be conducted during the school year where project staff
will visit classrooms and provide opportunities for follow-up meetings.
Individualized consultations will be provided to help teachers adapt the
materials and strategies to their own teaching styles. Teacher and student
interest in the atmospheric sciences will be heightened by the establishment of
a dial-up, computer-based weather data access and electronic bulletin board
system. This will be contributed by Purdue University. Also contributed by the
University will be 8-10 videotapes about the professional activities of
atmospheric scientists and related technological fields. Both of these vehicles
will enhance the career access information available to students. Cost-sharing
by the University and the school districts who are being asked to support their
teacher-participants amounts to 20% of the total cost of the project.
