This project concerns four hemoglobins from (1) earthworm,(2) chicken and
hummingbird, (3) lamprey, and (4) the nemertean worm, Cerebratulus. The ligand-
dependent dissociation of each hemoglobin is to be studied by light-scattering
and sedimentation. Earthworm hemoglobin is a ~4.1 MDa, 200 subunit complex with
both Hb subunits and non-globin components. The assemblage gradually loses
subunits and the mass decreases to 3.6 MDa. A first goal is the mechanism for
this stoichiometric conversion. A second goal is to determine the seasonal
changes in the biosynthesis of the Hb and to determine if the Hb is synthesized
only in the spring of the year. Ongoing studies on chicken hemoglobins have
shown that two components of chicken hemoglobin, A and D, associate upon
deoxygenation to form an assemblage of low oxygen affinity and enhanced
cooperativity. The project will determine the stoichiometry and mass of the
assemblage and the functional relationship between oxygenation and the
dissociation of the A-D assemblage. Another goal of this project is the
determination of the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding of hummingbird
hemoglobin to assess the extent to which the Hb is adapted to meet extraordinary
physiological needs. Lamprey hemoglobin self-associates from monomer to dimer
upon deoxygenation. The functional interaction of groups at the interface
between the subunits will be studied with site-specific mutagenesis.
Cerebratulus hemoglobin, with only 109 residues, is the smallest known
hemoglobin. Collaborative studies of ligand-binding kinetics and equilibria will
be undertaken with a variety of mutants constructed by site-specific
mutagenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The past activities in this
project have involved outstanding training of undergraduate researchers and the
future research will continue to provide such opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
