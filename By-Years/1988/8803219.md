This award will support ongoing collaborative research between Dr. Jacques
Pankove, University of Colorado at Boulder and Professor Lars Samuelson,
University of Lund, Sweden. The objective of this research is to synthesize a
new semiconductor, cubic gallium nitride (GaN), using low pressure chemical
vapor deposition (LPMOCVD). Through previous collaboration, the investigators
have built unique equipment in Dr. Samuelson's laboratory to carry out this
work. The proposed approach will consist of four phases: 1. LPMOCVD of CVD of
GaN on sapphire at lower pressure than previously reported; 2. LPMOCVD of GaN
using atomic nitrogen; 3. LPMOCVD of cubic GaN on cubic SiC; 4. Doping studies
of GaN. Results of this project should make an important contribution to basic
research in semiconductors.
