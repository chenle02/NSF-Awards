The proposed research is concerned with the study of models of population growth
and multispecies interactions involving structured populations, i.e. populations
for which the vital growth, mortality and fecundity rates of individual
organisms are significantly dependent upon physiological traits such as size,
age or developmental stage. The effects that such physiological traits of
individuals have on the dynamics at the population level will be explored. Some
models which have appeared in the literature will be studied and extended. The
focus, however, will be on the careful derivation of new models for certain
types of structured populations and multispecies interactions to which an
importance and interest has been attached in the biological literature and which
have not been previously modeled. A full range of standard as well as recently
developed analytical tools will be applied and in some cases, as part of the
proposed research, extended for use in this study. The numerical analysis of
models is expected also to play an important role.
