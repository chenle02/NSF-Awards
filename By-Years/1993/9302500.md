Description: The project supports the visit of a scientist from Bangladesh, Dr.
M.A. Bhuiyan, Department of Water Resources Engineering, Bangladesh University
of Engineering and Technology in Dhaka, to participate in research with Dr. M.
Hanif Chaudhry, at the Albrook Hydraulics Laboratory at Washington State
University. Dr. Bhuiyan will participate in the development and verification of
a mathematical model for the unsteady two- dimensional free-surface flow with
shocks and bores. The model will be based on finite- element method.
Experimental data will be obtained on an existing test facility. Scope: This
project provides for participation of a highly qualified young scientist from a
developing country in multi-faceted research in a well established, modern, U.S.
laboratory in the area of hydraulics. His expertise in finite element analysis
of unsteady flows will benefit the U.S. research effort, while he gains
experimental skills and knowledge in this important field. It is hoped that this
will lead to further substantial joint research involving scientists from the
two institutes in the area of fluid flow, and especially in flood research and
management.
