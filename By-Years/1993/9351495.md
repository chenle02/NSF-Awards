9351495 Jasinski A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is serving as
a cornerstone of our new laboratory teaching effort. The instrument is being
used in laboratories at all levels. Beginning with demonstration in a project-
oriented introductory chemistry lab, the instrument is being used in
increasingly sophisticated ways in higher level courses. Introduction of FTIR
into the introductory organic laboratory is enhancing the ability of students to
accurately analyze the small amounts of compounds that result from microscale
experiments. In addition, students are being introduced to a wider variety of
sampling techniques, including diffuse reflectance. Judicious choice of
detectors (DTGS or MCT) allows for more sensitivity to low light throughput at a
faster scan rate than dispersive IR spectrometers. FTIR techniques are enhancing
our capabilities in the instrumental course as well as the polymers,
pharmaceutical and medicinal applications in the industrial chemistry laboratory
and in undergraduate research. Students are being introduced to modern spectral
manipulation and database searching techniques as well as essential parameters
of FTIR spectroscopy including signal averaging, repetitive scanning, resolution
comparison and standards collections. ***
