The goal of this project is to establish a detailed three- dimensional
description of the evolution of a typical extratropical cyclone, particularly
the occlusion process. Within the scientific community there exist many
different ideas about the nature of the occlusion process, a number of which
stem from the original "Norwegian cyclone" model, a conceptual model developed
in the early part of this century by Norwegian meteorologists. Previous analyses
have had to rely on sparse (and often inadequate) data from the conventional
upper air observing network for diagnostic studies. The results, while useful,
have left open many questions. In this study, the principal investigator will
employ state-of-the-art mesoscale numerical models to analyze the three-
dimensional structure of several simulated cyclone events. The models provide
high temporal and spatial resolution which will allow a much more comprehensive
view of the cyclone evolution. The principal investigator intends to look at the
evolution of cyclones over both the ocean and the continent.
