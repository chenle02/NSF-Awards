9733247 King Research is proposed to develop a novel lithography technique, one
which would not only lower process cost but also enable a complete shift in the
FPD manufacturing paradigm and thereby contribute to efforts to lower production
costs for large-area electronics products in general. Specifically, this
technique will allow thin films to be patterned directly, without the need for
an intermediary photoresist mask or hard mask. It employs a high-fluence
projection lithography tool to selectively expose the substrate through a mask.
The direct Patterning of a silicon film has already been successfully
demonstrated in an initial study. Further work is proposed to develop direct-
patterning processes for silicon, dielectric, and metal films, and to
demonstrate these processes in the fabrication of polycrystalline-silicon thin-
film transistors (TFTs). The new technique should have a distinct throughput
advantage over established ablation techniques, as well as improved cleanliness
(fewer particulates) or lower associated mask costs. ***
