This project will examine the development of electrophysiological properties in
neural-lineage cells of the early Xenopus embryo. Although much attention has
focussed on the modulation of populations of ion channels during the terminal
differentiation of specific sets of post-mitotic neurons, very little
information is available about the development of ion channel populations in
neural-lineage cells at earlier stages, when initial commitment to neural
phenotypes occurs. Dr. Moody will use patch clamp techniques to study this
problem in the Xenopus embryo, at stages between the unfertilized oocyte and the
neurula. He will examine the stages at which cells involved in the formation of
the embryonic nervous system first express functional ion channel populations
distinct from cells of other fates, and then investigate the developmental
processes by which the electrical properties of the oocyte are transformed into
those of cells committed to neuronal phenotypes. Particular attention will be
paid to the roles of ion channel synthesis, the modulation of pre-existing
channels, and the spatial distribution of ion channels over the surface of
single cells in the early electrophysiological differentiation of the nervous
system.
