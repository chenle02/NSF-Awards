This project will develop fast and accurate numerical algorithms for linear
algebra problems arising in engineering computations. One class of such problems
concerns matrices with displacement structure. This is a general algebraic
concept and includes the well-known classes of Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde and
Cauchy matrices. In practice there is the need for solving rapidly and
accurately, both exactly-determined and over-determined linear systems involving
such matrices. Furthermore, in some applications like inverse scattering for
geophysical problems, there is also the need for the rapid factorization of such
matrices. Another related class of problems arises in adaptive filtering
applications, where there is a need to solve rapidly and accurately a sequence
of structured linear problems that are related by low-rank changes. In a
different vein, the computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric
pencils is another important problem. It frequently arises in finite-element
analysis of engineering structures and associated model-reduction problems. New
models and fast algorithms for the analysis of linear algebra problems with
large bounded uncertainties will also be developed.
