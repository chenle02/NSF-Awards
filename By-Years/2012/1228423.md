This project is a workshop gathering together scholars with expertise in
resource governance. It will focus on deployment of alternative property rights
regimes, addressing how different practices allocate resources. As a result of a
sharp rise in demand for agricultural commodities,essential resources are
increasingly considered scarce and subjected to commercial pressures: worldwide,
they are seen as valuable economic assets. This is leading to the
commodification of these resources and, in turn, the land on which they are
found, all for managing scarce resources that are essential to livelihood. Such
essential resources include water, food, and forests (the latter because of
their role as carbon sinks). Access to these goods will depend for the
foreseeable future directly or indirectly on control over the land that harbors
them. How to manage land to ensure broad access to scarce, essential resources
is therefore a critical issue, yet one for which we lack good answers. In order
to develop effective governance regimes for scarce, essential resources, it is
vital to develop dynamic models that (1) focus on access and sustainability, not
exclusion and growth; and (2) account for a wide and varying range of
stakeholder interests. The goal of this project is to develop a framework of
such regimes. Contributions to the workshop will be framed as a dialogue between
theoreticians and practitioners and allow for full-length papers as well as
comments. The output of the workshop will be published in an edited book.
