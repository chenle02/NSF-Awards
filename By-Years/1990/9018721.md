The principal investigator, in collaboration with David Kimbrough and Barry
Hanan at San Diego State University, will continue his study of the northern
Coast Range ophiolite in California. Field relations, uranium-lead and argon-
argon dating techniques, petrology, and geochemistry will be used in the Elder
Creek area to constrain the origin and time of intrusion of several different
magma series, the relationships between each magma series and between plutonic
and extrusive suites, and the tectonic history of this ophiolite in relation to
other adjacent units. The same techniques will be employed in the Stonyford area
to understand its age, origin, and tectonic history. The research will shed new
light on the geologic history of this complex plate boundary.
