The South Central Conference on Advanced Numerical Methods and Applications will
be held in April 5-7, 2013 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR).
The conference will bring together researchers of all career stages, working on
various aspects of numerical analysis and scientific computing, from the south
central region and other surrounding states. It will cover a wide range of
topics on Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, including but not limited
to the following list: finite element methods, finite volume methods, spectral
methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, numerical linear algebra,
preconditioning techniques, multiscale methods, parallel computing, numerical
methods for solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, image
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve as a forum for
researchers to distribute newest ideas, foster interaction and collaboration
between different groups, advocate the numerical analysis community in the south
central region, and help envision future research and education
agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to promoting group interaction and
collaboration, this conference will influence and invigorate the educational
developments among colleges, universities and research institutes. Graduate
students, postdocs, and junior researchers will benefit greatly from attending
the conference and communicating with peers. Special effort will be made to
encourage the attendance of woman, minorities, and other under-represented
groups. More information can be found on the conference webpage:
