In this renewal proposal they will investigate the properties of magnetic
impurities in metallic hosts for special systems, such as in ultra thin films
and for (nearly) insulated atoms and clustors. Furthermore they wish to
investigate the suppression of paramagnons at the interface of palladium with a
normal metal (copper, magnesium), and to explore the connections between the
spin-orbit scattering and the magnetic state of d-electrons in iron, cobalt and
nickel. The measurements of the magnetic scattering rate shall be extended into
the sub-mK temperature range. The main tool of investigation will be weak
localization. In addition they want to extend the investigtion to higher
concentrations of magnetic impurities which are beyond the application regime of
weak localization. They plan to investigate the non-spin flip scattering of
magnetic impurities by their scatteirng cross section in the normal conductance.
They also want to use ultra-low resistance tunneling juctions to investigate
basic questions, for example the range of the dynamic Coulomb interaction in
disordered two dimensional electron systems, the RKKY interaction and others.
