Abstract: EEC-9527345, University of Missouri Rolla, Dr. Scott Sudhoff: This
award provides funding to the University of Missouri Rolla for support of a
Combined Research Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Flexible Power
System Control". The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting
research advances in important technology areas into the upper level
undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty
researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum
development. This three year program under the direction of a multi
institutional team of researchers from the University of Missouri Rolla,
University of Arkansas, and Kansas State University will design two new courses
to provide students with a firm grasp of the fundamentals in distribution and
transmission systems and to introduce the students to advanced topics in the
control aspects of these systems. Novel features of this program include multi
institutional cooperation, student consulting teams, virtual classrooms and
interactive computer exercises and design. The faculty involved in this CRCD
program will cultivate and disseminate the expertise of the researchers to
enhance each school's power engineering program. In addition, this project will
lay the groundwork for schools to enhance the educational experience of their
students by relying not only on the experience of on site faculty, but also on
the experience of researchers at other institutions.
