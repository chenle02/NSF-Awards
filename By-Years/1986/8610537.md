Professor Taylor proposes a new theory that challenges currently held ideas in
accounting for the minimum attainable spectral linewidth of single mode
semiconductor diode lasers. He points out that the presently accepted theory of
Henry (Bell Labs) - first proposed in 1982, and since elaborated on by others -
has certain implications which violate the principle of energy conservation.
Professor Taylor's hypothesis treats spontaneous and stimulated emission
processes in a way consistent with energy conservation and provides for the
problem of random phase fluctuations in the photon field.
