9307034 Small This project combines laser-based techniques with a new, practical
methodology for reproducible, well-defined fabrication of thin (tens of
micrometers or less) hyperquenched glassy films. New, powerful experimental
techniques such as spectral hole burning and coherent time domain spectroscopies
will be used to develop an adequate understanding of the physics of amorphous
solids. The research deals with various aspects of the disorder, low-energy
excitations and low-temperature configurational relaxation (tunnelling)
processes of amorphous solids. A select number of organic liquids and waater
will be utilized in the experimental studies. The proposed investigation can be
divided into three parts: 1) studies of disorder and relaxation phenomena in
hyperquenched glassy and other amorphous solid films; 2) examination of
temperature dependencies of thermal conductivity and spectral diffusion; and 3)
the probing of special disorder-induced, low-frequency vibrational modes of
amorphous solids. These studies on amorphous semi-conductors and superconductors
and metal glasses have found and will continue to find technological
applications, particularly because human proteins have much in common with
amorphous solids, and that the solution to the nuclear waste problem may well
rest on safe, million-year containment in doped glasses. Also, the results from
these studies in organic systems will impact experimentalists and theoreticians
working on other materials. ***
