Motivated by problems in several applied areas, such as computer graphics,
robotics, computer vision, computer aided design, image processing, and
geographic information systems, computational geometry emerged as a discipline
about twenty years ago. Numerous efficient geometric algorithms and
sophisticated algorithmic paradigms have been developed, and computational
geometry is by now a rich and mature discipline. The link between computational
geometry and application areas is, however, still not as strong as one would
have hoped for. The purpose of this project is to narrow the gap between
geometry and the related applied areas. The project will address the issues
beyond the traditional framework of algorithmic design, and simple algorithms
will be developed and implemented that work well in practice. Geometric problems
motivated by various application areas, including visualization, robotics, data
mining, and metrology will be studied. The algorithms will be developed and
analyzed in a more realistic model of computation and will be implemented and
tested on ``real'' inputs.
