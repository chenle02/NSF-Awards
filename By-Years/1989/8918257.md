Clark Atlanta University in cooperation with Dolphus E. Milligan Science
Research Institute in the Atlanta University Center will establish a Research
Careers in Geosciences for Minority Scholars Program to increase the number of
minority students earning B.S. degrees in the natural sciences, computer
science, and mathematics with the prerequisites and interest in pursuing Ph.D.
degrees in the geosciences. The program includes the following activities: (1) a
pre-college summer program that emphasizes areas in geosciences, (2) four-year
scholarships for six entering freshmen each year of the program, (3) an enriched
curriculum and research component for undergraduate participants, (4)
articulation agreements with research universities and laboratories, and (5)
cooperative arrangements with the Atlanta Comprehensive Regional Center for
Minorities. Specific intended outcomes for the program include the following:
(1) the development of an early identification and nurturing mechanism for
talented Black students, (2) the creation of an awareness for careers in the
geosciences among Black pre-college and undergraduate students, (3) the
production of a competitive student training program in the geosciences, (4) the
production of B.S. degree recipients interested in and capable of pursuing the
Ph.D. degree in the geosciences, and (5) to insure that 75 percent of the
undergraduate program participants will enroll in Ph.D. programs in the
geosciences.
