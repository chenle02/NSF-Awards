Abstract

This project funds research that will evaluate how firms and consumers respond
to market-based policies that are supposed to improve air quality and address
environmental issues. The focus here is on testing hypotheses drawn from
economic theory about how new environmental policies affect business and public
health in the rapidly growing Chinese economy. China is about to adopt a new
national program of cap-and-trade emissions policies. The research team will
collect innovative measures of pollution, firm outcomes, and individual health.
They will analyze these data to test the team's hypotheses about whether or not
these policies will achieve the stated goals. Predicting and understanding the
effects of these policies is important for many scientific reasons. What is
more, the policies could potentially result in Chinese manufacturers facing much
higher costs of environmental compliance, which would have important
implications for worldwide trade and the comparative advantage of manufacturers
in countries such as the United States that already have strong environmental
controls. This project therefore will provide valuable new evidence to
researchers around the world and policymakers in the United States who are
charged with promoting US economic competitiveness.

The lack of reliable data are primary obstacles to understanding the world?s
most ambitious market-based environmental policy using data from a recently
implemented comprehensive cap and trade program. The project will evaluate how
emissions, firm outcomes, and individual health respond to this signature
environmental policy. First the team will conduct a conventional program
evaluation of the country's seven carbon trading pilot programs that were
launched in late 2013. This is analysis is already feasible using conventional
empirical approaches, such as difference-in-differences analysis. Second, they
will extensive baseline measures for the 2017- launch of the national program as
it comes online. Third, they will collect and assess innovative pollution and
health measures and evaluate the nation?s early experience with its incipient
national program. The project emphasizes analysis of independent and objective
metrics rather than official government measures. Heterogeneity in the program
features by regional market furnishes a laboratory for identifying successful
and unsuccessful program features. Rules governing the national program are
currently being finalized and will be evaluated for the identification
strategies they furnish.
