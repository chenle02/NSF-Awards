Proposal Number: 9361287 PI Last Name: Marchal The innovative use of computers
offers an opportunity to dramatically improve the learning and teaching of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The challenge is to identify an
instructional tool that addresses a serious and prevalent problem common to ODE
instruction--students' lack of a conceptual framework necessary to analyze and
build mathematical models, and to solve complex problems. In response,
IntelliPro proposes to investigate the feasibility of combining mathematical
simulation, graphic animation, and hypermedia to create an engaging multimedia
learning environment to significantly enhance students' understanding and
working knowledge of ODEs. The researchers envision powerful, easy to use, and
pedagogically meaningful interactive simulation, a computer "laboratory" that
will allow students to examine the properties of linear and nonlinear systems,
explore and construct realistic mathematical models, and apply intuitive
understanding of the behavior of solutions of ODEs to hypothetical and practical
situations. To determine technical feasibility, IntelliPro will (a) identify an
instructional strategy and essential content material, (b) design a software
structure and implement a proof-of-concept model, and (c)evaluate the software
design, mathematics education, and product development, will conduct the
research. ***y
