9351150 Spector The project will purchase an FT-infrared spectrophotometer for
use in the introductory freshman and organic courses. The innovative curricular
approach will include aspects of molecular symmetry, polymer properties, and
studies of inorganic complexes. FTIR experiments will be introduced into the
first-year chemistry curriculum: functional group analysis of prepared polymer
films and a comparative FTIR study of organometallic complexes of D3, C2 and D2h
symmetry. In the organic chemistry laboratory, concepts learned in general
chemistry will be reinforced by employing increasingly complex and sophisticated
experiments using FTIR spectroscopy. This systematic approach to FTIR
spectroscopy in the context of organic chemistry will include: functional group
analysis via qualitative "unknown" analysis (reinforcing the thin-film polymer
general chemistry experiment); determination of purity and completeness of a
reaction; examination of chemical equilibria (reinforcing thermodynamic concepts
learned in general chemistry); and examination of the molecular environment
(reinforcing the coordination complex general chemistry IR experiment). ***
