Single crystal fibers will have widespread applications in such areas as
composite materials, medicine, fiber optic sensors, and superconductivity.
Several techniques have been used to manufacture single crystal fibers. However,
fibers manufactured by these techniques either have low optical quality, short
lengths, or high cost. These factors have prohibited the availability of high
optical quality long (several hundred meters) single crystal fibers for many
applications. This project will investigate its laser-heated pedestal growth
(LHPG) process to manufacture long lengths of single crystal fibers while
obtaining high optical quality and stable diameter. During Phase l, a spooling
mechanism will be designed, fabricated, and assembled to be incorporated into a
LHPG growth apparatus. With the modified LHPG growth apparatus, an assortment of
sapphire fiber lengths of several diameters will be grown. The minimum lengths
will be 5 meters. These samples will be tested for diameter variations and
transmission.
