This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Peter Bodenheimer and Douglas Lin
(University of California - Santa Cruz) will undertake a study to determine the
frequency of habitable planets around other stars. In recent years, astronomers
have discovered over 300 giant planets, ranging in mass from Neptune-sized to
several Jupiter masses, but have not yet found small planets like the Earth. The
discovery of these massive planets has provided support to the sequential
accretion hypothesis (SAH), which assumes that the massive planets were formed,
together with a rich population of earth-like planets, through grain
condensation, planetesimal coagulation, embryo merging, and gas accretion. The
goals of this project include identifying the dominant effects which led to the
emergence of diverse populations of planets, including gas giants, hot Jupiters,
super Earths, and habitable planets; predicting observable features such as the
mass-period and period-eccentricity distributions which are unique signatures of
SAH versus other planet formation scenarios; and discovering dependence of
planetary properties as functions of the mass and chemical composition of their
host stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute toward NSF's goal
of integration of research and scientific education by using the talents of two
graduate students and some undergraduates in various aspects of the theoretical
calculations. Results will be disseminated through public lectures on planetary
science and through contributions to science journals for the general public.
