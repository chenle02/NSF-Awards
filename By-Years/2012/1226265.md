1226265&lt;br/&gt;Myrbo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAR Geoinformatics Program
grant supports a two year project to augment development of a prototype
informatics tool aimed at assisting non experts in identifying sedimentary
minerals and organic components in smear slides to support paleorecords research
on marine and lacustrine cores. Development of the prototype TMI (Tool for
Microscopic Identification) has a resulted in an online application. Support
from this grant will allow for augmented capabilities of TMI to include: 1) a
workflow tool for electronic data capture of smear slide analysis during core
description; and 2) a discovery and display tool for data stored in relevant
databases. The design will involve a modular, reusable architecture capable of
interacting with multiple external data sources (e.g., Neotoma) and workflow
tools. TMI will collect and maintain a database of images and data in
interpretive modules that will assist researchers and students without
professional level experience in optical petrography to quickly identify
sediment components in smear slides and to interpret the assemblages to place
them in the context of litho- and bio-facies and their environmental and
paleoenvironmental significance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
