9513036 Matyjaszewski This award supports the participation of 9 U.S.
researchers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Macromolecular Architecture and
Engineering, to be held in Sendai, Japan from October 27 to October 31, 1996.
The co-organizers are Prof. Krzysztof Matyjaszewski of Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh and Professor Prof. Shohei Inoue of Science University
of Tokyo. The theme of the proposed seminar was chosen in order to highlight
recent advances in the elaboration of novel polymerization methods and their use
in the design of new and well-defined complex macromolecular architectures
capable of generating advanced materials with controlled optical, electronic,
ionic, biomedical, high strength, and other special properties. Important
contributions in each of these areas are being made both in U.S. and in Japan,
and increased exchange of ideas and information between these two groups is
clearly warranted. The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of
expertise and geographical representation in the area of synthetic polymer
chemistry and polymer characterization, and were selected on the basis of being
the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
