A modern, high technology-oriented physiology laboratory to support the
physiology and cell biology courses is being equipped through this award. These
courses constitute an integral part of the Biology program and are fundamental
to the students' understanding of life processes. Explanations of biological
phenomena are increasingly sought at the biochemical level, and are arrived at
by employing sophisticated, instrument-oriented techniques such as radioactive
labeling of cellular components, spectro-photometric analyses of enzyme
activities and metabolic concentrations, and chromatographic procedures for
separating complex mixtures into their individual components. A UV/VIS
spectrophotometer, a high pressure liquid chromatographic system, and a computer
link-up that provides instrument control and data analysis are being added. At
least three courses are benefitting directly. In addition, a new instrumentation
course is being developed. In the field of modern molecularly-oriented biology,
skill in the use of these techniques and supportive instruments is second only
in importance to the students' understanding of the biological concepts for
which they are employed.
