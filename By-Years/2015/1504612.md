The engineer of 2020 is not only expected to offer technical ingenuity but also
to adapt to a continuously evolving environment while simultaneously being able
to operate outside the narrow limits of one discipline and be ethically grounded
in solving the complex problems of the future. To address the competencies of
the future engineer, undergraduate education must train students not only to
address engineering challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries, but also
to communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and non-
technical boundaries. One approach to train engineers in these competencies is
teaching biomimicry or bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum, which
offers relevance to professional practice as well as an affective hook to frame
complex, cross-disciplinary problems. This research aims to address the need for
undergraduate student training in multidisciplinary design innovation through
the creation of instructional resources that provide exposure to the abundance
of design examples that can be found in nature, and scaffolding the discovery
and knowledge transfer processes such that those natural designs can be used to
inspire engineering solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to
produce knowledge that will improve student learning, STEM literacy, cross-
disciplinary thinking, and capacity for innovation. As more engineering students
are trained in multidisciplinary design innovation, they will create solutions
that result in a sustainable future for society. Bio-inspired design supports
diversity and inclusion of ideas, and will attract women and minority students
with diverse backgrounds to pursue STEM fields.
