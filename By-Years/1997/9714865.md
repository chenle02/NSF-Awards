9714865 TUMEO This award will support a planning visit by Dr. Mark Tumeo,
University of Alaska, Fairbanks, to New Zealand to develop a cooperative
research project with Dr. Jacqueline Aislabie of the Manaaki Whenua-Landcare
Research Institute on oil- degrading bacteria which they have isolated from
spill sites in Antarctica. The aims of the intended research are to assess the
impacts of fuel importation in Antarctica and the viability of using indigenous
bacteria in Antarctica as part of ongoing soil remediation efforts.
