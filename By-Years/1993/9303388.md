This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program will
support work by Drs. James H. Espenson and Andreja Bakac of the Chemistry
Department, Iowa State University, on transition metal-mediated oxidation
reactions. Many of the studies will explore the superoxochromium(III) ion, which
is quickly formed when Cr(II) reacts with oxygen. Related aqua and macrocyclic
complexes of Cr, W, and Mo will be characterized in order to determine the
oxygen binding mode. The mechanism of oxygen self-exchange of the ion will be
determined using radioactive labeling methods. Oxygen transfer reactions between
Ru, Rh, and Cr and other transition metal oxo acceptors will be studied. In
addition, the very rapid reactions of other low-valent transition metal ions
with oxygen will be investigated and the mechanism of those reactions
determined. Metal-oxo, metal-peroxo, or metal-superoxo complexes might be
expected to be observed as intermediates. Various reactions of the metal-oxo
complexes formed will be undertaken, including electron transfer and hydrogen
abstraction. %%% In this thorough investigation of the details the interaction
of a number of transition metal ions with oxygen, Espenson and Bakac will
determine the way oxygen binds to the metal, the rates and pathways by which
oxygen is exchanged with other metals, and the susceptibility of the metal-oxo
complexes to oxidation or reduction. The fundamental results are expected to be
helpful in understanding the role of transition metals in organic oxidation
reactions, which are industrially important, and of metal-oxo ions in biological
systems.
