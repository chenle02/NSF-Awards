Computer Science (31) This project is developing a more effective way of
teaching the high dropout introductory programming course by using a set of
group-based cooperative learning exercises in conjunction with the lecture
approach. A major goal is to maximize use of faculty resources by incorporating
teaching assistants into the process.

Cooperative learning is a well known pedagogy for improving student retention
and success. However, it is relatively unused in computer science and this
project will provide an instructor's manual and group exercises to help computer
science faculty move towards using cooperative learning.
