Modeling fluctuations in the extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) over
time is a principal goal of the glaciological community. These models will
provide a critical basis for predictions of future sea level change, and
therefore this work great societal relevance. The mid-Pliocene time interval is
of particular interest, as it is the most recent period in which global
temperatures were warmer and atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have been higher
than current levels. However, observational constraints on fluctuations in the
WAIS older than the last glacial maximum are rare. The investigators propose to
collect geochemical data from the Ohio Range and Scott Glacier to quantify past
variability in the height of the WAIS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited available
cosmogenic nuclide data are broadly consistent with a model indicating that
Pliocene WAIS elevations and volumes were smaller than at present, and that WAIS
collapse was common. The PIs will use geologic observations and cosmogenic
nuclide concentrations from bedrock samples at multiple locations and at
multiple elevations, including sub-ice samples, to constrain WAIS ice volume
changes in a "dipstick" like fashion. Data obtained from the proposed research
will provide targets for data-ice sheet model comparisons to accurately
characterize Plio-Pleistocene and future WAIS behavior. As part of this project,
the investigators will work with the Natural History Museum and the Earth &amp;
Planetary Science department at Harvard to develop an exhibit that will become
part of the Museum's recently opened Earth and Planetary Science Gallery. The
project involves mentoring of a female graduate student as well as an
undergraduate student.
