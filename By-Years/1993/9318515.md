9318515 Denton This award is for support for a two year study to improve the
understanding of Pliocene glacial history and landscape evolution of the
Transantarctic Mountains in order to reconcile conflicting hypotheses of
Antarctic climate and associate ice response during Pliocene warm intervals. The
new field area to be studied is the Royal Society Range, which has extensive
areas free of ice and is adjacent both to the Dry Valleys and to large off-shore
volcanoes. These unique circumstances suggest that critical Pliocene
chronologic, stratigraphic, paleoclimatic, and surface uplift data will be well
preserved in this area. The glacial and tectonic information that will be
derived from the Royal Society Range should greatly clarify two important and
intertwined problems of Antarctic science: Pliocene ice-sheet stability and the
evolution of the Transantarctic Mountains. ***
