The National Science Foundation is awarding the University of Illinois at
Springfield funds to acquire a Carbon-Hydrogen-Nitrogen (CHN) Elemental Analyzer
that will be used for ?hands-on? teaching by Biology, Chemistry and
Environmental Science departments on the campus of the University of Illinois at
Springfield to generate carbon and nitrogen datasets. In addition, the
instrumentation will facilitate currently funded research projects and research
being developed at the University?s Emiquon Field Station located at one of our
country?s largest river floodplain restoration sites. A common element of all
projects is determining the carbon and/or nitrogen content in these ecosystems
and how it relates to questions of climate change. Reaching our goal of
measuring carbon and nitrogen content will be accomplished using the CHN
Elemental Analyzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student training on instrumentation
acquired through this funding will help develop an appreciation of nutrient
cycling, as well as develop much needed skills in advanced environmental
instrumentation analysis. In addition, training and research will help provide
insights into topics of the effects of global warming and species change on
ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Open house events will allow education
of the public to the details of how advanced analysis can be connected to
pertinent topics of public concern like climate change, restoration ecology and
problems with access nutrient (i.e., nitrogen) in our
rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
