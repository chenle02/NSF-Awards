The objective of the research is to advance the understanding of the mechanics
of hydroforming sandwich materials. Sandwich materials, constructed from two
face sheets and a porous core, have been used to reduce weight, improve thermal
insulation, reduce noise and vibration, and increase energy absorption. The
traditional method of constructing shaped sandwich panels is costly and time
consuming. The proposed project will investigate a new approach to manufacture
shaped sandwich panels based using sheet hydroforming techniques. The project
will address challenging issues including: effective characterization and
modeling of the constituents of the sandwich panel; understanding the competing
failure modes among face sheet wrinkle/fracture, core shear/fracture, and de-
lamination between the face sheet and the core; determining the forming limit of
the sandwich materials; and conducting experiments to validate model
predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to a
fundamental understanding of the deformation mechanics of sandwich panels and
will broaden the use of sandwich materials for weight reduction applications in
various industries. The research results can generate significant impact such as
improving vehicle fuel efficiency and decreasing harmful emissions. The project
will also provide excellent opportunities for students to actively participate
in a research project that has practical applications.
