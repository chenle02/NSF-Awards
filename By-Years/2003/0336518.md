0336518 Elster This award supports Charlotte Elster and students from Ohio
University in a collaboration with Siegfried Krewald of the Institute of Nuclear
Physics at the Research Center in Juelich, Germany. The research will focus on
developing a model of the exchange of the vector mesons omega and rho, the
nucleon exchange, and S-wave resonance. By studying the effect of different
production mechanisms on polarization observables, suggestions for possible
experimental investigations will become possible. Since the eta-prime
photoproduction from the deuteron is close to the production threshold, it will
also be possible to study the effects of the meson-nucleon final-state
interaction. Extensive experience with many aspects of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction, along with a history of developing meson-nucleon interactions,
allows the US-German collaboration to include sophisticated final-state
interaction into photoproduction calculation. The combined complementary
expertise that the two sides bring to bear creates an ideal environment for
carrying out the proposed research project and for training junior researchers
in an international setting.
