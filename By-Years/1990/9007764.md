This work will study the dynamics of interpenetrating fluids including the
development of instabilities in fluidized beds and radiative transport in hot,
rapidly rotating stars. Other topics include solitary structures resulting from
the complex Ginzburg - Landau equation, thermonuclear convection in stellar
cores and temporal chaos.
