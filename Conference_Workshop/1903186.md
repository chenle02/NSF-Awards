This award will provide participant support to the conference "Ideals,
Varieties, and Applications" (https://iva2019.wordpress.amherst.edu/) to be held
June 10-14 in Amherst, MA. The organizers will bring together graduate students
and researchers at all levels to survey the state of the art in computational
and combinatorial algebraic geometry. The conference will aim to provide
mentorship and support for graduate students and early-career researchers and
will stress the idea that mathematicians from a diverse range of institutions
can make significant and lasting contributions to mathematics and its
connections to other disciplines. Many of the conference topics are motivated by
applications outside of mathematics; further breakthroughs will result in
fruitful interplay between disciplines, and a more prominent role for
computational algebraic geometry in science and engineering, building on the
role it is already establishing in fields such as computer vision, modeling, and
computational biology.

Modern computational algebraic geometry began with the invention of Groebner
bases in 1965, which form the backbone of many practical algorithms developed
since then. A special emphasis will be placed on illustrating how computation of
Groebner bases drives both theory and applications. In particular, speakers will
cover advances in algorithms, toric varieties, Cox rings, syzygies, tropical
algebraic geometry, geometric modeling, and applications to computer-aided-
design (CAD). The organizers will emphasize recent open problems ripe for work
by early-career scholars with solid algebra training.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
