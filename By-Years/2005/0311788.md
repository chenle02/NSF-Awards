A fundamental understanding of the kinetics of phase boundaries, and
&lt;br/&gt;more broadly hysteresis, remains an open challenge in the study of
&lt;br/&gt;active materials. The lack of kinetic information is a consistent
&lt;br/&gt;difficulty in various problems including dislocation mechanics and
&lt;br/&gt;growth of thin films. The research in the current award, though
&lt;br/&gt;focussed on active materials, will impact these areas. There is now
&lt;br/&gt;an accepted framework to model this based on the notion of kinetic
&lt;br/&gt;relations, but it is phenomenological in that it does not address why
&lt;br/&gt;some phase boundaries are more mobile than others and how one can
&lt;br/&gt;change the mobility. This project examines through computation and
&lt;br/&gt;rigorous mathematics whether one can derive a kinetic relation
&lt;br/&gt;starting from a more fundamental or smaller scale description of
&lt;br/&gt;materials in the context of displacive phase transformations. Two
&lt;br/&gt;scales are of particular interest, atoms and defects. First, the
&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to understand the atomic-continuum linkage by starting
&lt;br/&gt;from an atomistic (discrete) model capable of phase transformations
&lt;br/&gt;and passing to the continuum in such a manner that captures the
&lt;br/&gt;essential dynamics of the phase transformation process. Second, the
&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to understand the role of defects such as vacancies,
&lt;br/&gt;impurities and second phase precipitates in determining the overall
&lt;br/&gt;propagation of a phase boundary. This leads to the mathematical
problem of &lt;br/&gt;homogenization of a non-local free boundary
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active materials like shape-memory materials and
ferroelectric &lt;br/&gt;materials possess unusual but useful properties that
make them vital &lt;br/&gt;for a variety of applications like dental braces,
cardiac stents, &lt;br/&gt;space antennas, ultrasonic devices, pressure sensors
and &lt;br/&gt;microactuators. The unusual properties arise from very
&lt;br/&gt;characteristic and intricate patterns that these materials can form
&lt;br/&gt;at a microscopic scale. Over the last &lt;br/&gt;decade, much advance
has been made in understanding the nature of the &lt;br/&gt;microstructure, its
relation to basic crystallography and its &lt;br/&gt;consequences for material
properties. In particular, a sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory for
static microstructures has emerged, and this theory has had &lt;br/&gt;important
practical impact by predicting and explaining new phenomena and applications.
&lt;br/&gt;However, much remains unknown regarding how the microstructure
&lt;br/&gt;changes as we apply stress to these materials. This is important
&lt;br/&gt;since it determines an important property of these materials known as
&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis or shape memory. Work supported by this award will
&lt;br/&gt;build a mathematical theory of the evolution of microstructure.
&lt;br/&gt;It will also train graduate and undergraduate students in research in
&lt;br/&gt;the emerging and important area of multiscale
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
