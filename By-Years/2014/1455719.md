This project funds a workshop on mobile community measurement infrastructure to
respond to the growing needs for increased visibility into network behavior to
enable cutting-edge research in mobile computing. The workshop will bring
together the top researchers in both academia and industry, as well as policy
makers from government, to discuss the requirements for such an infrastructure
and identify the concrete steps to make progress towards the identified goals.
Given the diverse research topics within mobile computing, we will ensure that
different research areas and all the important network layers (e.g., physical,
MAC, network, transport, and application) are adequately represented at the
workshop to ensure a productive outcome from the
discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible measurement infrastructure support
for experimentation are critical for enabling and supporting research work with
strong experimental components to help validate ideas and evaluate the design in
practice. Mobile computing research work must be evaluated in as realistic
network settings as possible to help researchers understand how various factors
such as signal strength, network load affect the performance and energy metrics
of interest. Currently, there is no environment that enables network visibility
from an end-to-end perspective of the cellular network protocol stack: from the
end-device all the way to the network server traversing through various network
elements. The lack of such an integrated measurement infrastructure greatly
hinders the innovation in this important research field. Because it is not
trivial to design instrumentation to support diverse needs of researchers in
mobile computing, the workshop helps define the goals and requirements of a
mobile measurement infrastructure that is designed to last at least 10 years to
support cutting-edge research in this space.
