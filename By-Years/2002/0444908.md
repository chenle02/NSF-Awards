Molecular mechanisms of cell quiescence are poorly understood. The majority of
cells in adult animals can remain healthy in the quiescent G0 phase of the cell
cycle for a long time until they are induced to proliferate by appropriate
extracellular signals. Under environmental stress, cells can survive by
undergoing growth arrest, then re-enter the cell cycle when that stress no
longer exists. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms for
maintaining this quiescent state in order to fill a serious gap in the current
knowledge of mechanisms pertaining to developmental biology, cell survivability
under stress, and animal hibernation. The PI's preliminary data suggest that a
novel quiescence-induced kinase, QIK, is involved in modulating cell quiescence
in response to various forms of stress. The objective of this project is to
determine the peptide sequence of QIK by biochemical methods. QIK will be
isolated from quiescent cells for biochemical analysis to determine its peptide
sequences. Once the peptide sequence of QIK is known, then the gene coding for
QIK will be identified and the function of QIK will be studied as the ultimate
goal. Because very few studies address the molecular mechanisms of cell
quiescence, the broad impact of this research is to advance current knowledge of
new kinases involved in regulating quiescence. New knowledge of molecular
mechanisms for homeostasis, tissue repair and cell dormancy in humans,
hibernation in animals and dormancy in plants is expected to provide benefits to
society as a whole. In addition, selected veterinary students as well as
minority high school students will participate in this research either through
regular, summer, or special programs provided by the University of Tennessee.
