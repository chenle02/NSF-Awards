The wealth of natural history information about swallowtail butterflies (family
Papilionidae) has catalyzed the elucidation of numerous classic biological
concepts. At present, associations of papilionid caterpillars and their food
plants are being studied throughout the world to gain greater understanding of
basic biological processes as well as economic benefits to agriculture.
Unfortunately, this work is crippled by the lack of a reliable taxonomic
framework describing evolutionary relationships among most species of
papilionids. However, DNA technology offers new tools for understanding
relationships among these insects. In particular, the mitochondrial (mt) DNA
molecule is easily isolated, surveyed for restriction sites and sequenced. Felix
Sperling, under the supervision of Dr. R. G. Harrison at Cornell University,
will use mtDNA sequence information to infer relationships among a broad
selection of species in the Papilionidae. Work will concentrate on the most
poorly understood genus, Papilio, which is one of 24 genera in the Papilionidae
but contains two fifths of the species. All eight species in the Papilio machaon
species group will be surveyed for restriction site variation within and between
populations. Using the polymerase chain reaction, at least 1000 base pairs will
be sequenced in 35-40 of the 220 species of Papilio. This will allow estimation
of the phylogenetic relationships among all major sections of Papilio, and will
provide a much firmer basis on which to interpret the diverse array of
biological data available for these insects.
