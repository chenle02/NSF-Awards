Planets form and are composed of the dust and gas found in disks around young
stars. The planet formation process is linked to the chemistry of the materials
in the disks: the chemical properties of the disk material shape the outcome of
planet formation, and planet formation in the disk is likely to affect its
chemistry. The investigators will use the Atacama Large Millimeter and
submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map the chemical structures of disks around five
young stars. They will also develop theory to use the distribution of chemicals
they observe to constrain planet formation models for the five systems. PI Oberg
will continue mentoring a Banneker fellow each year, and co-PI Bergin will
continue to offer a workshop on recruiting for both diversity and excellence. He
will also present the workshop at a conference. Graduate and undergraduate
students will be involved in the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team's approved
ALMA Large Program targets 5 protoplanetary disks in 25+ individual molecular
lines, and was designed to elucidate:&lt;br/&gt;1. the interplay between dust
and chemical sub-structures. The high angular resolution of the observations
will allow them to map out relationships between dust sub-structures and
chemical sub-structures.&lt;br/&gt;2. the vertical distributions of molecules in
disks. By combining high-angular resolution observations with line excitation
analysis the team will constrain the vertical chemical disk
structures.&lt;br/&gt;3. the distribution of organic molecules and volatile
elements in the planet forming zone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will
construct a catalogue of disk chemical sub-structures and develop an appropriate
taxonomy. They will catalogue rings, spirals, plateaus, non-axisymmetric
excesses and depletions, vertical emission layers, and other observed sub-
structures across the sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
