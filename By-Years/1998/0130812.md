EIA-0130812 Andreas G. Andreou Johns Hopkins University A Comparative Study of
Information Processing in Biological and Bio-inspired systems: Performance
Criteria, Resources Tradeoffs and Fundamental Limits

We propose a research program towards a fundamental and quantitative
understanding of the tradeoffs between system performance and resources such as
size, reliability and energy requirements for biological and bio-inspired
microsystems. We employ the mathematical tools of communication theory and model
natural or synthetic physical structures as micro-scale communication networks,
studying them under physical constraints at two different levels of abstraction.
At the functional level we examine the operational and task specification, while
at the implementation level we examine the physical specification and
realization. Both levels of abstraction are characterized by Shannon's channel
capacity, as determined by the channel bandwidth, the signal power; and the
noise power. The link between the functional level and the physical level of
abstraction is established through first principles and phenomenological
otherwise, models for transformations on the signal, physical constraints on the
system, and noise that degrades the signal.
