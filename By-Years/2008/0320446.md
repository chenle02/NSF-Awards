This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design and
construct a basic fast response scanning thermo system. Laboratory and ambient
air measurements will demonstrate the advantage of the fast response thermo
system to classify volatile compounds on single aerosol particles. The
innovative design will provide for scans from 50 to 800 degrees centigrade in
less than 30 seconds. The capabilities of any instrument that measures particle
properties, nephelometers, optical particle counters, aerosol mass spectrometers
or differential mobility analyzers will be significantly enhanced with this
method of characterizing aerosol populations with thermograms of their
volatility. Very simple experiments can be performed with this thermographic
technique that will yield useful data on classes of volatile compounds found in
aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capability of providing detailed
thermographic analysis of aerosol volatility rapidly will have widespread,
scientific and commercial benefits in areas of environmental monitoring, studies
of the health impact of aerosols, combustion research and emissions
inspections.&lt;br/&gt;
