Professor Chinburg will work on Galois Module Structure for Schemes and the
connection between capacity theory and intersection theory on varieties. In
particular he will work on Euler characteristics using equivariant Riemann-Roch
theorems. He will also work on limits of metrizied cycles in arbitrary
codimension. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
