9315679 Ebron This planning grant will provide support for planning the
development of an object-oriented simulator for automated distribution systems,
so that optimal automation strategies can be selected for specific systems. The
simulator would integrate load characteristics, feeder configuration, automation
strategies, and cost/benefit analyses into one graphics-based simulation
package. For purposes of basic research, it will allow general conclusions about
automation strategies to be made with respect to feeder type and load
characteristics. ***
