In 1988, a major five-year program known as E4 and entitled "An Enhanced
Educational Experience for Engineering Students" was launched by Drexel
University and the National Science Foundation. This program focuses on the
revision of the lower division engineering curriculum, and includes the
Introductory Engineering Laboratory (IEL). This project uses the IEL as a
physical and intellectual foundation to develop a new Advanced Engineering
Laboratory (AEL). The AEL is integrated with the IEL with respect to philosophy,
perspective, organization, program, and equipment. The objectives are 1) to
capitalize on developed student skills while focusing on sophisticated
specialized or interdisciplinary experiments; 2) to enhance the scope,
efficiency and effectiveness of existing upper-division laboratories; 3) to
develop new experimental configurations; and 4) to serve as a model facility and
strategy for providing a diverse, sophisticated and cost-effective environment
for teaching the theory and practice of modern engineering experimentation. This
phase of the project addresses the analysis, design, and prototype development
and testing of the AEL.
