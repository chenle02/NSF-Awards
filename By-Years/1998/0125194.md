This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
Office of Polar Programs, provides funds for research to establish the
systematics of cosmogenic argon production necessary to establish its
measurement as a routine surface exposure dating tool analogous to existing
methods based on 3He, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, and 26Al. Cosmogenic argon offers
advantages over existing cosmogenic chronometers in that it is stable (hence
applicable to long-term or ancient exposure dating) and less prone to diffusive
loss than He or Ne. Production of 38Ar is principally by spallation of Ca and
(probably) K, and is most easily measured using neutron-irradiated samples as
has been performed routinely on extraterrestrial samples for several decades.
Initial measurements on Antarctic samples by the principal investigators
demonstrate the viability of this method for terrestrial samples, and suggest an
average production rate >100 atoms/gm-Ca/year. Existing data suggest that
38Ar/Ca exposure ages younger than 10^5 years may be determined by this method
with useful accuracy. Further work on calcic minerals (apatite, sphene,
clinopyroxene, plagioclase, calcite) whose exposure histories are constrained by
3He and 21Ne concentration data, will be used to determine the Ca-derived
production rate. Analogous work on K-rich minerals (K-feldspars, micas) will be
used to constrain the production of 38Ar from K, which should theoretically be
comparable to that from Ca, using the same neutron-activation method. The
analytical work will use existing samples plus new samples to be collected from
the Dry Valleys of Antarctica in order to maximize cosmic radiation dosage for
calibration purposes. Laboratory studies of 38Ar retentivity in appropriate
minerals will be used to help evaluate our results and guide future
applications. The results of this work will be important to a wide array of
investigations that require knowledge of surface exposure ages.
