9514202 Wolf This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research project will continue
the development of a framework for the formal specification and analysis of the
behavioral properties of software architectures. Together with Daniel
Yankelevich of the Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina, the PI at the
University of Colorado Boulder will extend his work on a formal specification
method based on the Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM) model. CHAM provides
operational semantics which may be more easily understood by a wide audience
than competing mathematical formalisms. The collaboration established in this
project connects the PI with an existing effort between Argentina and Italy on
specification and verification of concurrent systems. It also combines the
systems orientation of the U.S. group with the theoretical orientation of the
Argentines to understand the potential of the CHAM model for software
architecture. ***
