This award is to help defer travel expenses for invited speakers at a
multidisciplinary meeting of developmental neuroscientists to be held in Israel
in June of 1988. This meeting will consist of two parts: 1) a series of "Pre-
meeting Workshops" to be held prior to the main meeting (June 19-21) at
Kibbutzim in the vicinity of Jerusalem and 2) the main meeting to be held in
Jerusalem (June 21-24). This meeting will focus on bridging the gap between
basic molecular and cellular approaches to the developing nervous system and the
study of neurological disorders of known ontogenic etiology. It is hoped that
this combination of basic developmental neuroscientists and researchers in more
clinically oriented fields will help to generate new approaches to the study of
normal and abnormal neural ontogeny.
