The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to design and develop an integrated charger
for electric vehicle applications. Electric vehicles produce less than half the
emissions of conventional combustion engine vehicles. This project develops a
new integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric
vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project advances an integrated onboard charger for electric vehicles.
Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are
equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an
additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. This project
develops a new topology, design, control, thermal management, packaging, and
validation of the first integrated charger onboard and auxiliary power module
for electric vehicles. Systems engineering tasks include: optimize the converter
design, implement a closed-loop controller, conduct a thermal management study,
conduct reliability analyses, design the enclosure, and demonstrate automotive-
level functionality requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
