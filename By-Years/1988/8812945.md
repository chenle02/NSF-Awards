The anti-correlation between cosmic ray fluxes and the level of solar activity
(solar modulation) is caused by magnetic field irregularities carried by the
solar wind which sweep the charged particles out of the solar system and/or
decelerate them. Since electrons and nuclei have greatly different charge/mass
ratios the relation of velocity and magnetic rigidity is significantly different
for these two particle species. Recent observations have shown that the failure
of the current modulation model simultaneously to reproduce electron and nucleon
modulation is related to reversals of the solar magnetic field which occur every
eleven years. If the heliospheric magnetic field has long range order the sign
of the charge of the cosmic ray particles can affect their propagation. A
detailed consideration of the symmetries involved shows that the charge
dependence should change when the solar field reverses. This research program is
designed to extend measurements of the charge dependence of cosmic ray solar
modulation through comparison of electron data to be obtained under this grant
with electron an proton data available from our instrument on the ICE spacecraft
as well as other data from the literature. This investigation will determine the
extent to which the large scale order of the heliospheric magnetic field is
important in determining the trajectories of charged particles in the
heliosphere.
