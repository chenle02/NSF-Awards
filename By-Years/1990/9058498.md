Three topics will be pursued with the aid of the Presidential Young Investigator
award. 1. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy will be used to investigate the
properties of solid-solid interfaces. The sum-frequency signal generated by
shining two beams of light onto a heterojunction (e.g., nickel silicide/silicon)
is to be measured in order to probe the interfacial electronic structure. 2. A
new technique in dynamical light scatteirng (diffusing wave spectroscopy) will
be employed to study particle motion and the transport of light in dense
colloidal suspensions. 3. Processes associated with adsorbed molecules on clean
metal surfaces (e.g., cobalt and platinum), such as energy transfer, dephasing,
and molecular movements, are to be investigated by ultrafast infrared
spectroscopic methods.
