The Physics Department at San Jose State University is starting a new laboratory
course in computational physics. The structure of the course parallels that of
experimental labs in which students do one or two major projects in the
semester. The available projects span all fields of physics, and the course
should be attractive to all majors (and perhaps some applied math and CS
majors.) The grant is adding a fast 386 clone, Mac IIx computer and some
supporting hardware and software to equipment already on hand. This upgrade
allows the department to run a lab with 15-20 undergraduates, and the more
powerful machines enable the students to run fairly sophisticated projects. The
university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
