The goal of the proposed Project ACCESS is to increase the number of associate's
and Bachelor's degrees in Engineering granted to residents of South Central
Texas.

The following activities will be implemented in order to achieve the project's
goal and outcomes: 1) Establishing dual credit engineering courses in at least
five area high schools; 2) Training faculty at community college in distance
education and/or infusion of state-of-the-art technology into engineering
curricula; 3) Supplementing community college curriculum with state-of-the-art
engineering education materials and software; 4) Converting at least 75% of San
Antonio College Engineering Courses and Engineering Math will be converted into
Internet format; 5) developing a new engineering course, "Engineering
Mathematics," for San Antonio College Engineering and Dual Credit students; 6)
SAC will obtain new articulation agreements for 2 + 2 transfers with at least
two additional 4-year Engineering programs in the South and Central Texas area;
and 7) other Alamo Community College District and area engineering faculty will
be made aware of the availability of new curricula.

San Antonio College will work closely with the University of Texas at San
Antonio, Texas A & M, South West Texas University and other schools to
articulate seamless engineering courses of study for "2 + 2 + 2" (high
school/community college/university) students.

The expected outcomes of this project are the following: 1) at least 40 high
school students, half minority, will be enrolled in dual credit Engineering or
pre-Engineering courses with San Antonio College each year; 2) at least 30
students each semester will be enrolled in one or more Web-based Engineering
course; 3) the number of minority Engineering majors at San Antonio College who
transfer to Engineering programs at four-year institutions will be increased by
at least 200%; and 4) the numbers of minority students graduating from San
Antonio College with an Associate's Degree in Engineering will be increased by
at least 200%.
