PRISMS - Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies for Motivating Students
is a two-year leadership project at the University of Northern Iowa to increase
achievement in high school physics and to cultivate reasoning and problem
solving skills in science. 50 well qualified physics resource teachers from
throughout the country will be trained in the use of materials and strategies
that have been developed and validated by the Iowa Physics Task Force. The
materials include a teacher's resource guide, Physics Resources and
Instructional Strategies for Motivating Students (PRISMS), which contain more
than 125 activities. The program emphasizes "learning cycle" pedagogy. It
includes a three-week workshop during the first summer of operation, and
extensive academic year follow-up activities. Participants who successfully
complete the academic year leadership component will receive up to 2 units of
graduate credit.
