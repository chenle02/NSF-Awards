With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Marcel Utz and his group at the University of Virginia
are working to combine the advantages of microfluidic devices and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Similar to the more widely-known magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), MRS is a powerful method of chemical analysis which
allows identification of chemical compounds as well as the detailed study of
biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. It is particularly
well-suited to detect many different metabolites in biological systems
simultaneously. Microfluidic devices are miniaturized chemical laboratories on a
chip which allow precise control of very small amounts of liquids in complicated
fluidic networks. They enable integration of laboratory procedures into a simple
and expandable platform, often with huge improvements in cost, reliability, and
throughput. The Utz group seeks to develop an efficient method to extract MRS
spectra directly from samples inside microfluidic devices, without the need to
transfer liquid from the chip to the MRS spectrometer. To achieve this, magnetic
inductive coupling is being used to focus the sensitivity of the spectrometer
onto specific fluidic chambers on the chip. This will enable new tools for
research as well as medical diagnostics based on the simultaneous detection of a
large number of metabolites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is highly
interdisciplinary, bringing together microfabrication, electrical engineering,
chemistry, and spectroscopy. It provides an ideal learning and training
environment for postdoctoral research associates as well as graduate and
undergraduate students. It also provides summer research experiences for school
students and teachers, familiarizing them with an exciting area of scientific
inquiry.
