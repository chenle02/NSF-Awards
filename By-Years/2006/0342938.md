With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University will acquire a
Beowulf computer for computational chemistry. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) quantum simulation of materials; b)
quantum liquids; c) control of molecular processes; d) computational surface
chemistry; e) statistical mechanics applied to the generational and structural
characterization of hard-particle systems; and f) biomedical imaging.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital
to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer
network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and
supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These
studies will have a significant impact in a wide number of areas, including
biochemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
