Indiana University, in cooperation with NSTA, will convene a Conference for
Strategic Planning in Science Teacher Education in Washington, D.C. in January,
1992. Three-member teams consisting of the Education Dean, Arts &amp; Sciences
Dean, and a Science Educator from twenty universities will be invited to
participate. The purpose of the conference is to discuss reform in precollege
science curriculum and new directions needed in the preparation of teachers. One
of the outcomes of the conference will be the preparation of the report, "An
Agenda for Action in Precollege Science Teacher Education Reform," which will be
widely circulated among those preparing teachers. It is also intended that the
conference will stimulate the participants to examine teacher preparation at
their respective institutions and take the lead in designing new innovative
programs. The cost sharing is 38% of NSF's contributions.
