9730438 Gerace Assessing to Learn is a technology-based assessment system for
high school physics that integrates formative assessment and instruction. The
assessment items are consistent with constructivist and active learning
pedagogies; they take account of research into physics education including the
elucidation of student preconceptions. Students evaluate their own learning and
teachers are guided to tailor instruction to meet student needs. The Classtalk
system, a classroom software tool, provides an integrated package that allows
presentation of the items for class discussion, collection and storage of
individual student responses and a display of total class responses. The
combination of sound assessment and immediate feedback results in teachers
changing practice to adopt a more responsive instructional style and matching
the assessment to the goals of physics education - understanding of physics
concepts and the process of inquiry, and application of those concepts to engage
in problem solving. The assessment items cover mechanics, electric and magnetic
fields, circuits, waves, optics, and modern physics. The project is a
collaboration of the PIs, teachers from high schools, Better Education, Inc. and
Texas Instruments. Products include the assessment items and accompanying
teacher aids that identify the reasons for common student responses and give
guidance on follow-up activities and discussion. The extensive evaluation
provides information on student achievement, change in teacher practice and on
the development process.
