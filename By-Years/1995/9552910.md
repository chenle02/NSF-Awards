9552910 Buikstra The Center for American Archeology (Kampsville, Illinois) will
initiate a 6-week, residential Young Scholars project for 34 students, recruited
nationally and entering grades ten, eleven, and twelve during the summers of
1996 and 1997. The disciplinary focus is in archeological research with an
emphasis on the role that geomorphology, botany, zoology, bioathropology and
other disciplines play in understanding past societies. Students will spend
three weeks excavating at a prehistoric Native American site. Activities will
introduce the students to ethical issues, career choices, and computer
applications in archeology.
