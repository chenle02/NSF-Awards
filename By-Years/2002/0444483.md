This grant supports the development of a rapid-quench, cold-seal hydrothermal
laboratory, capable of operating to ~2 kbar and ~950 deg C and with the
capability of automated, long-duration decompression and/or pressure
increase/decrease cycling. The device will enable experimental simulation of
static and/or dynamic processes in a pressure range that is appropriate for
shallow magmatic, volcanic conduit, or ore-forming environments. Specific
studies envisioned include: using pressure cycling to simulate repeated venting
and resealing of volcanic conduits or hydrothermal ore forming systems and
evaluating its impact on the formation of complexly zoned phenocrysts or quartz
vein systems; using controlled decompression to study the development of
vesicularity and permeability in volcanic systems, and; using long duration
static experiments to determine stable isotope fractionations between coexisting
melts and to study volatile solubilities in melts at volcanologically relevant
pressures. The lab will facilitate collaborative research between the PI,
colleagues in volcanology (K Cashman, P Wallace), ore deposits research (MH
Reed) and stable isotope geochemistry (I Bindeman), and their students in the
Department of Geological Sciences, University of Oregon. ***
