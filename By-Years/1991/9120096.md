This project is supported under the Phase II (Second Year) program of the
Seismic Repair and Rehabilitation Initiative (NSF 90- 23). There is a large
inventory of older reinforced masonry (URM) buildings located in high seismic
regions throughout the country which were not designed and detailed for adequate
lateral strength and ductility as per current code standards. These buildings
pose the greatest life hazard during moderate or severe earthquake, as attested
to by damage suffered by many of such buildings during the 1987 Whittier
earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A number of these buildings are
being evaluated and strengthened using several different techniques, steel
bracing and being one of the widely used schemes. However, there has been no
experimental study on the seismic behavior of masonry wall-bracing systems under
severe cyclic deformations and on rational procedures for their design which
will ensure satisfactory performance during a severe earthquake. A joint
cooperative research effort is conducted to study the in-plane seismic behavior
of masonry (URM) walls strengthened with steel bracing. The objectives are to
evaluate, through testing and analysis, currently used philosophy and design
procedures, and to develop improved methods for strengthening existing buildings
by using ductile steel bracing systems to enhance their safety during future
earthquakes of severe "design level" intensities. The findings of the proposed
study will be useful for formulation of code requirements for evaluation and
strengthening of existing URM buildings.
