0337208 Schnoor The degradation of environmental contaminants by the combined
action of plants and microbes has been recognized as a promising bioremediation
appraoch but is underinvestigated. In particular, the contribution of endophytic
bacteria is largely unexplored. The investigators identified a neat system to
explore the contributions of an endophytic bacterium to the degradation of
energetic compounds. The proposed research effort is likely to provide exciting
new results and insights into contaminant degradation by a plant-microbe
interaction. Hypothesis 2 appropriately addresses key questions and the
objectives are likely to produce meaningful results.
