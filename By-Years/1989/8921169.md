Two field experiments on radiation fog were conducted in fall of 1981 and 1982
near Albany, New York, which lies near the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk
rivers. The analysis of the data has proceeded in several different directions
due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject, and is nearing completion.
Under this award, Professors Lala and Fitzjarrald will synthesize these results
into several manuscripts and summarize our understanding of fog formation. The
manuscripts include: -Hudson Valley Fog Environments -Climatological Aspects of
Radiation Fog Occurrence at Albany, NY -Valley circulations observed with a
fine-scale surface network -Observations of fog formation processes near the
surface. -Fog drop spectra and microphysical process -Aerosol characteristics
during radiation fog events In addition to these publications, they will prepare
a data report on the fog field study for distribution in the research
community.//
