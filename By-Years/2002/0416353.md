Over the course of the past decade, a number of governmental and nongovernmental
organizations at various levels (city, state, nation) have supported pilot
programs intended to facilitate citizen deliberation and citizen-to-government
communication with digital technologies, with mixed results. The PI argues that
citizen-to-citizen deliberative democracy can be strongly supported with digital
technologies if democratic principles are used from beginning toe end (i.e., to
conceptualize, design, implement, deploy and evaluate new digital technologies
for democracy). In this project the PI will build upon his previous work in text
analysis and interface design methods for automatically summarizing and
visualizing large volumes of e-mail, to develop an interface and search engine
for deliberation that is designed to aid citizens to find, browse and sort
through opposing opinions. A set of "hybrid" computational methods will
incorporate both ideas and algorithms from social network analysis and corpus-
based computational linguistics, in order to support large-scale e-mail based
conversational data (like that found in high-volume newsgroups, listservs,
weblogs, etc.) to be summarized as not just social interaction, nor simply
linguistic production, but as sociolinguistic phenomenon. The PI envisions a
tool for browsing and visualizing information, more than for information
retrieval because, although users have a general information need - to discover
opposing opinions - their need is not sufficiently precise to evaluate the
technology according to the usual IR criteria of precision and recall.
Consequently, the PI will utilize a new method of evaluation for this type of
tool for democracy, according to its efficacy in reducing what in social
cognition is called "false consensus" and "pluralistic ignorance." In other
words, the PI will evaluate his tool according to whether or not it can provide
an essential platform for deliberation, a means for citizens to discover and
explore opposing and diverse opinions.

Broader Impact: There is great hope that digital technologies can help
reinvigorate the public sphere. Consequently, the outcomes of research projects
such as this one should be of interest and of use to a wide range of citizens
and citizen groups. The PI will establish a website for the project during and
after completion of the software system, and will make his tool available for
others to download and use. The users who will test the system in the evaluation
phase will be drawn from a range of academic and non-academic communities, in
order to ensure the software is accessible outside of the PI's immediate
scientific community.
