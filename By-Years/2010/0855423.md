The Compact Object Binaries and Gravitational Radiation project focuses on
computational modeling of astrophysical phenomena that enter the LIGO
sensitivity band, thus exploiting the predictive power of numerical relativity.
The effort capitalizes on both the latest advances of LIGO and its partners in
gathering data and operating at design sensitivity and on the recent revolution
in numerical relativity that has made binary black hole simulations possible.
The project consists of the following areas: (i) Enhancement of computational
infrastructure to improve performance and accuracy of black hole collision
simulations and their associated gravitational waves, (ii) binary black hole
simulations with unequal mass and spinning black holes in support of LIGO
observational efforts, and (iii) black hole and neutron star simulations to
model central engines for short gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project transforms the focus of the numerical relativity at Georgia Tech from
development to applications, with the aim of producing results that capture
broad interest and involving scientific computing that pushes the frontiers of
high performing computing. Specifically, the project further enhances the
computational infrastructure and enables the development of flexible and
reusable community tools essential to collaborative effort in support of the
detection and interpretation of gravitational wave observations.Â  In addition,
the project provides valuable sources of ideas and materials for
interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in
gravitational wave physics.
