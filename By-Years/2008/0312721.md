This research proposes to develop a semantic image database that could serve
investigations in cellular pathology within three sub domains: (1) Cancer, the
storage/detection of tumor/cellular images; (2) Cellular biology, requiring the
identification of nuclei in different stages of cellular division; and (3)
Neurobiology, quantification of cell types and neuropathological objects in
human or animal brain tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
advances and integrates two basic information technologies: iterative image
object classification and object relational knowledge base. The former is
employed to interact with domain experts to define models of object and concept,
and the latter is employed to retrieve image information based on such models in
a declarative fashion. Based on such, the research is aimed to develop a
complete set of key concepts to support semantic biological image retrieval in
neurobiology and cancer research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although semantic
retrieval of arbitrary images is, in general, a very difficult problem, specific
domains of biological images may be sufficiently constrained in contents that
one might hope to achieve semantic retrieval. The success of the proposed
research will be a demonstration of this principle and lead to the development
of many other special purpose semantic image systems. Finally, the proposed
research will introduce new requirements to the areas of object relational
database, decision support system and data mining system.
