String theory provides consistent high-energy extrapolations of theoretical
models of particle physics, as well as naturally unifying those models with
gravity, and provides tools of mathematical physics with a number of
applications in theoretical physics. One promising type of string theory model
known as F-theory has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years which points
out the need for some basic foundational studies. These studies involve a
sophisticated branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which provides the
background for constructing the physical models. The PI will determine what are
the restrictions for gauge groups and matter content for F-theory models, both
on Calabi-Yau threefolds and Calabi-Yau fourfolds; whether every elliptically-
fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold is birational to an equidimensional family, and if
not, what is the physical interpretation of the fibers of large dimension; the
structure of the base of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold; the
F-theory interpretation of Calabi-Yau manifolds which have a genus one fibration
that is not elliptic (i.e., there is no section); how the birational geometry of
the total space of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold interacts with
the choices of flux on that fourfold, and in particular, to what extent F-theory
vacua are necessarily lifted by fluxes; the M-theory dual interpretation of the
theory of T-branes; can the duality between F-theory and nongeometric heterotic
strings be extended; and other topics in Calabi-Yau geometry which may be
relevant to F-theory, including further exploration of the recent discovery that
the gauged linear sigma models which describe Calabi-Yau manifolds contain via a
partition function on S2 a wealth of information about the Calabi-Yau manifold.
Broader Impact The project will also have a broader impact through educational
activities of the PI, at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as
well as through the PI's ongoing efforts to streamline scientific communication
by making as much of it available electronically as possible.
