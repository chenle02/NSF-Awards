9726518 Raber This award is to support a study to be conducted by the National
Research Council (NRC) to review the roles of the various federal agencies in
planning, constructing, and operating facilities that provide synchrotron
radiation, neutron beams, and high magnetic field capability for the study of
materials, including biological, structural, and electronic materials. The NRC
will conduct a study through consultation with the broader scientific community
on the emerging and anticipated needs for the capabilities these facilities
offer. Representatives from the academic community ,industry, and government
will be invited to participate. The study will recommend guidelines to the
agencies based on the projected scientific and technical methods needed to
characterize materials, and the future roles of the various agencies in a
resource-limited environment. The guidelines wil consider collaboration and
coordination between the agencies in planning future facilities, and will
identify means to optimize the roles of the agencies, the states and the private
sector, to make the most effective use of their respective strengths in the
context of evolving user communities and changing national and international
resources. The estimated time for producing a report is one year from the date
of this award. This project is partially supported by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Research at the
National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National
Institute of Science and Technology, and the Department of Energy. ***
