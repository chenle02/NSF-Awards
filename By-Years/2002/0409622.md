This award will support the development and application of a geothermometer
based on the titanium-content of quartz. The thermometer will be calibrated by
equilibrating quartz with rutile and fluid at a range of pressure and
temperature conditions. Application of the thermometer will be tested by using
it to characterize the thermal history of selected igneous and metamorphic
rocks. Although the calibration assumes a TiO2 activity of one, it can be
modified to apply to systems lacking a pure TiO2 phase if Ti activity can be
estimated by some other means. Because quartz is one of the most abundant
minerals in Earth's crust, this thermometer - which has a precision roughly an
order of magnitude better than that of most geothermometers in application today
- promises to shed new light on the thermal histories of many rock types. The
thermometer should prove especially powerful when combined with imaging of
cathodoluminescence intensity, which often reveals a detailed record of growth
history, and which appears to be strongly correlated with the Ti content of
quartz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
