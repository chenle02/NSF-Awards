This project addresses the following problems: (1) there are no automated
particle-size analysis facilities in Southern New England (SNE), (2) students in
Earth & Environmental Science classes are not exposed to modern laboratory data-
collection techniques, (3) the Sedimentology Laboratory course should have a
coherent semester-long focus, and (4) more undergraduate research opportunities
are needed. This project purchases four pieces of equipment to establish a
modern sedimentological facility for teaching and research in a central SNE
location and develops a focused sedimentology laboratory course. Letters
describing the new facility are sent to all schools with earth science/geology
departments within a 150-mile radius, and a focused laboratory course with new
laboratory exercises is developed. Undergraduate students doing research in
sedimentology at the university are primarily women and minorities, both of
which are currently underrepresented in the earth sciences. Researchers from SNE
have access to a new generation of particle-size analyzer and through it the
opportunity to investigate paleoenvironmental changes. Students have more hands-
on exposure to data collection, analysis, and problem solving.
