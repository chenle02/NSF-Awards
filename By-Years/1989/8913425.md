This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Non-linear Dispersive Wave Systems". This conference will be held at
the University of Central Florida in December, 1990. This field has recently
been spurred by developments of practical necessity in many areas of science and
engineering, and new ideas have surfaced, giving it yet further impetus. These
include fruitful use of algebraic techniques, the extension of Benjamin's
stability theory, more reliance on Hamiltonian formulations, the use of
computational techniques as an investigative tool, and the new perturbation
theories for integrable systems. Professor Benjamin will present a unified
mathematical treatment of the classical aspects of the field, as well as new
results on hydrodynamic stability and instability.
