The objectives of this research focus on the development of optional operating
policies for feeding batch cultures of bacilli to produce metabolic products.
Three ;itBacillus;ro species which produce important enzyme products are to be
studied as model systems. The specific goals are to develop modeling for a
variety of induction-repression phenomena, to develop optimal operating policies
based on trajectory optimization techniques using a variety of measures of
bioreactor performance, and to verify and implement the optimal operating
policies using a highly instrumented computer-controlled fermentor.
