Students with an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math careers
find transitions from high school to community college to four year degree
programs to be particularly challenging. Early college and dual-credit programs
in high school can support students in successfully transitioning to college-
level work. The Expanding Career and Educational Learning in Information
Technology (EXCEL-IT) project will prepare for college-level work over 900 high
school students in a diverse and economically-challenged area of Washington
State. The project will involve dual-enrollment IT courses taught in high
schools by trained, certified, and well-supported instructors using a hybrid
online/classroom structure. Students will be able to earn both high school and
college credit, as well as take free certification exams for industry-recognized
credentials. This project will contribute to the development of a 2+2+2 STEM
degree pathway, with support from the Washington State Board for Community and
Technical Colleges. The goal of the project is to directly address the growing
shortage of qualified IT professionals and generate useful data and practices
for high schools and colleges to recruit and prepare a larger and more diverse
body of students for IT careers.
