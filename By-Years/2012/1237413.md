This grant will provides partial support for American postdoctoral, graduate,
and advanced undergraduate students to participate in the third Graduate Summer
Institute on Complex Plasmas, an international educational workshop which will
be held from July 30th to August 8th, 2012 at Seton Hall University in South
Orange, New Jersey. The project objective of this summer school is the
educational dissemination of the current knowledge of this new field, the
advancement of the current scientific challenges, and the promotion of the
potential technological opportunities afforded by complex plasmas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas
will focus on dusty and strongly coupled plasmas, reactive plasmas,
microplasmas, quantum plasmas, and plasmas in contact with surfaces. The summer
school will provide a broad overview yet rigorous curriculum that will lead to
further advancement in this emerging field by attracting young American
researchers in significant numbers since they will encounter scientific
challenges as well as technological opportunities upon which they can build
successful academic or industrial careers. A further benefit of this program is
that complex plasma applications appear to be a potentially very fertile field
for small, high-tech start-up companies which will perceive this subject as a
favorable innovation source for marketplace realization of new plasma
technologies.
