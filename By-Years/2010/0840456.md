This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor
Carol A. Fierke from the University of Michigan and colleagues Adam J. Matzger,
John Montgomery, Vincent L. Pecoraro and Melanie S. Sanford will acquire a
single crystal X-ray diffractometer with a strong copper source to obtain high-
resolution structural information in diverse fields including synthetic organic
chemistry, materials science and inorganic chemistry. This instrument will
support education and research in complexes from metallacrowns producing soft
materials; determination of absolute and relative stereochemistry of molecules
important in catalytic reactions; in synthesis and characterization of
biological properties of fluorinated proteins; in mechanistic studies of late
metal complexes with high oxidation states; and in metal-organic
frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.
