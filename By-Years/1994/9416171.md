9416171 Murray Numerous reports of fractures in beam flange-to-column flange
welds in steel moment resisting frames after the Northridge earthquake suggest
the need for a new connection configuration. No reports of end-plate moment
connection distress or failure are known. In this project the endplate and all-
bolted moment connections will be studied to develop an alternate to field
welded connections. Because both of these connection types require tension bolts
and the associated problems with prying forces, a shim plate is placed opposite
the beam tension flange or the tee-stub tension web. Using the shim ensures that
the bolt tension will not increase until separation of the end-plate or tee stub
flange and the column flange occurs. If the design is such that the pretension
force is sufficient to develop the strength of the connected beam, in effect the
connection is tested at the time the bolts are tightened. The project consists
of three tasks: Task I is a survey to determine if end-plate or all-bolted
moment connections exhibited distress or failure because of the Northridge
earthquake. Task II is the development of a design procedure for shimmed end-
plate and all-bolted moment connections, which is a relatively uncomplicated
procedure because the effects of prying forces do not need to be considered.
Task III is a set of four verification tests, two for each connection type. One
test in each set will be designed so the connection is the controlling limit
state and the second so the beam is controlling limit state. Successful
completion of the proposed research will result in a steel beam-to-column moment
connection which does not require welding but with sufficient strength to resist
large forces from seismic events. This is a Northridge Earthquake project. ***
