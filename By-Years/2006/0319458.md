The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean Studies Board (OSB) of the
Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources will continue providing
guidance on major ocean science and policy issues to the National Science
Foundation and other government agencies. The Ocean Studies Board monitors the
status and needs of ocean science community and assists NSF in developing and
maintaining strong programs of ocean research responsive to scientific
opportunities and national interests. OSB will: 1) contribute to the advancement
of scientific understanding of the ocean by maintaining continuous oversight of
the health of ocean sciences and stimulating their progress; 2) foster the
application of scientific knowledge to the use of the ocean and its resources;
3)provide leadership for the formulation of national and international marine
policy and to clarify scientific issues that affect ocean policy; and 4)address
scientific issues involved in cooperative international oceanographic research,
and to improve technical assistance. The OSB also serves as the U.S. National
Committee for the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). In this role,
it assists in the development of U.S. positions on international ocean-related
questions. Several other agencies also contribute to these activities and
provide support for focused studies undertaken by the OSB
