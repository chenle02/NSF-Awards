This research is aimed at developing a better understanding of ion beam-
assisted deposition to produce useful coatings on metal alloys. Of particular
interest are the effects of several process variables on the mechanical behavior
of the coated materials. Film morphology, composition, and geometry are
controlled to optimize film properties. Emphasis is on improved fracture
toughness while maintaining oxidation resistance by creating alternating oxide
(alumina) and metal (aluminum) layers. Mechanical properties are determined by
the ultra-low load indentation method, tensile testing, four-point bending, and
indentation-fracture techniques. The structure of the microlaminates is
correlated with the processing parameters and mechanical properties.
