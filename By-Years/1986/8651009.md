To assist the Department of Biology to more fully develop laboratories in
Cellular and Molecular Biology, NSF is providing funds for the addition of an
ultracentrifuge with three rotors. A major trend in biology today is the
understanding of biological phenomena in these two areas. This equipment enables
students in the Cell Biology course to perform sophisticated experiments dealing
with the isolation of cellular organelles and DNA. The addition of an
ultracentrifuge to the equipment already available in the laboratories through
the combined efforts of the State of Michigan and two major industrial firms in
the community allows students in the Molecular Biology course to do all of the
critical techniques involved in the area of genetic engineering.
