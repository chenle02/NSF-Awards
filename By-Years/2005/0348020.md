The proposed project addresses several challenging issues in multi-object
tracking such as failure modes, occlusion, background clutter, varying object
appearance, multi-object confusion, and high computational complexity. This
project will investigate five key elements in multi-object tracking including
(1) a trajectory tracking framework, (2) a joint multi-object representation,
(3) image-based likelihood functions, (4) the integration of object detection in
tracking, and (5) the compact and efficient discriminative feature tracking.
Based on recent preliminary results, it is expected that significant
improvements in multi-object tracking will be achieved by integrating these
elements into the proposed probabilistic estimation framework. An experimental
system for tracking multiple pedestrians and vehicles will be implemented for
testing the developed algorithms. The proposed educational program will focus on
developing graduate and undergraduate courses in the area of computer vision,
establishing an active research laboratory in visual computing and human-
computer interaction, and promoting collaboration with the industry to offer
students the opportunities to work on real-world research problems. Success of
this project will provide a novel solution to the multi-object tracking problem
and significantly advance the state-of-the-art. The proposed project is expected
to have broader impacts in the areas of video surveillance, human-computer
interaction, and intelligent teleconferencing. The proposed research will also
have an impact on establishing an educational program in computer vision at the
University of California, Santa Cr
