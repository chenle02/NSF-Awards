This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
innovative low-cost W-band (70-80 GHz) single chip transceiver using the
metamorphic wafer technology developed in Phase I, and efficiently integrating
the various MMIC components. The low cost non-electronic beam FET processes, MM
HEMTs, and initial chip designs developed in Phase I will be used for the
development of the fully integrated transceiver in Phase II. The resulting new
technology will enable the MMW industry to be cost effective to expand the
commercial market to achieve the low cost and high performance required in the
industry.

This project will enable enhanced performance and low cost consumer compatible
volume production of automotive collusion avoidance radar systems, MMW tracking
systems, and security radar and detection systems.
