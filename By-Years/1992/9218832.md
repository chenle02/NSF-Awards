The focus of this work is the development of synthetic routes towards the
production of macrocyclic depsipeptides of plant origin. Specific goals are the
optimized syntheses of a number of 14-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids containing
beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids. The targets are mauritine A,, sanjoinine A,
integerrenine and hymenocardine. The structural issues of conformation and
metal-complexation in these natural products will be addressed also. %%% With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Madeleine M. Joullie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Pennsylvania. Professor Joullie will focus her work on the synthesis of a class
of natural products known as cyclopeptide alkaloids. The difficulty in isolating
the compounds in quantity, from natural sources, makes the work desirable.
