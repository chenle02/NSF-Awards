With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Program,
Professor Donald Darensbourg of Texas A&amp;M University plans studies of carbon
dioxide-transition metal organometallic chemistry in five related area: 1)
mechanism and scope of decarboxylation reactions of carboxylic acids, 2)
reactivity of low valent metal alkoxides and aryloxides toward carbon dioxide
insertion, 3) copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides, 4) carbon dioxide
chemistry in aqueous solution employing soluble organometallic reagents, and 5)
photochemical activation of metal carbon bonds toward reaction with carbon
dioxide. In all cases emphasis is placed on the development of a mechanistic
understanding of the reactions involving carbon dioxide. Techniques to be
employed in these mechanistic studies include infrared spectroscopy under high
temperatures and pressures using a cylindrical internal reflectance cell, and
NMR spectroscopy. %%% Studies of the mechanisms of reaction of carbon dioxide
with various organometallic reagents will be undertaken with the ultimate aim of
developing methods of utilizing carbon dioxide as a carbon source for the
production of consumer products. This is especially pertinent to current
concerns of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide
constitutes more than 50%, in an economically feasible fashion.
