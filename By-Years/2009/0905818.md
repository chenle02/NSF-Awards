This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI investigates the
structure of minimal sets in topological dynamical systems and foliations that
serve as counterexamples to the Seifert Conjecture and the Modified Seifert
Conjecture. The interesting properties of these minimal sets are the topological
dimension, the Hausdorff dimension, isolation, and Czech homology in relation to
shape theory. Dynamics is also employed in work on problems in discrete and
computational geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems impact other
areas of science. The study of minimal sets is an extension of the study of
fixed points and attractors. The theory has application to biology, population
research, and economy, in addition to the traditional Science Technology
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The geometry problems studied by the
PI have applications to medical imaging.
