The Psychology Department emphasizes research and has a required three course
research sequence. The ten PC-AT computers currently on hand do not have the
software or hardware to update this research sequence. Therefore, the students
do not have an adequate exposure to the development and completion of
contemporary research. With equipment in this award, these PC computers are
linked in a network which makes it practical to use experimentally oriented
software. In addition to the network, hardware and software is being purchased
that a) simulates theoretical models and typical research results, b) runs the
students in classic and contemporary experiments, and c) allows students to use
these computers for stimulus presentation, data collection and analysis for
their own independent research projects. Additional course materials are being
developed locally. Results of this project will be presented at professional
meetings and published to encourage other departments to extend their use of
computers into undergraduate instruction. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
