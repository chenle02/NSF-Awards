The conference "Non-Archimedean Geometry and its Applications" will be held at
the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, during the period June 1-5, 2015. It will
feature talks by world experts, encourage new collaborations, and serve as an
excellent opportunity for junior participants to learn and meet experts in the
mathematical field of non-Archimedean geometry. The senior speakers have been
chosen on the basis of their research credentials, but also for being superior
expositors with a dedication to the development of younger generations of
researchers and teachers in mathematics. There will also be several junior
speakers, and an opportunity for Ph.D. students and postdocs to present their
work in a poster session. A strong effort will be made to have a diverse group
of speakers and participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been numerous
recent advances in non-Archimedean geometry, and these techniques have also seen
new and sometimes unexpected applications. In order to make these developments
known to a larger mathematical audience, the conference "Non-Archimedean
Geometry and its Applications" will be held during the period June 1-5, 2015 at
the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It will bring together leading experts in
various fields where non-Archimedean geometry or analysis play an important
role, and establish connections between these fields. Among the themes
represented at the conference will be Berkovich spaces, tropical geometry,
dynamical systems, and p-adic Hodge theory.
