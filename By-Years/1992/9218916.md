This award provides one-half the funding required for the acquisition of high-
resolution, shallow seismic reflection equipment to be operated by the
Department of Geological Sciences at the State University of New York in
Binghamton. SUNY-Binghamton is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed. The equipment will serve as a tool to provide images of near- surface
geologic structures for research projects including the investigation of 3-d
site effects for seismic hazard estimation, evaluation of the role of the
seismographic station's "receiver function" when modeling seismic waveforms for
earthquake source determinations or earth structure investigations, mapping of
buried faults, mapping traces of buried river deposits, and mapping of aquifers.
