We are changing the Introductory Physics Laboratory from "standard fare" to a
tutorial course with new experiments that emphasize the physics concepts and
principles of, and are given in synchronism with the concurrent lecture course.
In the past, the first phase of our change covered mechanics. New apparatus was
developed at Northeastern which is now used at many colleges and universities,
and available commercially. We are now in the second phase, the electromagnetic
cycle of experiments. Lack of suitable, commercially available apparatus is a
known serious problem in this part of the curriculum. This is especially true
for such important concepts as Ampere's and Faraday's laws. New robust yet
transparent experiments are in various stages of design, prototyping, or student
testing. Support from the NSF is being used to incorporate them fully into our
curriculum and make them available to the physics community. In addition, some
equipment support is being used to fully satisfy the tutorial character of the
new courses.
