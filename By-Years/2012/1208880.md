Howard University is one of only 48 U.S. private, Doctoral/Research-Extensive
universities and one of the premier Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) in the country. The submission of their institutional transformation
proposal comes at a very propitious time in their history as over 50% of their
faculty are retiring in the next five years leaving a huge need for STEM hiring
that could be truly transformative. Howard has a strong history of advancing
Women of Color, especially STEM women, into administrative positions. Their
activities center around three goals- broad stakeholder education, changes
related to institutional and individual advocacy, and individual empowerment
through training and opportunity. Howard University presents NSF with an
important opportunity to expand our knowledge of institutional transformation at
HBCUs and this proposal is uniquely designed to do this through the national
archive on the scholarship of women of color in STEM (e.g., leadership,
professional experiences, and accomplishments), their basic data collection and
evaluation efforts, and the proposed social science research. The social science
research is a strong, theoretically-based, mixed-method approach to
understanding women in STEM, and specifically URM women in STEM which should
contribute meaningfully to the literature.
