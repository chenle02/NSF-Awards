The proposal focuses on designing and building the NSF Middleware Initiative
(NMI), and will be one of two System Integrators as well as playing a Service
Provider role. The NMI program will expedite the development of middleware
functions and services to support the national research and scientific
community, and will also accelerate the deployment and use of new and emerging
applications across the Internet. The purpose of the NMI program is to enable
members of the advanced networking community to collaborate in developing and
assembling common network services and resources (middleware) to optimize the
network for applications and to share limited resources for the common good of
all users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCAID, along with its EDUCAUSE and SURA
partners, will help define, develop and deploy the NMI and will integrate across
three different streams of developing middleware applications and initiatives;
one stream is the middleware being developed and deployed by the GRIDS community
and the GRIDS Center, another stream is the set of middleware initiative being
worked on by the Internet2 community of research institutions and universities,
and a third stream is middleware which is being developed by independent
researchers and communities.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the deployment
and support of this middleware architecture, and in particular is a focused
outreach to the larger academic communities. While the other two Cooperative
Agreements primarily focus on GRID technologies and then work with the larger
academic and research community, this proposal focuses on the campus
infrastructure, discipline and desktop and then works with the GRID
technologies, among others. In order for middleware to be successful to the
broad education and research community, it must specifically
address;&lt;br/&gt;a) Integration with campus infrastructure: core middleware
services (such as identifiers, basic directory services, and first levels of
authentication and authorization) are typical activities that will be supplied
by the campus infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;b) Integration with vertical discipline-
oriented applications and middleware; such as workbenches and tool sets and
application portals. &lt;br/&gt;c) Integration at the desktop (i.e., operating
systems, user interface, personal production tools), &lt;br/&gt;d) coordinate
its activities and efforts with the other two partners of the NMI&lt;br/&gt;e)
Integrate with the components of the developing high performance and GRID
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
