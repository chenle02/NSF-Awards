The Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University will expand it PC
network and add a UNIX base workstation to the network. The present PC
configuration which runs McIDAS software has proven to be a useful tool for
interactive display of meteorological data, but this system is inadequate to
meet the teaching and research goals of the department. This award will augment
Creighton's present network which consists of IBM Models 80 and 70. Funds to
purchase three new 486-based PC will be awarded. In addition, a UNIX-based
workstation will be awarded. The workstation will greatly enhance the capability
with the addition of a workstation to run several meteorological software
packages which are not available on PC hardware. This new equipment will become
a vital tool in many of Creighton's classes which expose students to computer-
based meteorological displays. The additional equipment also will expand
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate research.
