This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel low-voltage periodic poling technique for creating highly
efficient quasi-phase matched waveguides in nonlinear optical materials. The key
innovation of the proposed technology is the use of co-planar micro-comb
electrodes to periodically pole waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical
material such as potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). Periodically poled
waveguides will enable highly efficient, quasi-phase matched (QPM), nonlinear
optical frequency conversion of continuous wave and low peak power quasi-
continuous radiation. The proposed technique will allow multiple waveguides with
different QPM gratings to be fabricated onto a single device, thereby building
in wavelength flexibility as well as reducing cost. The anticipated benefits of
low-voltage poling are waveguides with significantly improved conversion
efficiency, low scattering loss, and increased manufacturing
yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in
the areas of bioanalytical instrumentation (such as medical diagnostics, flow
cytometers and medical imagers) and telecommunications.
