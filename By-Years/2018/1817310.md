The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Synthetic Biology course is a two-week
long immersion course designed to introduce scientists to the field of synthetic
biology. It provides intensive instruction in synthetic biology methods,
combining practical lectures, open-ended research projects, and seminars from
leaders in the field. Through practical lectures, research projects and
seminars, participants will be exposed to cutting-edge synthetic biology methods
to provide them with a solid understanding of the challenges and opportunities
available in the field of synthetic biology. The course attracts advanced PhD
students, junior faculty, and researchers working at national labs and in
industry. It serves scientists from a broad range of backgrounds, including
biologists, physicists, and engineers from the US and around the world that are
looking to transition into synthetic biology research and disseminate synthetic
biology ideas and skillsets at their home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
course provides a critical training opportunity for scientists looking to
transition to the field of synthetic biology by offering a unique, immersive
learning opportunity. Equally important, the course is proving to be a training
ground for course instructors and teaching assistants, who learn invaluable
teaching and community organizational skills, and earn recognition from leaders
in the field as the emerging next generation next generation of synthetic
biology leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
