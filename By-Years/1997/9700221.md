This project will develop and evaluate a new joining method for composites. The
research plan will involve both experimental and analytical research. As part of
the development and evaluation of the new joining method, analytical procedures
will be developed to model several different joint configurations. These models
will be used to optimize joint designs. Experimental tests will be performed to
validate the analytical models. Current joining methods also will be tested and
compared to the results of the new method. Guidelines for bonding joints using
the new method will be suggested.
