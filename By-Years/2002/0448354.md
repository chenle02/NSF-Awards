This CAREER proposal aims to realize quantum simulation by integrating existing
techniques and new technologies into atomic gas Bose-Einstein condensation
experiments. By employing ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice,
quantum simulation will be used to study physics relevant to materials,
technology, and fundamental science that cannot be completely understood using
traditional computational techniques or available experimental methods. Three
key experimental ingredients are required for achieving quantum simulation using
atoms trapped in an optical lattice: preparing a well-defined initial state with
one atom at each lattice site, manipulating the atomic spin in a spatially
dependent fashion, and controlling the interaction between neighboring atoms in
the lattice. Initial studies will focus on harnessing these tools to simulate
the behavior of interacting many-body quantum systems that are not entirely
understood, such as models of magnetism important to fundamental physics,
materials science, statistical genetics, and models of cardiac function. The
educational component will be centered on the development of a undergraduate
course entitled "Physics of Gadgets" that will be part of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Discovery Program.
