This proposal centers around two main directions in representation theory, and
proposes to develop homotopical methods. The representation theory of finite
groups has been driven in a large part by the conjectures of Alperin and Brou'e
in the last twenty years. The proposal will bring new topological directions in
the area, and new conjectures. The basic idea is to replace actions on vector
spaces by actions on topological spaces. Higher representation theory, the study
of actions of a given monoidal category on categories, is a much more recent
area of research. It has been developed mostly in relation with Kac-Moody
algebras. A recent construction is that of tensor structures. Our proposal will
bring homotopical methods in the theory. It aims also at bringing higher
representation theory in the area of geometers working on counting invariants
and topologists working on invariants of four-manifolds, in the continuation of
Khovanov.

The project will bring new topological insight in algebra, and in particular in
representation theory, the study of symmetries. A major problem is to understand
global symmetries from local symmetries. We will approach and recast this within
a wider topological setting. The project will also produce methods to build
objects in algebra, as a counterpart of the classical constructions of spaces in
geometry as families or "moduli spaces". This should lead to an understanding
through algebra of some properties of three and four-dimensional geometry.
