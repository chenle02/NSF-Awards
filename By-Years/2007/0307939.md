The University of Oregon, Eugene, is producing "Absolute Zero and the Conquest
of Cold," a three-hour television documentary series about the field of low-
temperature physics, the field in which one-third of all physicists are working
today. The series explores key concepts, significant individuals and events in
the field's turbulent history, and the enormous impact that the mastery of cold
has had on society through technologies such as air-conditioning, refrigeration
and liquefied gases. The film, based in large part on Tom Shachtman's book of
the same name, will document how four centuries of research into lower
temperatures has produced stunning scientific insights and applications that
have revolutionized the world we live in. Planned outreach includes public
programs, museum activities, and an interactive web site.

The PI's for the project are Russell Donnelly of the University of Oregon,
Richard Hudson of Twin Cites Public Television, and Meredith Burch of
Meridian/Windfall Productions, Inc. Other key staff members include Thomas
Shachtman, author of the book upon which the series is based; David Dugan, Co-
Producer/Director of Windfall Films; David Heil of David Heil and Associates;
Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research; and Irene Goodman, of Goodman Research
Group.
