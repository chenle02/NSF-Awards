Abstract 9631051 Stith Fertilization involves a series of membrane lipid fusion
events, however the role of lipids as intercellular signals during the process
of fertilization is largely unexplored. The PI has shown that sperm increases
the amount of inositol -1,4,5-triphosphate in the Xenopus egg, produced by the
action of phospholipase C. the Pi has evidence that phospholipase D also plays a
role in fertilization. Choline, the product of this enzyme, increases at
fertilization, and an inhibitor of the enzyme inhibits fertilization. The
experiments in this grant will pursue studies on the action of phospholipase D
in various fertilization events. This research will increase knowledge of the
changes in lipids that occur during fertilization. ***
