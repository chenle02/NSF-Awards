This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Peter T. Wolczanski of Cornell University to study the
mechanism and thermodynamics of olefin-alkylidine rearrangements catalyzed by
niobium and tantalum complexes with tris-tertbutyl silicon oxide (silox)
ligands. The sulfur analog of silox will be used to explore the secondary
structures of linked manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel tetrahedra to explore
bio-inspired organometallic chemistry. Electronic factors involving oxygen-atom
transfer are to be explored with silox-rhenium-oxo derivatives. The fundamental
coordination and organometallic chemistry of square planar tungsten(IV) silox
derivatives will be investigated for reactivity parallels with d8 complexes in
oxidative addition reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reactions of organometallic
complexes with silicon-based ligands will be studied to address fundamental
questions as to how these reactions proceed.&lt;br/&gt;
