This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "The effect of winter variability on biodiversity and
community dynamics: analysis of long-term lake data." Strong contrast between
winter and summer abiotic conditions annually provides distinctly different
habitat within one location, promoting biodiversity. To determine effects of
reducing this environmental heterogeneity, this research uses multispecies
autoregressive analysis (MARs) to analyze complex seasonal community
transitions, discerning biotic pathways through which winter conditions affect
both summer and winter communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
