Magnetic techniques such as magnetic anisotropy offer the promise of providing
an efficient means of measuring finite strain in deformed rocks. However due to
several factors the methods are not presently robust. This project will
investigate the mineralogical control of magnetic anisotropy by use of the
Thompson formation of northern Minnesota. Results are expected to demonstrate
the compositional effects of deformed sedimentary rocks on various magnetic
properties, with the goal of developing a reliable tool for measuring strain.
