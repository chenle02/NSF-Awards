9410751 Miller This project is on research to develop improved bioreactors for
hematopoietic cell culture. This will involve an examination of how flow
patterns and transport characteristics within perfused flat-bed reactors
influence cell metabolic requirements. The four specific objectives of this
research are: (1) to characterize the metabolic requirements of hematopoietic
cells; (2) to enhance the productivity of current bioreactors by improving the
design for enhanced transport, cell seeding, and cell feeding rate; (3) to
evaluate alternative bioreactor designs, including stirred cultures and hollow
fiber cultures; and (4) to scale up the most promising system for clinical
trails. ***
