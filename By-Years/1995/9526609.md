9526609 Salters The research will investigate which of the two processes that
explains the high 176Hf/177Hf at Salt Lake Crater, Hawaii, is the most
plausible. In addition to the Hf and Nd isotope analyses, the P.I. will analyze
the mineral phases of the peridotites for their trace element content. The P.I.
intends to either use existing data or otherwise obtain full major and trace
element analyses on all the xenoliths. The specific peridotite samples that are
proposed to be analyzed include: set of Hawaiian anhydrous spinel lherzolites,
including LREE depleted xenoliths; continental peridotites from Kilbourne Hole,
Potrillo Maar, San Carlos, and the Colorado Plateau; the P.I. will also try to
initiate a study on the peridotites from the southern part of the Siberian
Plateau, Vitim and Bartoy localities; in collaboration with E. Hauri and J.
Natland the P.I&gt; will analyze peridotites from the Austral Island and the
Marquesas. In Addition the P.I. will analyze a limited number of MORB for either
Pb or Hf to determine whether a correlation exist between Hf and Pb isotopes in
MORB. Obtaining the above analyses should increase our knowledge of the space
and time relationships between the different components within the mantle.
