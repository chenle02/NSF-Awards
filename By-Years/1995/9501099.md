9501099 Bao The goal of this proposal is to develop analytic techniques and
computational methods for solving inverse and optimal design problems in
diffractive optics and wave propagation. The main topics of the proposed work
are as follows: stability analysis for inverse scattering problems in
diffractive optics, optimal surface design problems, direct modeling of
scattering and diffraction in complicated nonlinear optical materials, study of
surface enhanced nonlinear optical effects, and regularity analysis of inverse
problems in several dimensional wave propagation. Diffractive optics is an
emerging technology with many applications. The practical applications of
diffractive optics technology have driven the need for both rigorous
mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe the diffraction of
complicated grating structures, to compute the electromagnetic vector fields and
to predict the performance of any given structure, and to carry out optimal
design of new structures. The theory and algorithms help, for example, with the
design and fabrication of new and efficient gratings and optical lenses. The
work concerning inverse problems in wave propagation can be used to deduce the
interior mechanical properties of the earth from the measured boundary data
generated by an energy source. This problem arises naturally from reflection
seismology, oil and gas exploration, ground-penetrating radar, and many other
physical problems.
