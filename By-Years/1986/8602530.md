The need for more accurate modeling of microstrip discontinuity structures has
become increasingly apparent with the advent of monolithic microwave integrated
circuits (MMICs), as well as the push to higher and higher millimeter-wave
frequencies. The proposed research is aimed at tackling this problem through a
theoretical and experimental study at the University of Michigan which will be
augmented by collaboration with the Torrance Research Center of Hughes Aircraft
Company. The proposed theoretical approach involves an accurate computation of
the current distribution along the microstrip conductors using the method of
moments. Based on the current distribution, a frequency dependent equivalent
circuit model is derived for the discontinuity. These numerical results are to
be compared with S-parameter measurements using automatic network analyzer
equipment in conjunction with an appropriate de-embedding technique in the
frequency range from 2 to 40 GHz.
