9622373 Schadler This Research Equipment Grant will be utilized by the
Department of Materials Engineering at Drexel University to upgrade an existing
Micro Raman Spectrometer (MRS). the upgraded MRS will be used for current
projects on micromechanical behavior of graphite/epoxy composites, developing
MRS to measure three dimensional states of stress and to study toughening of
biocompatible bone implant materials for potential prosthesis applications. The
potential for a breakthrough in understanding of interfacial phenomena is
promising. The capability for measuring, interfacial stress, strain and three
dimensional stress in fiber composites is important in understanding
micromechanisms of failure of fiber composites under loading. The equipment will
also be used by other investigators interested in diamond films. Because MRS is
an unique technique for measuring the mechanical behavior of two phase systems
the results obtained can used to test micromechanical models which require the
data that can obtained from this technique for verification and refinement. ***
