The questions the proposer addresses in her research are the following: given a
dispersive equation, how much regularity does one have to assume for the initial
profile (initial data) in order to be able to insure existence and uniqueness of
the wave solution at later times? What are the conditions on the initial profile
that guarantee ``a long life'' for the wave? And if the wave does ``live'' for a
long time, which of its initial properties are preserved? A satisfactory
analysis of these phenomena requires answering questions on long time existence
and uniqueness for the solution of the associated Cauchy problem, as well as
regularity properties of the solution. It requires also analyzing continuity
with respect to the initial profiles, possible blow-up of some energies in
finite time, and rate of blow-up. A mathematically rigorous approach to the
questions of long time existence and blow-up is very difficult. Certainly
numerical methods provide a guide for theoretical results. But it is believed
that the analytic techniques available at the moment are not fine enough to
recover the predictions of the numerical work. The techniques that proposer uses
are purely analytical. The tools that she employs have been recently developed
in the general area of Fourier Analysis and Harmonic Analysis. As the tools are
new, the investigation is more likely to produce truly novel results. These
methods may bring new insights into well studied theoretical and empirical
issues.

The proposer main field of interest is Partial Differential Equations. In
particular, she concentrates her research on Dispersive nonlinear PDEs, so
called because their solutions tend to be waves which spread out spatially. Two
well known equations belong to this class: the Schrodinger equation and the
Korteweg-de-Vries equation. These equations and their combinations with the wave
equation, have been proposed as models for many basic wave phenomena in Physics.
Examples of these phenomena are: the propagations of signals in optic fibers,
nonlinear ionic-sonic waves in plasma in magnetic field and long waves in
plasma.
