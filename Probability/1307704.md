This research is in the area of random matrices. The proposal focuses on two
aspects of this domain: (i) Analysis of the topological expansions. It was shown
in the seventies that matrix integrals can be viewed as generating functions for
the enumeration of maps, that is connected graphs which are sorted by their
genus, where the dimension plays the role of genus parameter. This is the so-
called topological expansion. They were first used in physics as a clever way to
enumerate maps. It then became an apparatus to find invariants in many different
fields. On a different point of view, the limit of random matrices is well
described by free probability. Hence, free probability is useful to analyze
topological expansions and conversely topological expansions and random matrices
can be used to construct new concepts in free probability, with consequences in
operator algebra. The first part of the proposal addresses several questions in
this direction. One of the goals consists in developing a general mathematical
scheme to obtain topological expansions. Another one is to use random matrices
and classical probability theory to develop the theory of optimal transport in
free probability, hence proving isomorphisms results in operator algebra.
(ii)The second part of the proposal concerns the study of the universality
classes of random matrices. In fact, after the recent breakthroughs exploring
the universality class of Gaussian matrices, it is natural to study matrices
which are definitely out of this class. The proposal offers to study heavy
tailed matrices, and more precisely localization/delocalization of their
eigenvectors as well as local fluctuations of the eigenvalues in the bulk.

This research is in the area of random matrices, which are connected with many
domains of mathematics and physics, for instance as a large (random) array of
data, as the approximation of operators such as the Hamiltonian of large
physical systems, or more exotically via the non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann
zeta function. The project focuses on its applications to operator algebra,
combinatorics and physics.
