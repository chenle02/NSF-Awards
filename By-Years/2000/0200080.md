This project investigates the areas of harmonic analysis and&lt;br/&gt;wavelets
concerning the mathematical theory of multi-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional wavelet
expansions. One of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems of the subject is how to
construct higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;wavelet bases with desired
characteristics, e.g., wavelets with&lt;br/&gt;good time-frequency properties.
These areas of research have&lt;br/&gt;seen significant progress due to the
contributions of I.&lt;br/&gt;Daubechies, R. Coifman, and Y. Meyer, along with
many others.&lt;br/&gt;However, the majority of research has been concentrated
on&lt;br/&gt;isotropic theory, leaving many questions involving
non-&lt;br/&gt;isotropic wavelet theory unanswered. The proposer
will&lt;br/&gt;investigate this theory of non-isotropic wavelets from
three&lt;br/&gt;directions. The first is to study non-isotropic analogues
of&lt;br/&gt;the standard function spaces associated with expansive
dilations.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, to examine characterization by wavelet
expansions&lt;br/&gt;of Calderon-Zygmund operators associated with non-
isotropic&lt;br/&gt;dilations. The second is to construct orthogonal wavelets
with&lt;br/&gt;good time-frequency localization for large classes of
non-&lt;br/&gt;isotropic expansive dilations. The third is to identify
non-&lt;br/&gt;isotropic expansive dilations for which the construction
of&lt;br/&gt;well-localized wavelets is impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
generally, this proposal represents work on wavelet&lt;br/&gt;analysis which is
a powerful technique in harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;This technique has produced
wide-ranging applications to signal&lt;br/&gt;and image processing, such as the
JPEG 2000 image compression&lt;br/&gt;system. It is expected that further
research on multi-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional non-isotropic wavelets will continue to
produce many&lt;br/&gt;other contributions in pure and applied mathematics.
