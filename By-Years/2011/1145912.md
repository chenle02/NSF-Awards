In this RAPID project, the Principal Investigators will examine the effects of
trauma from the violence of war on risk aversion and other economic attitudes by
conducting economic experiments in Afghanistan. The team has preliminary results
showing that Afghans who live near a bombing site, when primed to recall a
fearful event, are willing to pay far more for certainty in an economic trade-
off than is predicted by mainstream economic theory. This project will extend
this work to examine the effects of trauma on all of the "Big 5" core factors
that significantly shape economic behavior: tolerance for risk, patience and
time discounting, social preferences, competitive propensity, and strategic
sophistication. These changes in economic attitude can turn individuals away
from otherwise beneficial economic opportunities and, society-wide, harm
prospects for recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this
research will reveal how exposure to violence can dramatically influence many
aspects of an individual's economic decision making. The project will also
attempt to demonstrate the potential for simple economic instruments to act as
diagnostic tools for economists and policy makers to identify potentially at-
risk individuals, especially in transitional economies. While conducted with
Afghans, these experiments may shed light on the effects of trauma on anyone
exposed to violence, including members of the U.S. military and victims of
violent crime. More broadly, this work may show shifts in economic attitudes
that can have implications for the development and economic growth prospects of
war-torn societies.
