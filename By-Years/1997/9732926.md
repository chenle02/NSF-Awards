This is a 12 month field study focusing on the dynamic relations between adult
males and immature white-faced capuchin monkeys living in highly seasonal,
tropical dry forests of Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. The objectives are
to explore the range of affiliative behaviors that take place between adult
males and immatures, to identify the morphological and behavioral factors that
draw the attention of young to the adult males and vice versa, and to determine
the effects immatures have on the social interactions with adult males. In
addition to the observational behavioral data, fecal samples will be collected
from known individuals for subsequent DNA analysis to determine paternal
relations. Studies of the genesis and nature of social relations between
immature and adult male nonhuman primates are important for the development of
theories regarding male parental care, social development, and affiliative
interactions that serve to bond group members.
