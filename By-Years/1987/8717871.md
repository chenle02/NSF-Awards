This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for work by
Dr. Glen A. Russell, Iowa State University, focused on the one-electron
reduction or oxidation of neutral radicals in chain and non-chain processes. The
work extends to the application of free radical chain processes involving
alkylmercury halides with the primary objective of developing selective additive
alkylation processes for electron-poor and electron-rich substituted alkenes. It
is believed that such alkenes, which yield adduct radicals that can be
classified as acceptor or donor species, can be induced to participate in chain
reactions by electron transfer between the adduct radicals and added donor
acceptor molecules or ions. The added donor or acceptor molecule or ion will be
chosen so that electron transfer yields a new radical or radical ion capable of
rapidly reacting with the alkylmercury halide to regenerate an alkyl radical.
The study also involves physical organic studies on the reactivity of alkyl
radicals, particularly towards unsaturated systems, and includes new studies
concerning the regiochemistry of radical attack, the stereoselectivity of
radical addition and the stereospecificity of radical substitution occurring by
an addition-elimination sequence. This data will be applied in a diagnostic
fashion to establish or eliminate the presence of radical processes in reactions
of other organometallic tert-butylating agents.
