The cloud is becoming increasingly integral to our daily lives, the business
ecosystem, and society at large. Recently, cutting-edge cryptosystems have been
developed that provide the first-ever theoretical solutions to many cloud-
related tasks. Such tasks include fine-grained access control to encrypted data,
broadcasting to a set of recipients with minimal communication overhead, hiding
secrets in public code, and much more. Unfortunately, these recent systems are
far from being ready for deployment, due both to significant computational
inefficiencies and to new and thus little-understood underlying computational
assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is bringing cutting-edge
cryptographic applications closer to practice by improving the efficiency and
security of said applications. A particular focus is program obfuscation, a
powerful new tool at the heart of many of the recent theoretical advances in
cryptography. This project develops new constructions and security analyses for
obfuscation and other related cryptographic tools, yielding more efficient
protocols and increasing our confidence in their security. In addition,
education is integral to this project, as the PI develops new cryptography
courses and advises undergraduates and graduate students alike in order to
cultivate the next generation of scholars and practitioners.
