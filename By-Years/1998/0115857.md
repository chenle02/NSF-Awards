With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will acquire a tunable solid-
state laser system for applications in atmospheric chemistry, aerosol analysis,
process monitoring and reaction dynamics. This equipment will be utilized in the
following applications: a) laser-based probes of heterogeneous atmospheric
chemistry; b) single particle mass spectrometry in real-time; c) real-time
analysis of CO in fuel cell engines; d) reaction dynamics and spectroscopy of
metal ion-molecule clusters; and e) photochemistry and spectroscopy of
charge/proton-transfer complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A laser
provides a directed beam of coherent monochromatic visible or infrared light,
which enables researchers to obtain with unprecedented detail, important
information about fast chemical reactions and/or the structure of molecules. Its
use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive
and nonreactive molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of
areas such as atmospheric chemistry and combustion chemistry.
