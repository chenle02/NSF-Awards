9303817 Moog Richard S. Moog is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform condensed phase spectroscopic
studies. Two lines of research will be pursued. The first study will compare the
rotational reorientation of Coumarin 102 dye in non-polar decalin with the
reorientation lifetime in fluorinated alcohols to see what the effects of
hydrogen bonding are on the reorientation times. The second study will examine
the photoinduced double proton transfer reaction of hydrogen bonded
1-azacarbazole : alcohol complexes in alcohol solutions and in dilute aprotic
solvents. Most of the work will employ time resolved fluorescence measurements.
%%% The physical and chemical properties of solutes are profoundly influenced by
the solution environment. The influence of solvent on chemical reactions and the
dynamical processes which occur in solution have been widely investigated. This
research has shown that, rather than providing an inert and static medium in
which physical and chemical processes occur, the solvent often plays an active
and crucial role in these processes. The investigvations to be performed by Moog
will be specifically directed at understanding the role which intermolecular
hydrogen bonding plays in solute reactivity and dynamics in solution. ***
