This project will investigate how, when and why open source collaborative
software development projects succeed or fail. Open source software runs the
Internet, dominates the web server market and competes successfully in operating
systems and even applications markets. This success is remarkable given the
major communication and coordination problems that typically plague other forms
of geographically distributed collaboration. But despite the visible successes
of open source, it is also true that most projects fail. This project will
conduct theory-driven empirical studies of coordination, social networks, and
outcomes. The first step will be to replicate studies of commercial software
development projects to determine if coordination in open source follows the
same processes, or if it is fundamentally different. The next step will be to
perform comparisons of open source and commercial developments to see if the
theoretically-predicted differences are observed. Next, a computational model of
open source software development will be constructed. Model predictions will be
validated against actual observations. Finally, field experiments will be
conducted to make specific coordination improvements in selected open source
projects.
