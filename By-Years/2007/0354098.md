The REU program at the Texas A&amp;M University Cyclotron Institute focuses
entirely on research in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry. Students in the
program will have the opportunity to work closely with internationally renowned
scientists at a major university-based nuclear
facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will gain research experience by
carrying out specific projects under the direct supervision of Physics/Chemistry
faculty at the Cyclotron Institute. Weekly discussions on forefront areas of
Nuclear Physics/Nuclear Chemistry will be led by Institute faculty. Students
will have the opportunity to share their work via an oral presentation and
virtual poster session near the end of the program. Students of all ethnic
backgrounds and types of undergraduate institutions are encouraged to apply.
