This Conference on Ethics in Engineering Education, scheduled for June 1990,
takes advantage of recent interest and advances in course development, research
and professional society initiatives. The conference will gather 20
participants, representing engineering and engineering ethics educators,
practicing engineers, and engineering societies. In discussions stimulated by
prepared presentations as well as prior distribution of short reports of
relevant work, participants will aim to identify and examine the core concepts
and skills which students should develop from their exposure to engineering
ethics. Conference participants would also aim to identify effective techniques
and the expertise teachers need to communicate these concepts and skills. The
conference will generate a report for all deans of engineering schools and
directors of engineering programs. This project focuses on important and timely
issues in ethics and undergraduate engineering education. The investigator and
participants are highly qualified; the institutional sponsor is appropriate; the
results are likely to be of wide interest and broadly disseminated. The project
is strongly recommended for an award.
