The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
is to create a wearable sensor that monitors ovulation hormones to aid
conception. The end product will make fertility tracking and treatment more
convenient, accessible and affordable to the 7.5 million American couples
currently struggling to grow their families. Patients undergoing infertility
treatments typically have to visit a fertility clinic 3-8 times during a single
ovulation cycle to assess circulating reproductive hormone levels in the blood.
These frequent clinic visits create high costs and a burden, decreasing overall
access to infertility care. This project will develop an affordable, accurate,
at-home fertility-monitoring solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes research towards the
development of a low-cost ovulation monitoring wearable to accurately track
reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle. The proposed low-cost,
wearable device will capture hormone peaks in real time. This project will
demonstrate that the proposed technology can continuously monitor reproductive
hormones and that the data generated of equivalent quality and accuracy compared
to standard blood draws. Furthermore, the proposed research will validate the
deviceâ€™s ability to function over multiple days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
