Some RNA plant viruses become associated with RNAs termed "small satellite
RNAs". The ca. 360 nucleotide residue satellite RNA of tobacco of tobacco
ringspot virus (STobRV RNA) is not a messenger RNA, and it has no extensive
nucleotide sequence homology with its supporting virus, tobacco ringspot virus
(TobRV), as detected by hybridization analysis. Nevertheless, STobRV RNA
replicates in TobRV infected plants where it reduces TobRV accumulation and
symptom severity and becomes encapsidated in TobRV coat protein. Multimeric and
circular forms of STobRV RNA found in infected tissues are likely replication
intermediates. The goals of this study are to develop electroporation procedures
to infect plant cell protoplasts with TobRV and STobRV and to study the
mechanism of replication of the satellite RNA in protoplasts. These studies will
allow elucidation of the interactions and relationships between the genomic and
satellite RNAs in this system and will enable these relationships in protoplasts
to be compared with those of intact plants.
