9616441 Dev, Pravati Stanford University Design-Based Learning of Vertebrate
Biology, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Virtual Creatures Stanford
University has been awarded $215,498 for a one-year planning grant to help
integrate pre-college education implementation and research questions and
strategies with an ambitious program of developing advanced computer-based tools
for teaching biology at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Prior efforts to
create interactive virtual creatures have restricted interaction to viewing
selected structures. This project will develop and evaluate for their
educational efficacy a small library of transitional creatures that will allow
virtual dissection and other simulated physical manipulations on a personal
computer.
