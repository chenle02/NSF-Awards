ABSTRACT CTS-9700210 Funding is requested for a high-speed infrared camera and a
high-speed visible wavelength camera to conduct thermal and visual observations
of transport phenomena in various experiments. The equipment will be used to
study thermal processing of molten glass, active temperature control in
semiconductor manufacturing, heat release in turbulent diffusion flames, and the
response of tissue to light and heat. A total of eight investigators will be
sharing the equipment.
