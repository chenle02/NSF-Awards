Studies are proposed of a single electron, isolated from all matter by
suspending it in the electric and magnetic fields of a Penning trap. The central
idea is to observe, study and use the relativistic mass increase at energies
below one electron volt. This mass increase will be used to probe the quantum
structure of the cyclotron motion of the isolated electrons. A fractional
resolution of 10E-9 is required in measurements of the cyclotron frequency. This
will permit more precise measurements of the magnetic moment of the electron and
positron, which would provide the most stringest test of quantum electrodynamics
and test CPT invariance. The interaction of the cyclotron oscillator with the
surrounding microwave cavity changes the radiation rate but may also shift the
cyclotron frequency; these effects will be studied in a Penning trap with three
cylindrical electrodes and two flat end plates. Ways to exploit the relativistic
nonlinearity will be investigated.
