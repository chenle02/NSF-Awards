Materials are being developed for an innovative course in mathematical
applications as a modern replacement for existing precalculus and related
courses. The course is an introduction to mathematical models at the precalculus
level and provides students with the skills and knowledge needed for calculus.
The models developed in the course are primarily based on discrete mathematical
topics such as difference equations, data analysis, probability, and matrix
algebra. The course involves computer and/or graphing calculator work to
investigate most of the mathematical models. It also involves a variety of live
classroom experiments to investigate how well the mathematical models reflect
actual processes or to help develop mathematical models based on observed
experimental data. The course features a series of student investigations to
provide a real- life dimension. It is designed to provide students with the
motivation and impetus to continue on in mathematically related fields by
exposing them to the wide applicability of mathematics.
