&lt;br/&gt;SGER: SALT: Molecular Computing with Regular
Crystals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will investigate a massively parallel three-dimensional computing
architecture implementing a new family of cellular automata called Salt.
Transitions in the automata are governed by a 6-cycle state update process that
alternates between two disjoint sets of cells in a regular lattice. It may be
possible to construct such a regular crystal lattice structure at a molecular
scale resulting in unprecedented density and parallelism. The physics and
topology of such systems are suited for solving problems such as computational
fluid dynamics and protein folding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
work we will investigate computational models that exploit the Salt
architecture, and conduct preliminary analysis of the engineering feasibility of
Salt models at the physical level. Long-term efforts are directed towards
nanoscale construction of these devices and identifying suitable programming
models for Salt hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
