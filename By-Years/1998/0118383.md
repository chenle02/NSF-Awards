A long-standing controversy in mid-ocean ridge dynamics is whether upwelling
beneath fast spreading ridges is sheet-like with a relatively uniform magma
supply along axis, or more three-dimensional with diapiric-like upwelling near
segment centers and lateral redistribution of melt along axis at shallow magma
chamber levels and/or by lower crustal, ductile flow. The UNDERSHOOT experiment
was designed to address this problem by mapping the pattern of magma delivery
from the mantle to the crust along the entire length of a transform bounded
segment of the East Pacific Rise between the Siqueiros and Clipperton fracture
zones. The quality of the data are the important issues that remain warrant
further analyses. Models of crustal thickness will be refined by employing
improved algorithms that allow all data collected in the experiment to be
modeled simultaneously. Understanding of the properties of the Moho transition
and uppermost mantle will be improved. Improved models of along axis variations
in the structure of the mantle and lower crust low velocity zones will be
developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
