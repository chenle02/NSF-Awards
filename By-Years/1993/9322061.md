9322061 Harmony University of Kansas Dr. Marlin D. Harmony and other members of
the Chemistry Department of the University of Kansas are being supported to
continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For
the period 1994-6, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer
actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the
traditional areas of chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic and physical in
addition to bioorganic, biophysical and bioanalytical in collaboration with the
University's Center for Bioanalytical Research. The primary source of the
students will be students from small colleges in the region that are lacking in
research facilities.
