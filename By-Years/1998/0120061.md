Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this renewal proposal, Dr. Klewicki plans to
carry out further experimental investigations on the effect large Reynolds
number on the cross-stream transport in a turbulent boundary layer. Even though
much has been learned form the experiments carried out under the current Grant
CTS-9905526, better understanding of such transport mechanisms can be obtained
when the experimental parameter range is extended, and additional transport
terms measured. The experiments will be carried out in a wind tunnel and in an
environmental test facility in the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah. In the
current Grant, 3 undergraduate students participated in the experimental work
through the REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
