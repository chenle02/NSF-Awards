This project will result in the upgrading of the rare gas mass spectrometry
laboratory in the Department of Marine Geology and Geophysics at the University
of Miami. The upgrade will allow the measurement of xenon and krypton isotopes
to be made with sufficient precision to carry out research projects aimed at
investigating the abundances of these isotopes in rocks with a mantle signature.
The abundances of these isotopes in mantle- derived samples (e.g., in mid-ocean
ridge basalts) holds important clues about the timing of the degassing of the
Earth, the resultant formation of the atmosphere, and the present structure and
evolution of the mantle.
