9505351 Cook The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Carolyn D. Cook to work with Mr. Mateus
Kilmaskossu at Cenderawasih in Irian Jaya, Indonesia. The goal of this project
is to plan and do research towards developing the potential of indigenous
Pandanus agroforestry with the Amung-me people of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. They
will conduct background research providing the basis for this development which
will promote biodiversity while creating a sustainable enterprise. These people
have no sources of income but desire to enter a new market system in their
province. They lack the skills and education to mine at the nearby mining
company. These two elements make them ripe to learn a new area of specialization
which could raise their self esteem, plus allow them to make a living. This
project aims to establish a network of communication and exchange of knowledge
among faculty and students of Cenderawasih University, the Amung-me, government
officials, non-government organizations, future researchers and beyond. ***
