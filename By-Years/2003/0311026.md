Vahid&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0322026&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;eBlocks: Embedded Systems
Building Blocks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a set of building
blocks that can be used by people,&lt;br/&gt;having no special training, to
build simple but useful embedded&lt;br/&gt;computing systems. The types of
systems are those that monitor switches&lt;br/&gt;and sensors (motion, light,
temperature, etc.) and control basic outputs,&lt;br/&gt;like lights, buzzers,
electric relays, and simple actuators. The project&lt;br/&gt;defines an
intuitive set of eBlocks, incorporates compute intelligence into
&lt;br/&gt;previously passive sensors and outputs, defines the communication
and&lt;br/&gt;coordination protocols between eblocks, and develops methods to
assist&lt;br/&gt;people in creating and configuring eBlock systems. The result
is a set of&lt;br/&gt;eBlocks that can be connected into systems by nearly
anybody to perform&lt;br/&gt;useful tasks. Example systems include detecting a
garage door left open at&lt;br/&gt;night, notifying a deaf person of noise,
turning on a fan after a certain&lt;br/&gt;temperature is reached in a
scientific experiment, finding commonly lost&lt;br/&gt;items, and tallying votes
anonymously in a classroom or meeting.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts not only
involve improved control over home, office, &lt;br/&gt;store, school, and other
environments, but also the improved support of &lt;br/&gt;research in a
diversity of other scientific disciplines relying on sensors&lt;br/&gt;and
control, as well as use in design courses in colleges and high schools.
