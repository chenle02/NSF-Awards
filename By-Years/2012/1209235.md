The UC Davis ADVANCE program utilizes a four-pronged approach to increasing the
participation and advancement of women in the STEM fields. This approach
includes: establishment of a Center for Advancing Multi-Cultural Perspectives on
Science (CAMPOS), implementation of programs to reduce the impact of unconscious
bias, empowerment of STEM women faculty, and a rigorous social science research
and evaluation program that is designed to both inform and assess the innovative
approach being utilized to create and sustain an inclusive STEM environment.
Underlying this multi-faceted approach is a keen focus on the recruitment,
retention and advancement of Latina STEM faculty and the development of a STEM
workforce that more closely resembles the region. To that end, it is expected
that this project will provide much-needed nuance to the understanding of how
race, ethnicity and cultural differences interact with personal, familial,
institutional, mentorship, and network influences to impact the attractiveness
of the academic career path and the professional trajectories of Latina STEM
faculty. Given the vast network of UC campuses and innovative dissemination
methods, the ADVANCE program at UC Davis will seminally impact the region and
other universities nationwide. As such, UC Davis will drive institutional change
toward gender equity in numerous institutions of higher education, while
promoting the career success of underrepresented STEM faculty and enhancing the
potential of academic science through the inclusion of previously
underrepresented perspectives.
