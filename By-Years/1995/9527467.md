9527467 KNOX The Research Vessel NEW HORIZON, owned by the University of
California, San Diego, is operated primarily in support of NSF funded
oceanographic research. The ship requires a mid-life refit to ensure continued
productive service throughout her planned service life. Placed in service in
1978, the ship has operated in excess of 17 years. This project will support
improvements and upgrades to the vessel in the following areas: Resolution of
long term stability restrictions, Replacement and overhaul of obsolete or
deteriorated equipment, machinery and systems necessary to ensure reliable
operations, Upgrades of science equipment and support systems to allow conduct
of increasingly complex missions, and Habitability enhancements. The project is
under the direction of Dr. Robert A. Knox, Associate Director, Ship Operations
and Marine Technical Support and Captain Thomas S. Althouse, Marine
Superintendent, Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ***
