PROJECT SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biology and Excellence for Science
Teachers (BEST) program is an expansion of a &lt;br/&gt;NSF -PSFMETE funded
program, Engaging Students in Ecological Research, a pilot program that was
launched in Summer 2000 by Dr. Lidia Yoshida. The BEST program is a teacher
development program designed to improve the biological science curriculum in
urban underrepresented schools. The goals are to improve science teachers'
knowledge-base and update them in content, techniques and issues in science, to
train teachers in the use of computers to prepare lessons for their classes and
to further facilitate communication &lt;br/&gt;between science teachers within
Los Angeles and Orange County through the Internet and ongoing science
educational program activities. Workshops will be offered during the academic
year with lectures and inquiry-based laboratories topics such as genetics,
molecular biology, ecology, evolution and techniques in investigation and
experimentation to high school and intermediate school teachers. Teachers will
develop interactive lessons with laptop computers in the laboratory and will the
have the opportunity to &lt;br/&gt;borrow the computers and LCD projectors for
use in their classrooms. These lessons will be made available on-line where a
website will be maintained for participants to share program information,
resources and laboratory activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
