This project will support strategic planning by the Rocky Mountain Biological
Laboratory (RMBL). RMBL is a private, non-profit research institution that has
hosted 142 scientists in the last five years. Funding will allow Rocky Mountain
Biological Laboratory's Planning Committee, consisting of four board members and
the Executive Director, to visit larger, independent research institutions to
explore how other research institutions manage operational revenue streams,
fundraising, government contracts, marketing, branding, and endowment. The
committee will also explore how organizations use metrics to track institutional
effectiveness. The committee will provide a report to RMBL's Board as part of
setting priorities for RMBL's strategic planning and developing a financial plan
for RMBL that increases our ability to support research and research
training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of creating RMBL's next strategic plan, a
planning committee will visit a number of other independent research
institutions to better understand their funding models, examining fundraising,
branding/marketing, operational revenue streams, and branding and marketing.
Additionally, we will father information on how these institutions use metrics
to track performance. A written summary of the findings will be made through the
Organization of Biological Field Stations so that other similar institutions
will have access to the information. For more information about the Rocky
Mountain Biological Lab, see their website at http://www. rmbl.org.
