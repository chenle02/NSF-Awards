The 2016 Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang 2016) will be held
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. CoLang brings together leading
practitioners of language documentation from across the world to provide
cutting-edge training in language documentation techniques and collaborative
practices. Over a period of five weeks, including two weeks of workshops
followed by three-week, in-depth field methods classes, participants engage in
hands-on training in best practices in linguistic field research. Uniquely,
CoLang focuses on collaborative documentation, engaging specialists from within
language communities of underrepresented groups with academicians in knowledge
sharing. All participants learn and teach, providing formal instruction via
workshops or practicum teaching, participating in classes that take them out of
their familiar areas and challenge them to engage with cultures and material new
to them, and by networking with their colleagues around the world. In this way,
CoLang builds a growing network of language workers who support each other in
developing valid and sustainable approaches to language documentation.
