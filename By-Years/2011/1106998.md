The project concerns theoretical study of mathematical models of large random
networks, with a focus on the following two settings. Certain observed features
of the U.S. road network are consistent with it being approximately scale-
invariant over scales of 5 - 500 miles. It is proposed to study mathematical
properties of models that are exactly scale-invariant. Such study raises new
foundational and substantive issues. Second, there is great current interest in
information flow in social networks. Relevant abstract mathematical models are
similar to models previously studied in many different scientific and
engineering contexts (epidemics; broadcasting in computer networks; interacting
particles in statistical physics). It is proposed to delineate a particular
broad class (``Finite Markov Information Exchange") of such models, record what
is already known about them, and formulate and investigate many new questions.
The formulation of questions is guided by analogy with the well understood
theory surrounding mixing times for finite Markov chains.

At the research level, broader impacts envisaged from this research are
facilitating the spread of techniques between different research communities and
providing additional tools for the design, analysis and empirical investigation
of large networks. At the postgraduate training level the second topic provides
a fertile field of open problems and varying apparent difficulty, whose study
will expose the student to a broad range of techniques. Both topics also fit
well with the principal investigator's activities in undergraduate teaching (a
"probability and the real world" course) and supervising undergraduate research
projects.
