Why do some species introductions fail and some succeed? Answers to this
question are critically important to the fields of ecology, invasive species
biology, ecological restoration and biological control. While larger numbers of
propagules (e.g. seeds or eggs) are known to increase colonization success, how
much of this effect is due to propagule number alone or to the greater genetic
diversity usually contained within larger colonizing populations remains a
puzzle. This project will experimentally decouple genetic diversity from
propagule number to test whether genetically diverse colonizing populations are
more likely to succeed than genetically depauperate ones. Using the model plant,
Arabidopsis, the investigators will manipulate both genetic diversity and seed
number in natural environments. The study will significantly advance our
understanding of the basic ecological principles governing colonization events
and provide valuable insights for controlling weedy and invasive species. It
will also inform ecological restoration and biological control efforts, which
require decisions about how many individuals and genotypes to introduce. It will
provide training for one early-career postdoctoral researcher and six
undergraduate research assistants; many of the undergraduates will be recruited
from underrepresented groups in the sciences. Lastly, this project will be used
in teaching modules that will be developed and implemented in partnership with a
Houston public high school and then made freely available to other educators
online.
