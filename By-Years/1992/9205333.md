This research is concerned with developing inorganic monolayer by incorporating
arrays of inorganic ions and complexes into monolayer assemblies formed by
Langmuir-Blodgett and self-assembly techniques. Organized organic monolayers
will be used as templates for forming inorganic layers. Three classes of
inorganic layers are explored: layered alkylammonium metal halides, metal
halides prepared on organic host, and layered metal phosphonates and phosphates.
The new materials will be characterized structurally, and an investigation of
their magnetic properties in two dimensions will be conducted. The proposed work
has an ultimate potential for developing high-density, reversible magnetic
recording media.
