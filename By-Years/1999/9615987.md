Phase II project will develop zinc gallate (ZnGa2O4) as a thin-film phosphor and
produce full color faceplates by selective ion implantation of luminescence
centers. Field emission displays (FEDs) based on cathodoluminescent phosphors
are promising alternatives to active matrix liquid crystal displays; however,
conventional sulfide-based powder phosphors compromise FED performance due to
their granular nature, current-saturation characteristics, and limited operating
lifetime. Replacing powdered phosphors with sulfur-free, thin film oxide
materials can improve chromaticity, allow much finer definition, and increase
phosphor lifetime, while reducing manufacturing costs. Phase I demonstrated
bright red and green cathodoluminescence (CL) in sputter-deposited ZnGa2O4 which
was ion implanted with europium and manganese; and bright blue CL was found from
"self-activated" (Ga-rich) zinc gallate films. Phase II will optimize phosphor
preparation, ion implantation and annealing, and increase external luminous
efficiency by minimizing light-guiding in the thin-film phosphor. Organometallic
chemical vapor deposition of ZnGa2O4 will be compared to sputter-deposition of
the thin film phosphor host. A wider range of activator and co-activator ions
and annealing schedules will be investigated. Multi-colmr phosphor faceplates
will be fabricated and demonstrated in an operating FED device. Flat, field
emission displays with high luminance, wide color gamut, high electrical
efficiency, and long operating life will find applications in computer
terminals, lap-top computers, instrument panels, navigational aids, and consumer
electronics from cellular telephones to television sets.
