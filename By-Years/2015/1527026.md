Primary user networks provide wireless coverage over a large area by using
multiple geographically separated transmitters operating on licensed frequency
bands. On the other hand, cognitive radios are opportunistic users of unoccupied
spectrum. In order to coexist with the transmitters in its vicinity, they need
to sense the spectrum, i.e., detect the primary users' transmissions, and avoid
causing them interference. This project focuses on the dynamic spectrum access
in the presence of primary networks that are cellular, have anisotropic
antennas, or employ frequency reuse, and aims to significantly increase the
range of spectrum that cognitive radios can use. Through higher-layer radio
scene analysis we aim to maximize the cognitive radio network throughput by
increasing the detected spatial resolution and utilization of spectrum holes.
This combination of increased spectrum and geographical spread makes large-scale
cognitive radio networks a viable candidate for implementing smart grids,
environmental networks, and traffic sensors. For defense purposes, the learned
primary network topology provides unprecedented information about commonly
deployed communication networks.

This project research is based on development of cooperative algorithms for the
identification of spectrum holes and classification of primary network activity
by geographically large-scale cognitive radio networks. A novelty of the
proposed methods is that they will not rely on knowledge of the channel
propagation models or the location of the radios. This blind nature of the
algorithms allows for more diverse applications. Instead of geographical
vicinity, correlations in the received signals will be used for distinguishing
between primary transmitters and learning the shape of their footprints. For the
case that footprints of two or more transmitters overlap, message passing based
cooperative spectrum sensing methods will be formulated for the joint estimation
of the multiple transmitters spectrum occupancy. The learned footprint and the
detected spectrum occupancy will be used to analyze the primary user activity
over time. Primary users that are part of the same infrastructure-based primary
networks will be identified. Further, learning their traffic statistics will
enable the classification of their channel access methods and protocols.
