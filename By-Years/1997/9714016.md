Professor Clifford Dykstra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the analysis of
dynamical features of weakly bound complexes. Ab initio electronic structure
calculations are used for evaluating the intrinsic electrical response
properties of molecules. The results of these calculations are incorporated into
a molecular mechanics model for clusters which can then be used to predict
molecular structures of larger clusters. A new feature of this work is the
incorporation of diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methodology to improve the
predictions of dynamical properties. The primary goal of the work is a detailed,
fundamental understanding of weak interactions, including transferable
potentials, electronic structure changes, and dynamical manifestations. Weak
molecular interactions are important in problems ranging from molecular
clustering, certain surface phenomena, nonlinear optical response of
aggregations, aspects of protein structure, and drug design. This work is aimed
at achieving reliable predictive capability for structures and energetics of
weak clusters, and for the changes in properties of systems which experience
weak inter- and intramolecular interactions such as hydrogen-bonding.
