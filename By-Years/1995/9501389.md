ABSTRACT Cristoph Beckerman University of Iowa CTS-9501389 This work is a
combined numerical analysis with experimental validation of the effects of
convection on grain structure development and the distribution of alloying
elements during dendritic solidification of metals. A numerical model will be
developed and its predictions compared with high resolution time-dependent
experimental measurements during the solidification of transparent and metallic
alloys. The work will potentially point out improvements in casting technology.
