In this Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the PI will use remote sensing
observations along with laboratory and field measurements to determine if
peatland fires, and the associated nitrogen emissions, might fertilize nearby
high-latitude soils resulting in an enhancement of microbial production of
nitrogen oxides. These northern high-latitude soils are the largest reservoir of
soil organic matter on the planet, and ongoing disruptions due to wildfire and
other climatic changes could result in a substantial release of greenhouse gases
and reactive gases such as nitrogen oxides, which are the focus of this work.
The new knowledge gained during this project could enhance our understanding of
an understudied and potentially substantial source of soil nitrogen emissions,
which will be beneficial to atmospheric chemistry and climate research
communities, as well as the broader public.

The specific tasks include: (1) using satellite remote sensing data to document
trends and emissions of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide from high-latitude
fires and soils; (2) conduct laboratory soil chamber experiments to quantify in-
situ emissions from burning peatland soils; (3) deploy a network of nitrogen
oxides analyzers to compare ambient nitrogen oxides concentrations nearby both
burned and pristine soils; (4) combine these data with forward modeling in order
to compare to satellite columns; and (5) conduct additional laboratory
experiments to determine physical and chemical controls of soil nitrogen oxides.
The end result will provide emission factors of nitrogen oxides from fires and
soils in high-latitude land masses and will provide information that might
explain the nitrogen oxides anomaly observed after peatland fires. The PI plans
on joining and enhancing the Polar Science Early Career Community Office and
mentoring an undergraduate student during the course of this project.
