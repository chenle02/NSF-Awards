The goal of this project is to increase the number of highly qualified and
capable students who are able to complete degrees in STEM majors by providing
approximately 20 need-based scholarships at Bowling Green State University,
Owens Community College, and Terra Community College. A variety of student
support programs are designed, such as a 5-week summer bridge for entering
students to prepare them for the rigors of college science and math courses; a
tiered system of mentoring by peers and faculty; learning communities with
monthly events that draw students and faculty together by merging academics and
social networking; undergraduate research; and support and promotion of graduate
and professional studies after completion of a baccalaureate degree. This
project increases the graduation rate in mathematics and science of economically
disadvantaged students and of under-represented women and ethnic minority
students.
