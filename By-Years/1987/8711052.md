This action would provide continued support for a group of physicists at the
University of Massachusetts. In collaboration with others, they are using
accelerator facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Fermilab to
pursue a series of experiments in elementary particle physics. The purpose is to
study the properties of particles containing the heavier quarks as constituents.
Central to the program at both Fermilab (E690) and Brookhaven (E766) is a
technique solving the problems of precision measurement of complex events at
high speed. The method couples a magnetic particle detector with a hardware data
processor capable of analyzing 10**5 events per second.
