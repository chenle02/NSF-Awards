The National shortage of American engineers and engineering students has placed
the United States at risk - technologically and competitively. The objective of
this project is to encourage capable high school students to elect a career in
engineering by exposing them to the many exciting facets of the engineering
profession. The program targets the entire nation giving special emphasis to
underrepresented groups such as minorities, the disabled, and women. The program
covers all engineering fields but focuses on electrical and mechanical
engineering. During the two-week long intensive program students are immersed in
engineering activities. The participate in active discussions on the engineering
career, on professional ethics, view engineers at work at an industrial firm and
a governmental agency, learn how to use the computer as the engineer's
preeminent tool, and practice engineering analysis and design using the
engineering method. The Academy period provides added dimension to the program
by allowing extra help for those needing it, honors work for the truly gifted
and one-on-one career counseling for. Significant follow-up activities continue
to provide motivation and guidance for the participants until they have been
accepted in an engineering program. The results of this program can serve as a
national template for others to use.
