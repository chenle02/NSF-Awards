This award to the University of New Orleans is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the National Science Foundation's Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) Program. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed
to acquire an X-ray diffractometer system that will be installed and operated in
the University's Department of Geology & Geophysics. The University is committed
to providing the other half required to purchase the equipment. The equipment
will significantly enhance the research and student training capabilities of the
department and will be used in a series of ongoing projects involving faculty
and student research. These projects include diagenetic studies of clastic and
carbonate rocks, laboratory simulations of diagenetic chemical reactions,
characterizations of fine-grained, deep-sea sediments and factors affecting
their behavior, provenance studies of Mississippi River sediment,
characterization of minerals in pegmatites, and structural geology studies in
Alaska.
