With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Karen Emmorey will conduct three
years of psycholinguistic research on the the perception and production of
American Sign Language (ASL). This project includes the first experiments using
head-mounted eye tracking technology to study eye behaviors of signers. One set
of studies will investigate the social and conversational functions of eye gaze
during sign perception. Deaf signing dyads and hearing speaking dyads will be
compared to identify perceptual, linguistic, and social demands on eye gaze for
signed versus spoken language interactions. A second set of studies will
investigate eye movements during sign production. These studies address the
grammatical functions of eye gaze in ASL and identify how signers co-ordinate
their eye movements with the linguistic structure of signed sentences. Tthe
project will also compare the eye behaviors of native deaf signers with adult
late learners (hearing and deaf) during sign perception and production.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of signed languages is essential to an
understanding of the nature of human language universals and variation. It is
also significant for the development of second language programs that train sign
language interpreters, as well as instructors for deaf education programs. The
use of eye gaze to mark linguistic structure is unique to signed languages, and
the results of this project will provide insight into how language modality can
affect grammatical encoding. The project will also identify how second language
learners must alter their eye gaze patterns during both sign language perception
and production. Finally, deafness has a substantial impact on the ability of
students to gain access to academic and scientific careers, and this project
aims to promote the participation of deaf people in research by supporting a
deaf graduate student and providing a research environment accessible to deaf
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
