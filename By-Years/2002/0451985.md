This proposal requests funding to support organize a symposium on "Mechanical
Behavior of Biological and Bio-Inspired Materials" at the Materials Research
Society Fall 2004 meeting. The goal of this symposium is to start a dialogue and
potential collaborations between modelers and experimentalists of mechanical
behavior in bioinspired and biological materials.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:
Biological, and bio-inspired materials have complex architectures that require
advanced experimental techniques for measurement of mechanical properties and
also due to their structural hierarchy, often need new multiscale modeling
methods. This symposium will enhance interactions and collaborations between
modelers and experimentalists working on mechanical behavior in bioinspired and
biological materials.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This is the first time a
symposium is organized at MRS that is focused on mechanical response in
biological and bioinspired materials. This symposium will bring together two
distinct and important communities in materials science that often remain
separated. The impact of these interactions, have far reaching consequences in
many fields, especially the biomedical and also structural composites fields.
