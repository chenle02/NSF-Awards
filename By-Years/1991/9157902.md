This is an award to support research by this Presidential Young Investigator
(PYI) on physical and chemical mechanisms that affect migration of synthetic
organic chemicals in groundwater and the fate of these contaminants when the
water is extracted from subsurface aquifers and subjected to water treatment
processes. This project involves investigation of the extent and rate of organic
contaminant uptake by natural solids found in soils and determination of the
controlling mechanisms. This is the initial, base-level award for this PYI.
Results of this research are likely to be applied in engineering design of
processes and systems for decontamination of soil contaminated by organic
chemicals from accidental spills or by substances leaching from disposal sites
for hazardous wastes. The results may also be applied in engineering design of
treatment processes for removal of organic contaminants from water.
