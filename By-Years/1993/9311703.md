9311703 Staiger With the use and abuse of antidumping law now a central concern
of both multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, it is especially
important to gain as full an understanding as possible of the impact of existing
antidumping laws on the free flow of trade. In this project, the determinants
and the effects of antidumping investigations in the United States over the
period 1980-1985 are examined. Rather than focusing primarily on antidumping
duties alone, this research considers antidumping law more broadly, paying
particular attention to the on-going investigation effects of antidumping
procedures on imports and domestic output, and to whether such effects could be
sufficiently important to encourage filing of petitions that, absent these
effects, would not be worth pursuing. The project includes these broader aspects
of antidumping law in an effort both to assess more accurately the determinants
and the effects of antidumping petitions as well as to evaluate several
hypotheses suggested by recent theoretical work on antidumping law. A novel
aspect of this research will be to disentangle the effects on imports and
domestic output of the various phases of the antidumping investigation process
along the lines suggested by recent economic theory. ***
