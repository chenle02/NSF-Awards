Studies will be made of the nature and strength of chemical bonding in compounds
of transition metals with p-block elements with focus on trends in isoelectronic
series of compounds. The research program includes measurement of thermodynamic
stabilities, and bond strengths, by mass-loss effusion, effusion- mass
spectrometry, and high temperature solid-state galvanic cells, x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopic studies of both core levels and valence-conduction
band regions, and band structure calculations by both KKR and Extended Huckel
methods. The goals are to deepen the understanding of bonding in solids,
especially in relation to bond strength and structure, obtain high quality data
on thermodynamic stability, and develop ways of predicting stabilities which
take into account the best insights available about the nature of chemical
bonding.
