This proposal seeks funds to support a collaborative petrologic, structural,
chemical, and isotopic investigation of the growth and development of
continental crust as recorded in rocks of the middle crust (roughly 125-25 km).
The middle crust is a dynamic environment through which Earth materials are
cycled both mechanically and chemically. Supracrustal rocks may be transported
to mid-crustal levels through tectonic processes; juvenile additions to the
crust may be emplaced from the mantle; fluid fluxes may initiate melting,
possibly to produce charnockites, or leach LIL elements; melting in the middle
crust may extract large volumes of melt through vapor-absent melting. Artifacts
of many of these processes have been recognized in two distinct blocks of
Archean crustal rocks in the northern Madison Range, SW Montana. Our integrated
study of this segment of Archean continental crust will lead to a more
comprehensive understanding of the geochemical processes that contribute to the
growth and development of continental crust, as well as to the specifics of the
tectonic and magmatic cycles controlling crustal evolution in the northern
Wyoming Province.
