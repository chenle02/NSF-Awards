The acquisition of a multi-nuclei, variable temperature Fourier transform
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer has been essential for the joined
Departments of Chemistry at the institution and the College of Mount St.
Vincent. The instrument bridges the gap between undergraduate training and
graduate research and inaugurated a new era in the teaching of chemistry to the
students. Emphasis on (13)C-NMR, using COSY, HETCOR and 2D pulse techniques is
an integral part of modern NMR spectroscopy. FT-NMR enables students to use
smaller amounts of chemicals, complementing semimicroscale procedures previously
adopted in the organic laboratory. Skills such as recording and interpreting
spectral data are complemented by the concepts learned in advanced physical,
analytical and instrumental chemistry. Research is an integral part of the
undergraduate curriculum; a high field FT-NMR is essential for modern research
in chemistry. The acquisition of such an instrument is supporting the recently
instituted program in nuclear medicine technology. The institution is
contributing to the project in an amount in excess of $7,000 over the NSF funds.
