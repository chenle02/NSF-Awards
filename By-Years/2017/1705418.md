This project will test new ideas for effective compression and heating of
plasmas via pulses of electric current channeled through the plasma. Such pulses
can create powerful electromagnetic fields which then squeeze and heat the
plasma. Instabilities can limit how much a cylinder of plasma can be squeezed by
causing the plasma to break up into clumps. This research project will test new
ideas for reducing plasma instabilities. The knowledge gained in this project
could enable more powerful x-ray generation, higher-pressure material properties
experiments, more efficient nuclear fusion generation, and a better
understanding of astrophysical processes. The project will benefit society by
advancing basic scientific knowledge, enabling future energy sources, and
improving the national defense capabilities. This project will also help to
train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in plasma science
and engineering while building stronger partnerships between academia, industry,
and national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate
the way in which cylindrical plasmas become unstable and break apart when they
are strongly compressed by a magnetic field. Two new theoretical concepts will
be tested experimentally. The first study will investigate plasma instability
when the plasma source is a cylindrical metal foil that has been vaporized and
ionized by an intense pulse of electrical current. The goal of this study is to
determine how the instability is affected by the material properties of the
metal foil. Experiments will be conducted with various foil materials, and the
results will be compared to predictions from a recently developed theory. The
second study will investigate the effect of rotating the direction of the
magnetic field lines as the plasma is compressed. A recently published theory
predicts that the cumulative instability growth should be reduced by one to two
orders of magnitude. Experiments will be conducted to test this theory.
