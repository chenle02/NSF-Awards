The Boston Area Advanced Technology Education Connections (BATEC) is a
consortium of three two-year colleges, many high schools in the Boston and
surrounding areas and the University of Massachusetts/Boston. The Regional
Center activities build upon and coordinate successful programs of the BATEC
partners to create a seamless regional IT education system that serves the
career needs of Boston area students. The NWCET standards are the reference for
refocusing IT education at all levels to align course content with industry
needs and ensure consistent, current and flexible IT education. Close
collaborations with industry ensure the currency both of the curriculum and of
the faculty knowledge. Institutional curriculum specialists use a train-the-
trainers model to expand professional development opportunities for faculty and
teachers. A dedicated e-portal provides instructors access to localized
standards, curricula, assessments and professional development resources.
Sustained outreach programs expand the capacity of the region to attract
students from diverse backgrounds to IT education and employment.
