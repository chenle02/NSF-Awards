9409681 THOMPSON This research is a series of experiments examining the ability
of people to evaluate the accuracy of hearsay evidence about out-of- court
statements by children. The project will first examine factors that affect the
accuracy of testimony by an adult witness regarding a child's statements,
focusing particularly on the effects of witness preconceptions and on the
ability of the witness to take into account the effects of suggestive techniques
used in interviewing children. Sesondly, the study will test the ability of
people to evaluate the testimony of the adult hearsay witnesses, focusing on
whether they take into account factors known to influence the reliability of
hearsay witnesses. These studies cast light on important theoretical issues
concerning the accuracy of cascaded inference in jurisprudence. They will also
have considerable practical value by illuminating the cognitive factors that
underly the ability of people to evaluate the accuracy of hearsay evidence. ***
