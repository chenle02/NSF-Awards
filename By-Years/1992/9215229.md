The interaction of laser light with atoms is investigated theoretically using
both perturbative and non-perturbative techniques. Excitation, ionization and
the generation of radiation at other than the primary wavelength are considered.
Mathematical and computational methods are developed and applied to treat the
strong coupling of laser radiation with matter and its dependence on the details
of the atomic structure.
