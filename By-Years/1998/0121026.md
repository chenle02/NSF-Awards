California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) and the University of
Southern California (USC) propose to establish a Collaborative to Integrate
Research and Education (CIRE) in the areas of controls and multimedia
technologies. Under this collaboration the collective strengths of the
Structures, Pointing and Control Engineering (SPACE) laboratory-a NASA supported
facility within the School of Engineering and Technology at Cal State LA-the
Integrated Media Systems Center, an Engineering Research Center at USC-will be
combined. The major goal of the program is to increase the number of
underrepresented minority students exposed to interdisciplinary research and
cutting-edge technologies and prepare them for future employment and advanced
degrees in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
