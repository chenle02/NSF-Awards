The objective of this project is to provide travel support for a small (5-7)
group of U.S. researchers to learn about vibration research in China and to
initiate contacts which might lead to future cooperative research. Vibration is
one of the most fundamental elements among important subjects of applied
mechanics. The visit of the U.S. team will be made on the occasion of the
International Conference on Vibration Problems in Engineering and the exhange
among researchers will be made via a cooperative seminar and visits to research
laboratories in conjunction with the conference activities.
