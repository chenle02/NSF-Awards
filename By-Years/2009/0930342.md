(Public Law 111-5).

This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is directed
toward the rapid, large-scale production of pristine nano graphene platelets
(NGPs) ? an emerging class of nano materials expected to have a revolutionary
impact on nanotechnology. NGPs exhibit exceptional properties as do carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), but can be mass-produced at much lower costs. NGPs exhibit the
highest intrinsic strength and highest thermal conductivity of the existing
materials.

Highly conductive graphene will find practical applications in nanoelectronics,
transparent and conductive coating (e.g., as a replacement for ITO glass),
supercapacitor, battery electrode, fuel cell bipolar plates, thermal interface
materials, and conductive nanocomposite. The total potential market size for
conductive nano fillers/nanocomposites is forecast to reach $5 billion ($550M
for automotive components alone) by 2013.
