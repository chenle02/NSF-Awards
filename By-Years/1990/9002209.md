Studies on the losses suffered by the Northeastern part of the island of Puerto
Rico under the forces of hurricane Hugo will be conducted by: selecting
representative structures (e.g., single- and multi-story, wood, steel, cement,
private and public buildings) for evaluation of damage sustained; carrying out
structural analysis and determining the behavior of structural elements;
disseminating the results of this study to architects, engineers, contractors,
government officials and the general public by organizing and conducting a
national conference in 1990.
