Dating the age and duration of metamorphism remains one of the most difficult
tasks to be attempted by geochronologists. Data on the length of time required
for heating and metamorphism, however, are a critical keystone for building
accurate geophysical models of processes of heat and mass transfer in the
Earth's crust. The proposed research will attempt to determine the growth rate
of garnets by measuring variations of 87Sr/86Sr in growth shells and in their
groundmass. Problems are anticipated in completing the difficult task of
precisely analyzing isotope ratios of very small samples. Furthermore, the
success of the method rests on the viability of untested assumptions regarding
the behavior of the groundmass as a homogeneous reservoir. Progress is
impossible in science unless risks are taken. In the present case, risks are
acknowledged but the potential great significance of a successful result
warrants support for a feasibility study. Successful completion of the proposed
research will lead to measurement of the rates of mineralogical reactions, rates
of devolatilization, and rates of heating. By dating garnets that were rotated
during growth, it should be possible to determine rates of strain during crustal
deformation.
