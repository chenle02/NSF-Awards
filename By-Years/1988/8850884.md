"Follow-Up to the 1985 Survey of Science and Mathematics Education" The proposed
follow-up to the 1985 national survey, to be conducted jointly by RTI and
Horizon Research, Inc., will determine the proportion of 1985 science and
mathematics teachers who are still in teaching, investigate the reasons that
others have left, and determine the likely effectiveness of various incentives
for reducing attrition in the science and mathematics teaching force. Data from
the 1985 survey will be used to determine if attrition is more extensive for
particular groups of teachers (e.g., those in urban areas, those with better
course background preparation, or those who have only a few years teaching
experience). The immediate result of this research will be a better
understanding of the extent of science and mathematics teacher attrition and the
factors, including salary levels, that affect decisions to leave teaching.
