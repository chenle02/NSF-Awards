\ P C X P# 9300910 Stone This three year project will complete the inventory of
the plants of the Philippines. In so doing, it will document the severe
reduction in plant diversity in the Philippines since the beginning of this
century less the 6% (2300 sq. miles) of the original forests remain. The
project, originally based at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, was recently
transferred to the Botanical Research Institute of Texas and closely involves
the Philippine National Herbarium, where the voucher collections of the survey
are being housed and databased. The results of the project will enable
investigators to identify similar trends in other tropical areas such as
irreversible soil changes, loss of forest dependent species and cyclical changes
in temperature and humidity. Knowledge of these trends will aid in conservation
efforts in the Philippines, where it has developed social, economic, cultural
and political partnerships. In addition to completing the survey of the entire
country, teams of investigators will sample permanent plots to estimate the
thoroughness of the survey methodology. %%% Since the beginning of this century,
the Philippines has lost over 94% of its original forests to human activity.
This study will complete a long term survey of the remaining plants of the
Philippines. Its results will enable conservation efforts in the Philippines
which the project has already aided through its social, economic, cultural and
political partnerships. One of the essential partners in this project is the
Philippine National Herbarium, where the voucher collections of the survey are
being housed and databased. ***
