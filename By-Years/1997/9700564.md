Kleiman 9700564 This project is concerned with free resolutions related to
monomial ideals and toric varieties. It is in the interface between commutative
algebra, algebraic geometry and combinatorics. The goal of the project is to
build minimal free resolutions in some special cases, construct non-minimal
structured resolutions, and obtain bounds on Betti numbers. Some of the problems
are closely related to Groebner basis theory and integer programming. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
