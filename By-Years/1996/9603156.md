This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research on anisotropic
particle suspension. It involves Eric Shaqfeh and Alice Gast of Stanford
University and Elisabeth Guazzeli at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie
Industrielles in Paris, France. The objectives of the research are to study and
perform numerical simulations of hydrodynamic interactions between suspended
particles; and to conduct experiments on the sedimentation of fibers and the
flow of chains of magnetic particles. Through these studies they propose to
characterize the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of these systems. The U.S.
investigators brings to the collaboration theoretical expertise. This is
complemented by the French groups expertise in conducting these experiments.
