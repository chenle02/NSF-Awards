9726944 TURRIGIANO Much of the development of the mammalian central nervous
system occurs after birth, and requires experience in order for functional
circuits to form. A central problem in neurobiology has been to elucidate the
rules by which experience, in the form of patterned neural activity, determines
which synaptic connections are maintained and which are lost. An important
hypothesis is that neurons compete with each other in an activity-dependent
manner for the establishment of synaptic connections. This is thought to occur
through competition between synapses for limiting quantities of a neurotrophic
agent that is essential for maintenance of the synapse. Presynaptic neurons that
are successful at exciting the postsynaptic neuron obtain more neurotrophic
agent and therefore out-compete neurons that are not. Although this model has
generated much interest, it has not yet been directly tested. Cortical circuits
have both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic connections. Inhibitory
connections, where electrical activity in a presynaptic neuron inhibits
electrical activity in the postsynaptic neuron, is essential for the proper
functioning of cortical circuits, but despite this importance most research to
date has concentrated almost exclusively on elucidating the rules by which
excitatory synaptic connections are formed. While the rules for formation of
inhibitory connections have not been established, an understanding of these
rules is crucial for understanding the genesis of cortical circuits. The goal of
Dr. Turrigiano's research project is to ask whether the formation of inhibitory
synaptic connections involves competitive mechanisms, and to ask whether this
competition occurs through the activity-dependent uptake of a trophic agent.
These experiments will help to complete our understanding of neural circuit
development, and will test a prominent model for how activity wires up the
mammalian central nervous system.
