It has been found, contrary to prevailing thought, that herbivorous fishes,
particularly two species--Diplodus holbrooki and Lagodon rhomboides--are among
the most common fishes of coastal and continental shelf habitats throughout the
southeastern United States, and their feeding habits can dramatically affect the
structure of hard-substrate benthic communities. These fish are also major prey
species for commercially important species such as snapper and grouper, and may
be a significant pathway of energy transfer from shallow nearshore waters to
deeper offshore reefs. Experimental field studies will be conducted to assess 1)
the interactions between different herbivorous fishes, the interactions between
fishes and other herbivores, and the effects of these interactions on benthic
community structure; and 2) the mechanisms that cause dramatic increases in the
abundance of unpalatable brown seaweeds in the presence of herbivorous fishes.
These data will then be compared with studies already completed on herbivorous
fish in tropical communities.
