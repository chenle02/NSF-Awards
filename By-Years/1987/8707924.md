The needs of engineers in their interaction with engineering databases are very
different from those of their counterparts in the business world. Business
database management system interfaces typically provide only a single mode of
textual communication, usually a structured query language. However, in an ideal
engineering database interface, an engineer would be able to define constraints,
give examples, point at parts of pictures, and (sometimes) use several modes of
communication simultaneously. This research develops a plan for exploring the
needs of engineers with respect to database access and developing a conceptual
design for a multi-modal engineering database interface to satisfy those needs.
The conceptual design will include the formal definition of an engineering query
language and will describe the methodology for representing database requests in
multiple modes (e.g., graphics, engineering query language, natural language,
examples, etc.). A prototype system will be implemented on an engineering
workstation computer (DEC MicroVAX II) to demonstrate the feasibility of the
conceptual design using a sample database of structural engineering information.
