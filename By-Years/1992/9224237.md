Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) dominates the early successional forests of the
North Carolina Piedmont. Scarcity of resources, especially light, causes the
stands of pine to undergo thinning: as the trees grow larger, competition for
light escalates and the shorter, shaded individuals suffer high mortality.
Several investigators have found that in some forest tree species, genetic
heterozygosity is low in young stands and high in older stands. This trend is
the likely result of the culling of the more homozygous individuals when the
stands undergo thinning. Research is proposed to determine whether those
individuals with high heterozygosity are less likely to die, and whether the
average heterozygosity of the survivors in a stand reflects the intensity of
competition for resources as determined by initial stand density. This research
proposes to explore the natural processes which influence genetic structure in
forest stands. Natural forest stands, as opposed to pine plantations, may
maintain higher genetic diversity as a likely benefit of heterozygous
individuals through thinning of dense stands. The genetic effects of natural
stand thinning could have important implications for forest management efforts
aimed at maximizing tree vigor and forest productivity.
