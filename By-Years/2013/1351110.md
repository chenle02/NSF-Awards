Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1351110&lt;br/&gt;Eric J.
Seibel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this EAGER project a new engineering
design for an endoscopic medical device is proposed. This new approach will
allow a working channel to be included within an ultrathin and flexible
endoscope of 1.7-mm diameter. Instead of shrinking the conventional endoscope of
separate channels for illumination, imaging, flushing, and biopsy; the new
approach will place an ultrasmall imager at the tip of a working channel that
provides flushing and biopsy. This new approach is transformative for clinical
imaging and critically helpful for accelerating the development of optical
biopsy. The working channel will provide the key requirements of fluid exchange
and tissue vacuum, biopsy, and retrieval. Testing will involve the biopsy
apparatus, which is suction of the epithelial mucosa into a cutting chamber that
is connected to the proximal end for biopsy retrieval. The biopsy apparatus will
be modified in an iterative manner using test results from a synthetic phantom
and ex vivo pig lung. The integrated microendoscope and biopsy apparatus will be
fabricated and tested for endoscopic guidance to specific sites for biopsy.
Fluorescently labeled cells and microspheres will be injected into the luminal
wall so that accuracy as well as adequacy of the biopsy will be the quantitative
milestones.
