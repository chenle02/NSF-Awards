The Pliocene was a time of dramatic evolutionary and climatic change in East
Africa, yet it is poorly understood. This project will enhance our knowledge of
mammalian evolution during this period by analyzing the abundant materials from
the Ndolanya Beds at Laetoli, northern Tanzania. This is one of the few sites
that dates to this important period; its geographical location and temporal
placement between the Laetolil Bed and Olduvai Bed I make it especially
important. Specifically, the student, working with noted geologists,
anthropologists, and biologists, will attempt to refine the dating of the
Ndolanya fauna and identify previously inadequately documented vertebrate taxa.
This will enable the student to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the area.
The research has the potential to have an important impact on paleoanthropology
and our knowledge of the environment in which Pliocene hominidae lived. It will
provide proper geological and temporal controls so that hominidae finds
(Australopithecus boisei and Homo habilis) can be placed in their environmental
context.
