The objective are to develop a body of knowledge in methodology and analytical
tools for on-line tracking of the synchronous machine parameters and turns ratio
of stator and field windings from the standpoint of system identification. The
significance of this research is that engineers at utility companies can use the
proposed estimation technique to identify the machine parameters for use in
power systems planning and stability studies. Furthermore, by tracking the
machine parameters and turns ratio of stator and field windings, the incipient
faults of synchronous machines can be detected in real-time. The on-line
detection of imminent failure will facilitate orderly shut-down of the generator
for repair. In addition, by avoiding forced outage, the control power system is
assured. Finally, the results of this research can be used by power system
control engineers to accurately predict and control the dynamic performance of
electronically controlled future power systems.
