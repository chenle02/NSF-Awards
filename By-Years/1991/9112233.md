Specimen preparation and supplemental electron microscopy equipment will be
purchased and dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment will
be used for research projects, including advanced structural materials and
electronic materials and devices. Four specific projects are proposed in
particular: (1) Deformation of High Temperature Titanium Composites and Titanium
Intermetallics (2) Fatigue and Fracture of Metal Matrix Composites (3) Micro-
Characterization of MBE Grown Strained Layer Superlattices and Low Temperature
Composites (4) Micro-Characterization of Semiconductor Heterostructures and
Devices After Post-Growth Processing
