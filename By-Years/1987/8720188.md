New methods for light microscopy will be developed. The focus will be on the
digital imaging microscope, which can be used for the analysis of changes in
molecular distribution underlying cell function. The spatial and temporal
resolution of current camera and microscope systems will be improved by
developing both new camera recording systems and a new high speed confocal
microscope. Further improvements in image quality will be sought by the
development of image restoration methods that incorporate a priori information
about the biology to enhance the reversal of distortion and noise introduced by
the imaging process. In order to facilitate subsequent interactive analysis,
work will be carried out to develop image feature extraction systems capable of
recognizing regular sub-cellular features of interest so that images may be
simplified and principle features of interest presented for subsequent analysis.
Finally, work will be carried out to develop interactive 3-D graphics display
systems allowing the biologist to extract information in a quantitative yet
flexible manner form such images. These projects will be carried out by a team
consisting of biologists, computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists.
The research is motivated by the need to better understand how molecular
distribution in cells and tissues determines their function. While the
development of tools address these issues will require the solution of problems
that are physical and mathematical in nature, the ultimate benefit from these
efforts will be in the area of biological research. The method will have an
important impact on cell biology and neurobiology and ultimately on biomedical
research as well.
