Multi-component polymer systems exhibit a rich variety of useful mechanical,
electrical, and optical properties. The nature of the interface and free surface
boundary regions is a central problem to the understanding and predicting of
their complex behavior. This ROW research-initiation grant will deal with
composition-vs-distance profiles in the model systems of partially miscible
polymers; (a) polystyrene/polybromostyrene (b) polystyrene/deuterated
polystyrene. The measurements will be performed by several complementary
techniques; (a) secondary ion mass spectroscopy, (b) forward recoil elastic
scattering with simultaneous measurement of time-of-flight and energy
measurements, (c) neutron and x-ray reflectivity and fluorescence. The first two
techniques have resolutions of 120A and 240A, respectively, and the advantage
that the measured energy spectra can be converted simply and unambiguously into
concentration profiles. The reflectivity techniques have resolutions of approx.
20A but obtain data in inverse space and the interpretation is difficult without
preliminary information from other methods. The experimental program will focus
on investigation of the equilibrium and dynamical properties of interfaces and
surfaces as functions of chain length, interaction parameter, segment
deuteration, and blend composition. Of special interest are surface wetting and
pre-wetting phase transitions and their relationship to bulk critical phenomena
as predicted by various theoretical models.
