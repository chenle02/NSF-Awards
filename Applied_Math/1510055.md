This research project studies vehicle kinematics and related problems. The
project focuses on a number of carefully selected concrete problems with
applications in areas including pursuit problems, geometrical robotics,
flotation theory, and fluid motion. The mathematical results of the research
will have an impact on the study of fundamental differential equations (Hill's
equation) that describe numerous natural phenomena, from planetary motion to the
motion of electron. The investigator will actively involve undergraduate and
graduate students in this research program.

The unifying theme of this project is the monodromy of the related continuous
and discrete systems and a strong connection with finite- and infinite-
dimensional completely integrable systems. In particular, the investigator will
study connections of vehicle kinematics with the filament (binormal, local
induction, smoke ring) equation, one of the most studied completely integrable
partial differential equations of soliton type, and its discretizations. The
research will contribute to the emerging areas of discrete differential geometry
and discrete completely integrable systems.
