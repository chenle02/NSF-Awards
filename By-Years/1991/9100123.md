The investigators propose a foodweb-based procedure for analysis of
biodiversity problems. To test the validity of this approach, they will apply it
to a river food web at a site within an old-growth conifer forest in northern
California. At present, this site is relatively pristine, but invasion by exotic
predators and herbivores (squawfish and bullfrogs) is anticipated within a few
years. In the pre-invasion community, the researchers will investigate how
macroalgae, which dominate primary producer assemblages in the river, mediate
predator-prey interactions involving the dominant vertebrate and invertebrate
grazers. The effects of macroalgae on habitat selection, feeding rates, growth,
survival, and emergence of 1) frog tadpoles (Hyla regilla and Rana boylei) in
the presence and absence of predatory aquatic garter snakes (Thamnophis couchi);
and 2) algivorous midge larvae (Pseudochironomus richardsoni) in the presence
and absence of predatory fishes (roach, Hesperoleucas symmetricus, and juvenile
steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss) will be analyzed in manipulative field
experiments. Results from these studies will allow the investigators to evaluate
the relative importance of macroalgae in providing food, refuges, or thermally
favorable microhabitats to these dominant vertebrate and invertebrate grazers,
or to their predators. Predictions of how changes in algal or predator
assemblages following invasions will alter critical food web linkages will be
developed, then tested in similar river reaches where predatory squawfish and/or
bullfrogs have already arrived. These predictions will also be tested at the
primary study site of the principle investigators following the establishment of
invaders.
