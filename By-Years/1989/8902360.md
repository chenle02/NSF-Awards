Storage management mechanisms play a significant role in the implementation of
modern programming languages. Language facilities for dynamic allocation of data
objects and the local environments of procedures require the support of both
stack and heap based allocation schemes. One property shared by almost all
storage management techniques is their cost decreases as the number of objects
decreases even if the amount of memory involved remains constant. The
investigator has developed techniques that can reduce the allocation overhead
associated with procedure calls by exploiting this property. This is a project
in which these techniques will be extended to other domains, including the
allocation of memory for procedures in languages requiring retention of
activation records and the allocation of dynamically allocated data objects.
