The issue of optimal damages for death and serious permanent injury is one of
the most important questions facing society today. Although it is generally
agreed that current award levels are not optimal, no consensus has been reached
on what the awards should be. This lack of consensus has resulted in
diametrically opposed trends. At the same time that legislatures are trying to
reduce damage awards for death and permanent injury by using caps, courts are
increasing allowable recovery for death and serious permanent injury. Despite
the ofttimes fervor of the debate, little rigorous scholarship has been done on
what constitutes optimal damage rules and damage awards. Professor Arlen seeks
to address this issue through her research. Her project focuses on efficient
damages from serious permanent physical injuries resulting from single activity
accidents, in particular automobile accidents. The work aims to determine what
damage awards induce efficient risk-taking and risk-spreading behavior under two
conditions: where all injured individuals suffer identical losses or where
parties do not necessarily suffer the same losses. The case of the automobile
accident is both practically and theoretically important. Automobile accidents
are a primary cause of accidental serious permanent injury in contemporary life.
Further, such a single accident activity allows determining utility maximizing
damage rules in situations (1) where individuals run risks of both injuring and
being injured and (2) face the possibility of both paying and receiving damage
awards.
