This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports the design and
development of a sensitive, broadband antenna and receiver to observe the
distribution in angle and redshift of highly redshifted neutral hydrogen,
throughout the epoch of reionization. The system, operating in the 45 - 200 MHz
range, will offer extremely high dynamic range for observing relatively weak
hydrogen signatures within the strong natural and man-made radio environment.
