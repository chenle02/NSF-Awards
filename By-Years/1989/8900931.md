This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in the Department of Psychology at Syracuse University. The
program is a 10-week summer research program designed to enlarge the very small
numbers of blacks entering the field of experimental psychology. Ten students
between their junior and senior years will be enrolled. At least five students
will be from colleges with substantial black undergraduate enrollments. Students
will be assigned to laboratories in which they will help design, carry out and
analyze the results of a research project, under the supervision of a regular
full-time member in the Syracuse Psychology Department. Students will make both
oral presentations and written reports of their projects. Advisors will evaluate
reports through written comments sent to the students after the end of the
program. Students will evaluate the program by completing forms distributed at
the middle and end of the summer. Information about actual career choices and
the impact of the summer program on those choices, will be solicited from
students, home departments and advisors at the end of the academic year
following the program.
