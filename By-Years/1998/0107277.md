0107277 Shekelle The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad.

This award will provide twenty-four months of support to Dr. Myron Shekelle to
work with Dr. Jatna Supriatna at the University of Indonesia in Depok,
Indonesia.

This project is a study of the number of species and their distribution of
tarsiers (small bodied, nocturnal primates), using genetic and acoustic data.
The PI will coordinate activities between Columbia University and the University
of Indonesia to study the biogeography of all Sulawesi vertebrates and map
regions of genetic endemism - with implications for conservation.

Dr. Supriatna is Director of the Center for the Study of Biodiversity and
Conservation. He is also the in-country program manager for Conservation
International.
