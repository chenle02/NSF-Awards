9502772 Parvin This project will investigate the possible use of coil springs
for the support bearings of bridges in order to resist lateral and vertical
forces. The investigation will determine the resistance of various combinations
of soil springs and tie-down mechanisms for static and dynamic loads.
Experiments will be conducted in laboratory on one-third scale models ***
