This is a rapid response sampling effort to evaluate the environmental impact
of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on Prince William Sound and adjacent areas. Since
the inception of the spill on 24March1989, the affected area has expanded to
present a threat to the Gulf of Alaska. Chemical, biological and physical
studies will be initiated during a seven-day sampling cruise from 5 to
11April1989 on the R/V Alpha Helix. Other support from private, state and
federal sources has been requested to continue this preliminary study of the
environmental recovery.
