Participants are being recruited who share a common interest in exploring
various areas of combinatories and discrete mathematics as they are applied to a
variety of topics, many of which have direct applicability to the undergraduate
curriculum. The objective of this conference is to cover selected fundamental
topics from contemporary combinatories/discrete mathematics, with the goal of
modernizing undergraduate courses related to these areas. To this end, emphasis
will be on basic new theoretical results and their uses, as well as fundamental
combinatorial/discrete mathematics concepts and problem solving techniques. The
application of these topics to areas other than mathematics will also be
discussed. The mornings will be devoted to lectures by the main speakers and
afternoons to group discussions, problem solving sessions, participant talks,
classroom application/incorporation/improvements, and the use of computer
facilities. The participants will be required to submit a report indicating how
the ideas of this conference were incorporated into or affected the content of
their courses; the teaching of their courses; their mathematical activity and
awareness; and, where applicable, their research during the 1992-93 school year.
