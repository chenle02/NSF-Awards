The Bio-ITEST program is a model designed to provide secondary science teachers
with the knowledge, skills, and resource materials to engage their students in
the newly developing fields of bioinformatics and computational biology,
ensuring that students will be able to participate in these important new
workforce areas. The goals of the Bio-ITEST program are to increase teacher and
student understanding of the application of information technologies in the
biological sciences, the ethical implications of the acquisition and use of
biological information, and the career possibilities in the fields of
bioinformatics and computational biology. The Bio-ITEST program will address
these goals by developing: (1) an annual two-week professional development and
career awareness summer workshop for 25 secondary science teachers; (2)
additional shorter workshops for 50 teachers annually; (3) a year-round online
program for participating science teachers; (4) original, research-oriented high
school curricular materials on bioinformatics and careers in bioinformatics; (5)
mentorship opportunities for high school students annually in bioinformatics;
(6) student research projects that will be showcased at a juried Student Biotech
Expo; and (7) broader dissemination of curricular materials to teachers across
the country through STEM networks, websites, and professional development
conferences. Leading education outreach, technology, community college, and
bioinformatics organizations in the Pacific Northwest will collaborate to
develop and implement the Bio-ITEST program. The primary partners include the
Northwest Association for Biomedical Research (NWABR), the Puget Sound Center
for Teaching, Learning and Technology, Geospiza, and Bellevue Community College.
