9601571 Henyey This award provides partial funding (59% of total cost) for the
acquisition of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and ancillary equipment
for installing 50 GPS stations of the Southern California Integrated GPS Network
(SCIGN). Installation, operation, and maintenance of the stations will be
coordinated by the University of Southern California. The institution is
committed to providing the remaining 41% of cost of this project. Geodetic
techniques to measure crustal deformation have seen rapid advances recently.
State-of-the-art GPS techniques are currently capable of measuring displacements
of a few millimeters. The continuously operating SCIGN network in the Los
Angeles area will be able to detect rates approaching 1 mm/yr and will be used
to map the regional strain pattern as it develops overtime in this earthquake
prone area. ***
