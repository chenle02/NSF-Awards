Professor Balaban is one of the leaders in constructive quantum field theory and
statistical mechanics. His past work is widely recognized as a tour-de-force in
which Professor Balaban has the best solution to the ultraviolet stability
problem for both three and four dimensional gauge field models. He is currently
attacking still other fundamental problems in quantized gauge fields that govern
particle interaction. These include nonlinear models that relate to the current
thrust in string theory and unified quantum field theory. Professor Balaban is
uniquely qualified for research on these hard problems in mathematical physics.
