Most industrial robots employ primitive parallel-jaw grippers or special-purpose
manipulators designed for specific tasks. NSF has provided Columbia University
with a Utah/MIT dexterous hand capable of grasping and fine manipulation in the
manner of the human hand. This new grant will permit development of tactile
sensing strategies for identifying known object types, and sensor-based control
strategies for manipulating tools and parts.
