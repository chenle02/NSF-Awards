This project is a collaborative between Clarkson University and the American
Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES). The collaborative will provide
20 American Indian high school women from across the nation with a four week
summer program integrating engineering, mathematics computer applications and
enterpreneurship activities. The program is designed to build skills and support
student achievement. Educators from the Native community serve as mentors and
role models. Parents, tribal leaders and other community members will serve as
project resources. All project participants will be exposed to various tribal
customs and beliefs. Student participants will become part of on-going research
projects at the university and a reservation near the university.
