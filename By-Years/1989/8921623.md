This project involves the collaboration of two cultural anthropologists who
will interview a relatively small sample of North American "persons-in-the-
street" about their perceptions and moral evaluations of the environmental
problems of global climate change. A "folk model" will be constructed that
represents these beliefs, which will be compared with a similar set of
interviews and model elicited from specialists whose jobs affect the environment
(utility analysts, environmental lobbyists, congressional staff, and others).
These data will contribute to an analysis of theoretical questions involving the
pattern and meaning of intracultural variation, such as how knowledge of the
mechanisms and consequences of global warming are socially distributed, and
whether this knowledge consists of collections of unconnected facts or systems
of propositions. This research is important because concerns about the state of
the environment are gaining more significance in society. Increased
understanding of the structure of popular understanding of these issues, and the
moral evaluations that go along with opinions, will help policy makers
understand public reactions.
