Collaborative research on nonlinear PDEs and integro-differential equations

The proposal develops and applies new constructive methods in the study of
solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, with focus on existence
and uniqueness, regularity and spontaneous formation of singularities. Recent
advances in Borel-Laplace regularization and summability are used to find global
properties of solutions of PDEs. There is a wide range of problems where these
questions are essential, and a number of concrete examples including thin film
equations, Kuramoto-Sivashinski, KdV and mKdV will be analyzed.

Natural phenomena in physics, chemistry, material sciences and in many other
disciplines are most often described by differential equations; complex
phenomena are frequently modeled by partial differential equations. The present
project covers a wide range of such equations, the global properties of their
solutions and their possible blow up. This resarch is a piece of an unfolding
enterprise to advance a theory of singular behavior, of substantial importance
in mathematics and its applications.
