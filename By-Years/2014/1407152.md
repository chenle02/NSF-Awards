A recurring theme in mathematics is that many kinds of geometric spaces can be
precisely characterized by the collection of functions defined on the space.
These functions can be added and multiplied, forming a structure called an
algebra. These algebras of functions are defined in such a way that the product
of two functions does not depend upon the order in which they are multiplied,
just as in numerical multiplication. But many algebras arising in mathematics
and quantum physics are noncommutative, and such algebras do not have a
corresponding geometric space (in our current understanding of this term). This
project has two related goals: first, to better understand a certain class of
algebras that should correspond to quantum versions of ordinary "flat" (affine)
spaces, and second, to seek a suitable space-like object that should form the
geometric counterpart of a noncommutative algebra. The proposed approach will
promote interaction between ring theory, functional analysis, and quantum
physics. The PI will involve undergraduate students in this research.

This project addresses two objectives in noncommutative algebra that are both
related to foundational issues in noncommutative geometry. The first objective
is to develop new techniques for the study of skew (or "twisted") Calabi-Yau
algebras. These algebras simultaneously generalize two important classes of
algebras from noncommutative algebraic geometry: Calabi-Yau algebras and Artin-
Schelter regular algebras. Problems to be considered include invariants of
actions on these algebras, the structure of these algebras in low dimensions,
and duality theory for modules over such algebras. The second objective is to
construct a functorial invariant for noncommutative algebras that meaningfully
extends the spectrum of commutative rings and algebras. This will build upon
rigorous obstructions to several natural candidates for noncommutative spectrum
functors. The initial focus will be to extend the Gelfand spectrum functor from
commutative to noncommutative C*-algebras.
