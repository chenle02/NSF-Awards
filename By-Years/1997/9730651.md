Quellmalz 9730651 This project builds on the notion that states, districts, and
teachers need innovative approaches to sharing exemplary assessment resources,
collaborating on the development of new ones, and understanding how the use of
standards-based performance assessments can advance education reform at all
levels of the system. This project, a collaboration between SRI and the Council
of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) will develop a type of electronic library
--an on-line, standards-based interactive resource bank of science performance
assessments. Specifically, the project has two goals: 1. To develop a two-tiered
on-line performance assessment resource library for K-12 science from multiple
sources. One tier will be a password-protected, secure accountability pool of
assessments and the second will be for use by teachers and professional
development organizations. 2. To identify, study, and evaluate the effectiveness
of policies, implementation models, and technical quality requirements for the
use of the two tiers of PALS.
