9316334 Crespi This Research Planning Grant will initiate a regional-scale study
of strain history partitioning in the Taconic Allochthon of western New England.
Field studies will focus on orientation analysis of cleavage, bedding and veins,
and collection of samples. Laboratory analysis will include microstructural
study of the veins ad pressure-fringes around pyrite crystals to establish the
degree of partitioning of strain into coaxial and non-coaxial components. The
results will test the feasibility of the area and methods a larger- scale
project to investigate strain partitioning in the northern Appalachians orogenic
belt.
