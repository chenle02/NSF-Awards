Affinity membranes are a promising new bioseparation technology to overcome the
limitations of conventional gel-bead columns, where performance is limited by
intra-particle diffusion and pressure drop effects. This project aims to: i)
theoretically and experimentally determine the role of association kinetics and
axial diffusion in the design and performance of affinity membranes; ii)
recommend new, more optimal designs for affinity membranes; and iii) explore a
new class of affinity bioseparations based on differences in association
kinetics.
