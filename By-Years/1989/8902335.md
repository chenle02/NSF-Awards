The long term objective of this proposal is to understand how cytoplasmic
factors interact with the genome to effect determination and differentiation
during early development. Since the primary germ layers arise during the period
when the maternal components of the egg are present and can effect gene
expression, it is important that we understand how the components of the embryo
interact to establish these layers. As a model system Dr. Showman is examining
the gene coding for alkaline phosphatase in the embryonic endoderm of Spisula
solidissima. Using a combination of cell marking and cell deletion studies he
will determine the lineage of the cells expressing alkaline phosphatase and the
role of cell interactions in the lineage determination process. Coincidentally
the gene for Spisula alkaline phosphatase will be cloned and characterized in
terms of time of mRNA synthesis, message prevalence, polysome association,
tissue specificity and reiteration frequency. Finally the gene will be sequenced
to determine its overall structure. From these studies he will learn the role
played by specific cytoplasmic components in regulating the expression of a
unique marker of a defined cell lineage and be in a position to begin an
analysis of the cytoplasmic components themselves. %%% This study addresses the
mechanism of determination and differentiation of specialized cells during the
