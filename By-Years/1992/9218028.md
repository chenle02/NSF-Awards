This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Richard D. Burkhart of the University of Nevado, Reno and Professor Masahide
Yamamoto of the University of Kyoto. The goal of this research project is to
evaluate the role of triplet-triplet annihilations as a viable mechanism of
charge carrier generation in vinylaromatic polymers as well as small molecules
present as molecular dopants in inert polymer matrices. The polymers and small
molecule analogues will be synthesized in Professor Yamamoto's group, while
transient absorption spectroscopy on laser excited solutions and solid films of
the polymers will be carried out by Professor Burkhart's group to determine the
identity of any transients observed, looking especially for transient ions.
These experiments will be carried out over a range of temperatures from 10K to
ambient. To evaluate rates of decay of the transient species, nanosecond kinetic
measurements will be carried out at the University of Kyoto. When both ion and
triplet decay signals can be observed simultaneously, it will be possible to
determine whether or not a relationship exists between the formation of
transient ions and the occurrence of triplet-triplet annihilations.
