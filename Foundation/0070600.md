The investigator is pursuing two lines of research, relevant to the general
proof-theoretic program of extracting constructive, computational, and
combinatorial information from theories of classical mathematics. The first
involves extending a semantic approach to ordinal analysis to Kripke-Platek set
theory, and extracting combinatorial and computational principles for the
constructible hierarchy from the analysis. The second involves trying to find
sharp conservation results for weak theories of nonstandard arithmetic,
preferably via "natural" interpretations of the nonstandard theories in the
standard ones, and exploring ways in which ordinary mathematics can be carried
out in these frameworks.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, there has been a gradual divergence
between two different ways of thinking about mathematics. On the one hand,
mathematics is viewed as a general investigation into abstract concepts, many of
them involving infinitary objects and structures. On the other hand, many see
mathematics as grounded by concrete symbolic representations and calculation.
One goal of proof theory is to reconcile these two viewpoints, by finding the
concrete, computational content that is hidden in general forms of abstract
mathematical reasoning. The investigator aims to apply proof-theoretic methods
to the study of theories of nonstandard analysis, and fragments of set theory.
