9726237 Madrazo The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through the
Mathematics and Science Education Network (MSEN) provides a 3-year Research
Experiences for Teachers and Students project. Research opportunities in
biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics/technology are provided to 12 teams
of 1 high school teacher and 3 students entering grades 10-12 in the first year
of the project. In years two and three the project will serve an additional 39
teachers and 117 students. Research teams of 1 teacher, 3 students, and a
scientist/mathematician collaborate on a research project integral to the
researcher's on-going research program. Teachers integrate related research
experiences into their classrooms,during which the participating students serve
as peer mentors to their classmates. During the academic year the teams also
participate in research symposia to present results of their research and
discuss results.
