This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Lily M. Ng of the Chemistry Department, Cleveland
State University. Chemical phenomena on semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces
will be studied using in situ Fourier transform infrared reflection - attenuated
total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. During the planning period, adsorption
of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, acetate, ammonium, acetonitrile, methanol
and thiourea on the surfaces of silicon electrodes, Ni or Pt modified
electrodes, and CdTe electrodes will be investigated during photovoltaic and
photoassisted catalytic experiments. This project is relevant to the development
of more efficient photocells.
