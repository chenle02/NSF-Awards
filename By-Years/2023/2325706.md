A group of multidisciplinary researchers from the George Washington University,
Georgetown University, North Carolina State University, Trinity College, and
City University of Hong Kong have developed a two-day conference in New
Frontiers in Reliability and Risk Analysis to be held at the Science and
Engineering Hall of the George Washington University on October 13-14, 2023. The
conference will focus on modern statistical methodologies of Reliability and
Risk Analysis, which have a broad appeal, with applications in a vast array of
disciplines such as engineering, science, business, medicine, law, healthcare
and the social sciences. The conference organizers encourage participation and
attendance by early-career researchers with diverse backgrounds and researchers
from underrepresented groups.

The conference will be emphasizing presentation of topics on novel application
areas and modern theoretical developments such as Adversarial Risk Analysis,
Fusion Learning in Survival Analysis, Big Data in Reliability, Financial Risk
Analytics, Machine Learning in Risk Analysis, and Deep and Reinforcement
Learning in Reliability and Risk Analysis, Block Chains and Reliability, and
Bayesian Learning and Decision Making with Big Data. The conference will feature
key plenary speakers. For more specific and up to date conference details,
