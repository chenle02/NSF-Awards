The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to
provide a fabrication system to companies manufacturing and/or developing cell
based models for sale and/or service, pharmaceutical companies, and research
organizations. The platform will allow these entities to prototype and scale
quicker, fail faster, and reduce costs of commercialization. Companies often
must completely reengineer their fabrication process when scaling or changing
their models. With this system, they can more rapidly iterate through potential
designs. Decreasing the time to develop new cell based models will benefit the
public and companies in this important and growing field. In addition, the
technology can have an impact in analyzing/ranking potential drug candidates for
pharmaceutical companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
techniques used to rapidly prototype inorganic metallic electronics commonly
called laser induced forward transfer. The system integrates laser direct write
and laser micromachining (additive and subtractive techniques, respectively) for
the manipulation and prototyping of biomaterials on a micron scale.
Cells/biomaterials can be precisely transferred to a substrate using laser-
assisted direct write. Before and/or after the transfer of 1-1000's of
cells/units, the substrates can be shaped using laser ablation to create cell-
scale geometries. Alternating addition and subtraction of (bio)materials in a
controlled and repeatable way on a micron scale allows for the creation of
cellular constructs in almost any geometry and gradient of chemical factors. A
goal of this I-Corps project is to determine the commercial potential for the
technology as a platform and/or as a service.
