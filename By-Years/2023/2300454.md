The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career
faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new
research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It
is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home
institution. This award to Bethune-Cookman University aims to evaluate the
impact of pedagogical interventions on student success utilizing educational
software in STEM Education, specifically in the biological sciences.

This project aims to modernize the undergraduate biology curriculum by
integrating active learning and computational thinking in an intelligent online
tutor, using a “pathway algebra” approach commonly applied to fields like
systems biology and genomics. The focus will be on developing and refining
educational software to teach this formal logical language for describing
biological pathways and problem-solving skills. The project aims to improve
students' ability to integrate reasoning skills and conceptual knowledge,
promoting deeper learning and transfer to new topics by learning to specify
summaries of new content and describe their own theories using this language.
The impact of this innovation will be empirically evaluated, and the resulting
software will be widely disseminated, impacting biology education at other
institutions, and serving as a model for best practices in STEM fields,
including economics and social sciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
