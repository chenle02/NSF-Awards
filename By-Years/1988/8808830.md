The project deals with the development of a mathematical model of the cutting
process (mechanics together with the heat transfer considerations) in orthogonal
cutting of rock with polycrystalline diamond cutting (PDC) tools. A model will
be developed which will be valid for a wide range of cutter speeds, cutter
configuration and various rock formations. The model could then be used to
improve the design of oil well drill bits and the productivity of rock drilling.
