Francis Marion College will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Physics which will offer science enrichment activities for 25
precollege students entering grade 12. The program will include individual
research projects in nuclear physics, laser physics, x-ray diffraction, solid
state conductivity, ultraviolet spectroscopy, superconductivity, and engineering
physics. This will be reinforced with classroom discussions and group
laboratories on topics such as lasers, quantum mechanics, special relativity,
elementary particle physics, superconductivity, atomic/nuclear structure, and
astrophysics.
