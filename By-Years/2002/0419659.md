This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the
development of high efficiency expanded-PTFE (ePTFE) membranes. Inexpensive,
asymmetric membranes will be developed, which offer high filtration efficiencies
in the nanometer range and considerable energy savings over conventionally
fabricated membranes. In this Phase I work, we will demonstrate our concept and
produce membranes which are capable of achieving 99% filtration efficiency in
the 20 nm size range, and which show &gt;50% savings in energy requirements over
the best performing competing products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These advanced
ePTFE membranes have application in existing industries as diverse as air
purification, microelectronics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing, viral
filtration and for the protection of sensors. Our manufacturing process can be
performed on a batch or a roll-to-roll basis and could ultimately be adapted to
produce a family of ePTFE membranes with multifunctional separations
capabilities which do not sacrifice cost for efficacy. &lt;br/&gt;
