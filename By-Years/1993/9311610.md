This proposal, "Parity nonconservation in Atomic Dysprosium", is for
observations of parity nonconservation in atomic Dysprosium, employing the
methods of atomic beams and laser optical spectroscopy. The investigator seeks
to make quantitative tests of the standard model where radiative corrections are
important, and thus to try to discover new physics beyond the standard model.
Second, he seeks to uncover small but interesting secondary effects such as
those due to a nuclear anapole moment. Finally, parity nonconservation
experiments provide unique tests of many-body relativistic calculational
techniques in atomic theory.
