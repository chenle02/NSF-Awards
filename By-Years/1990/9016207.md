It is now widely recognized that in view of the excellent science and
engineering capabilities that exist in many countries in all parts of the world,
it is increasingly important for U.S. scientists and engineers to remain in
close touch with the activities and plans of their foreign colleagues, in part
as a means for planning joint research programs with them. Additionally, gaining
an understanding of many important scientific problems, such as those associated
with the global environment, requires cooperative scientific efforts on a
multinational basis. U.S. scientists and engineers have a number of available
mechanisms to maintain close communication with scientists and engineers in
other countries. Among the oldest and most extensive of these mechanisms are the
non-governmental international disciplinary unions (the first was established in
1919) which today comprise the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
in which more than 70 countries are represented. National members of these
unions, as well as ICSU-proper, are private scientific bodies whose activities
are normally determined by committees of working scientists. In the United
States, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the official adhering body to
ICSU and its unions, and NAS disciplinary and non-disciplinary staff officers
manage U.S. participation on behalf of the U.S. National Committees for ICSU and
those unions.
