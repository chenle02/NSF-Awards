Over the last few years, the AI and Robotics communities have begun to realize
that the proliferation of relatively cheap but sophisticated robot hardware, and
the development of robust and reliable robotics techniques for performing low-
level control and perception. These developments have created a demand for
integrative AI and robotics research to fulfill the potential of today's robots.
The project aims at fostering cross-fertilization between these research fields
through a series of activities at the AAAI-16 conference that will be held in
Phoenix, Arizona from February 12th to 17th, 2016.

The project will include the following activities at the AAAI-16 conference: (1)
participation of PhD students interested in integrative AI and Robotics
research, (2) presentations by researchers showcasing current problems and
solutions in robotics research, (3) a "spotlight" presentation by a young
researcher showcasing new and exciting research in the field of robotics, (4) a
robotics exhibition, and (5) an open house day, open for the general public.
