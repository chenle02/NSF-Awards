This project funds the devlopment of an apparatus for the Millikan oil drop
experiment that will permit a student, working without assistance, to complete
all phases of the experiment efficiently and accurately. The apparatus takes
advantage of video recording to separate the functions of data acquisition and
data analysis. The oil drop experiment is pedagogically attractive, but it is
not popular with students and does not fulfill its potential because the
execution has been so cumbersome. With modern technology brought to bear on the
problem, it is hoped that the experiment can be raised to a favored position in
the laboratory repertoire.
