This project addresses the mechanisms of electron and proton transfer in the
reaction center complex of the photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides
and Rhodopseudomonas viridis, for which the structure of the reaction center
(RC) is known at atomic resolution. The main focus is the two quinone molecules
that act as electron acceptors to the photochemical events. The quinones undergo
one-electron reduction to the semiquinone, and double reduction to the quinol
state, which also requires uptake of protons from the aqueous medium. The work
aims to identify amino acid residues active in the binding of both quinones, in
the stabilization of the semiquinone states, in the establishment of the
functional redox potentials of the two quinones, and in the proton transfer
pathways leading to formation of the quinol state. The effects of specific
mutations on the functional redox and acid- base properties of the to-electron
gate, in Rb. Sphaeroides, will be investigated by kinetic and equilibrium
techniques based on optical spectroscopy and electrometric measurements. These
will be supplemented by structural studies, including X-ray difference analysis
where possible, and infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), and by computational
approaches, utilizing the comparative virtues of mutant RCs to maximum effect.
%%% The primary goals of this work are (1) to demonstrate and understand how
specific activities and properties are induced in biological cofactors by
protein-ligand interactions, and (2) to investigate the mechanism of proton
transfer through proteins. These are important general issues in enzymatic
catalysis and biological specificity. The reaction center quinones are uniquely
suited for these investigations, through the great experimental amenability of
the system for biophysical measurements and for protein engineering.
