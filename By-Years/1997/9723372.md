9723372 Koshland This project is designed to change the specificity of an
enzyme by substitution of amino acids at the active site or in other parts of
the protein by site-directed mutation or by random mutation. The purpose is to
create an enzyme that has the same catalytic power but a very different
specificity from the original enzyme. The enzyme chosen for this study is
isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle and it is to be
changed into an alkylmalate dehydrogenase, a change that alters the active site
from a polar, negatively charged chain to a non-polar, hydrophobic side chain.
To change the specificity of an enzyme is of great significance both for
research and applied practical problems. To apply enzyme catalysis to practical
problems such as cleanup of toxic wastes, it will be important to direct the
catalytic power of an enzyme towards specific compounds such as man-made
polutants that need removal. ***
