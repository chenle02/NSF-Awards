This renewal proposal focuses on a study of the optical and electronic
properties of alkalides, electrides and mixed systems to determine the nature of
electron-electron interactions in crystalline solids with weakly trapped
electrons, factors which lead to electron spin pairing, and the nature of metal-
non metal transitions. Thin films, microcrystalline films, and single crystals
of these materials will be prepared, and their emission-, reflectance-,
transmission-, and fluorescence-spectra studied. The electrical conductivity and
impedance spectroscopy of powders and single crystals will be determined, and
their photoelectron and thermionic electron emission investigated.
