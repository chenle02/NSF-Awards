This three year project, sponsored by Southern Illinois University-Carbondale,
will teach middle school teachers science content and science-related social
issues. In the first year 22 key middle school teachers and eleven instructional
supervisors will be involved. In the second year 33 other teachers will be
involved. These participants will receive instruction in science content,
investigate local STS issues and learn specific methods to teach middle school
students these same skills. Assisted by project staff the teachers in the
program will provide inservice training to colleagues in other districts. In the
third year the prior participants, and administrators from their schools, will
attend a one-week workshop relating to staff development and program
implementation. As a result of this project at the end of three years each
district served will have in place a component of its science curriculum focused
on science-related social issues, teachers trained in this issue-related
approach, a cadre of key teachers and administrators who can provide training to
new teachers as they move into the district and a staff development program
designed for that particular district which will insure continuation of this
program. The matching funds provided by the University, Maryville College and
the school districts are equal to 125% of the NSF grant.
