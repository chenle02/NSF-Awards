The principal investigator will develop and improve methods for understanding
the stability of nonlinear waves as solutions of partial differential equations
which arise in a number of scientific fields. In one particular case, he will
use ideas he has recently developed to establish the exponential decay rate for
nonlinear perturbations in solitary wave problems for KdV- type equations. The
qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves for such systems is of significant
scientific interest in view of the wide spread occurrence of such phenomena in
real world situations.
