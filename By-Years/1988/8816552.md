This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of simple prototypical molecules near
their dissociation thresholds. The object of this study is to understand the
interaction of the variety of molecular vibrations and rotations as a molecule
proceeds along the path to dissociation. Fully state-resolved experiments will
be done to observe the spectra of molecules at the threshold of dissociation, to
measure dissociation rates for individual quantum states and to map the release
of energy and angular momentum among product degrees of freedom. An aim of the
study is to establish the extent of coupling between vibrational and rotational
degrees of freedom as a molecule proceeds along the reaction coordinate to
dissociation products. The data obtained should provide a strong test of
alternative dynamical models of unimolecular reactions. Ab-initio potential
surfaces will be used with state-of-the-art dynamical methods to compare theory
and experiment which provide complete energy state spectral resolution.
