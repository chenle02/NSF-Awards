This Partnerships for Innovation Project from Case Western Reserve University
focuses on co-extrusion of multilayer polymer films for various potential
applications such as gas barrier films for food packaging, optical films and
lenses, and electronic/optoelectronic films. A recent discovery enables a new
application of multilayer films in dielectric films for high energy density and
low loss capacitors. Potential applications of this research platform on
multilayer film capacitors will include smaller capacitors with high
efficiencies, pulsed power electronics, dc-link capacitors for hybrid electric
vehicles, grid-tie inverters and converters, and many others.

The broader impacts of this research include the following: First, this project
will serve as a university model for translating knowledge and technology to
market-valued solutions. If successful, the project will have a direct impact on
the local and national economy by crystallizing cutting edge technology in
Northeast Ohio for U.S. polymer dielectric film production and capacitors.
Second, students and faculty will learn innovation skills that bridge the gap
between industrial needs and discovery research. Third, this project will
provide mutual incentives to the team via collaboration and maximization of
resources. In this project, a Master of Engineering and Management student will
be involved in market analysis and product design. Finally, this project will
outreach to K-12 education by participating in a successful education program
developed by the NSF Center for Polymeric System (CLiPS), the Polymer Envoys
Program.

Partners at the inception of the project are Case Western Reserve University as
the lead academic institution, PolymerPlus LLC (Valley View, OH) and Orbital
Research, Inc. (Cleveland, OH).
