Dr. Wright will be studying conditions which imply that certain contractible
manifolds of dimensions greater than or equal to three cannot be non-trivial
covering spaces. A very beautiful three-dimensional result of J. Robert Myers
(Oklahoma State University) shows that genus one Whitehead manifolds cannot non-
trivially cover any 3-manifold. Dr. Wright's objectives are to find conditions
which can be easily checked which show that an open contractible n-manifold
cannot be a covering space of any other manifold. These conditions will show
that Whitehead manifolds (as defined by Myers) of arbitrary genus cannot be non-
trivial covering spaces, that n-dimensional generalizations of the Whitehead
manifolds cannot be non-trivial covering spaces, and that the interior of the
Mazur contractible 4-manifold cannot be a non-trivial covering space. In fact,
Dr. Wright expects his new approach to produce a significant understanding of
which contractible open manifolds of all dimensions can be covering spaces.
