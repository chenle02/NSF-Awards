The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will administer a
travel grant program for approximately 70-80 U.S. mathematical and computational
scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the
International Conference on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 07), to be
held on July 16-20, 2007 in Zurich, Switzerland. The travel awards will cover
air transportation and lodging costs consistent with the rules and procedures of
the National Science Foundation. It is estimated that the cost of round-trip
airfare and 6 nights lodging and per diem will be approximately $2000 - $2400.
An individual award of $1200 will partially cover these travel costs. Awards for
graduate students and early career faculty with no source of funding will be
allocated at $1500. The participation of U.S. mathematical and computational
scientists in the ICIAM 07 scientific program is again expected to be strong.
