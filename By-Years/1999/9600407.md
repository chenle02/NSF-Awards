Three aspects of positron molecule interactions are investigated experimentally:
annihilation rates, annihilation gamma ray spectra and the formation of positive
ions. Previous research has indicated that the annihilation rates in larger
organic molecules are dominated by long-lived complexes. This has raised new
questions about the attachment process which may have significant implications
for cosmic annihilation spectra and galactic evolution.
