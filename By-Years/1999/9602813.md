The Biology Department at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is undergoing a
rapid expansion in research and research training. Much of this surge in
research is attributed to the activity of six faculty members and their students
in the areas of plant ecology, insect ecology and reproductive behavior, and the
ecology and phylogeny of fishes. Investigative studies are performed in a 92
year-old greenhouse and designated facilities in the Hover Building. The
greenhouse has long outlived its functional usefulness, and research space for
ecological studies involving fish research has not been renovated since the
building was constructed in 1940. Because no other facilities exist at EMU for
maintaining either plants or fish, research has been severely restricted,
critical experiments in existing projects are not feasible, and research
activities undertaken in botanical and ecological courses have been hampered.
Funding from the ARI Program will be used to replace greenhouse and aquarium
rooms into a single structure. The combined terrestrial and aquatic facility
will include three separate rooms for maintaining specific greenhouse
conditions, a terrestrial ecology laboratory and an aquatic ecology laboratory.
The renovated facility will improve the quality of research programs and
significantly strengthen the Biology Department's overall curriculum that is
designed to include a research component in numerous courses in botany, zoology
and ecology. With the ability to complete research projects on campus, rather
than work in rented greenhouse space elsewhere, or in distant field locations,
faculty will be available to provide more training opportunities for students.
Eventually, these changes will increase the quality and number of applicants to
the Department, both as undergraduates and graduates, and will enhance EMU's
ability to attract and retain quality faculty.
