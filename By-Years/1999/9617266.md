This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Wyoming to acquire an
upgrade of a Siemens P3 X- ray diffractometer to the P4 model. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1)structural investigations of fluoroalkylphosphine complexes, (2) structural
and reactivity correlations in iron nitrosyls, (3) Diels-Alder reactions within
vesicles and the aggregate morphology of novel surfactants, and (4) structural
studies of nitrogen oxyanions and luminescent molecular rectangles. The X-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules.
