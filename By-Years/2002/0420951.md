This award provides support for the purchase a laser scanning confocal
microscope and an automated rotary microtome for tissue preparation. The
confocal imaging system will be located in a newly renovated and expanded
biological imaging facility where it will be used for faculty and student
research and for instruction. Research uses include a group of projects that all
require high-resolution 3 dimensional localization of cells and molecules within
tissues. These projects include studies of the following: the migration of
lymphatic heart myoblasts in amphibian embryos; the progression and origin of a
syndrome in drosophila that resembles the human degenerative brain disease
spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SC3); the regulation of binding of the
microtubule motor protein kinesin to intracellular cargoes; the formation of new
brain nerve cells that may enhance cognitive ability of pregnant and nursing
rats; the regulation of the flow of oxygen to light-making enzymes in fireflies.
The automated microtome will replace an obsolete 40-year old instrument. In
addition to use in faculty and student research, the microscope will be employed
in existing Microanatomy, Developmental Biology, Comparative Anatomy, Principles
of Neuroscience, and Neurobiology courses. The microscope is expected to enhance
faculty and student research collaborations between psychology and biology
departments and strengthen a neuroscience concentration which requires students
to perform a year of independent research. The instrument will also be used by
students and faculty at Randolph Macon College. An experienced microscopy
technician will direct the imaging facility, maintain the confocal microscope
and other imaging equipment, train new users, and assist faculty and students in
carrying out their research.&lt;br/&gt;
