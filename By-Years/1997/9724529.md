This grant acquires an ultra-high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer
(FTS) to study gas phase compounds. The instrument, used jointly by researchers
in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Denver, develops and implements FTS methods to
measure atmospheric gas phase compounds at remote field sites. In addition, the
investigators explore new research directions, including evaluating and
understanding deployment issues involved in atmospheric remote sensing;
acquisition of solar absorption spectra; gas cell absorption studies of
molecular species; analysis of synthesized chemical substances coupled to
electronic and molecular absorptions; and identification of chemical reaction
products. The researchers have historically incorporated students in their
research; accordingly, the additional FTS instrument is an instructional tool
for graduate and undergraduate training in gas phase spectroscopy at the
University of Denver. ATM-9724529
