This award supports participation in a conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry
to be held at the University of Miami from January 27 through February 31, 2020.
Mirror symmetry originated in physics as a duality between superconformal
quantum field theories. This duality has been interpreted in a consistent,
powerful mathematical framework called Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) that
has led to dramatic developments in how the mathematical community approaches
ideas from theoretical physics, and indeed our conception of space itself.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today HMS is established as one of the most powerful
frameworks for building bridges between seemingly unrelated parts of modern
geometry. Traditionally HMS has been incredibly successful in discovering novel
phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic and contact topology
informed by algebraic geometry. The goal of this conference is to highlight the
flow of ideas in the opposite direction: from symplectic to complex geometry.
The conference will summarize recently developed connections between Hodge
Theory and HMS which have striking algebraic applications and give new insights
into rationality problems. In particular, the conference will focus on new
cutting-edge directions of investigation: (1) birational invariants and gluing
of D-modules; (2) extending the scope of Homological Mirror Symmetry; (3)
categorical Kaehler geometry; and (4) topological recursion. The conference
