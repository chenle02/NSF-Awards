The project is devoted to the study of mathematical models in statistical
mechanics. It deals with hyperbolic dynamical systems that have their origins in
physical studies of electrical current, conductivity, diffusion, and gases of
molecules. Hyperbolicity is a key feature used to derive laws of electrodynamics
and thermodynamics, or otherwise to describe the macroscopic behavior of the
underlying systems of particles. Specific models to be treated in the project
include gases of hard balls (in particular, those emulating Brownian motion),
Lorentz gases (imitating electrons in metals), and the Galton board (a physics
analogue of a pinball machine). The proposal also deals with the dynamics of
fluids governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and quasi-geostrophic equations.
The main tools of the proposed studies are methods of hyperbolic dynamics,
averaging theories, and stochastic processes. The proposal deals with problems
originating in physics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, and statistical
mechanics. Its main goal is to study complex physical phenomena by exact
mathematics and derive precise laws of nature. In many cases the principal
investigator hopes to obtain rigorous mathematical descriptions of physical
processes that have been only known empirically or qualitatively. In some cases
the mathematical analysis reveals new features of complex evolution models that
have been overlooked or unnoticed in experimental studies. The principal
investigator closely collaborates with physicists and statisticians on several
join research projects.
