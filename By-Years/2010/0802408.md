Over a three-year period, Southwestern College (SWC) is developing and
establishing a comprehensive program in Geospatial Technology (GST). GST is the
specialized set of information technologies (such as aerial photography, remote
sensing, surveying, and global positioning systems) that supports a wide variety
of uses, including data acquisition, data storage and manipulation, image
analysis, and geovisualization display and output. Because San Diego County is
home to a large number of companies that utilize GST, a significant need exists
within the workforce of San Diego County for personnel trained in the theory and
use of geospatial technology software and hardware, particularly for spatial
analysis and geovisualization applications. The Earth Science and Physical
Science Departments at SWC, along with faculty from disciplinary divisions
across the entire campus, are increasing the professional opportunities for
residents of the SWC District while supplying the local science and industry
sectors with highly qualified geospatial technicians.

The core of the GST program is the implementation of three new courses
emphasizing hands-on experience with the hardware, software, and techniques
employed in science, industry, and academia and the incorporation of GST
learning modules into other existing courses. Other valuable services of the
program are: 1) professional development for college and high school faculty in
GST theory and applications; 2) placement of community college students into
baccalaureate programs and undergraduate GST research projects; and 3) placement
of students into professional, paid internships. The GST program is promoting
the intellectual development of a community of learners who are underserved and
in need. With the college's student enrollment of greater than 80% ethnic
minorities, not only is the Southwestern College GST program providing quality
technicians to a regional workforce in need, it is also increasing the number of
technical employees from underrepresented groups.
