The Department of Earth Sciences is upgrading its meteorology computer
laboratory for undergraduates. The laboratory is being used to achieve a full
integration of Unidata computer- based meteorological analysis and display
packages into the introductory, synoptic, weather briefing, climatology and
weather forecasting courses. The laboratory also makes possible the development
of a new senior level course in mesometeorology and is enhancing the ability of
undergraduates to engage in independent research studies.
