Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are increasingly important in global
environmental governance. NGOs contribute to the shaping of how the
international community frames global environmental problems by raising public
awareness, lobbying national governments, providing technical expertise during
international negotiations, and helping states implement and monitor
international agreements. Despite the importance of NGOs, the community has not
developed a productive analytical framework for studying NGOs.

Michelle Betsill and three American colleagues will work with four European
scholars at a workshop on (1) refining an analytical framework, (2) developing
an edited volume comprised of the papers at the workshop, and (3) producing a
research agenda for future work. In addition of the seven scholars,
approximately eight others - government policy makers and NGO practitioners -
will attend sessions of the workshop in Stockholm in June 2003.
