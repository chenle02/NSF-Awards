Boise State University will purchase a high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy
system, and a fast Fourier transform spectrum analyzer. This equipment will be
used to provide research opportunities for undergraduate physics majors, and to
improve instruction in a senior physics laboratory course and a senior computer
science course. Planned student projects include the identification of
radioactive isotopes in environmental samples, and investigations of magnet flux
properties in high-temperature superconductors. Boise State University will
match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
