This research will be on problems related to the question of supersingular
primes for a given elliptic curve over a number field. Immediate goals include a
proof of a natural sufficient condition for the infinitude of supersingular
primes in the totally imaginary case and unconditional explicit lower bounds on
the density of such primes. Further goals will include the nonzero fixed trace
problem (of which many old classical problems are special cases) and various
other open problems in the arithmetic of elliptic curves and abelian varieties
of higher dimension. The area of this research is in that branch of number
theory which studies certain cubic equations and the number of rational
solutions of them (elliptic curves). The subject has connections throughout
mathematics and has been instrumental in solving many problems in number theory
concerning many topics. The number of solutions of the equation modulo primes is
a central focus in the subject and this is the area focused on by this
investigator.
