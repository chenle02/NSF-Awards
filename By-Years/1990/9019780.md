The objective of this research is to determine the cellular, physiological, and
biophysical basis for gigantothermy in the leatherback sea turtle. The following
hypotheses will be tested: 1. The tissue metabolic rate of leatherback muscle is
elevated above that of green turtles and intermediate between that of green
turtles and mammals. 2. Aerobic metabolism is the primary source of energy for
activity of nesting, and other exercise. 3. Leatherbacks maintain constant
elevated body temperatures while active and at rest in both warm (tropical) and
cold (north temperate) waters. 4. Blood flow to the skin and periphery is
increased when on land, and while exercising in warm (tropical) waters, and
reduced when in cold (north temperate) water. These hypotheses will be tested by
completing the following experiments: 1. Measure the tissue metabolic rate of
the pectoral muscles of leatherbacks and green turtles at temperatures from 5 to
35oC using a Gilson respirometer. 2. Measure the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic
rates of adult leatherbacks while they are resting and active on land in the
tropics and north temperate region. 3. Use multichannel sonic transmitters to
measure the body temperature of resting and active turtles in warm and cold
waters. 4. Measure skin blood flow using the 133xenon washout technique. Finally
these data will be used to test a mathematical model that predicts the effects
of body size and metabolic rate on heat transfer and body temperatures of
leatherbacks on land and in the water.//
