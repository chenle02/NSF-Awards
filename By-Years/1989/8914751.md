This award supports cooperative research in science education to be carried out
by Sally Duensing of the Exploratorium in San Francisco and Maurice Bazin,
Director of Espaco Ciencia Viva (Living Science Space) in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. The focus of this research will be the investigation of significant
cross-cultural issues in informal science education, both for the general public
and specifically in working with elementary and middle-school teachers. The work
will begin with a comparison of the ways exhibits are used as adjunctive
teaching materials by museums in different cultural settings. Because of their
work with poor communities in Rio, Espaco Ciencia Viva focuses on more socially
relevant issues in exhibits and programs. This can have a powerful effect on the
differences involved in the communication of science to different cultural
groups, a currently vital need in the U.S. as well as in other countries
particularly in a time of global concerns about scientific issues. Then, there
is the question of how access to modern technology affects the understanding of
science and scientific issues and thus affects approaches to teaching. The
museums will exchange staff who are actively involved in the creation of
exhibits and educational materials and also in teacher education programs. The
visits will be scheduled when teaching programs are under way. Participation in
these programs will provide the basis for sharing ideas and for making the
cross-cultural observations of the differences in teaching science to students
and to teachers of very different background levels. Because both institutions
have some exhibits in common, the visiting staff will study how teachers use
exhibits with similar overall content and function in different contexts.
Clearly, each institution will derive new ideas from the other in areas of
materials development, science education, teacher training and public awareness
of science.
