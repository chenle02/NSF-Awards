The Maryland Undergraduate Mathematics Enhancement Program (MUMEP) supports a
regional coalition of mathematics faculty from two- and four-year Maryland
institutions in the region near the University of Maryland, College Park campus.
Through workshops and seminars, MUMEP fosters communication among regional
mathematics departments. A week-long workshop is offered during each of the
summers of 1993 and 1994, devoted to visual thinking in mathematics. Mathematics
topics are chosen from chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry. Workshop
participants will gain hands-on experience working individually and in small
groups. During each academic year following the respective summer workshop,
regional seminars are held in which participants continue the mathematical and
curricular dialogue begun during the workshops.
