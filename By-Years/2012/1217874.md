This project takes a novel look at Complex Networks and related problems in data
mining and signal processing. Issues arising in Complex Networks are formulated
as intrinsically topological problems which, when studied using algebraic
topological tools, affords highly efficient and effective solutions. The
algebraic approach yields distributed computations, and naturally unveils
topological information about the underlying network for strategic planning of
mitigation. In particular, this unified view allows tackling problems of
dynamics and evolution of networks, where time-varying properties may in turn be
used for network healing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efficient developed
solutions will have an impact on data mining analysis, and provide more insight
into the associated strengths and limitations, as well as other network related
applications in a broad variety of networks.
