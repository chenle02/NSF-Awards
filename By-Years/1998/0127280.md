Computer Science (31) This project is developing curricular materials for an
interdisciplinary digital media program to meet four needs: (1) the high
interest that college students are showing in digital media, (2) the growing
demand for digital media professionals, (3) the need for course material that
addresses both the technical and the aesthetic elements of multimedia creation,
and (4) the need for a curriculum that balances hands-on experience with
fundamental concepts that remain constant beyond fast-changing multimedia
development tools. The primary goal of the project is to develop materials that
are appropriate to students of either computer science or art, to find the core
curriculum necessary for both groups of students, and to present this
interdisciplinary material in a well-integrated, modular approach.

The curricular materials are divided into three modules: (1) a primer that
provides fundamental knowledge required of all students and that concentrates on
hands-on exercises; (2) an advanced module that provides the scientific,
technical, and mathematical foundation for the students understanding of digital
media; and (3) an advanced module that addresses the aesthetics and graphic
design issues. The materials cover image processing, digital audio, and digital
video and are delivered in an electronic format (Web, CD-ROM, and e-books) with
interactive multimedia enhancements.
