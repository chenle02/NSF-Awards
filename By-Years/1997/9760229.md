*** 9760229 Facello This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
explore a novel approach to automatic quality surface and volume mesh generation
for 3D models. The software to be developed will be a critical extension to the
firm's Wrap that reconstructs surfaces and solids from arbitrary 3D point data,
providing the ability to automatically produce quality surface and volume meshes
directly from the output of 3D scanners. Currently, mesh generation is often a
separate package apart from the modeling software, and the creation of a finite
element analysis (FEA) model is a time consuming process requiring a tedious
translation of the computer assisted design (CAD) model into an FEA model or the
construction of a new, duplicate model in the FEA environment. The inability to
automatically generate meshes with guaranteed local quality has hampered the
numerical methods used to analyze complicated geometric shapes. The software
module, if successfully implemented and combined with Wrap, will solve one of
the most difficult problems in mesh generation. The integration of surface
reconstruction and mesh improvement provides a compact solution that will enable
both important time savings and ease of use from the total integration and
automation of modeling and mesh generation for reverse engineering problems. ***
