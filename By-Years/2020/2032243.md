Live bacterial vaccines can be engineered to more effectively trigger a desired
immune response to prevent infection. This project examines an approach to
making more effective live bacterial vaccines by engineering the bacteria to
introduce certain atypical protein building blocks, called non-native amino
acids (NNAAs), into their proteins. These NNAAs could help stimulate an immune
response against proteins in bacteria that would usually evade the immune
response, thus leading to more effective vaccines. As part of this project,
undergraduate students will receive mentoring and resources to conduct projects
related to non-standard amino acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metabolic engineering
strategies will be utilized to create a de novo biochemical pathway that forms a
nitroaromatic amino acid. The nitro chemical functional group has scarcely been
explored as a product of metabolic engineering. Therefore, the stability and
toxicity of relevant nitro compounds will be explored. In parallel, the
substrate specificity of engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNA pairs
will be examined in order to facilitate template-directed incorporation of this
amino acid within proteins. This project will also study whether the immunogenic
amino acid can be introduced to a model bacterial antigen without disrupting key
structural features, and how the mouse immune system responds to the modified
and unmodified antigen. Overall, this project will generate foundational
knowledge and tools that may lead to the first application of metabolic
engineering to vaccine research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
