Isolation and Study of a Murine Macrophage Homeo Box cDNA: This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, l987/l988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the apllicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. The central question
about mammalian homeo box genes is whether they control mammalian development as
dramatically as the fruit fly homeo box genes control insect development. In
order to answer this question, mammalian homeo box genes must first be isolated.
This project will isolate and sequence a mouse macrophage homeo box gene cDNA.
The project is under the direction of Dr. Tom R. Hollon, Department of
Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, U.S.A., and Professor
Philippe Brulet, Institut Pasteur, 28, rue du Dr. Roux, 75724 Paris, France.
This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international
travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable,
language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for
the U.S. home institution.
