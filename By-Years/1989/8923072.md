Two aspects of Arctic oceanography, convection and cross-boundary exchange in a
lead and the interaction of topographic features on the bottom side of the ice
pack with fluid motions will be studied using a numerical models. Both studies
will use a two- dimensional adaptation of an existing three-dimensional
primitive-equation model with sigma coordinates that uses the Mellor-Yamada
level 2.5 turbulence closure. Basic understanding of important exchange
processes will result from this work.
