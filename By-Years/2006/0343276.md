This is a proposal to organize the International Workshop on Languages and
Compilers for Parallel Computing, which is the 16th consecutive year that the
PIs are organizing the workshop. The workshop covers all aspects of languages,
compiler techniques, run-time environments, and architectures for parallel and
high-performance computing. Since 1988, the annual LCPC workshops have provided
a forum for leading researchers and practitioners to present their latest work
and to exchange ideas about future directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The papers
published in the proceedings of the workshop have been widely cited over the
years and many of them have represented the first public presentation of
innovative ideas. The participation is truly international with speakers from
the US, Japan and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the workshop covers many
topics, the emphasis has always been software, e.g., compilers, languages, run-
time systems, performance evaluation for parallel systems. Moreover, LCPC has
also been an occasion for graduate students to meet more senior researchers in
this informal setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
