9352344 Carr The School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma will
improve the quality and scope of its undergraduate education for both majors and
nonmajors through the creation of a computer-based synoptic laboratory. This
facility primarily consists of a network of UNIX-based servers and X terminals,
and enables students to access and effectively process current and/or archived
meteorological data using software produced by the UPC (UNIDATA Program Center).
The facility meets three needs. First, it will permit more innovative techniques
in exposing nonmajors to scientific concepts which may impact their daily lives,
and allow them to gain a better understanding of local and global weather,
climate, and environmental issues. Second, this facility will satisfy the need
of undergraduate majors in atmospheric science to utilize, software packages on
X terminals for simultaneous viewing of text and raster image graphics in a
classroom environment. This laboratory will greatly facilitate the teaching of
important meteorological concepts via real-time use of conventional, profiler,
surface mesonetwork, satellite, radar, and model data. Third, the School will
convert from a VMS computing environment to a UNIX-based one, enabling it to
fully participate as a primary node in the distribution of weather data over the
Internet. The creation of a computer-based synoptic laboratory addresses these
crucial needs because of the versatility and power of the UNIX-based servers,
and the enhanced graphics capabilities of the X terminals. The quality of
undergraduate instruction will be improved considerably since faculty and
students will be able to utilize UPC software packages with current or archived
meteorological data in both classroom and research endeavors. ***
