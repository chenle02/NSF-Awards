David S. Glueck, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth College, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his work on
stereoselective P-C bond formation. Glueck has recently shown that a chiral
Pd(0) complex catalyzes the asymmetric coupling of a secondary phosphine (RR'PH)
with an aryl halide (ArX) to give a chiral tertiary phosphine (RR'ArP*). The
mechanism of this reaction and the factors leading to the high stereoselectivity
will be explored. One key factor to be studied is the relative rate of
phosphorus inversion and reductive elimination in Pd phosphido complexes. The
stereochemistry and diastereoselectivity of transmetalation and of reductive
elimination will also be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral phosphines are
frequently used in asymmetric catalytic transformations such as hydrogenation.
The new "chiral at phosphorus" ligands prepared by Glueck are a complement to
the better-known "backbone chirality" phosphines where a chiral alkyl group is
attached to the phosphorus. In addition to these potential industrial
applications, students working on this project will develop a broad set of
skills in synthesis, characterization and catalysis.
