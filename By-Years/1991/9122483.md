Managers must know how to help individuals make technological transitions
without detriment to productivity and well-being. The purpose of this Research
Planning Grant is to support the investigator in completing preliminary
activities necessary to develop a long-term program of research on the process
of technological change and the worker/task interface. During the project
development phase, survey instruments will be refined and possible research
sites will be evaluated.
