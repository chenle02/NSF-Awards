Learning and memory requires specific chemical modifications of neuronal
structure and interactions between the neurons in the nervous system. There are
a number of chemical substances in cells, such as calmodulin that phosphorylate
specific enzymes responsible for the chemical modifications. Another of these
important substances recently discovered and found only in nerve is a compound
called neurogranin. Like calmodulin and the associated calcium/calmodulin
dependent protein kinase II, neurogranin may regulate the availability of active
calmodulin in nerve cells. In order to better understand the processes
associated with learning and memory the location of neurogranin within the
neuron, how it gets to its site of action from the site of its synthesis and how
neurogranin regulates the availability of calmodulin must be determined.
