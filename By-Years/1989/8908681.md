It is a well.established finding in the study of interpersonal relationships
that individuals prefer association with others who are similar to themselves.
On the other hand, there is evidence that extreme similarity can be aversive and
that individuals seek to establish distinctiveness from others as part of the
maintenance of self identity. The current research is based on the premise that
individuals select group memberships in order to meet simultaneously their
competing needs for social differentiation and inclusion. Laboratory studies of
artificially created groups and field studies of natural groups will be combined
to test predictions that individuals prefer membership in distinctive subgroups
(rather than majority groups) and will make efforts to preserve distinctive
group identity even when such identification is disadvantageous. The results of
these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of social group
membership in establishing and maintaining individual self identity and mental
health.
