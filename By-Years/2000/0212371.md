Organization of behavioral plasticity by neurochemicals Gene E. Robinson,
Principal Investigator

Many animals show profound changes in behavior as they grow up, and these
changes are based on maturational changes in the structure and functioning of
the brain. Like other forms of behavioral plasticity, behavioral maturation
involves coordinated change in many different aspects of behavior and is
accompanied by extensive changes in neurochemistry. Previous NSF funding led to
the discovery that octopamine influences the behavioral maturation of the honey
bee, specifically the age at which honey bees shift from working in the hive to
foraging. Octopamine is a biogenic amine, which is a prominent class of
neurochemicals that regulate behavior in many organisms, vertebrate and
invertebrate, including humans. This proposal seeks to use octopamine to explore
precisely which behavioral mechanisms need to be affected to orchestrate complex
behavioral maturation. Research will determine whether octopamine acts to
increase responsiveness towards specific environmental stimuli so that a bee
with the occupation of foraging continues in that occupation because of the way
that it reacts to certain stimuli. Other possibilities that will be tested is to
determine whether octopamine promotes foraging behavior by increasing overall
activity or improving the cognitive abilities that are essential for successful
foraging. The research will involve detailed measurements of biogenic amines in
the brains of individual bees, treatments of biogenic amines, and quantitative
behavioral analyses. The honey bee has become an important model system for
studies at the interface of neurobiology, behavior genetics. This research will
provide useful insights into the neurochemical basis of complex behavioral
changes experienced by many social animals, including man, and provide a
demonstration of how brain chemicals influence the development of cognitively
demanding tasks.
