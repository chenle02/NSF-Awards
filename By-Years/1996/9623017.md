Professor Michael L. Klein is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the area of computer
simulation and modeling of structural and dynamical phenomena in molecular
solids and polar fluids. Both classical molecular dynamics and Car-Parrinello ab
initio molecular dynamics will be used to characterize the behavior of a variety
of condensed molecular systems including polymers, metal-ammonia solutions, and
organo-lithium compounds. A path integral version of Car-Parrinello molecular
dynamics will be used to study quantum phenomena such as proton motion in
selected solids and liquids. Attempts will also be made to develop and implement
novel methodologies and algorithms for condensed phase simulations with
increasing emphasis on massively parallel computing. Computer simulation of
molecular systems is providing many rich insights into chemical behavior at the
molecular level. As the computer algorithms and force field models continue to
improve, it becomes possible to study larger systems, and to gain useful
insights regarding more and more physical and chemical properties. Using a
combination of simulation techniques including molecular dynamics, quantum Monte
Carlo, and Car-Parinello theory, Klein is able to perform computer simulations
on systems consisting of large numbers of molecules such as crystalline
substances, and metal ammonia solutions. He is able to study a number of
important chemical and physical properties of interest in the design of new
materials.
