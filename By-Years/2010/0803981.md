Lopez (0607195)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pilot Project for Research in Visualization
for Geoscience Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot project will
investigate the cognitive aspects of visualization in selected topics in Earth
and Space Science education, and explore which visualization strategies have the
greatest positive effect on student learning and comprehension. Visualizations
are a common tool for teaching fundamental geoscience concepts and yet what
students learn from them or how effective they are at conveying correct
information is as yet poorly documented. Building on similar research within the
physics and astronomy communities, this project will conduct studies that
compare how well students learn common geoscience concepts when they are taught
using 2-D versus 3-D visualizations or when multiple visual representations are
used. The study will also explore how students interpret (or misinterpret)
widely used geoscience teaching visuals. Pre- and post-testing comparisons will
be document student comprehension and how it relates to the effectiveness of
instructional materials. Videotaped interviews and analysis will help to clarify
student thinking as they interpret visualizations. Studies will be conducted in
both the Florida Institute of Technologys Whole Earth course, taken by a
disparate group of students with highly variable background (including many who
are pre-service teachers), and the introductory Astronomy course sequence. The
results of this research will lead to improved geoscience education at Florida
Tech, particularly for the pre-service teachers participating in the Whole Earth
Course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
