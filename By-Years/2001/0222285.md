Funds are provided to process the data collected on two geophysical cruises in
the Sea of Marmara. The PIs will combine the results from the collected chirp,
sidescan, and bathymetric data with detailed sedimentology of piston cores and
land-based observations to work out the configuration of the fault zone and to
determine the history of paleoseismicity by correlating submarine landslides and
turbidites to individual paloearthquakes. The work will have important societal
relevance as it will lead to better understanding of the nature of deformation
associated with the earthquakes and their history in the region.
