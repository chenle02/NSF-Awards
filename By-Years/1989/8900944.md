Under the supervision of her thesis advisor, Dr. Patricia L. Crown, Ms. Maria
N. Zedeno will analyze 310 whole andrestored archaeological vessels for her
doctoral dissertation research. These materials, recovered from Chodistaas
Pueblo, located in east central Arizona, provide an excellent data base since
all were recovered in secure archaeological context from a site which was
occupied for less than fifty years. With assistance from scientists at the
University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution, Ms. Zedeno will determine
clay sources through trace element analysis of ceramics and comparison with
known clay sources in the region. Through petrographic and other analyses, she
will reconstruct the techniques by which the pottery was constructed, and she
will also conduct a stylistic analysis of design styles. Comparisons will then
be made among different sets of data. To reconstruct trade and other interaction
networks, archaeologists often analyze ceramics at archaeological sites in an
attempt to determine which types were made locally and which were imported from
elsewhere. Such studies are often based on either examination of design or
techniques of manufacture and include unfounded assumptions about how these
variables relate to point of origin. Ms. Zedeno will evaluate such assumptions
through analysis of the chronologically limited, stratigraphically secure
Chodistaas Pueblo sample. Trace element data should provide a basis against
which stylistic and technological variables can be measured. This research is
important not only for what it will reveal about cultural interaction in the
U.S. Southwest but also for its broader methodological significance. It will be
of interest to a wide range of archaeologists.
