This Career Advancement Award is supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. Professor Georgiadis and her students at Boston University
will study the interactions and properties of nucleic acids at interfaces using
in situ two-color surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Self-assembled
monolayers of oligonucleotides on surfaces and the factors that control
hybridization selectivity in DNA and peptide nucleic acid films will be studied.
This work has potential for developing extended DNA arrays that will be useful
in studies DNA-drug interactions. Monolayers of biomolecules on surfaces will be
studied by an extremely sensitive surface spectroscopic method, surface plasmon
resonance spectroscopy, using two colors of light. This new method has been
developed in this laboratory. The properties of the biomolecules as they
interact with compounds that are candidates for drugs will be measured and used
to understand these chemical reactions. This information will also be useful in
developing rapid nucleotide sequencing data for DNA and other nucleic acids.
