This award will provide funding for the “Integers Conference 2020,” which will
be held in Augusta, Georgia, October 1-4, 2020. The conference is being hosted
by the Department of Mathematics at Augusta University. The Integers
conferences, of which this will be the ninth, serve to bring together
mathematicians and students interested in the fields of combinatorics and number
theory. It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career
stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished
researcher. A large portion of the funding will support students, early-career
faculty, and mathematicians belonging to underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve as a catalyst for major
collaborative projects among mathematicians representing the areas of additive
number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial game theory,
probabilistic number theory, enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial
optimization, Ramsey theory, the theory of partitions, and other areas of
combinatorics and number theory. It will feature four plenary talks and around
sixty additional talks. The conference organizers plan to support ten student
research talks, including talks presented by students who have recently
participated in an NSF “Research Experiences for Undergraduates” program. The
proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the
journal Integers. The following website has been created for the conference:

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
