The purchase of a FT-IR spectrometer and associated computer hardware and
software is an important feature in the vertical (course to course) integration
of the laboratory programs. A series of progressively challenging and
instructive hands-on experiments centered around the spectrometer are being used
to demonstrate the capabilities of modern instrumentation and computerized data
manipulations. For example, students in the Organic Chemistry course laboratory
use the instrument to record spectra of compounds and to identify unknowns using
the database available. Also, junior students use the spectrometer in analytical
and kinetics experiments where the advantages of the instrument is more fully
explored. Senior students use the instrument extensively to tackle problems
encountered in their collaborative research activities with faculty members. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
