9414375 Sitar This action is to support the collection of geotechnical
engineering data on the Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 , so as to
better understand the cause and effects of earthquake strong ground shaking. The
overall objective in gathering this perishable data is to apply the knowledge
gained to help mitigate the effects of future earthquakes. For this project,
particular focus is directed towards gathering data for assessing the following:
(1) the liquefaction (that is, ground failure) and ground compaction, and the
associated ground displacements, (2) the effect of local soil conditions on
ground shaking characteristics and damage patterns, (3) the seismic response of
natural slopes, and (4) the seismic response of earth structures such as dams,
embankments, solid waste landfills, mechanically stabilized retaining
structures, and structural fills. ***
