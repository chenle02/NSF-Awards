SES-0242269&lt;br/&gt;Lorraine Bayard de Volo&lt;br/&gt;University of
Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the role of gendered discourse
in the mobilization of women in Latin American wars of the last half-century.
Historically and across many cultures men have been the most likely participants
in wars of all kinds (e.g., civil, guerrilla, international) and other large-
scale civil and international conflicts. Research findings document a fairly
consistent "gender gap" in support for war, with men much more likely to support
and participate in war than women. Researchers note that official and informal
appeals for male participants in wars tend to focus on masculinist values such
as honor, patriotism, virility, and defense of home and territory. This project
examines the other side of the gender coin: what are the conditions under which
women will support and participate in wars? This study examines variations in
women's support of state-sponsored and/or guerrilla wars in four Latin American
countries (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Nicaragua) chosen for variations in
the engagement and support of women in conflicts and focuses on the kinds of
appeals and arguments made by governments, guerrilla organizations, and
mobilized women's groups to garner women's support and participation in war as
well as several other national-level factors: feminism (national and
transnational); regime type (mobilizing, exclusionary, or repressive regime);
and war type (internal vs. external war; "manpower" needs of the military).
Archival, interview, and field data will be used to address the following
questions. How are women mobilized for and against war? What explains changes
over time in the methods and mobilization frames? Why do gender imagery and
attempts to mobilize women figure more prominently in some wars than others? How
might we explain discursive changes such as that of the shift in guerrilla
rhetoric from Che Guevara's "New Man" to the Zapatistas' feminist-friendly
rhetoric? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
