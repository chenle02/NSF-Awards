The proposed research program exploits the Rochester 4p heavy-ion detector
CHICO, plus Gammasphere, this nation's premier high-resolution gamma-ray
facility, at heavy-ion beam facilities in order to probe the structure of nuclei
at high angular momentum as well as far from stability. The Yale-Rochester YRAST
gamma-ray detector array, which is coupled to the Yale 20MV tandem accelerator,
will be used to complement the proposed research program at Gammasphere. The
developments of CHICO, contributions to Gammasphere, and the techniques of
Coulomb excitation, heavy-ion induced transfer, and fission-fragment
spectroscopy, are the culmination of many years of effort at Rochester. These
are used to study collective modes of motion in nuclei, to probe single-particle
and pairing degrees of freedom and to explore exotic neutron-rich nuclei far
from stability. The research has applications such as the planned studies of
exotic metastable (isomeric) states in nuclei may provide a means of using
stimulated isomer decay for energy storage or for building gamma-ray lasers.
Cline will continue to be involved in the development of the next generation
high-resolution gamma-ray detector technology that employs the new concept of
tracking the location and energy of every gamma-ray interaction. Such detectors
will provide a resolving power that is orders of magnitude better than currently
available, enabling studies that at present are inaccessible to nuclear science.
Besides having an enormous impact on nuclear science, the potential impact of
such gamma-ray tracking and imaging detectors will be considerable to a wide
range of applications, including astrophysics, medicine, industry, and nuclear
safeguards. The proposed research program will be an ideal environment for
graduate and post-doctoral education.
