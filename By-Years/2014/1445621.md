This project addresses needs for research outlined in the 2013 National Research
Council report, Monitoring Progress Toward Successful K-12 Education: A Nation
Advancing?, which proposed indicators related to improving STEM education.
Specifically, the project will address research on indicator 2, time allocated
to teach science in grades K-5, and indicator 3, science-related learning
opportunities in elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, to be
conducted by the University California, Berkeley, will address the issue of
measuring instructional time and adequacy of resources for science education in
grades K-5. The project will review existing evidence related to time, type, and
substance of science learning experiences in elementary schools, conduct
interviews and surveys of key informants, convene an expert panel in order to
approach consensus related to measurement strategy and implementation
recommendations, document research findings and expert recommendations, and lay
groundwork for next steps regarding implementation of measurement systems. The
project will advance the work of the Education &amp; Human Resources (EHR)
directorate in fostering research on science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) education.
