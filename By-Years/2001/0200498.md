The overall objective of this research project is to understand the fundamental
science affecting the nanoscale processing of plastics. Manufacturing is
responsible for control of molecular morphology and geometry. At the nanoscale,
control implies understanding interfacial effects. While much of the current
nanotechnology research has focused on ceramic and metallic materials, there has
been relatively little work done on the processing of polymers at the nanoscale.
Yet, because of their low density, high toughness, and versatility, polymers
will play an important role in the nanotechnology revolution. We intend to focus
on the effect of polymer properties and process conditions on "internal"
interfaces between phases in polymer blends and on the "external"
material/tooling interface. Applications of this technology include extruded
multicomponent thin films for conformable, high-density data or energy storage,
injection-molded low-cost calibration standards, and electrospun nanowires and
nanotextiles for circuits and selectively permeable membranes. This research
project builds upon our unique strengths in the area of plastics processing, our
exceptional contacts with industry and government labs, and our
interdisciplinary interactions with faculty in polymer chemistry and the
engineering programs at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell
(UML).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discoveries made as a part of this research
project will be broadly disseminated through support of graduate and
undergraduate students and yearly workshops open to industry and academia. To
educate industry and the general public, a series of nanotechnology seminars
will be developed in conjunction with UML's highly successful continuing
education plastics seminar program. For the broader audience, through
coordination by the UML Institute for NanoScience and Engineering Technology and
the College of Engineering, the excitement of nanotechnology and research in
general will be conveyed to middle school and high school students and teachers
with hands-on demos and activities.
