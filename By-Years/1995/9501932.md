The evolution of geometric and photometric attributes of 2D organizational
structures can not only provide evidence for the underlying structure and motion
but also help infer complex motions. This research will develop a computational
theory to extract structural and motion information from long image sequences by
exploiting perceptual organizational principles. Simple motions will be grouped
to infer about complex motion. An efficient computational framework will be
developed to monitor the evolution of the organizational structures. Detection
of the 2-D organizations isbased on graph theory and voting methods, and a
modification of Bayesian networks. These 2D organizations are then tracked
through the image sequence to generate traces of their photometric and geometric
properties. This research will open up possibilities for the development of new
tools for motion understanding using organizational principles.
