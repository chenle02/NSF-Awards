This award provides continued funding to Colorado State University (CSU) for the
support of a 3-year REU Site entitled, "Research Experiences for Undergraduates
in Chemical Engineering Using the Colorado Bioprocessing," under the direction
of Dr. Vincent G. Murphy. This 10-week summer program will provide an
opportunity for 8 undergraduate students from other institutions to participate
in a variety of bioprocessing research opportunities at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels in preparation for a career in bioprocessing research and
development. The students will work on individual research projects in the
Colorado Bioprocessing Center (CBC) with the guidance and support of a faculty
advisor and CBC staff. In addition the students will participate in weekly
colloquia and a concluding symposium where they will share their research
experiences with fellow participants.
