Candidates for public office regularly make vague statements that leave voters
uncertain about the policies they intend to pursue. Why do candidates employ
ambiguity, and what are the consequences? Two factors have impeded empirical
research on these fundamental questions. First, existing datasets do not measure
the ambiguity in candidate statements and distinguish it from other sources of
uncertainty. Second, previous research had difficulty distinguishing causes from
effects; the perceived and actual ambiguity of candidates may depend on, as well
as influence, the preferences of voters.

The Principal Investigators will puruse a two-pronged investigation of the
relationship between candidate ambiguity and voter choice. First, they will run
survey experiments that manipulate the ambiguity of candidate platforms. In
their experiments, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults will chose
between candidates who state policy positions with varying levels of ambiguity.
The experiments will reveal whether, and under what conditions, candidates can
gain or lose support by taking ambiguous positions.

In the second prong of the study, the Principal Investigators will study the
actual uses of ambiguity in U.S. elections by analyzing the transcripts of all
presidential debates since 1960. The data will shed new light on many questions:
Do candidates avoid or limit their ambiguity in circumstances when our
experiments suggest that ambiguity would be harmful? Do candidates use ambiguity
differently in primaries than in general elections? Do candidates employ
strategies of ambiguity more often on complex issues, or on issues owned by
their party or gender? And do candidates call attention to ambiguity when our
experiments show that it could be advantageous?

In addition to advancing our understanding of politics, the project will have
several broader impacts. It will actively involve undergraduate and graduate
students in scholarly research; develop new experimental methods that could be
used to study other features of campaigns; and provide practical lessons for
candidates, advisors, and citizens who are involved in political campaigns.
