This project concerns investigations of fundamental problems at the interface of
differential geometry, partial differential equations and theoretical physics.
The fundamental laws of nature are described in the language of mathematics
using ideas from differential geometry and partial differential equations.
Understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations is an
important part of understanding the structure of the universe. This proposal
concerns a centuries-old class of mathematical objects called Monge-Ampere
equations. These equations arise naturally in the study of geometry and are
closely related to Einstein's equation in general relativity and the Hull-
Strominger system from string theory. A main goal of this project is to develop
analytical techniques to investigate the important properties of the solutions
to this type of equations, which will lead to deep understanding of the
fundamental geometric structures. The study requires a broad range of tools from
real and complex analysis, as well as algebraic and differential geometry.
Progress on these questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems
in mathematics, but will also have applications in physics and other sciences.

This project will investigate the interaction between fully nonlinear partial
differential equations and complex geometry. In particular, the investigator
will study the solvability of complex Monge-Ampere type equations deduced from
the study of a generalized Hull-Strominger system in string theory, which can be
viewed as a generalization of Ricci-flat metrics on non-Kahler complex
manifolds. Building on his joint work with Phong and Picard, the investigator
will develop new analytic techniques for further understanding of this type of
equation and to provide a complete answer to the question raised by Fu and Yau.
Another major goal of this project is to study the anomaly flow, which was
introduced by the investigator and his coauthors, aiming to develop analytical
methods for solving the Hull-Strominger system on general three dimensional non-
Kahler Calabi-Yau manifolds. Short-time existence of solutions of the flow were
obtained in the joint work with Phong and Picard. The investigator will study
the long-time behavior and convergence of this flow, and will also use this flow
investigate the relation between the balanced cone and the Kahler cone on Kahler
manifolds. To accomplish these goals, the investigator will develop new tools
for the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations
without concavity property.
