This award is for the purchase of two I/O nodes for use with an Intel iPSC/2
computer system. The system supports research in several areas including the
development of a C++ translator and compiler for MIMD architectures, neural
networks for image processing and machine vision, and parallel algorithms for
high level direction finding. There are several problems that can be naturally
adapted to parallel computer architectures. Two such problems are studied under
this award. The first is research in neural networks. These networks have been
proposed as natural models for vision and are easily simulated on parallel
computers. The hope is that real time vision can be accomplished with a complex
enough network. The second problem is in signal processing. The particular
application is automatic direction finding which is a problem whose solution is
important in sonar, surveillance, and seismic application areas. Massive
computation is needed in order to reduce errors introduced by noise in the
signals. The final area of research is in the development of an interpreter and
compiler for the programming language C++. This project will support other
projects by providing a compiler for a modern high level programming language.
