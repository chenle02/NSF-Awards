9601489 Street This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $110,356 as partial support of the costs of acquiring
instrumentation for high-resolution shear-wave investigations within the New
Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ). Specific equipment will include a Minivib seismic
source to produce both compressional and shear waves at sufficient force and at
frequencies enabling penetration to 1.5-2 km depths, a 24-bit, 48 channel
seismograph, geophones and cables, and an upgrade to their current seismic
processing software that will license them to process Vibroseis type data. This
high frequency source and multi-channel seismograph will allow high- resolution
imaging of the semi-consolidated soils that lie over Paleozoic strata in the
Upper Mississippi Embayment. Characterization of the thickness of these layers
and shear wave velocities within these layers will provide useful data for
seismic hazard mitigation and engineering purposes. ***
