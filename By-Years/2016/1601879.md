The explosion of digital data carries a wealth of opportunities. The ability to
collect and mine data at scale continues to enable new applications and
transform our lives. However, privacy concerns are seen as a major hurdle
towards data sharing and analytics. This project develops a practical framework
for "oblivious computation", which allows general computation over sensitive
data, but without disclosing the data.

The proposed work takes a combined algorithms and programming language lens. On
the programming language side, the proposed work designs friendly programming
abstractions that facilitate the compilation of programs into efficient,
oblivious representations. On the algorithms side, the proposed work designs
efficient oblivious algorithms for a wide characterization of realistic tasks.
The resulting framework, ObliVM, allows non-expert developers to write programs
much as they do today, and ObliVM automatically generates the corresponding
oblivious computation implementation. ObliVM supports several different
architectures for implementing oblivious computation, including those based on
trusted hardware and those based on cryptographic secure computation. ObliVM
offers a unified programming framework such that a developer can write a program
irrespective of the backend architecture -- through a universal intermediate
representation, this program can be compiled to either a trusted hardware-based
or a cryptography-based backend architecture. ObliVM can facilitate the
deployment of oblivious computation in real-life scenarios, and allow businesses
and individuals to monetize sensitive data without the risk of exposure.
