This award to the University of Oregon by the NSF Chemistry Division's Special
Projects Office supports activities by the Committee on the Advancement of Women
Chemists (COACh) to increase the number and success of women in academia in
chemistry and allied fields. This award is co-funded by NSF's Divisions of
Chemistry; Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems;
Materials Research; Mathematical Sciences; Physics; and Earth Sciences; and
NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Under the direction of
Prof. Geri Richmond, COACh (1) develops and offers professional skills workshops
that assist women scientists and engineers in achieving their full career
potential at the graduate, postdoctoral, and faculty and administrative levels;
(2) targets minority women scientists and engineers through professional
meetings with high minority attendance; (3) assesses the short and long term
impacts of these workshops, and disseminates results of the assessment to the
scientific community; (4) assists with transformational change in departments
and institutions to insure the recruitment and retention of underrepresented
groups in science and engineering; (5) works with science and engineering
departments and their faculty to identify and break patterns that can create
different potentials for men, women, and minority students to be innovative; (6)
fosters and strengthens mentoring and networking among women academic scientists
and engineers; and (7) partners with other organizations on gender equity issues
in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical merit stems from new insights into
obstacles and opportunities for underrepresented groups. The activities have
broad impact through their effects on the careers of participants and their
colleagues.
