Rewrite systems are sets of equations used to substitute equals for equals from
left-to-right only. They have important applications to programming languages,
since they represent a simple and intuitive functional language, and in
automated deduction, where they play an important role in improving the
efficiency of reasoning about equations. Termination of a system means that the
equations cannot be used infinitely often, without reaching a term that does not
contain an instance of a left-handed side. Proving termination can be difficult.
(It is, of course, undecidable in general.) Under past support, a number of
methods for proving termination were devised which have proved useful. New
aspects of this subject are now being investigated with an emphasis on semantic
methods for structured (hierarchical) systems and extensions of rewriting to
handle conditional equalities, associative- commutative functions, higher-order
rewriting, and a logic programming style. Since establishing termination is an
essential component of many automated deduction and program verification
systems, this project will also invest effort in implementations.
