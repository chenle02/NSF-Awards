This research will focus on determining if impurity induced layer intermixing
exists in semiconductor heterostructures comprised of quarternary materials. The
interest in this phenomena lies in the ease with which optical waveguides and
lasers can be patterned and the specific semiconductor materials are of
importance for the lightwave technology area. The research will be a
collaborative effort between the University of Illinois, the University of Paris
in Orsay, and Thompson CSF. It will use French-supplied crystals and
characterization equipment along with U.S.-supplied lithographs and processing
steps.
