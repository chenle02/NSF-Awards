9136690 Hickey-Vargas This award provides one-half the funds required to upgrade
an inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer in the Geology
Department at Florida International University. The University is committed to
providing the additional funds necessary for the upgrade. The instrument is used
in the department's research and teaching programs for rapid and accurate
chemical analysis of geochemical samples, mostly rock, mineral, and water. The
upgrade will improve the limits of detection for certain elements critical for
current research projects. ***
