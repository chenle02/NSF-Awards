Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This cross-disciplinary project integrates
mathematics and biology in the undergraduate curriculum at Sweet Briar College
(SBC). The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the quantification
skills of SBC students using applications in the life sciences. Quantification
skills are defined as the ability to look at an unfamiliar problem, determine
the type of data necessary to address the problem, select the appropriate
mathematical tools, and draw conclusions on the adequacy of the results.
&lt;br/&gt;The objectives for the initiative are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Strengthen the
quantification skills of biology students.&lt;br/&gt;2. Expose mathematics
students to the usefulness and applicability of mathematical knowledge and
highlight career opportunities in the life sciences.&lt;br/&gt;3. Introduce
students to interdisciplinary research, emphasizing collaboration with
researchers from different fields.&lt;br/&gt;4. Improve the overall oral and
writing skills of mathematics and biology students with specific emphasis on
interdisciplinary content.&lt;br/&gt;These objectives are achieved by: 1)
Developing a new course, Quantification Skills for Biomathematics, focusing on
applications of mathematics to biology, and 2) Enriching the mathematics and
biology curricula by developing and implementing additional educational modules
that are used as biomathematical projects in existing courses. The focus is on
the biological applications of common mathematical tools, rather than underlying
mathematical theories. Students experience the usefulness of complex
mathematical techniques as applied to biological problems.&lt;br/&gt;Modules are
adapted from: 1) existing texts and programs; 2) results from our research, and
3) data from our collaborators at the Center for Biomathematical Technology at
the University of Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;
