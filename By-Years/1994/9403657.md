This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University in the purchase
of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The faculty members whose research is
dependent upon mass spectroscopy will greatly benefit from the acquisition of
this instrument. Research projects to be carried out with this instrument
include: analysis of high and low molecular weight polar compounds, along with
liquid sample introduction capability; the development of new synthetic methods
for the synthesis of medicinally useful compounds; studies of free radical and
electron transfer processes; characterization of organometallic complexes; the
study of molecular recognition; and new pathways for the total synthesis of
natural products. A high resolution mass spectrometer is an instrument used to
measure the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion. This information is an
important piece of data used to help determine the atomic composition and,
sometimes, the molecular geometry of a molecule. It is one of the essential
tools needed to learn the detailed structure of newly synthesized molecules.
