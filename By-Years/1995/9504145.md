The goals of this continuing research project are to identify primitive
operations in parallel and distributed computation, and to establish tight
bounds on their complexity. Within this general framework, emphasis is placed
on: (i) The design and analysis of algorithms for REALIZABLE models of parallel
and distributed computation; (ii) the development of techniques that are
applicable for a wide range of computational models and problem variations;
(iii) the analysis of `simple` classes of algorithms which are easy to
implement. This project concentrates on the following areas: (a) normal
hypercube algorithms; (b) sorting networks; (c) list ranking; (d) algorithms for
distributed networks, in particular, for the dynamic asynchronous network model;
and (e) multiple-resource scheduling.
