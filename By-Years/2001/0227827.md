0227827&lt;br/&gt;Wicks &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the University of
Southern Mississippi to support the activity described below for 36 months. The
proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program
Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the University of Southern
Mississippi (Lead Institution), Mississippi Technology Alliance, Hattiesburg
Area Development Partnership, the Society of Mississippi Inventors, and the
Mississippi Polymer Institute. The proposed goals are to bolster competitiveness
and innovation in Mississippi companies by establishing infrastructure for
participating in high throughput screening techniques (HTS) and combinatorial
methodologies (CM), and to establish a laboratory for HTS/CM experimentation and
a support organization drawn from the University, companies and private/state
economic development authorities. A high throughput laboratory for screening of
formulations and providing an understanding of its impact on the development of
new products to companies is being established. This laboratory provides new HTS
methods and equipment for the technology companies and individual inventors in
Mississippi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are 100 companies in
Mississippi involved in producing polymeric formulations, representing
approximately 6,000 employees. There are an additional 10,000 employees in other
related polymer products manufacturing fields. The effort will make these
companies more productive and shorten the development time to market for new
products and polymer formulations. The University of Southern Mississippi has
several active programs to recruit and retain minority students, e.g., Alliance
for Graduate Education in Mississippi, the Mississippi Alliance for Minority
Participation, Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education. Minority
students will be involved in this effort. The creation of more jobs combined
with the training of workforce for the polymer industry have obvious societal
benefits.&lt;br/&gt;
