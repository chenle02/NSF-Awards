*** 9552868 Pagni, David This is a 5-year project at $5,972,910 to provide a
two-year enhancement of 100 hours for each of 1620 teachers of mathematics and
480 instructional assistants, responsible for Limited English Proficiency
students, and administrators, K-9, with focus on content and pedagogy with
emphasis on newly-adopted instructional materials aligned with the California
Mathematics Framework. Ongoing support will include an additional 100 hours of
enhancement through the implementation of site-based Action Plans focusing on
teacher discourse, reflection, and classroom observation and coaching. Parents,
community, and business partners will participate in 100 hour programs in site-
based activities. Two district-wide staff development days per year will be
devoted to mathematics for all teachers, instructional assistants, and
administrators. Project cost per participant: $2844 per person. Cost sharing:
$15,809,754 or 260%. ***
