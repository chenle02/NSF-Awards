A user mode research program will be carried out in fundamental radiative
capture reactions. The experimental studies will be conducted at TRIUMF in
Canada, involving radiative capture of pions on polarized protons, and at KEK,
involving radiative neutron-proton capture at high energies. The pion work will
improve our understanding of the photopion production cross section and shed
light on the underlying quark sub-structure and interactions in nucleons. The
neutron-proton capture work will provide new data addressing alternative
descriptions of the np system in terms of quarks or meson-nucleon degrees of
freedom. Simulations, data analysis, interpretation, and other related
activities will be carried out at the University of Kentucky.
