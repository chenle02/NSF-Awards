This award will support a two-month planning visit to the University of
Birmingham in the United Kingdom. Dona Boggs of the University of Montana and
Patrick J. Butler of the University of Birmingham propose to conduct preliminary
investigations into the ways in which muscular activities of flying, diving, and
breathing are coordinated in different species of birds and other vertebrates.
The project will ultimately include a study of wing-propelled swimming in little
penguins, Eudyptula minor, which will involve cooperation with researchers at
Flinders University of South Australia. The project takes advantage of the
British investigator's unique expertise, the University of Birmingham's long
history in research in diving physiology, and Australian studies of little
penguins. This planning visit will provide an opportunity to develop a long-term
trilateral collaboration.
