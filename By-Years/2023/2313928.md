This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will support a diverse
group of 10 undergraduate students in a 10-week mentored research experience in
computational robotics, including components emphasizing professional and
academic skills development and community building. The primary population of
target students will be sophomores and juniors from undergraduate-serving
institutions in the southeast. The project will encourage these students toward
graduate study and research-oriented industry positions in robotics and related
areas of computing, and provide essential preparation for these career paths. It
will be an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research
projects each year. The emphasis on applications of computing in robotics is
supportive of the growing social need for such expertise. The selection process
for these students will promote the inclusion of underrepresented groups through
targeted publicity and outreach efforts.

Research conducted by the students will lead to more effective approaches to
robot perception, control, and learning. The research spans projects rooted in
areas are often overlooked by the contemporary robotics community, but crucially
important for the deployment of reliable, trustworthy robotic systems.
Participants will engage in scientifically-relevant research projects organized
around the observation that "Robots Change Everything." That is, when computers
are utilized to enable autonomy in robotic systems, the complexity and
unpredictability of the physical world have profound implications on nearly
every aspect of that computing system, from the application-specific algorithms
and data structures, all the way down to the lower-level considerations of
security and network connectivity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
