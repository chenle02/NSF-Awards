The Huntsville Alliance for Science Project (HASP) will provide two mobile
laboratories, equipped and staffed by industry, to bring laboratory experience
to schools with no laboratories and to bring about change in schools in which
laboratories are underutilized. One van will be equipped with kits of materials
to support experiments in grades 3-6, and these teachers will be given in-
service training and support from industrial scientists. The other van will be a
student laboratory for grades 6-8.
