Funds are provided for the establishment of the Center for Innovative Mining
Systems. This center is to have sufficient credibility and broadly based
industry support to sustain a productive research program even through the
highly variable economic cycles inherent in the mining industry. With an
international character of its own, the Center may also serve as a means of
evaluating industry/university centers having international funding and
orientation. The Center would be particularly valuable in defining those
emerging opportunities which are evident only to an open and innovative
consideration of the entire mining system.
