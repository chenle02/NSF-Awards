Proposal ID: AST 0139675&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gillam, Stephen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Gillam is awarded funds at California State University-Los Angeles (CSLA) to
continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site. Ten students annually
will be recruited through CURE, the Consortium for Undergraduate Research
Experience, which consists of CSLA, Pasadena City College, Los Angeles City
College, Los Angeles Southwest College, East Los Angeles College, and the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The goal of the program is to recruit, train, and
retain underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. Participating
students will work on research projects with mentors from CSLA and JPL; most of
the students will observe at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory. The projects
available range from astrometry of asteroids to planetary observations to ages
of globular clusters. The students will also participate in field trips and
training classes.&lt;br/&gt;
