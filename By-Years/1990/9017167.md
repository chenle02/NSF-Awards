This award will support the development of comparative standard samples for the
quantitative analysis of the element oxygen with the microanalytical electron
probe technique. Although oxygen is the most abundant element on earth, its
concentration in minerals and synthetic materials is usually inferred by making
assumptions about charge balance and stoichiometry. The capability to directly
analyze oxygen concentration on a microanalytical scale will constitute an
important analytical advance in mineralogy and materials science.
