Doctoral Dissertation Research: Sources of Psychological Distress among Adults

Abstract Research in social psychology suggests that when individuals perceive a
double standard between how others evaluate them and how they view themselves,
that difference can contribute to psychological distress. However, we do not yet
understand exactly the conditions under which such perceived discrepancies can
create psychological distress. This project compares the degree to which
specific social identities, especially those considered obligatory versus
identities people can choose (voluntary), may affect people's self-concept and
psychological distress in different ways. To that end, this research project
involves a two-pronged methodology. The first part uses existing telephone
survey data to examine the relationships between identity discrepancies, self-
concept, and psychological distress in the context of one obligatory and one
voluntary role. The second part of the project involves the collection of
additional survey data to investigate the extent to which people's commitment to
and the centrality of specific obligatory and voluntary identities affect the
outcomes of interest.

Broader Impacts Findings from this study may contribute to our understanding of
how people's multiple identities and roles can either help mitigate or
exacerbate psychological distress. In turn, findings may also inform clinical
research and practice aimed at preventing and treating more severe forms of
mental illness and the behavioral risks associated with mental illness. This
research project will also provide practical survey research training and
experience for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students who will
be conducting the telephone interviews at the Kent State Survey Research Center.
