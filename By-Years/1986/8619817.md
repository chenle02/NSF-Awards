The design, manipulation and control of physical objects involves complex
computational models that are tightly coupled. To create and use such models
requires an environment that hides intricate details, that harnesses
complexities, and that is supported by powerful computers and graphics. This
Institutional Infrastructure project at Purdue University is planned to develop
tools that integrate design and inspection of computational models of physical
objects with simulation and analysis of their behavior and interaction. These
tools will create and manipulate the geometric shapes, simulate the physical
processes, help control the power of multicomputers, and provide a natural,
uncluttered environment for the users. The award will aid in providing the
facilities, support staff, maintenance and related costs for developing and
experimenting with the large, complex interactive systems. The project is based
on ongoing work at Purdue and will utilize new workstations, a tightly-coupled
multiprocessor, sophisticated graphics systems and access to a supercomputer
system. This project will allow for substantial expansion of the current work in
geometric modeling and mathematical software, will strengthen other areas and
will, as well, allow for expansion of the graduate program in computer science.
