The project will investigate the linkage of land-derived riverine waters with
open ocean waters via 'buoyant plumes.' The project will assess the role of
river discharge, tides and winds in the formation and maintenance of the buoyant
plumes throughout the continental shelf. For such assessment, the project will
use shipboard measurements, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, Autonomous flying
vehicles (drones), and a floating platform that will be complemented by computer
model simulations. The project will provide approximations of the linkage
between land and open-ocean processes to be used in global-scale models. The
project will also facilitate interactions between a research intensive
university and an undergraduate college. It will train graduate students and
provide valuable experiences to undergraduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study concentrates on the dynamics of supercritical
coastal buoyant plumes that expand obliquely across the shelf. These buoyant
plumes transport low salinity waters across the continental shelf and can be
entrained by ocean currents flowing by the shelfâ€™s edge. The buoyant plumes are
influenced by the balance between wind stress (upwelling-favorable) and buoyancy
forcing. Tidal pulses of brackish water interfere with such dynamic balance to
produce radial fronts referred to as sub-plumes. These sub-plumes are
subsequently advected by Ekman transport. Data collection will consist of 4
seasonal surveys of Winyah Bay plume using ships (UNOLS ship requested), drones,
Autonomous Surface Vehicles, and a floating platform to obtain profiles of water
velocity, salinity, temperature, and turbulence properties. The sub-plume fronts
shall be ubiquitous as long as the horizontal density gradient is prominent and
the inertial period is greater than the tidal period. Observations will be
complemented by numerical simulations with a non-hydrostatic numerical model. As
Broader Impacts, the study will allow parametrization of cross-shelf plumes into
lower resolution models that study land-ocean exchanges. The project will
support 2 MS and 1 PhD students, and offer cruise opportunities to several
undergraduate students. Data collected and their analysis will produce Ocean
Data Analysis modules to be distributed to the oceanographic community. The
project will be a collaboration between and R1 and a teaching
institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
