Spilhaus 9520236 This action provides partial support for operational expenses
of the XXI General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics
(IUGG), July 2-14, 1995 at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The Assembly
will be hosted by the U.S. National Committee for IUGG on behalf of the U.S.
geophysics community, and is being organized by the American Geophysical Union
(AGU). The IUGG General Assembly is held every four years; it was last held in
the USA in 1963. The General Assembly is a collaborative effort with the seven
constituent associations of the IUGG: International Association of Geodesy
(IAG), International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA),
International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), International
Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS), International
Association of the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO), International
Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI), and
International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior
(IAVCEI). The Assembly will facilitate communication among scientists from many
different countries and representing a variety of related disciplines. It will
also serve as a forum for planning new international programs, for informing
scientists from developing countries about new findings and techniques, and for
reporting and evaluating research accomplished since the last Assembly.
