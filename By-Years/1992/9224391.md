In Phase II we propose a revolutionary surface- emitting /receiving optical
head. Building on our successful Phase I results, we will develop transceiver
array optical heads comprising one- and two- dimensional arrays of thousands of
high-speed, densely-packed addressable vertical cavity surface- emitting lasers
and photoreceivers integrated to microlenses. This new critical technology
promises to displace conventional optical heads containing single edge-emitting
lasers which are currently used in compact disc players, laser print engines and
local area network fiber optic communications. Future credit card-size optical
memory technology comprising our transceiver array optical heads may well be the
next dominant trend in digital storage. The biggest fallout of this new critical
technology may be its replacement of CD, cassette tape, digital audio and video
tape and laser discs. The new technology also promises to be the digital laser
printhead of the future for high-speed, high- resolution computer-to-plate
sheet-fed presses and for electrographic and photographic digital laser printing
& copying. In addition, this critical technology will impact numerous parallel
optical processing applications including: free-space optical interconnects,
digital optical computing, neural optical computing and pattern recognition
through, e.g. dramatic simplification of the interconnection optics.
