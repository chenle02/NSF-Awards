This award sponsors undergraduate and graduate student attendance at the 28th
ACSAC, to be held December 3-7, 2012 in Orlando, Florida. The ACSAC conference
is a top-tier academic security conference which attracts about 200 highly
skilled security professional attendees per year. ACSAC regularly brings
together leading minds in academic, governmental and commercial computer
security to address the most pressing problems in applied computer security and
to discuss seminal works in Computer Security. In addition to keynote Invited
Essays and Distinguished Practitioner talks), ACSAC includes a "Classic Papers"
series, in which two or three authors of seminal papers in computer security are
invited to update those papers and present lessons learned. These papers,
available free on the ACSAC web site, familiarize a new generation of students
with key security research developments of the past, and provide a valuable
resource for undergraduate and graduate instruction. Supported students have an
opportunity to meet and interact with notable figures at the conference.
