Wireless communication technology has gained widespread acceptance in recent
years. Wireless local area networks have come into greater use, with the advent
of the IEEE 802.11 standard and availability of several commercial products
based on this standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ad hoc network can be formed by
wireless, potentially mobile hosts, without requiring the use of any fixed
infrastructure, such as base stations. Such networks have many applications,
including home networking, personal area networking, sensor networking, search-
and-rescue missions in remote areas, and other civilian as well as military
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern wireless devices are often designed with
the capability to transmit at different bit rates using different modulation
schemes and to operate in a power-save mode to conserve energy. While such
wireless devices can be built, there is not adequate research on performance of
ad hoc networks utilizing such devices. This project will, therefore, attempt to
answer two broad questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)How to design wireless
medium access control (MAC) protocols that exploit multi-rate and power-save
capabilities in ad hoc networks? While there has been some work on such
protocols, this project is expected to develop new techniques to utilize multi-
rate and power-save capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) What is the impact of
multi-rate and power-save capabilities on performance on network layer and
transport layer? The project will study the interaction between wireless device
capabilities and upper layer performance, and develop mechanisms to improve
performance of the various layers.&lt;br/&gt;
