This project will develop and implement a library of symbolic manipulation
programs in the SMP language to solve algebraic and computational problems
arising in the calculus of variations. All of these problems recently proven to
be solvable in an explicit computational way are, in fact, approachable only
through extremely tedious hand calculation. The first such problem is
determining whether a given system of differential equations can be derived from
a variational principle. This problem comes in various forms, including the
direct problem of whether the system as it stands is the Euler.Lagrange
equations of some variational problem, or the more difficult question of finding
an integrating factor which would make the system equivalent, in some sense, to
some Euler.Lagrange equations. Coupled with this question is the determination
of the Lagrangian itself, possibly in some particularly nice form that depends
only on the lower order derivatives. Finally, the algorithms developed for
computing dissipative decomposition of differential equations will be extended
to deal with equations involving several independent variables. The proposed
library of manipulating programs would significantly speed up this line of
research into the systems of differential equations of mathematics and
mathematical physics.
