9528422 Samson This grant provides $150,000 as partial salary support for a
laboratory technician over a three year period. Specifically, the technician
will be responsible for the day-to-day management, operation and maintenance of
a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) and an X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer (XRF) for the Earth Sciences Department at Syracuse University.
This proposal is a Phase I technician support proposal under the EAR/IF program.
The addition of a lab technician at Syracuse will allow these facilities to be
opened up to a wider regional community of users and allow these PI's to enhance
their scientific productivity in research areas such as the tectonic
investigation and geochemical characterization of slates in the southern
Appalachians utilizing Uranium-Lead geochronologic techniques to establish the
timing of orogenic events and Neodymium isotopic analyses to yield insights into
the petrogenesis of these terranes. ***
