9413262 Govind This project is on research to develop a new class of biosensors
based on synthetic fluorophores and phase-shift fluorometry. The method uses the
principle that a fluorophore exhibits shift in its emission in response to the
analyte in question when excited by an intensity modulated beam of light. This
research will stress the development of resonance energy transfer fluorophores
and light sources that can be modulated at high frequencies. On-line sensors for
pH, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose will be developed and tested for both
hybridoma cell cultures and microbial fermentations. ***
