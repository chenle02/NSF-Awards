This award has two central objectives: (1) Development of a thermodynamic
characterization of degradation dynamics employing entropy (thermodynamic
disorder) as the fundamental measure of degradation, and (2) Development of
methods of measurement of state variables that are functionally related to
entropy. The research tasks include: application of thermodynamic principles to
characterize component degradation and lifetime, characterization of initial
component lifetime, development of a mathematical framework for study of
stochastic degradation dynamics, and development of methods for measurement of
entropy related state variables. Through a theoretical and experimental
investigation of degradation in machinery components, the project hopes to
advance a scientific understanding of degradation dynamics, leading to improved
engineering maintenance practice. This research could build a strong foundation
for maintenance science that can potentially impact many manufacturing
industries such as the semiconductor and aerospace industries.
