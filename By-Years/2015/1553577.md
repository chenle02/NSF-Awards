An award is made to Washington University in St. Louis to develop new
instrumentation for the structural determination of proteins and biomolecules
within cells. This technology platform will impact a diverse set of fields
including biology and materials science, enabling the study of molecular
structures in contexts that have hereto been inaccessible. Understanding
biomolecular structures within cells is essential to designing new chemical
processes for energy and raw material production from sustainable environmental
sources. Unraveling the structures of molecules in cells will also be key to
designing the next generation of drugs to combat infectious diseases, cancer,
heart disease, etc. Graduate and undergraduate students implementing this
powerful instrumentation will gain diverse skill sets ranging from
electromagnetic instrumentation design and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to
structural biology and biochemistry. The instrument design and biological
applications of this research will be taught to graduate and undergraduate
students in a magnetic resonance course. Dissemination of this technology will
be achieved through a collaboration with industrial partner Bride12
Technologies.

In order to achieve and understanding of biomolecular structure at the atomic
level within cells, it is necessary to achieve a gain in NMR signal strength of
>10,000 fold. Novel magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR instrumentation will allow
cooling of NMR samples to extremely cold temperatures of <10 degrees Kelvin
using a combination of helium and nitrogen cryogens. New fast-frequency tuning
high-power microwave sources will enable pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance
in the 200 GHz band in combination with high-resolution NMR. Together, these new
cryogenic and microwave technologies will yield a boost in the voltage of NMR
signals by a factor of >10,000, compared to the random fluctuation of voltage
that results in noise. Such a gain in NMR signal strength will significantly
expand the scope of molecular structures that can be studied with NMR, and also
drastically shorten the duration of NMR experiments.
