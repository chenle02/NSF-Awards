Zhang's research covers a broad range of problems in probability theory,
sequential analysis, and statistical inference. In probability theory, he will
work on normalized random walks, local limit theorems, large deviations, and
renewal theory. In sequential analysis, problems in nonlinear renewal theory,
power-one tests and confidence sequences, multi-decision and selection, clinical
trials, multi-armed bandit, and optimal stopping will be persued. Problems in
statistical inference include those involving empirical Bayes estimation,
mixture models, testing and estimation under biased sampling schemes. Zhang
research involves a wide variety of problems in the fields of probability and
statistics.
