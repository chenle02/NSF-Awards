This proposal supports student participation in the 2021 Network and Distributed
System Security (NDSS) Symposium held virtually in February 2021. NDSS brings
together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet community who
research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define network and
distributed system security. This grant enables career development and learning
opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending
conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our
society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to
discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers,
and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve
them well during their research careers. In the pandemic era, virtual attendance
at conferences is crucial for jump-starting academic careers, and this award
helps in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
