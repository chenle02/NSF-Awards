In this project, a computer-interfaced diode array ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer is being used by the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania
State University-Behrend College to enhance undergraduate instruction in
analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental analysis, physical
chemistry, and undergraduate research. Determination of the coordination number,
geometry, and isomerization kinetics of transition metal complexes, rapid
analytical measurements including analysis of Beer's Law deviations by second
order comparisons with extentions to multicomponent analysis are experiments
which the speed and data storage capabilities of this instrument make possible.
Undergraduate research activities on iron-containing macrocyclic complexes and
on the analysis and determination of wine phenols also utilize this
sophisticated instrumentation extensively.
