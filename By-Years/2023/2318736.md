Cells are the basic building blocks of living organisms, and a crucial property
of cells is their ability to self-reproduce. One goal of this project is to
explore the origins of cells and self-reproduction by building and studying
stripped-down (minimal) synthetic cells that primarily contain components
involved in self-reproduction. Additional project goals are to provide the PI
with training in cryo-electron microscopy, which will facilitate detailed
analyses of RNA-based minimal synthetic cells, to establish a research program
that has experience in such techniques, and to train students for future
participation in the U.S. workforce.

Understanding how to build synthetic life is a fundamental science and
engineering challenge. Since all known life is encapsulated in cells and genetic
information is also needed, a very simple form of life may be RNA encapsulated
inside membrane vesicles (protocells). Studying protocells experimentally yields
new insights into the biophysical and evolutionary importance of cells. However,
current studies on protocells are limited by experimental techniques that
measure properties in bulk, rather than for individual protocells. The overall
goal of this Transitions proposal is to enable analyses of individual protocells
and the RNA structures within by receiving training for and using the technique
of cryo-electron microscopy (EM). The technical goals will be to study the
microscopic organization inside protocells and the distribution of contents to
successive generations. Establishing cryo-EM as an analytical technique for
protocells will open the door to fundamental, previously inaccessible studies of
these simple life-like structures.
