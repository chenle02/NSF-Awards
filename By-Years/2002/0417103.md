This project establishes a scholarship program to attract and retain graduate
and undergraduate students in an information assurance program. The program
combines courses, practice, and research in information assurance and builds on
established courses in cybersecurity and more traditional computer science
topics. A number of creative mechanisms are used to recruit, retain, and place
students, including an alliance with existing recruiting programs for women and
minorities.
