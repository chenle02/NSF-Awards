9508328 Russell The Center for Computational Mathematics at the University of
Colorado at Denver will purchase an eight-processor Sun Microsystems SPARC
server 1000E, which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: Parallel Implicit Multigrid Methods for Direct
Numerical Simulation of Time Dependent Compressible Turbulent Flow around Flight
Vehicles. Transitional and turbulent flow at subsonic and hypersonic speeds will
be approximated directly, without turbulence models. Eulerian-Lagrangian and
Mixed Methods for Subsurface Flows. Flows in porous media, with emphasis on
applications to oil recovery and groundwater contaminant transport, will be
simulated with new numerical methods designed to be accurate for convection
dominated flows through irregular geological formations. Stabilized Finite
Element Methods and their Massively Parallel Implementation. Discretizations
with strong accuracy and robustness for a wide range of applications will be
developed and analyzed, and domain-decomposition equation solvers will be
designed and implemented. Parallel Iterative Methods. Robust, fast equation
solvers will be developed for equations arising from discretizations of models
of solid mechanics on highly distorted finite element meshes. Preconditioned
Parallel Methods for Large Symmetric Eigenproblems. Fast, accurate, robust
methods will be developed for computation of several extreme eigenpairs of
symmetric generalized eigenproblems. The projects span major areas of scientific
computation: model development and application, discretization methods, linear
equations, and eigenvalue problems. All share large-scale parallel computation
as a central theme.
