This award provides partial funding to modernize the thermal ionization source
mass spectrometer system operated in the Division of Geological and Planetary
Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. The upgrade will include
replacement and correction of ion collectors which have degraded during the
intensive use of the spectrometer during the last six years and construction of
a new filament source system. In addition, the award will also be used to
partially fund the acquisition of equipment to improve the Division's mineral
separation laboratory. The California Institute of Technology is committed to
providing matching support. Several research groups in the Geological and
Planetary Division at Caltech make extensive use of these facilities in research
projects spanning a broad spectrum of interest in petrogenesis, tectonics and
geodynamics of continental crusts and margins, geological hazards, and
environmental geochemistry.
