This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the redesign,
renovation, and upgrade of the ground floor of the Science Building complex on
the campus of Calvin College to create the Integrated Science Research
Experimental Laboratory (ISRx). The ISRx will place student and faculty
researchers from a variety of disciplines in the same physical environment. The
science that emerges from research performed in this space is expected to be
highly interdisciplinary. Of particular note will be collaborations between
chemistry/biology and computer science/mathematics researchers. The affected
chemistry research areas include genomics, proteomics, biofuels, biomolecule
binding, structure, and imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovations will
improve conditions for research training of students, and will promote
interdisciplinary research by providing a common research area. Calvin provides
a variety of science outreach activities to the Grand Rapids area, focusing
primarily on sections of Grand Rapids that have significant ethnic minority
populations, and these activities will be enhanced by the proposed renovations.
