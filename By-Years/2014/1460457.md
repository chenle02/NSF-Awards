Savannah State University in Savannah, Georgia hosts an 8-week, 10-student
summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in marine sciences.
The goal of this REU program is the early recruitment and support of
undergraduate students in the STEM pipeline. This program is developed around a
multidisciplinary, collaboration between academic and governmental partners in
the Savannah, Georgia area. Savannah State University's local partners include
the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, UGA MAREX Aquarium and Gray's Reef
National Marine Sanctuary. Each has experienced research mentors and high level
research facilities that provide an excellent environment for student research
projects. Students receive a combination of classroom instruction, career
guidance and research experience that is designed to support their continued
progress in obtaining STEM degrees. NSF funding supports the student stipend and
living expenses, limited research expenses for each student and program
administration.
