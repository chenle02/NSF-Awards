9413485 McDermott This is a starter grant for an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellow in Plant Biology. The long-term objective of the research is to
understand the role of phosphorus (P) in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. The
research plan is divided into three general goals, and is designed to carry on
from where the postdoctoral research stopped. The first goal is to determine
what factors influence bacteroid P supply or bacteriod P acquisition activities
during symbiosis. This includes determining to what extent host genotype or
growth stage can influence bacteroid P supply and if aspects of nodule ecology
can affect bacteroid regulatory mechanisms. The second goal involves looking at
the importance of various possible sources of P during symbiosis. This will be
achieved by isolating Rhizobium mutants with defects in the different mechanisms
of P acquisition, and testing them for a symbiosis phenotype. The third goal is
to begin cloning the genes involved in P metabolic regulation so that we can
begin to understand how and to what extent enviornmental P can influence all
aspects of symbiosis. The above research represents a comprehensive and directed
attempt at understanding P metabolism in (Brady)Rhizobium. It blends physiology,
molecular biology, and biochemistry in a way that should quickly provide
important information about a macronutrient that, on a world-wide basis, is
known to be limiting for this ecomonically important symbiosis. ***
