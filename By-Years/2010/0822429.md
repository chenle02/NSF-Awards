Funds are provided to allow the PI to participate in the 2008 cruise of the R/V
Polarstern to the Russian arctic shelf and slope waters. Prior studies in the
Beaufort Gyre resulted in the hypothesis that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
concentrations found in the polar surface layer (PSL) of the Arctic Ocean are
largely controlled by the time since the water last resided on the shelf. Access
to the Russian arctic shelf and slope waters is limited for US scientists. The
samples to be collected during the 2008 Polarstern cruise will provide a high-
resolution distribution of both 228Ra/226Ra ratios and DOC concentrations across
the upper eastern Arctic Ocean, allowing the evaluation of the residence time
and degradation of terrestrial DOC in the PSL waters of that region, where he
believes residence times will be much shorter than in the Beaufort Gyre.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic soils contain a disproportionate load of the global
soil organic carbon stock, and its mobilization is possible as those soils thaw
and drain in response to climate change. Useful predictions on the effect of
these changes on carbon dynamics depends on the collection and interpretation of
high quality data, such as proposed, to characterize the present day carbon
dynamics of the Arctic. &lt;br/&gt;
