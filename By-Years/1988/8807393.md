This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Maurice M. Kreevoy, Department of
Chemistry, University of Minnesota, to pursue with Dr. In-Sook Han Lee,
Department of Chemistry, Science Education Research Institute, Kangweon National
University, for a period of 24 + months, a program of cooperative research on
the reduction of NAD analogues (nicotinamide quarternary salts), including
pyridinium, quinolinium, acridinium, and phenanthridinium halides, by mono- or
disodium phosphonate. The nature of this reduction will be explored by
characterizing the products by instrumental techniques and by determining the
mechanism of the reaction by kinetic methods. The reduction of nicotinamide
quarternary salts and their analogs has been a long standing objective because
of the great importance of this process in biological systems and the possible
use of nicotinamide enzymes in synthetic transformation. Although many of these
reactions could be valuable in practical organic synthesis, enzyme-catalyzed
oxidation-reduction reactions of this type have not been very successful because
the reduced cofactors are expensive to produce, some are not commercially
available, some are unstable in solution, and others leave undesirable by-
products. Phosphonate used as a reducing agent has several advantages, namely,
it is a strong enough reducing + agent to produce a wide range of reactions with
a variety of NAD analogs and it is inexpensive, commercially available, stable
in solution, and its end product is not likely to produce side reactions. This
project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean
scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,
skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
This project will add an international cooperative dimension to Dr. Kreevoy's
research under NSF Grant No. CHE-8520903.
