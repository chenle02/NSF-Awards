In collaboration with the Murmansk Institute of Marine Biology and Geology,
USSR, this project will initiate basic glacial geologic, stratigraphic and
geochronologic studies to provide new field data to independently evaluate the
extent and timing of Late Weischselian and older glaciations. Field research
will focus on the western part of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, where ice-
free forelands contain abundant raised marine and glacial features. High
resolution SPOT satellite imagery will be used as a mapping base to determine
the distribution of raised beaches, moraines and other glacial features.
Geomorphic and pedologic studies will provide relative ages for a previously
isostatic response will be documented by radiocarbon dating of fossils included
in raised beaches of known elevation. Particular attention will be given to the
recognition of glacial-diamicts and uncomformitites, the collection of micro and
macro-fauna for paleenvironmental assessment, and radiocarbon dating and amino
acid racemization analyses. These studies will provide new insight into the
history and extent of Late Weichselian glaciations on Franz Josef Land and will
provide needed data to evaluate conflicting hypotheses regarding Late
Weichselian ice volumes in northern Eurasia.
