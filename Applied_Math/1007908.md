This project focuses on development and analysis of physically-motivated models
of materials undergoing martensitic phase transition, a diffusionless
deformation of a crystal lattice from the high-symmetry parent austenite phase
to the low-symmetry martensite phase, which can exist in several symmetry-
related twin variants. Under mechanical or thermal loading, these materials form
finely layered twinning microstructures. The unique properties of martensites,
such as their ability to accommodate large deformations and the marked
hysteresis they exhibit under cyclic loading, are determined by the kinetics of
phase and twin boundaries. Understanding how dynamics of the interfaces depends
on their orientation, microstructural configuration, and properties of the
crystal lattice involves challenging open problems in modeling of martensites.
The project seeks to advance the understanding of these phenomena from the
perspective of mesoscopic lattice models. Building on her prior work, the
investigator focuses on several prototypical discrete models with the goal of
capturing the essential features of interface kinetics and microstructure
evolution and an emphasis on higher-dimensional phenomena and rate effects. The
main ingredients of the models are nonconvex interactions between nearest
neighbors allowing for the existence of two stable homogeneous states and the
long-range interactions. Among the outcomes of this project are prediction of
nucleated microstructural patterns and derivation of interfacial kinetic laws
that can be used to solve problems involving temporal and spatial
inhomogeneities. The results are compared to experimental observations and
molecular dynamics simulations.

By focusing on the interface kinetics, this project helps determine how the
dissipative properties of martensites and related active materials depend on the
material structure and the loading conditions. This is important in emerging
civil, aerospace and industrial applications that require significant passive
damping, such as damage and vibration control in composite structures and
attenuation of earthquake- and wind-induced vibrations in buildings and bridges.
Results of this project may also help design new materials with desired
properties. Mathematical methods developed during the project can be used to
solve similar problems encountered in dislocation theory, fracture mechanics,
DNA modeling, image recognition, and numerical analysis. The broader impacts of
this program are also achieved through training of graduate and undergraduate
students in an interdisciplinary research program, as well as educational and
high-school outreach activities.
