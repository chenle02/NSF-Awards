9313712 Gombosi Dynamics of Cometary Environments. Dr. Gombosi will continue his
theoretical studies of dusty cometary gas flows and the solar wind interaction
with comets. Dr. Gombosi is participating in the development of a new solution,
adaptive, multidimensional, numerical methodology. He will apply this new
technology to multiscale phenomena in comet environments. The major advance of
the proposed over previous models is the use of adaptively refined meshes, so
that high resolution can be achieved in areas such as the edges of active
regions, the sonic transition region in cometary jets, cometary bow shocks, the
diamagnetic cavity boundary, or the very thin recombination layer near the
contact surface.
