Stars have wide ranges of masses, ages, rotation rates, and other physical
properties. For example, Be stars are relatively young, rapidly rotating stars
of type B, with surface temperatures above 10,000 K and characteristic emission
features (hence, the "e" in Be) in their hydrogen Balmer lines. During the last
few years, photometric and spectroscopic observations have revealed variations
in the colors and in the absorption lines of Be stars that move from the blue to
the red, on time scales of 0.2 to 2 days, and that so far have defied unique
physical explanation. Vogt and Penrod have interpreted these variations as being
due to nonradial pulsations (NRPs) in the stars' photospheres. The PI will test
the NRP model with a time series analysis of the stars' absorption line
variations. Furthermore, he will compare variations in the stars' photospheres,
circumstellar disks, and high velocity winds to determine whether the proposed
NRPs are responsible for the mass loss observed from these and, possibly, other
rapidly rotating stars.
