Proteins involved in the binding of sperm and egg cells (gametes) during
fertilization are known to be some of the fastest evolving and often differ
greatly between species. These differences are thought to be the basis of some
reproductive incompatibilities between species, and potentially between members
of the same species. The goal of this study is to determine how natural
selection causes the rapid accumulation of changes in the structure of gamete
binding proteins. This will be accomplished by conducting a suite of
fertilization experiments between mussels that differ from each other at the
sperm protein M7 lysin. Also, the geographical distribution of different
versions of M7 lysin in mussel populations throughout Europe and the
Mediterranean will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study
will add important information for understanding the process by which
populations become reproductively isolated, and the mechanisms underlying
successful fertilization in general. Both graduate and undergraduate students
will be involved in the project and all will be from groups currently
underrepresented in the sciences. This experience will provide these students
with a platform to start their careers in scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;
