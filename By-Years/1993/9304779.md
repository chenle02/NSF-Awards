Political processes can have profound impacts on the structure and operation of
spaces. Changes in political processes may produce new ways to organize and use
space, a fundamental fact that once again is being demonstrated in the nations
of central Europe and northern Eurasia that recently replaced communist regimes
with more democratic governments. This doctoral dissertation improvement project
will focus on the relationship between political activism and community identity
in post-Soviet cities of Russia. Special emphasis will be given to assessing the
role of political activism in the formation of new community and territorial
identities within cities and the degree to which those new identities affect the
agendas and behavior of people active in politics. Archival research, detailed
interviews, and surveys will be used to conduct a comparative analysis of
'committees of self-governance' in Moscow, and secondary data will be examined
to determine broader political and economic trends in urban centers throughout
Russia. This research will provide valuable information and insights into the
dramatic transformations of political and urban structure in Russia, and it also
will extend and refine theories developed in Western contexts regarding
reciprocal interactions between place and politics. As a doctoral dissertation
improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising
student to establish a strong independent research career.
