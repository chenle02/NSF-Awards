9701959 Hodgson Economic time series models can often be reduced to a sequence
of uncorrelated innovations that may be characterized by complicated forms of
dependence, heterogeneity, and non-Gaussianity (i.e., non-normality) that are
difficult to model. Despite long-standing awareness of this fact, the range of
econometric methodologies currently used by empirical researchers rarely extends
much beyond maximum likelihood techniques that assume these innovations to be
Gaussian, such as ordinary least squares. The objective of the project is to
facilitate the extensions of this range through the development of adaptive
maximum likelihood techniques and semiparametric efficient estimators applicable
in many modeling contexts of interest to financial and macroeconomics, and
through the development of a software package implementing these techniques. The
educational component of this CAREER award provides graduate students training
in adaptive estimation techniques as part of the syllabi of advanced graduate
level courses on either nonparametric econometric techniques, theory of
efficient estimation, applied time series econometrics, or applied financial
econometrics. Graduate students will also be trained in the use of the software
developed under this project. .
