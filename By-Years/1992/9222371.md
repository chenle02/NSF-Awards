Integrodifference equations are simple discrete-time models that arise in
population biology as models for organisms with discrete nonoverlapping
generations and well-defined growth and dispersal stages. These equations
possess many of the attributes of continuous-time reaction-diffusion models. At
the same time, scalar integrodifference equations readily exhibit period-
doubling and chaos, and traveling cycles as well as traveling waves. Systems of
integrodifference equations, in turn, exhibit a new variety of diffusive
instability and pattern formation. The investigator proposes to study the
traveling waves and cycles and the varied spatial patterns that arise in these
models, employing a variety of analytical and computational techniques. Some
equations have solutions that show repetitive behavior either in space or in
time, developing patterns. It is of interest to determine under what conditions
such pattern formations can arise. This research will shed light on pattern
formation in general. The equations studied here are related to models of
ecological processes. Landscape ecology is beginning to investigate how
ecological processes generate the complex spatial patterns observed on the
landscape and how these patterns, in turn, constrain or determine the rates of
the processes. The investigator examines a fundamental mechanism that may be
responsible for spatial patterns. The project has practical ramifications in
that it may allow for better prediction of the spread of invading riparian
plants and invading insect pests.
