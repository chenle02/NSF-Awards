A new quantitative investigation into the morphology of shallow estuaries and
inlets will be carried out using a combination of numerical modeling with finite
element methods (FEM) and field experiments. An assessment of the relative
importance of continuous tidal forcing and infrequent storm events to sediment
transport and resulting evolution of estuaries will follow.
