Abstract ATM-9618913 Elsner, James B. Florida State University Title:
Classification of Tropical Cyclones The purpose of the proposed work is to
extend previously successful work on objective classification of Atlantic
tropical cyclone activity into two categories: 1) Tropical only, and 2)
Baroclinically influenced. This work will extend the methodology to other
tropical cyclone basins such as Pacific basin. The research will involve a
healthy combination of physical reasoning, data exploration, and statistical
analyses to determine whether separation of tropical cyclone types can be used
to better identify and predict natural components of worldwide tropical cyclone
climate variability. The successful completion of this work will help understand
the seasonal prediction of tropical cyclone activity over the global tropical
cyclone basins.
