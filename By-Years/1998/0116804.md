With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Northern Arizona University will acquire a High
Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer for Research in
Chemistry and Earth Sciences. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including a) atmospheric source apportionment using isotopic signatures
of lead; b) arsenic speciation in the aquatic environment; c) isotopic studies
of lead, thorium and uranium in the environment; d) aqueous geochemistry; and e)
genotoxicity of chromium (VI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of
areas, especially environment chemistry and human health. &lt;br/&gt;
