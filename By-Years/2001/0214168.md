This project develops a world-level, longitudinal measure of global
organizations and discourse devoted to human rights. Time series analyses of the
expected growth in this measure focus on international conflicts and the rise of
international organizations as principal causes. Another series of analyses
would focus on the consequences of the rise of this global human rights regime
for the policies and for the actual practices of individual nations. While
national-level factors such as economic development also affect national human
rights policies and practices, the growth of the global human rights regime and
a nation's connections with the global system are also major explanations for
nation-level changes in human rights.
