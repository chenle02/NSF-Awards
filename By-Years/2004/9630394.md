963034 Finkelstein The objective of this project is to determine the molecular
basis of pattern formation during Drosophila head development. Studies of
invertebrates and vertebrates suggest that head and trunk regions are patterned
by different genetic mechanisms. Dr. Finkelstein will determine the pathway of
head development, and compare it to previously described paradigms of trunk
specification. Dr. Finkelstein has previously shown that the segment polarity
genes hedgehog (hh) and wingless (wg) specify the identities of specific regions
of the head of the adult fruitfly. In the experiments proposed here, he will
analyze the expression and function of hh and wg in the imaginal discs that give
rise to the head. In addition, he will study the molecular interactions of hh
and wg with the genes decapentaplegic, orthodenticle, and engrailed, which are
also involved in head formation. Finally, he will use genetic methods to
identify and analyze new loci required in the developing head. By using the
combination of molecular and genetic approaches possible in Drosophila, he will
systematically determine the pathway of head development. Since many of the
genes in this pathway are evolutionarily conserved, his results will form a
foundation for studying head formation in other animals. Ultimately, such
studies will be critical for understanding how genetic defects perturb normal
pathways of development.
