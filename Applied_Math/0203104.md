The research project is focused on application of the Lax Pair and the Riemann-
Hilbert Method to the solution of scattering problems in inhomogeneous
geomaterials. This approach is based on a new version of the Inverse Scattering
Transform suggested recently by A. Fokas for studying boundary problems for
linear and integrable nonlinear PDEs. Topics of investigation include: (i)
analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the elliptic curve related to the
vector Lax pair of the elastodynamic equation; (ii) explicit evaluation of
scattering coefficients of Raylegh wave in a quarter-space and a corner; (iii)
the Riemann-Hilbert approach to scattering of elastic surface wave at a vertical
interface of two homogeneous quarter-spaces.

The analysis of seismic waves is the major source of information about the Earth
internal structure and its sesmicity. The elastodynamic equation serves as a
basic mathematical model for studing diffraction and scattering of seismic waves
on deep fault zone areas and other inhomogeneities in the Earth Crust and Upper
Mantle. The research program indicated above would allow to make a considerable
progress in solving some of the longstanding problems related to realistic
geometry of seismic zones. Moreover, the important nature of the method
developed in the project is that it can be also applied to various nonlinear
versions of the elastodynamic equation. During the last decades it has been
discovered that nonlinearity of the Earth materials may be responsible for some
peculiar characteristics of the wavefield, hence the research project would
provide an analytic tool for studing these completely new kind of seismic
phenemena as well.
