9314537 Tublitz Neuropeptides, small proteinaceous molecules released from nerve
cells, have profound effects both on the brain and peripheral tissues. They have
been implicated in a variety of neural functions, ranging from controlling
movements to transmitting sensory information such as pain. These chemicals are
also involved in more long-term behavioral changes such as learning and memory,
arousal and various emotional states. Despite their critical importance, little
is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying peptide action.
Dr. Tublitz's research is directed towards finding these answers. He is
concentrating on a family of neuropeptides, the Cardioacceleratory Peptides
(CAPs), that modulate several different tissues, including the heart, gut and
brain. In his previous NSF research, Dr. Tublitz demonstrated that these
neuropeptides modulate four different, developmentally-specific behaviors, each
having a distinctive set of characteristics resulting in very different
physiological and/or behavioral consequences. Moreover, he identified the cells
that produce the CAPs and their targets. Dr. Tublitz will now determine how
these neuropeptides affect their targets at the molecular level as well as to
identify the genes that code producing the peptide regulate its levels. The
results from this basic research will lead to a better understanding of how
neurochemicals function to modulate nerve cell activity and subsequently,
behavior. ***
