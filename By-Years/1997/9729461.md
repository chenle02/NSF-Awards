The console of the 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at the NMR Shared Facility of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham will be upgraded to provide state-of-the-art
capabilities to the participating investigators. This upgrade will overcome the
many limitations of the existing system and significantly enhance the programs
of participating investigators in their research on protein and nucleic acid
structures and interactions.
