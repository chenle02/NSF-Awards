The ability to imitate is crucial for human development, for transferring
learned abilities from one generation to another, and perhaps even for
understanding the intentions and actions of others. Interest in the processes of
imitation has a long history but most of the research has focused on the
imitation of visually observable actions. This research program focuses instead
on vocal imitation, which emerges spontaneously in infants and plays an
important communicative role in language acquisition, singing, and other
expressive vocalizations. The studies combine behavioral and physiological
measures of vocal imitation with a computational model in order to evaluate
whether deficits in vocal imitation reflect a failure of auditory imagery or of
the complex transformation from auditory perception to coordinated motor
action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A potential application of this research is the
development of interventions for individuals who have difficulty with vocal
imitation, including pedagogical techniques to train "tone deaf" singers. A
second potential application is to the learning of tonal languages such as
Chinese, for which pitch information is critical.
