This project responds to increasing national concern about the low levels of
participation and achievement of inquiry skills among women and non-Asian
minorities in mathematics. Activities will include the design of an
instructional approach that combines an inquiry-based mathematics curriculum
with cooperative small-group learning. It will test the effects of the combined
instructional approach on the mathematics achievement, attitudes, and future
plans of low-income Hispanic middle school students. The major focus will be on
students' ability to solve problems in mathematics and their participation in
classroom problem-solving activities. The project will be carried out in three
phases: (1) the effects of inquiry-based instruction on development of inquiry
skills will be tested; (2) a cooperative learning component will added to the
classroom activities; and (3) students will be trained to increase their
involvement and participation in classroom activities. The results of this
project will be significant in a number of ways: it is the first attempt to
design and systematically test combined inquiry-based and cooperative learning
approaches to mathematics curriculum and instruction; it has the potential of
creating more optimal learning opportunities for low socioeconomic Hispanic
students; it has potential for improving the inquiry skills of all students; and
the intervention strategies to be developed have potential for motivating
students to continue their education in mathematics and the sciences.
