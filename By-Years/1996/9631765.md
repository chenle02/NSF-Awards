Danilchik 96-31765 Fertilized eggs become multicellular through a series of
rapid, synchronous cell divisions, or cleavages, that serve to populate the
egg's volume with zygotic nuclei, clonally segregate the egg's developmental
potential, and reduce daughter cells' volume to that of somatic cells. In animal
cells, cleavage furrowing is generally recognized to be a microfilament-
dependent process. Recently, however, Dr. Danilchik discovered a novel
microtubule-containing array in the early cleavage furrows in eggs of the frog
Xenopus laevis. This structure consists of numerous thick, short bundles of
radially arranged, acetylated microtubules that emanate from the vicinity of the
contractile ring of all cleavage furrows until the midblastula stage. Dr.
Danilchik hypothesizes that the microtubule array functions to recruit membrane
vesicles to the site of new membrane formation at the furrow's leading edge, and
perhaps also to draw a thick layer of peripheral cytoplasm inward along each
cleavage furrow, a process known as ingresson. Since all receptormediated, cell-
cell interactions depend on the composition of the membranes deposited between
cells, it is clear that the directed membrane deposition and ingression have
potentially significant roles in events of early development, such as
specification of the primary tissue layers. The specific aims of this proposal
are to carry out: 1) a structural analysis, to define further the cytoskeletal
organization of the furrow, 2) functional studies, to understand how membrane
deposition and ingression are accomplished, and 3) developmental gene-expression
studies, in which vesicle delivery or ingression will be locally inhibited to
learn the developmental significance of cleavage. Results from this project will
contribute to our understanding of how animal cells divide, one of the most
fundamental problems in Cellular and Developmental Biology.
