Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SoftHum project champions the use
of Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software as a foundation for computing
education that can attract students into majoring in Computer Science, provide
an excellent learning vehicle, and achieve social benefits. Students engaged in
SoftHum team projects work in unique real-world environments along with
professional developers in which the students gain traits of professional
maturity, practical experience, and social responsibility within a humanitarian
context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SoftHum project is (1) developing a process to
support student success in a community-based software experience using
Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software, (2) documenting an environment that
supports student Open Source experiences, and (3) positioning faculty from other
institutions to apply this approach to computing education.&lt;br/&gt;
