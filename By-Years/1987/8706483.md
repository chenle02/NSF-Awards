sponsored and supported by the EPA, "Environmental Modeling and Simulation" held
in 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio and Environmetrics 81 sponsored by EPA, SIAM, and
SIMS and supported by the EPA in Alexandria, Virginia in 1981. Featured in the
three day program of Environmetrics 87 will be contributed research papers over
