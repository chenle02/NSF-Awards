Title: Higher Order and Exact Methods for Statistical Inference

Abstract

There has been burgeoning interest in the last decade or so in artificial
likelihoods for nonparametric problems. The investigators also propose to
develop tractable approximations to the usual and adjusted nonparametric
likelihood ratio statistics. These approximations are intended both to make
bootstrap inference feasible and to yield insight into inaccuracies of the
standard asymptotic approximations. Maximizing the adjusted profile
nonparametric likelihoods yields adjusted estimators, and the investigators
propose to study their properties, particularly as a basis for the popular
bootstrap-t method of inference. Small sample inference in discrete data
problems, such as contingency tables, log-linear models, and logistic
regression, has received much attention. One approach is saddlepoint
approximations; another approach is the use of Monte Carlo methods to simulate
from the relevant conditional distributions. Important new ideas from
computational ring theory may pave the way for the next generation feasible
methods in highly discrete problems, just as the network algorithm provided
methods that are currently being implemented routinely in practice. The
investigators propose to use analytic and computational concepts from the theory
of Groebner bases and toric ideals to provide correct and feasible simulation
methods in complex discrete problems.

The proposed research concerns feasible methodologies for accurate inference in
both nonparametric and parametric settings. In the nonparametric framework, the
focus is on approximate inference based on pseudo-likelihoods, while in the
parametric context, the focus is on simulation methods for exact inference in
discrete models. The inferential methods that are to be addressed in the
proposal have broad application in data analysis of numerous areas of modeling
scientific phenomena.
