A scanning tunneling microscope facility will be established to study (1) the
formation of smooth ultrathin metal films, (2) nanometer scale direct writing,
and (3) restructuring on metal surfaces during catalysis. The facility will be
used for a series of research projects on nanometer diameter metal clusters,
cluster-beam-deposition process, chemical vapor deposition, and production of
ultrathin films. The project has important technological applications in the
fabrication of microelectronics, high quality optical mirrors and high density
digital memories.
