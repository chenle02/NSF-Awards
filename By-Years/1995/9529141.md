This workshop integrates the design disciplines into the development of easy to
use electronic systems and the assessment of the critical nature of their
perceptual quality, intuitive user relationships, and overall impact and value.
The multidisciplinary workshop team, including researchers and practitioners
from design, engineering, computer science, education, library science, the
social and behavioral sciences, and fine art, consider the design and
development of the interfaces, tools, services, and overall systems necessary
for success. The goals are a framework for understanding the creation and
cultivation of the Schools of Design for the Information Age, with Ph.D. level
research agendas (such as Crticial Theory, Evaluation and Measurement Theory,
Semantics, and Design Methods), and initial plans for such schools.
