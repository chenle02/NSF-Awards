New technologies are being developed that use quantum mechanical phenomena to
process, store, and securely transmit information in ways that are not possible
with classical devices. A key ingredient in the performance of quantum
technologies is the presence of entanglement, which can be thought of as a kind
of connection between spatially separated objects that does not exist in the
everyday classical world. This project will advance the progress of science by
deepening understanding of entanglement between atoms and between atoms and
light. Gaining a better understanding of entanglement and how to accurately
prepare entanglement of atoms and light will promote the development of useful
quantum information processing technologies. In addition research and education
activities supported by this NSF award will contribute to workforce training for
future commercialization of quantum technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research project will study the fidelity of entanglement prepared in multi-atom
ensembles as well as between atomic ensembles and optical fields. Long range
atomic interactions mediated by highly excited Rydberg states will be used to
create deterministic entanglement between multi-atom ensembles and between
ensembles and light. The fidelity of Rydberg state mediated entanglement will be
compared in 1D and 2D ensembles and in spatially disordered and ordered
ensembles. The comparison will elucidate the robustness of Rydberg blockade in
the presence of complex short range interactions. Spatially ordered ensembles
that exhibit collective resonances due to dipolar interactions will be combined
with strong, long range Rydberg interactions to generate single photon
wavepackets with controlled directionality that will enable entanglement of
spatially separated atomic arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
