9502304 Slaughter The overall objective of the research is to construct a
methodology that allows rapid and accurate formulation of a design,
construction, operation, or decommissioning procedure so that most of the effort
can focus on exploring scenarios and outcomes rather than on the mechanics. The
research takes two distinct approaches. First, the research allows the explicit
linking of the design process to the fabrication and construction processes. The
second approach is to allow an explicit consideration of the set of functional
systems (e.g. structural, enclosure, mechanical, finish) within the facility as
well as the coordination of the different phases.
