The phonetics and phonology of vowel nasalization have been studied for some
time, but the oral articulation of nasal vowels has been largely overlooked in
both the phonetics and phonology literature. The acoustic consequences of
nasalization obscure the oral configuration of a nasal vowel. Nevertheless, it
is sometimes assumed that nasal vowels are produced with the same lingual and
labial configurations as their oral equivalents. To better understand the
synchronic and diachronic behavior of nasal vowels, the graduate student will
examine the oral articulation of nasal vowels directly. The current project will
combine articulatory, aerodynamic, and acoustic signals in order to observe
lingual and labial articulation during the production of oral and nasal vowel
congeners in two dialects of French: Quebec French (QF) and Northern
Metropolitan French (NMF). The findings from this research are likely to have a
significant impact on historical linguistics, specifically on sound change in
Romance languages, as well as on the understanding of vowel nasalization more
generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Pilot results from five speakers suggest that
the speakers of NMF and QF produce nasal vowels shared by both systems in
different ways which are suggestive of important characteristics of vowel
nasality. When the oral articulation of a nasal vowel enhances the acoustic
effect of nasalization, it is possible that the degree of naso-pharyngeal
coupling can be reduced while still conveying nasality of the vowel. On the
other hand, when oral articulation minimizes the acoustic effect of
nasalization, an emergent nasal consonant may convey vowel nasality instead. The
results suggest that the inter-dialectal differences in the nasal vowel systems
of QF and NMF can be explained, in part, by the inherent characteristics of
vowel nasality rather than by circumstances that are specific to the
evolutionary development of French. This research will also support the
scientific training of a graduate student.
