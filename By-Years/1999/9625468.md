CTS-9625468 Wirtz This is a grant to purchase a controlled-strain rheometer with
rheo-optical capabilities to study the dynamics of complex fluids. This device
is capable of making steady, transient and dynamic measurements. Mechanical
measurements will be conducted simultaneously with rheo-optical measurements
(i.e. dichroism and birefringence). the rheometer will compliment the
experimental techniques currently used. The equipment will be used for a broad
range of topics that include relating the tunable microstructure with the
viscoelastic properties of magnetic colloidal suspensions, comparing the
viscoelastic properties of vesicles as measured by rheometry and light
scattering techniques and the study of the rheological properties of a wide
range of fluids including sheared polyelectrolyte solutions, highly strained
lubricants and surfactant-polymer mixtures.
