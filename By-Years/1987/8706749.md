The rocks of the Alexander-Stikine suture zone in southeastern Alaska include
the boundary between locally derived geological terranes formed on the west
coast of the North American plate and the exotic terranes which have, over
geological time, migrated long distances due to the movement of the Pacific
plate. Field studies in this zone by the principal investigator of this project
will be focused on the global tectonic processes through which these distant
terranes were displaced and finally joined on the western margin of North
America. This proposal requests 50% of the funds required to purchase a small
research boat for field transportation in this otherwise inaccessible region.
The NSF-sponsored research in the geological history of the rocks of the
Alexander-Stikine suture zone of southeastern Alaska will provide new and
specific interpretations of the growth of continents during plate tectonic
changes.
