The polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine play an essential
role in cell growth and proliferation, however their precise function in cell
metabolism is unknown. In cells, the polyamines are closely associated with
nucleic acids and have been shown to stabilize DNA and chromatin structure. This
property is similar to that of histones, the basic protein found bound to DNA in
the nuclei of all higher organisms. Both the histones and polyamines can undergo
enzymatic acetylation in the cell nucleus and can also be deacetylated. These
acetylation and deacetylation reactions are thought to regulate the binding of
these molecules to DNA. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop
new, selective inhibitors for polyamine and histone acetylation and
deacetylation, and utilize them to elucidate the function of these reactions.
The target for these inhibitors will include the nuclear acetyltransferases for
histones and polyamines, the nuclear deacetylases for the histones and the
cytoplasmic deacetylase for the polyamines. Specific compounds will be designed
and synthesized for each of these enzymes and tested for inhibitory activity in
test tube assays. As specific and effective inhibitors are found, they will be
tested in living cells for their effect on modulating the level of acetylated
histone and polyamine. These new inhibitors will serve as research tools to
advance our understanding of the function of histones and polyamines in normal
cell processes. The significance of acetylation and deacetylation on DNA
structure and function will also be enhanced. Of ultimate interest and
significance is the role of acetlyation-deacetylation on the specific regulation
of gene expression.
