This award will fund the on going research program of the Wayne State University
Elementary Particle Physics group on analyses of the CLEO-c data. The group
consists of two faculty, Professors Bonvicini and Cinabro, and three graduate
students working towards their PhD degrees. The NSF supported the group
participation in the construction and operation of the CLEO detector as well as
data taking. This research grant will enable the continuation the group analysis
effort and allow them to complete the physics analysis of the CLEO-c data. The
Analysis effort concentrate on the studies of three body charm decays using the
Dalitz technique, measurements of D D-bar mixing parameters taking advantage of
the quantum correlations of the D mesons produced at CLEO, and in rare charm
decays. The three graduate students will concentrate on searches for higher
order Fock states in rare semi-leptonic D decays and correlated Dalitz plot
studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also support the extensive
involvement of the group in undergraduate student's research via an REU/RET
program. This program achieves its intrinsic goals of promoting undergraduate
and younger student interest in careers in science, technology, and engineering,
especially among the under-represented, and making connections with K/12
teachers. The group found that in addition the students and teachers in the
program have been able to make a significant contribution to their research
effort.
