the University of Rochester will purchase a pulsed laser system and an electron
beam deposition unit that will be dedicated to support r esearch in engineering.
The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: 1)the fabrication and investigation of circularly symmetric grating,
surface emitting semiconductor lasers, 2) new materials and epitaxial structures
for advanced semiconductor lasers, 3) epitaxial layer disordering in III V
Heterostructures, and 4) avalanche processes in semiconductors and gain coupled
semiconductor lasers for applications in optoelectronics. ***
