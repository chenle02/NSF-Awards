This research is centered on two objectives. One goal is focused on the
synthesis and study of new types of metal-thiolate complexes as models for
metal-sulfur centers in proteins. Specific systems include analogs for the
?Fe(SR)4!1- center in rubredoxins2- the ?Fe4S4(SR)4!1- center in high potential
iron-sulfur proteins, the ?Fe3S4(SR))3!2- center in 3Fe-sulfur proteins, and the
?Ni(III)(SR)n! center in hydrogenases. Another goal is to explore new research
directions in the area of metal-oxide compounds as analogs for relevant metal-
oxide centers in biology as well as in the industrially important metal- oxide
supported catalyst. The reaction chemistry of new types of ligands will be
explored. Specifically, compounds that are apt to mimic the iron- or manganese-
oxide centers in hemerythrin, ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase
and Photosystem II will be investigated. This research is being pursued with the
prospect of obtaining fundamental information about the structural,
spectroscopic and reactivity properties of these metal centers in nature. The
interactive activities include numerous lectures in graduate chemistry courses,
and putting together an industrial scientist- graduate student seminar, directed
at enhancing the graduate students' awareness of career opportunities in the
chemical industry. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to
provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in
the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
