This proposal (and a related one, 8918359) will address the bimodality of
western boundary currents in the ocean. Using concepts from dynamical systems
theory, a simple non-linear model will be developed to study the behavior of
ocean currents. These currents have the property of bimodality in which the path
assumes one of two possible trajectories. The Kuroshio in the western Pacific is
an example of such a current, and the model will be developed using parameters
from that region.
