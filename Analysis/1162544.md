The goal of this project is to use computational and analytic methods to
understand the long term dynamics of several problems that are specified by the
Physics etc. The main tools used are analysis, topology and computation. One
computes invariant manifolds by studying (numerically, analytically) the
invariance equations satisfied by them and uses this as the skeleton. This
requires to develop constructive versions of KAM theory, normal hyperbolicity as
well as some novel objects such as the scattering map. This strategy can be
applied also to renormalization maps (maps in the spaces of maps) and analyze
some very chaotic systems.



The unifying principle is to find landmarks that organize the long term behavior
in concrete systems. This is done using systematically numerical calculations
and rigorous mathematics. The use of rigorous mathematics allows to work with
confidence close to the breakdown of the objects considered, when the numerics
becomes less clear.It is also well suited for applications when one needs to
consider concrete mappings, for example in Astrodynamics or in chemical
reactions. This involves projects of different levels and we plan to involve
students in some of them. The students will get training both in numerics and in
rigorous mathematics as well as be able to consider concrete problems.
