A special one and a half day workshop will be held, to identify areas of
academic research that can significantly impact the future of industrial
technology development in the field of materials processing. About 30 leaders,
in the area of materials processing, will be invited to the workshop. They will
include representatives from the academia, industry and the venture capital
community and be required to establish a set of industry- based priorities for
materials processing research. The workshop, at its conclusion, will submit a
final report which will make specific recommendations on those technical
challenges in materials processing and manufacturing to which resources can be
allocated with the highest impact. The identification of such opportunities will
enable efforts and resources to be effectively applied in the area of materials
processing. This will help in slowing and even reversing the gradual erosion of
the United States' international competitiveness in this field.
