9450615 Treichel A consortium led by the Chemistry Department of the University
of Wisconsin-Madison will develop a new chemistry curriculum that will have
three major components: integrating general, analytical, and organic chemistry
into a two-year sequence built around a topic-oriented approach; introducing
active-learning techniques such as cooperative group learning, discovery
learning, and computer-aided instruction into all courses throughout the
curriculum; and developing a variety of intellectual tools that students can
apply effectively to significant problems, and that can be packaged and
disseminated to a variety of institutions. A large number of individuals
representing a wide variety of types of institutions will participate in a
curriculum planning conference that will generate a large set of ideas from
which specific curriculum reforms can be developed. In two subsequent workshops
a smaller group will select the best of these ideas and develop a plan for
comprehensive curriculum reform. UW-Madison's tradition of commitment and
excellence in undergraduate chemistry education, our ability to attract many
excellent chemists/educators as participants in the planning conference, and our
established means of dissemination make us uniquely suited to carry out
curriculum reform.
