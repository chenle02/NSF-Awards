The purpose of the proposed three-year research project is to investigate
characteristics of mathematics learning and its facilitation in an informal,
after school, and urban environment. The research project consists of two
interconnected studies, one focusing on the learning of middle-school students
and the other inquiring into facilitator interventions. The first study focuses
in-depth on (1) the mathematical ideas and forms of mathematical reasoning that
middle school students develop and use as they investigate well defined, open
ended tasks; (2) the patterns of discourse among the students as they build
solutions to each task; and (3) over the course of the study, changes that occur
in students' views about mathematics and about themselves as mathematical
thinkers. The second study documents and analyses facilitator interventions and
their consequent influence on student-to-student discursive interactions and
individual student learning. &lt;br/&gt;
