0302731&lt;br/&gt;Ricketts&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Minnesota
Duluth provides support for the acquisition of a midwater trawl and trawl sonar
plus a dissolved oxygen sensor to be used on R/V Blue Heron operated by the
university's Large Lakes Observatory. These instruments are expected to provide
important shared-use infrastructure for investigations of the ecology and food
web in Lake Superior and adjacent regions. These acquisitions should provide a
substantial advantage to marine scientists using R/V Blue Heron in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
