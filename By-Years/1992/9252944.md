Data sets--one primarily on women in a study of publicly funded housing, and a
second on the "hidden homeless," who are primarily men, will be provided by the
host institution, and will be used to examine: 1) how men's and women's
responses to destitution vary; and 2) the range of strategies women and men use
to survive destitution, the relationship among those strategies, changes over
time in their use, and their consequences for various aspects of well-being.
Appropriate data analytic techniques--both qualitative and quantitative--will be
used to compare women and men as well as to make comparisons among different
groups of women. The proposed research will examine survival strategies in the
face of destitution, especially as they are shaped by gender. This project
furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in science or engineering through research, and to encourage other
women to pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced
visibility as a role model on the host campus. The proposed activities which
contribute to the second objective include: collaboration with an ongoing
project at the Institute, a seminar for graduate students, mentoring individual
graduate research assistants, consulting with undergraduates in the Honors
College, as well as presenting talks to both the Department of Sociology and
other units on campus.
