Anna Krylov of the University of Southern California is supported by an award
from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop predictive
ab initio methods to characterize the electronic structure of ionized and
electron-attached states in model systems, such as small clusters of
nucleobases, DNA hairpins or similar systems. The proposed developments are
based on the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster approach for ionization
potentials (EOM-IP) and electron-attached (EOM-EA) systems, which is capable of
describing multiple closely lying electronic states in an accurate, robust and
efficient computational scheme The PI and her research group are (i)
implementing properties and analytic gradient calculations for EOM-IP-CCSD using
a Frozen Natural Orbitals (FNO) approach); (ii) implementing non-iterative
triples corrections for the IP-CCSD and IP-CISD methods to improve accuracy of
these methods; (iii) extending the FNO scheme to EOM-EA-CCSD energies and
gradient calculations; (iv) implementing efficient calculations of Dyson
orbitals and other inter-state properties to aid interpretation of the results
and facilitate more direct comparisons with the experiments; and (v)
parallelizing and redesigning the tensor library to take advantage of modern
computer architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krylov group develops methods
with the aim to study charge transport through molecular wires, which plays a
central role in many important processes such as the radiative or oxidative
damage in DNA, light harvesting, molecular electronics and solar energy
applications. Software developed by this research group is made available to the
community by being implemented in widely used software packages: Q-CHEM and
SPARTAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported partially by a co-funding
arrangement with the Office of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI).
