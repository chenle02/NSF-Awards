Project develops methods for computing synthetic seismograms using Fourier
techniques. Calculations are for eleastic media, not the more simple acoustic
assumption. Previous work had shown that the methods can make a computation 3
times as fast as an explicit finite difference algorithm. Project will verify
the veracity of the method, perform selected modelling efforts for 2-dimensional
structures, and apply the method to PASSCAL data from the QUACHITA, Arkansas
experiment.
