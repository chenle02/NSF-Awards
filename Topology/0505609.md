The principal thrust of this research project is further development of
efficient triangulations and their applications to the study and understanding
of 3-manifolds. 0- and 1-efficient triangulations have lead to a number of new
methods and results on triangulations of 3-manifolds, decision problems,
algorithms, computational complexity, Heegaard splittings, and Dehn fillings. We
propose to develop further our understanding of 0- and 1-efficient
triangulations and to form a notion of g-efficient triangulations (g > 1). Our
goals are to make an explicit connection between efficient triangulations and
geometric structures on 3-manifolds, to use efficient triangulations for a
better understanding of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and to use our
methods that reduce a given triangulation to an efficient triangulation to
achieve a simplification to the solution of the Homeomorphism Problem for
3-manifolds (Classification of 3-manifolds). In particular, we propose new
algorithms for deciding if a 3-manifold is a Haken manifold, for the JSJ
decomposition of a 3-manifold and for the recognition of Haken manifolds.

Three-dimensional manifolds are mathematical objects which are locally modeled
on familiar three-dimensional space. The major problem in the study of three-
manifolds is their classification, which is to make a complete list of all
three-manifolds without duplications. The study and understanding of three-
manifolds toward such a classification is the main objective of this project. In
particular, we know that three-manifolds can be considered as a union of
building blocks fitting together in a very organized way. For example,
tetrahedra may be used as the building blocks; in this case, the collection of
tetrahedra and the information about how they fit together is called a
triangulation of the three-manifold. All three-manifolds can be triangulated.
Thus one of the major strategies toward solving the classification problem is to
find methods to recognize a particular three-manifold, having been given the
three-manifold in one of its many possible triangulations. Applications of
topology of three-manifolds range from questions of protein knotting and
unknotting in DNA to the issue of the shape of space (the universe). In
particular, the latter may very well come to an issue of recognizing the three-
manifold that is our universe. Thus the classification and understanding of
three-manifolds has far reaching applications and implications.
