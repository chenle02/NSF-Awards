This project intends to develop a complete curriculum for grades 5-8. The
materials to be produced are: instructional materials, staff development
materials, and assessment materials. The instructional materials will consist of
40 units each of about 3-4 weeks duration. They will be developed in the spirit
of the Standards grades 5-8. There will be a "Teacher's Guide" to provide
information on activities, video clips, and technological tools related to each
unit. The staff development material will consist of two pieces: an inservice
program and a teacher network model. The latter component is to lend support to
the teachers. It will include such things as electronic bulletin boards and
collaborative organizations. The third part of the project will be the
assessment materials which will consist of instructional assessment materials
and a "core" curriculum readiness examination to assess the students' readiness
for the "core" curriculum as described in the 9-12 section of the Standards.
