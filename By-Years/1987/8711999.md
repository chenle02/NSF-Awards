The malacology collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County
is the largest in the western United States and the third largest in the
country. Its representation of the Eastern Pacific marine fauna is the most
complete in existence and has been used by all modern workers studying the
region. Additionally, the collection is strong in small-sized species worldwide
and has significant holdings of non-marine mollusks. Previous awards have
allowed the collection to begin computerizing its holdings. Locality data from a
total of nearly 8,000 stations from fully documented expedition sources have
been standardized and entered into the computer. The current project has five
major objectives: 1) Expansion and rearrangement of the marine reference
collection to integrate the three regional collections into a single
systematically- arranged collection. 2) Curation of the newly acquired
collection of Recent mollusks from the University of California at Los Angeles.
3) Curation of a large survey collection made off southern California under the
auspices of the Bureau of Land Management. 4) Computer entry of data for
specimens in the type collection. 5) Continuation of support for visiting
investigators who will examine and re-arrange portions of the collection.
