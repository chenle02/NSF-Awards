This project will incorporate use of an FTIR spectrophotometer into laboratory
courses in organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, analytical chemistry,
advanced synthetic techniques, physical measurements, and biochemistry, and an
active undergraduate research program. The planned uses include exploitation of
the computer-intensive data handling capability of the instrument as well as
special uses such as the study of thin films and solids by use of photoacoustic
spectroscopy and grazing angle techniques. The grantee will match the NSF award
from non-Federal sources.
