The goal of this project is to develop a spectrometer to detect fast neutrons
which will allow the characterization of the background environment for
sensitive underground experiments. These experiments, such as searches for WIMP
dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay, and detection of solar neutrinos,
are some of the highest priority directions in nuclear and particle physics, and
understanding the backgrounds in which they must operate is essential to their
success. &lt;br/&gt;The spectrometer proposed here will use a technique called
capture-gated spectroscopy, with a lithium-loaded liquid scintillator, and will
be able to measure both the fluence and energy of neutrons up to 50 MeV.
&lt;br/&gt;This technique also has important applications in homeland security
and neutron dosimetry.&lt;br/&gt;
