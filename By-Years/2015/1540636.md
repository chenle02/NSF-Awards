ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities
Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific
institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students.
Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the
opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM
fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally
significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for
science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal,
and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct
of undergraduate and graduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining
underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next
generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and
thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an
important step in retaining students who are more likely to continue their
studies and pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce
directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-
defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the
STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) and
University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) will collaborate to develop an earth
systems science major at the tribal college, establish an educational continuum
that will permit LLTC students to earn a BS in tribal resource management from
UMD, and develop an ecosystem network and research agenda between the two
institutions that will result in workforce opportunities for LLTC students, as
well as greater community engagement in ecological issues that impact the
reservation.
