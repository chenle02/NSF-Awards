The objectives of this project are: to help programmers formally specify the
interfaces of modules in the object-oriented programming language C++, and to
help programmers reason about the correctness of programs that use message
passing and inheritance. Work on specification will involve designing and
formally defining an interface specification language for C++, and testing the
utility of the specification language on several examples. The specification
language, Larch/C++, will use subtype relationships and overloading within
assertions to specify polymorphic modules. Work on verification will involve
fundamental studies to understand properties that specification language should
be able to express. These properties include relationships between
specifications such as refinement and subtyping, how to use inheritance in
specifications, and ways to reason about mutation and aliasing. While such
studies may eventually lead to formal methods for the verification of C++
programs, the emphasis will be on learning how to specify the properties that
need to be proved. The project would promote the reuse of designs and program
modules, and would help guide reasoning about C++ programs. The techniques
developed would also be applicable to other object-oriented languages.
