Abstract:

An international conference will be held on mathematical control theory for
systems governed by partial differential equations. This is an area of applied
mathematics that has recently been sparked by new questions and new modeling
challenges. These new questions have given rise to new mathematical and
computational methods that will be discussed at this conference to be held at
Georgetown University from May 31 to June 2, 2003.
