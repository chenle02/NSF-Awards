This conference will be held March 21.23, 1988 at the Johns Hopkins University
on various areas of continuum physics and related disciplines that have
undergone considerable development during the last twenty.five years. About a
dozen major speakers will provide surveys of achievement in their fields of
expertise. Many fields of continuum physics have enjoyed marked growth since the
end of the Second World War. These fields provide precise and illuminating
formulations of governing equations of a rich variety of physical phenomena.
