The Ninth International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology is being held for the
first time in the U.S. on July 19-24, 1992 in Monterey, California. This
conference/workshop brings together top workers in the field of plant membrane
biology to present their latest research, to exchange ideas and techniques and
to foster collaborations. The subjects to be included are the structure,
function and regulation of membrane transport proteins, metabolic
compartmentation, membrane receptors, light and hormone-mediated signal
transduction, membrane protein targetting, and transport through plasmodesmata.
Two instructional workshops, including manufacturer-sponsored equipment
demonstrations, are planned on patch clamping and intracellular calcium
measurements. Nobel laureate, Bert Sakmann, will present the keynote address. It
is anticipated that the exciting scientific program combined with the scenic
environment should provide ideal conditions for the exchange of information and
the generation of new ideas which will greatly benefit U.S. scientists and
students working in this fundamental area of plant biology.
