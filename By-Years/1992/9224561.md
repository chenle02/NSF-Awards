This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Gellman at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. This study will investigate the
conformation-directing effects of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are
relevant to protein folding by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopic methods. The specific
topics of study are: the intrinsic stability of isolated alpha-helical turns,
the postulated helix-initiating role of N-terminal proline residues, the
intrinsic stability of beta-hairpins, conformation-specifying effects of ionic
peptide appendages, mechanisms of cooperativity among intramolecular hydrogen
bonds, and the conformation-directing role of nonpolar-nonpolar interactions
(including the hydrophobic effect) in aqueous solution. %%% The results from
Professor Samuel H. Gellman's spectroscopic studies will contribute
significantly to our understanding of protein folding. The importance of his
work is the determination of thermodynamic parameters to assess the relative
contributions of hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding to peptide and protein
stability.
