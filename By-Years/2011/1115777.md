Polyhedral methods to solve polynomial systems exploit the sparsity structure
and give rise to hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms for the computation of
Puiseux series expansions of the solutions. The leading powers of the series are
tropisms and are defined by the exact Newton polytopes of the system, while the
coefficients of the series are solutions of initial form systems which may have
coefficients of limited accuracy. The new algorithms will be implemented in the
free open source software system PHCpack, with interfaces to computer algebra
systems such as Macaulay 2 and Sage (linking the PHCpack library as a Python
module). As almost all modern computers have multiple cores enabling to compute
in parallel, we design our algorithms for speedup and quality, using the
multiple cores to compensate for the cost of multiprecision
arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solving polynomial systems is a fundamental
problem in mathematics with applications to various fields of science and
engineering. Solvers that exploit the sparse structure provide better solutions
faster. Algorithms and software produced by the proposed research will be
disseminated through the users and developers community of Macaulay 2, a
computer algebra system for research and teaching in algebraic geometry and
commutative algebra. Implementations on parallel computers will enable the
efficient solution of large computational problems.
