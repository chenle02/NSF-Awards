With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Norbert F.
Scherer in the Chemistry Department at the University of Chicago will develop a
multiphoton fluorescence microscope for time-resolved and super-resolution
studies in chemistry and biology. The goals of this development project are a)
to develop a non-linear optical microscope capable of sub-diffraction limit
imaging by stimulated emission depletion (STED); b) to use fluctuation
spectroscopy to determine local molecular concentrations in few-attoliter
volumes and to establish lifetime imaging; and c) to investigate chemical
reaction dynamics in very small volumes in heterogeneous materials via time-
resolved STED. The PI will develop a user-friendly instrument capable of
studying dynamics on a timescale from femtoseconds to seconds; in addition, the
instrument will have 3-D imaging capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
studies will bring state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy techniques to the
United States biological research community. In particular, the payoff for
biological research will be quite substantial if superresolution can be
demonstrated for a variety of fluorophore systems. &lt;br/&gt;
