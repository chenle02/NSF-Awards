With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Barnard College will acquire a
gas chromatograph mass spectrometer with flame ionization detector (GC/MS/FID).
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies
of contaminant concentrations and metabolite formation in laboratory bacterial
and protozoan cultures; b) analysis of components of biologically-produced
organic matter; c) analysis of product distributions of intermolecular reactions
of dihalocarbenes with strained olefins; and d) kinetic studies of
N-heterocyclic carbenes. &lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric
detection (GCMS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research in environmental and organic chemistry at Barnard College.
