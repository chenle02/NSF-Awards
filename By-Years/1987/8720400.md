Construction of a detector at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility Cooler
Ring T-site is proposed by the University of Pittsburgh in collaboration with
IUCF. The detector will be used for kinematically complete measurements of
threshold pion production in NN collisions by making coincident np measurements.
Associated with the detector is a new large aperture magnet which will be
constructed and placed in the ring, replacing a small bore magnet, for the
purpose of utilizing large acceptance detectors arrayed around the intersection
region. A gas jet target will be used, and reaction products detected in an
array of scintillators and multi-wire drift chambers. A new scattering chamber
and other associated vacuum chambers will be constructed. New scintillators,
drift chambers, associated readout and general purpose electronics, and power
supplies will be purchased. Most of the new equipment will remain at IUCF for
the purpose of serving users of the facility.
