This is a group proposal for the continued support of research in theoretical
physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A broad research program
is proposed, including studies of string theory, gauge/string duality, cosmic
superstrings, quantum black holes, particle astrophysics, quantum chaos theory,
lattice gauge theory, and the application of quantum field theory to phenomena
in particle physics and quantitative biology. Research in string theory will
focus on time-dependent string field theory, analytic approaches to quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), gauge/gravity dualities, string vacua, and supersymmetry
breaking. In particle astrophysics, non-Markovian quantum corrections to the
Boltzmann equation will be assessed for their impact on various astrophysical
phenomena, such as fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation,
production of elements in Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and neutrino transport in
the sun and in supernovae. Research in quantum chaos theory will focus on the
classical Ruelle resonances and their role in quantum phenomena, with
applications to quantum black holes. Work in particle physics phenomenology will
include studies of the neutrino mixing matrix. Work in quantitative biology will
focus on the application of quantum field theory to the physics of RNA folding.
Research in lattice gauge theory will be directed at the study of the masses of
strongly interacting particles, the properties of light pseudoscalar mesons, the
decays of particles with heavy quarks, and the behavior of strongly interacting
matter at high temperatures
