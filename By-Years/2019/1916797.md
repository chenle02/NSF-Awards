Innovations in plant science are needed to tackle global sustainability, food
security and human health. Plants not only form the foundation of terrestrial
ecosystems and the human food supply, but also provide renewable energy and
essential medicines. The goal of this workshop is to bring together scientists
from the fields of data science and bioinformatics, imaging, proteomics, single
cell profiling and nanotechnology to brainstorm and develop tools to lay the
groundwork for creating a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic molecular
organization of the plant cell, an initiative we are calling the Plant Cell
Atlas. A Plant Cell Atlas will become a crucial resource for the scientific
community to address basic, long-standing questions in biology that relate
directly to grand challenges in food security and climate change. This community
will leverage and extend a number of revolutionary technologies and techniques
and be poised to create new techniques. This conference will foster a network of
young and established scientists. We will proactively recruit participants from
underrepresented scientists and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop aims at starting a community of
interdisciplinary scientists to meet and brainstorm about broader directions the
Plant Cell Atlas initiative should take, the challenges it might pose on the way
and how to be prepared to meet those challenges. The workshop also aims to
foster interaction with and input from the leading scientists of the Human Cell
Atlas project by inviting some of them to share their perspectives and
participate in workshop activities. The workshop will feature presentations of
initial data, along with broader ideas, in the form of invited talks and short
talks from abstracts. In addition, breakout sessions and panel discussions will
be organized around topics including technical challenges, community wants and
needs, and the conceptual goals of the plant cell atlas. These activities will
facilitate interaction and networking among the participants of this initiative.
We anticipate various proposal concepts and collaborations to form from this
gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was co-funded by the Cellular
Dynamics and Function and Genetic Mechanisms clusters of the Division of
Molecular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program of the Division
Integrative Organismal Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
