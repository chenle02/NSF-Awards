This research is concerned with improving the laser-heated pedestal-growth
method in order to grow long single crystalline fibers of sapphire, yittrium
aluminum garnet, titanium carbide, titanium diboride, and barium fluoride.
Single crystal fibers of these materials in lengths greater than one meter have
not previously been grown. These fibers will have potential widespread
applications in such areas as strengthening elements in structural composite
materials, and fiber optic sensors for medical and other applications.
