This NSF award provides partial support for U.S. based participants of a
conference titled "1, 2, 3; Curves, Surfaces, and 3-Manifolds" in Nahsholim
Israel and the Technion Institute of Technology, May 7-11, 2023. The goal of the
conference is to bring together researchers at all career stages to discuss
intersections in geometry and topology in dimensions 1, 2, and 3. These topics
have become intimately intertwined over the past 40 years, and have provided the
impetus for the much of the development of entire fields of mathematics, such as
geometric group theory. Importantly, the conference will also include workshop-
style talks aimed at helping bridge the gap between seasoned researchers and the
next generation of mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confluence of
topology and geometry of three dimensional manifolds, and the geometric
properties of mapping class groups, has been intensively studied over the last
several decades and is of central importance in a variety of mathematical
disciplines. For example, hyperbolic 3-manifolds are often governed by certain
surfaces contained in them. These surfaces inherit their own hyperbolic
structures from their inclusion into the 3-manifold, and these structures are
very coarsely encoded by collections of curves on the surface. Miraculously, in
key situations, the hyperbolic 3-manifold can be reconstituted from this
collection of curves--this is the essential content of the Ending Lamination
Theorem. The mathematics developed to study curves used in the proof of this
theorem simultaneously provide a powerful toolkit for studying mapping class
groups of surfaces. Abstractions of these tools now provide the framework for
studying a very large and robust class of groups from a geometric perspective.

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
