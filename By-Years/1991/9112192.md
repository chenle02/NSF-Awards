An experimental project is proposed to investigate laser-assisted layer epitaxy
(LALE) for the selective area deposition of InGaAsP/InP based optoelectronic
devices. Demonstration of the LALE process for the selective area deposition of
InGaAsP/InP heterstructures could revolutionize the methods currently used to
grow and fabricate these devices. Current fabrication techniques for
optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) involve several epitaxial growth runs
and processing sequences. On the other hand, LALE would provide a spatially
controlled epitaxial process to grow OEICs in a single growth run. TO date, no
research has been conducted on LALE in the InGaAsP/InP materials system, which
is playing an every increasing role in optical communication and photonic
integrated circuits. The principal objective of this project is to demonstrate
the LALE of InGaAs and InGaAsP in a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
system (MOCVD).
