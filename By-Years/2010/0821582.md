This award provides funds to the Florida International University to acquire a
Nanoimprinter for research and education. Nanoimprinting is not governed by the
optical diffraction limit and has the capability of large area exposures with
high throughput. It will enable researchers at FIU?s open-access lab to conduct
several main cutting edge research projects, such as: the development of micro-
batteries based on carbon nanoelectrodes; integrated nano-photonic devices based
on polymers; the mechanics of nanostructured polymer materials; DNA array
biomedical devices; Micro/Nano fluidic devices; and carbon-nanotube sensors. The
proposed activities will advance knowledge in and across different fields. By
acquiring this next level of capability, FIU researchers and collaborators will
be able to perform research on nanotechnology devices and processes that have
great potential for actual applications. &lt;br/&gt;The successful development
of the proposed projects, enabled by the Nanoimprinter acquisition, has broad
implications in health care and homeland security. This instrumentation research
will integrate undergraduate and graduate student?s training. Existing hands-on
laboratory courses will be expanded to include experiments with this new
nanoscale mass-production technology. Together with the exciting research
topics, the enhanced infrastructure for research at FIU - one of the top
Hispanic Serving Institutions in Florida - will attract more students from our
underrepresented population into graduate school. A big impact on increasing the
number of students in materials science, biomedical and electrical engineering
from traditionally underrepresented groups is expected. Exposing graduate and
undergraduate students to this new technology in an open-access laboratory will
also help to boost interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research
collaboration across various research groups, blurring the boundary of
departments and even institutions. The Nanoimprinter will be placed in the
existing open-access Motorola Nanofabrication Research Facility, and will be
easily accessible to campus users as well as other academic and industry users
in south Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
