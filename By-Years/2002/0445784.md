The enormous amount of information processed in the nervous system is dependent
on a complex network of trillions of neuronal connections. These neural
connections are formed during embryonic development, when neurons extend axonal
projections to their targets. Axonal migration occurs in a highly precise and
stereotypic fashion. The objective of this project is to determine the cellular
and molecular mechanisms by which motor axons migrate from the spinal cord to
their distant muscle targets.

The laboratory of Dr. Granato uses the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate
the molecular and cellular aspects of axonal migration. This project focuses on
one gene, called diwanka. In embryos in which the diwanka gene is defective,
motor axons fail to extend to their muscle targets, suggesting that this gene
plays a crucial role in guiding motor axons. Dr. Granato has recently identified
the gene responsible for the diwanka phenotype. The gene is thought to play a
role in collagen modification, but its precise role in guiding motor axons is
currently unknown. In the experiments proposed here, Dr. Granato will
investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this gene helps in
making precise neural connections.

This research program has broad impacts, in providing scientific research
positions at different levels (premed and post-doctoral) to underrepresented
minorities, and by enhancing scientific discoveries that may benefit society
(i.e. regeneration of motoneuronal connection), as well as by presenting our
research discoveries at interdisciplinary conferences.
