Abstract

This proposal describes an international conference on partial hyperpbolicity
and related topics to be held in Chicago in May, 2006. The goals of the
conference are to disseminate recent breakthroughs in the field and to promote
integration of and collaboration among the different approaches to the area that
have developed in the past 10 years. This will be the third conference in a
series that began with an NSF-supported conference organized by the PIs in May,
2001.

The topic of partial hyperbolicity emerged in the early seventies and has become
a central direction in which the theory of complicated ("chaotic") dynamical
systems has developed. The study of partial hyperbolicity and related systems
has extended significantly beyond the classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics,
driven by the realization that many practical applications of dynamical systems
to experimental phenomena do require a much broader theory. The broader impact
and intellectual merits of this proposal are multifold and interrelated:

* Because of the conference focus on minicourses, graduate students and recent
Ph.D.'s within the US will be exposed to cutting edge research in the area, even
before this knowledge has been disseminated by other means.

*A portion of the plenary talks in this conference will be devoted to recent
applications of the theory of partially hyperbolic systems to mechanical
systems, as well as certain systems in biology.

*The conference will bring together participants from four continents; the
expectation is that the conference will lead to new collaborative ventures
between these participants and US participants.

*Finally, the conference will increase the worldwide visibility of US
researchers in the area of partially hyperbolic and related dynamical systems.
