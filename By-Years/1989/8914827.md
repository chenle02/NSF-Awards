Funding for a microprocessor-controlled atomic absorption spectrophotometer is
made. This machine will replace a twenty year old instrument at the Rensselaer
Fresh Water Institute and will be used in a variety of studies, ranging from
very applied to very basic. Research efforts involving contamination of inland
surface water by heavy metals, microbial and aquatic/plant stress in acid
impacted environments, and metal contamination and recovery in industrial
processes will be undertaken.
