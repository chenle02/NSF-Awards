The reallocation of workers from one job to another involves large numbers of
workers at all phases of the business cycle, indeed between 5 and 10 per cent of
all employed workers per quarter. In addition, recent empirical evidence
confirms job destruction is at least as important as job creation as a source of
fluctuations in aggregate employment. In recent work, the investigator has
developed a model of the labor market to account for these facts. The purpose of
this project is to further develop and then to use the model to analyze a number
of important questions regarding the labor market. Some of these questions are:
(1) In the context of the model, does the empirical fact that wages tend to be
rigid have important quantitative consequences for the level of unemployment and
for worker welfare? (2) What are the expected magnitudes of the effects of
severance pay and prior separation notice policies on job creation and on job
destruction? (3) Technical progress is often associated with the need to
reallocate workers from old technologies to new ones. To what extent does this
process contribute to unemployment? (4) Who benefits from and who bears the cost
of the worker reallocation process? This project is important because answers to
these questions have important implications for our better understanding of
worker reallocation, and its effects on the experience of unemployed workers as
well as on the aggregate level of employment.
