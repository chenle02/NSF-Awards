This research project concerns studies of fundamental symmetries in mathematics,
and how they interact with each other, creating larger symmetries. The aim is to
give a quantitative analysis of the number of times some symmetries appear as a
result of such interactions. The analysis will help elucidate the nature of
symmetries in general and will apply to other spaces and families of discrete
objects exhibiting such symmetries. The work has important applications in
probability and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is concerned with
the study of Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group, which are some of
the most classical objects in Algebraic Combinatorics. It aims at applications
of enumerative and computational complexity nature, for estimating the
coefficients and deciding their positivity. On a combinatorics side, the
proposal aims to establish new unimodality results for various classes of
partitions. The employed tools are largely intrinsic in these fields, involve
group representation theory, Schur functions, and combinatorics of Young
tableaux, with some bijective and analytic methods in partition theory added to
the mix.
