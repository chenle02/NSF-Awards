This project is providing equipment for a studio classroom for statistics
instruction. The studio format is replacing the traditional lecture delivery
method for introductory statistics courses by allowing the integration of
multimedia instruction, student-centered activities, and computer simulations.
The design of the studio fosters student instructor interaction, student student
interactions, team projects, and small group activities. The project is
benefitting approximately 1,500 students per year. *
