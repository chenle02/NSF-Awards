This award funds continuation of a very active research program in
extragalactic astronomy by one of the pioneering groups in the area of Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), In addition to providing correlator services for
Mark II VLBI observations throughout the U.S. and much of the world, these
researchers will continue their investigations of active galaxies, and attempt
to discriminate between a number of competing models for these objects. They
will also be active in the first use of the Very Long Baseline Array of radio-
telescopes, both as users of this new instrument and a developers of software
for data reduction and analysis for that facility.
