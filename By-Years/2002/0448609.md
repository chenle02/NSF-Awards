The design of systems that can detect and recognize objects in large image and
video repositories will enable significant developments in areas as diverse as
life sciences, surveillance and law enforcement, entertainment, advertisement,
and copyright protection, among others. While significant progress has been
achieved in this area over the last decades, the design of such systems still
requires vast amounts of expert knowledge and manual labor. This project lays
the foundation for a long-term vision of recognition systems containing banks of
recognition modules fully trainable by naive users, with minimal requirements in
terms of manual data pre-processing and computational complexity. From a
technical standpoint, the project addresses two fundamental barriers in the path
to this objective: 1) the dependence of current classifiers on carefully
assembled and pre-processed training sets, and 2) the training complexity of
state-of-the-art classification architectures. The first is addressed through
the introduction of a new statistical learning framework, denoted by weakly
supervised assembly of training sets, which combines elements of discriminant
visual saliency and image matching to automate the process of assembling the
training sets required for detection and recognition. The second is addressed
through the introduction of new, and computationally efficient, boosting methods
for the design of cascades of large-margin classifiers, with support for both
template and constellation-based object representations. At the educational
level, the project will contribute to the advancement of the coverage of the
recognition problem, through the introduction of new courses, and the
development of a software library to be used as a teaching aid in visual
information retrieval courses. The design of this library will also provide
research opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds at a scale
well beyond what can usually be found at the undergraduate level.
