An ad hoc network is a group of mobile computers (or nodes) using wireless
network interfaces, in which individual nodes cooperate by forwarding packets
for each other to allow nodes to communicate beyond their direct wireless
transmission ranges. This project is attempting to create a routing protocol for
ad hoc networks that is highly robust against attacks, yet is able to perform
close to the best existing non-secure ad hoc network routing protocols.

The research focuses primarily on on-demand (or reactive) routing protocols, in
which a node attempts to discover a route to some destination only when it has a
packet to send to that destination, but also considers how the routing security
techniques developed apply to other styles of ad hoc network routing protocols
such as periodic (or proactive) and hybrid protocols. The research addresses
passive and active attackers, including cooperating attacking nodes and
compromised nodes. The types of attacks considered range from routing disruption
attacks, in which an attacker attempts to cause legitimate data packets to be
routed in dysfunctional ways, to resource consumption attacks, in which an
attacker injects packets into the network in an attempt to consume valuable
network resources such as bandwidth, or to consume node resources such as memory
(storage) or computation power.
