Glucocorticoids are hormones secreted from the adrenal glands of animals and
human beings. These hormones are known to influence brain function and behavior
in both adult and developing organisms. The hippocampus, a brain area involved
in memory and learning, is a particularly important target site of
glucocorticoid action. Previous research has demonstrated that altered
glucocorticoid levels early in life significantly modify the development of the
hippocampus, yet few studies have examined the functional consequences of these
changes in brain organization. Dr. Meyer will perform experiments in which young
laboratory rats will be exposed to either very low glucocorticoid levels (by
surgically removing their adrenal glands) or high levels (produced by injection
of hormones into non-operated animals). Appropriate control procedures will also
be performed. All subjects will subsequently be tested in a spatial-learning
task, the Morris water maze, that critically depends on the hippocampus for
normal performance. Separate animals from each group will be studied at
different ages, thereby enabling Dr. Meyer to detect disturbances in the normal
developmental appearance of spatial-learning ability. These experiments will
provide important new information about the role of glucocorticoids in normal
behavioral development as well as the potential deleterious effects of early
exposure to high levels of hormones, as sometimes occurs in human clinical
situations.
