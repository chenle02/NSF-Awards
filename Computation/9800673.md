This project supports graduate student and junior researcher participation in
the Fifth International Conference on Integral Methods in Science and
Engineering (IMSE98) which will be held August 10-13, 1998 at Michigan
Technological University, Houghton, Michigan.

The invited speakers:

Gregory Beylkin (University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado), Archie G. Gibson
(University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico), Glenn R. Ierley (Scripps
Institute, San Diego, California), Sangtae Kim (University of Wisconsin,
Madison, Wisconsin), M. Zuhair Nashed (University of Delaware, Newark,
Delaware), Jean Claude Nedelec (Centre de Mathematiques Appliquees, Palaiseau,
France), Brian Sleeman (University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom),

Will discuss numerous rapidly evolving areas of Integral Methodology. Since such
techniques embrace a wide variety of scientific disciplines, conference
participants will have many opportunities to broaden established research
programs, as well as obtain an introduction to a wide range of fields employing
integral methodologies. Since this is truly an interdisciplinary meeting, there
will be many opportunities for technology transfer of state of the art integral
methods to and between the different applied sciences and engineering. In
addition, this conference will provide the opportunity for young scientists to
meet, listen to, converse with, and learn from more seasoned researchers.
