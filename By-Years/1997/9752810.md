Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering (T4E) is a one-week short course offered
during the summer at the United States Military Academy, West Point. The goal of
the T4E program is to raise the standard of teaching excellence in undergraduate
engineering programs nationwide by increasing the number of engineering faculty
who have studied and practiced sound, proven teaching methods. The principal
objectives of the short course are ( 1) to provide a diverse group of 24
relatively inexperienced engineering educators with an opportunity to make
substantive improvements in both the effectiveness and efficiency of their
teaching, and (2) to provide six additional senior faculty members or
administrators to observe the course, for the purpose of establishing similar
programs at their own institutions. The course strives to meet the needs of
faculty from two-year and four-year teaching and research institutions and to
achieve appropriate representation from groups that are typically
underrepresented on engineering faculties-- women, African-Americans, Hispanic-
Americans, Native Americans, and individuals with disabilities. In a series of
workshops, the short course addresses topics in organization and presentation of
classes, establishing objectives, student learning styles, instructional
technology, student-teacher relations, promotion and tenure, and success in
academia. Working in small groups, participants will prepare and present
practice classes and will be critiqued on their performance by the T4E faculty
and their fellow participants. Through this experience, participants will build
confidence and poise; they will significantly improve their ability to prepare
classes efficiently; and they will develop the self-assessment skills necessary
for continued long-term improvement after the short course. This highly focused,
week-long immersion experience will provide a foundation on which participants
ca build their own individual teaching styles, consistent with their own
personalit ies and teaching environments. Following the workshop, participants
are expected to interact with faculty at their own institutions to promote the
cause of teaching excellence. Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering is expected
to have an immediate, substantive impact on the teaching skills of participants
because of its practical, student-centered approach and its emphasis on actual
"get-up-anddo-it" teaching. *
