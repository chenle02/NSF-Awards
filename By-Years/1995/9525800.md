ATM 95-25800 ABSTRACT WILLIAM COLLINS NCAR TITLE: "INVESTIGATION OF THE WARM
POOL SURFACE HEAT BUDGET AND VALIDATION OF ATMOSPHERIC GCMS USING TOGA COARE
DATA." This is a three year project that seeks to establish relationships
between SST, convection, moisture, and radiative forcing and to validate climate
GCMs by the application of the results obtained. The work proposed is thus not
only highly relevant to COARE but also closely connected to climate issues that
center on the maintenance of the warm pools and its global climate effects. The
investigators will 1) analyze the observed data for cloud radiative forcings, 2)
analyze the surface heat budget on various time scales in different SST regimes,
and 3) conduct GCM validation.
