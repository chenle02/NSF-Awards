This research is building an understanding of what data is useful to attackers
and what data is private for its legitimate owners so that security systems can
incorporate these values into a data-driven, defense-in-depth approach to
securing our digital lives.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We are exploiting the fact
that both users and attackers must sift through vast amounts of data to find
useful information. This system, called contextual data protection, enables
users to passively manage their private and potentially lucrative stored data
with minimal overhead, adding extra protection to private data which greatly
lowers the risk inherent in long lived archives.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously, we are creating effective defenses for data by
improving our understanding of cybercrime, information use habits, and
acceptable usability tradeoffs for data access. Building on previous research
analyzing the financial successes of spam-based cybercrime, we are developing a
methodology and apparatus for understanding the illicit value of stolen
information. By understanding what is discoverable and valuable to attackers, we
can develop techniques to focus security efforts on lucrative information,
thereby preventing cybercriminals from turning a profit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, our goal is to create a set of general techniques that
use tools from cryptography that defend users' data by exploiting a deeper
understanding of its value to both the users and the attackers. This research
will shed light on the meaning of information value, ownership, and protection
in this era of long-lived digital storage.
