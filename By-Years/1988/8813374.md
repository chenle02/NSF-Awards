The effects of metal ions on the hydrolysis of a series of carboxyl substituted
esters and amides will be studies to allow a chemical assessment of the
mechanistic possibilities for the metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A. In this work
all the currently recognized will be investigated in systems of know mechanism
so that a quantitative evaluation may be made of the effects on the rate
constants of: 1\0 the identity of the metal ion, 2\0 the strength of binding of
the metal ion to either the carbonyl oxygen or the leaving group, 3) the pka of
the leaving group, and 4) the stearic fit of the carboxyl group. In conjunction
with the chemical work a kinetic investigation of carboxypeptidase A will be
carried out employing new types of substrates with which the leaving group can
be varied. Conformational effects will be investigated in stopped-flow studies
and in inhibition studies. The later experiments will give information on the
nature of the sites in which esters, peptides, and inhibiting the enzyme,
because these techniques have proven successful in other systems and because of
her experience in protein work, funding is recommended.
