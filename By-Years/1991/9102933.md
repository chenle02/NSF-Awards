Objective of this work characterize Li isotopic composition of major reservoirs
and apply isotopic systematics to probe the nature and magnitude of element
transfer during various marine processes. Specific research will include (1)
estimation of the flux of Li isotopes from continental runoff; (2) study of
seawater-ocean crust exchange as reflected in the distribution of Li isotopes in
metabasalts, hydrothermal fluids and weathered seafloor basalt; (3) assessment
of the Li in the ocean; and (4) evaluation of the element cycling processes at
convergent plate margins including island arcs and continental margins. The
results of this study will constitute the first comprehensive Li isotope data
which not only will characterize the geochemical cycle of Li but can serve as a
basis for understanding oceanic processes that have significant geochemical and
geophysical implications.
