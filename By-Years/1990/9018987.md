This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a mass spectrometer
system for the measurement of noble gases. The equipment will be installed at
the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University. Columbia
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The system will
be capable of measuring all noble gases from helium-3 to xenon-136 with high
resolution and sensitivity. Applications will include projects emphasizing the
use of noble gas tracers in the field of hydrogeology, including reconstructions
of paleotemperatures for the continents, the dynamics of deep circulation
groundwater using helium-4 and argon-40 and the dating of groundwater using the
tritium/helium-3 method
