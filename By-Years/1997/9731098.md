This project supports an aerosol sampling program that will be carried out in
collaboration between the University of New Hampshire, the University of
Colorado/CIRES, and the Nepalese Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM).
The concentrations of soluble ionic species, organic carbon and elemental carbon
in aerosol will be determined on a continuous basis (at a nominal 2-day
resolution) at these stations for approximately two years. This filter sampling
will be complemented by continuous multi-wavelength aerosol optical depth
measurements at each station. One station will be situated near Kathmandu, and
the other at an altitude of 4100 m. The primary objective is to determine the
modifications in the aerosol content of air masses as they traverse Nepal from
south to north and encounter the Himalayan Massif. The alternating influence of
summer monsoon air from the Bay of Bengal and wintertime westerlies are expected
to cause large seasonal variations in the concentration and composition of
aerosols. Optical depth measurements will provide information on the
relationships between surface-level air masses and the aerosol burden in the
overlying column. Little is currently known about the atmospheric chemistry over
much of central Asia due to a lack of systematic sampling in this broad region.
The central Asian monsoon circulation is the primary source of water for densely
populated regions of Asia, and is also a major component of the global climate
system. Model predictions suggest that anthropogenic modifications of
atmospheric composition could greatly modify regional climate, including the
strength of the summer monsoon and therefore the amount of much needed
precipitation.
