The principal investigator aims to understand the interplay between contact
geometry in 3 dimensions and invariants of 3-manifolds. Contact structures are
geometric objects which originated in the study of optics in the 19th century;
in recent years they have become important tools in low-dimensional topology,
providing information about the shapes of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces such as
our universe, and in knot theory, which has seen emerging links to such topics
as protein folding. Many of the tools which the PI uses to study such spaces,
including Floer homology theories, draw heavily from mathematical physics, and
they contain contact-geometric data which has provided a wealth of information
about both the contact structures themselves and about the spaces in which they
reside. The proposed research would investigate such data and uncover
connections which it provides between disparate areas of mathematics, including
algebra, topology, and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to study
invariants of contact structures and 3-manifolds, especially homological
invariants of 3-manifolds with boundary, which arise from gauge theory and
symplectic geometry. The first goal of this project is to develop applications
to topology and to symplectic geometry of contact invariants in several Floer
homology theories for sutured 3-manifolds. These potential applications include
computable obstructions to Lagrangian concordances between Legendrian knots;
bounds on the number of Reeb orbits in a contact 3-manifold, generalizing the
proof of the Weinstein conjecture in this setting; and an intriguing conjecture
relating Stein fillings of a 3-manifold to representations of its fundamental
group. The second goal is to establish a relationship between different sutured
Floer homology theories, whose corresponding closed 3-manifold invariants
(Heegaard Floer homology, monopole Floer homology, and embedded contact
homology) are now all known to be isomorphic, and to identify their respective
contact invariants as well. The third goal is to investigate an emerging
connection between Legendrian contact homology (LCH) and new sheaf-theoretic
Legendrian knot invariants, and in doing so to apply algebro-geometric
techniques to problems in contact geometry and hopefully understand the
relationship of LCH to classical knot invariants.
