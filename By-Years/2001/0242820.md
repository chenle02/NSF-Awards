Two magnetohydrodynamic models will be developed to study non-thermal heating,
the generation of directed plasma flows, and energetic particle acceleration
processes in solar and stellar atmospheres. A critical component of both
simulations will be a realistic description of transport processes in the form
of anisotropic tensors for electric and thermal conductivities, as well as
viscosity. Such a treatment is necessary when magnetized plasma is neither in a
collisionless, nor collision-dominated regime. One model will describe the
propagation of small amplitude waves in two spatial dimensions with special
emphasis on the role of Pedersen currents in heating the plasma where ions are
"magnetized" (i.e., the product of the cyclotron frequency and the collision
time is of order unity). The second model will treat time-dependent shock
formation in one spatial dimension and its impact on heating and the formation
of supersonic jets.
