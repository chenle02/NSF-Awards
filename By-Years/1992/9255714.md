Project Tellus is developing six (6) multidisciplinary video modules on global
environment change concerns and issues that are indigenous to the Gulf of
Mexico. For this project, information is synthesized for module production from
Sea Grant staff, classroom teachers, university scientists, state agency
specialists and recent research results and findings on global change. The 6
modules are designed around general topics as follows: scientific process,
climatic change, biodiversity, sea level rise, exotic species and water quality.
Classroom teachers are extensively involved in the writing, development, and
dissemination of the materials.
