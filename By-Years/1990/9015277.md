This research will develop an information and decision theoretic model of
integration and identify the characterizing information requirements for three
major functions of manufacturing: process design, production planning, and shop
floor control. The model development will be conducted in two phases. In Phase
I, the investigators will unite previous results in several major disciplines of
the literature to uncover the basic sub-functions, decision spaces, logical
interrelationships, and required data classes and knowledge classes pertaining
to these functions. In Phase II, the model will be calibrated to certain
previous efforts, using empirical results obtained from the industry-sponsored
Computer Integrated Manufacturing Program at Rensselaer. This research focuses
on integration issues that are crucial to the development of competitive
manufacturing systems. The results should provide considerable insight into the
information- theoretic aspects of future manufacturing systems.
