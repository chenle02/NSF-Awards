This project enables mechanical engineering students to conduct ultra-high
temperature experiments. The equipment purchased includes an electric furnace
capable of reaching 1950 K, and a data acquisition system for recording and
processing experimental data. The laboratory improves the offering in materials
science by permitting the study of the mechanical properties of ceramics. It
also allows students in Heat Power Design and Senior Independent Courses to
consider potential processes that use high temperature solar energy as a
substitute for those that currently consume conventional fossil fuels. Students
experimentally investigate chemical reactions adaptable to such processes. The
experience with ceramics heightens undergraduate students' awareness of
materials other than just conventional steel and nonferrous alloys. It further
serves to illustrate chemical reactions that may become a part of pioneering
processes while increasing interest in energy and environmental research. The
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
