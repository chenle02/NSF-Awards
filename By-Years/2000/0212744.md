This proposal requests travel funds from the National Science Foundation to help
fund a focused workshop, to take place in part at the Louisiana State University
(LSU), and in part at the LIGO Livingston Observatory, to aid in the creation of
"source working groups" for interferometric gravitational wave detectors.
