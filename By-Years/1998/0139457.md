THz optoelectronic devices, imaging, and spectroscopy have the potential for
widespread use in commercial applications. This program will focus on the
development of wideband THz devices based on electro-optic polymer composites.
Focus will be placed on two important applications: (1) the development of a THz
emitter-detector pair that has significantly wider bandwidth than is currently
available and (2) the development of large area THz detectors for direct imaging
applications. The goal is not merely to demonstrate the highest frequency of
detection but rather to develop an ultra-wide bandwidth emitter-detector pair
that will have significant impact on spectroscopic applications in the THz
regime. In addition to these two major goals, detailed measurements and analysis
will be performed and on various electro-optic and photorefractive polymer
composites in the THz regime. These studies will help to develop a body of
knowledge about these materials and devices that will be needed to understand
and bridge the gap between very high speed electronic devices and photonic ones.
