9500812 Navrotsky Nanophase materials (particle sizes in the 1-100 nm range) are
important as ceramic precursors, catalysts, and adsorbents, molecular sieves,
coatings, etc. This work seeks to test the hypothesis that structures which are
metastable in the bulk are actually energetically stabilized as nanoscale
materials. Using gamma alumina as a technologically important example, in
collaboration with Alcoa, Co-PI proposed to determine the enthalpy of the
alphagamma transition as a function of particle size (surface area) by high
temperature solution calorimetric techniques. %%% PI proposed to determine the
enthalpy of the alpha-gamma transition in alumina as a function of particle size
by high temperature solution calorimetric techniques. The results will be useful
in understanding the stability of nanosize particles of metastable phases.
