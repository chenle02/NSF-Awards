The project revamps several laboratory courses and develops a new laboratory
course in powder metallurgy to produce a unified approach to teaching advanced
materials use and processing to mechanical engineers. The acquisition of a x-ray
sedigraph completes the laboratory facility development for the material science
and engineering plan to enhance its undergraduate curriculum. The goals of this
plan are to return materials processing to an equal leg of the processing,
structure, property triangle that is the materials engineering paradigm, and to
better focus our undergraduate curriculum on the education of mechanical
engineers. The enhanced laboratory is also used in a statistics course.
