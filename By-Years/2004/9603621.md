Barbehenn 9603621 Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS),
such as free radicals. The consequences of ROS in herbivorous insects range from
no effect, in well-protected species, to reduced growth or death, in species
that are less well protected. The ingestion of prooxidant chemicals in plants
can greatly exacerbate the production of ROS. Research on the ways insects are
protected from ROS has focused on the role of antioxidative enzymes in the gut
tissues, rather than on mechanisms that may exist in the lumen of the gut. This
work is designed to determine the effectiveness of defenses that may exist in
the gut lumen, where ROS are first formed. The investigators will test a general
hypothesis that the detrimental effects of prooxidants on susceptible insects
are the results of ineffective defenses against ROS generated in the gut lumens,
whereas well-protected insects have effective defenses against ROS in their gut
lumens. The importance of this work lies, in part, in developing a better
understanding of the different antioxidative strategies of herbivorous insects
that enable them to feed on "toxic" plants.
