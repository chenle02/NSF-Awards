Robust and efficient high order accurate methods for computation have gained
more and more popularity in the numerical modeling of real world problems for
their ability to produce high fidelity simulations. However, such methods are
not available or not well understood for hydrodynamics equations modeling high
speed flows in spacecraft design, combustion, detonation, astrophysical jets,
hurricanes, tsunamis, plasma dynamics, and inertial confinement fusion. This
research project aims to develop improved numerical methods for simulation of
these systems. Progress in designing robust and more efficient high order
methods will significantly impact on simulation technology for such
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state of high order accurate numerical
methods is still far from being practically satisfactory for time-dependent
nonlinear problems. Compared to their low order counterparts, high order methods
are much harder to stabilize and might be less efficient in practice due to much
larger computer memory cost. Thus it remains challenging to utilize a high order
accurate method to solve nonlinear hydrodynamics equations in real world
problems. The objective of this proposal is to address these real-world problem
challenges from specific perspectives. First of all, one would like to ensure
the robustness of Eulerian schemes by preserving certain invariances of physical
quantities such as positivity. Second, one would like to design more efficient
implementations of very high order schemes on curved elements for complex
geometries.
