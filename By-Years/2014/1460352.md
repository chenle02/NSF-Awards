The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) award at the University of
Rochester will support twelve students per year for ten weeks of research in
fields including particle, nuclear, and cosmic ray physics, optics and quantum
optics, condensed matter physics, biological physics, plasma physics,
astrophysics and geophysics. The faculty research groups' combination of
enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of
their research. Individual guidance and mentoring foster each student's skill at
navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - as well as
his or her intellectual development as an independent
researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student works with a faculty adviser on a
specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group.
The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly
presentations by University faculty, participate in tours of University research
facilities and social outings and may also take part in the department's summer
outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which
each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written
abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly
encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for
additional support to present their results at national student and professional
conferences.
