There continues to be a gap between the special functional requirements known
to characterize engineering databases and the ability of currently popular
database theories and software technologies to service these requirements. This
problem is especially annoying to those designing so-called CAD/CAM databases
from information relating to the design and manufacture of products. A solution,
if effected, is expected to provide significant productivity gains in both
design and manufacturing. The problem stems largely from a lack of understanding
of how to manage not the data about the world being modelled, but the diversity
of possible representations of objects that are of interest in the CAD/CAM
domain. This research proposes to make progress on this issue by first adopting
a simplified conceptual schema for modelling the objects and relationships of an
extensible framework that will allow results obtained to be extended upward to a
richer model when satisfying results are obtained. This proposal presents a plan
to develop both the required theory and a software environment for working with
the same. The result will be the construction of a "first-pass" conceptual
modelling paradigm for the development of engineering databases.
