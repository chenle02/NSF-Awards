9525767 McKinley In this Research Planning Grant (RPG) the PI will develop new
approaches for combining compile time analysis, program transformation, and data
transformation to generate programs that achieve good cache memory performance.
During the planning period, the PI will explore and compare benefits of
techniques that improve locality within loop nests and techniques that improve
locality between loop nests in spite of large data sizes. A successful
completion will lead to a more ambitious research plan to investigate compile
time techniques to improve memory performance of scientific applications on
uniprocessors and shared memory multiprocessors. ***
