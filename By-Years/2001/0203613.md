The Research Vessel (R/V) Cape Hatteras is a general purpose Regional Class
vessel, owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke
University/University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium. Since its
construction and delievery in 1981, the vessel has operated from its homeport at
Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina. For the past 20
years, the vessel has supported a variety of oceanographic research funded by
the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, United States
Geological Survey, Naval Oceanographic Office, the Department of Energy, and the
State of North Carolina. Funds in this proposal were requested to upgrade and
enhance the capabilities of the R/V Cape Hatteras. Renovations and modifications
will enable scientists to utilize state of the art instrumentation and
equipment; to work on a safe and modern platform; and allow the ship to operate
for approximately another 10 years in the North Atlantic coastal region. This
mid-life refit would include the renovation and upgrading of all cabins, labs,
and interior spaces; relocation of the aft crane to the winch deck; the addition
of two science berths; the replacement of all helm and engine controls; the
replacement of most interior plumbing; and the replacement of all exterior and
interior coatings.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
