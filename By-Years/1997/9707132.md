9530693 Knox This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation
in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/Vs
MELVILLE, a 279 foot vessel, NEW HORIZON, a 170 foot vessel , and the SPROUL, a
125 foot vessel. The MELVILLE is owned by the Navy, while the NEW HORIZON and
the SPROUL are owned by the University. All the ships are operated by the
Institute in support of oceanographic research funded by a variety of Federal,
state and private organizations, although NSF is the primary user of all the
ships. Instrumentation requested includes both shared-use equipment for specific
ships and shared-use instrumentation that will be maintained by the central
Ocean Data Facility(ODF) and used aboard a variety of SIO and non-SIO ships. The
instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF- funded cruises aboard
the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL during 1996 and will enhance the scientific
capability of these vessels in the future. ***
