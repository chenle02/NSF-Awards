With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Tanko will examine the
mechanism of decay of several cyclopropyl ketyl anions. In particular, questions
that surround one potential mode of decomposition, i.e., a mechanism that
proceeds via rapid and irreversible cyclopropane ring opening, will be addressed
in this study. The potential use of these radical anion systems as "clocks" to
measure the rates of competing bimolecular processes will be explored. Finally,
potential applications of radical anions reactions to organic synthesis will be
studied. %%% Single electron transfer (SET) provides an important reaction
pathway in organic chemistry. The species that are produced via SET processes
are called "radical anions". Their intermediacy in such reactions can be
inferred by the appearance of rearranged products. Dr. Tanko has devised
methodology for studying radical anion intermediates and for utilizing these
intermediates as mechanistic probes to obtain detailed information about the
mechanisms of competing reactions. In addition to their inherent mechanistic
interest, radical anion reactions can be used to promote reactions that are
likely to be useful for synthesizing structural units of important natural
products.
