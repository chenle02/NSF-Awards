The goal of the project is to provide new theoretical insight regarding deep
extremal problems in complex analysis and potential theory. Particular emphasis
will be placed on the method of symmetrization and the method of quadratic
differentials, new versions of which were developed by the PI in his previous
works. The PI will test these innovative techniques, in combination with a rich
variety of existing tools, on some old challenging problems as well as on some
new interesting questions posed in recent publications. The three main themes of
the project are: (i) Developing covering theorems of Landau type and minimal
area problems for analytic functions; (ii) Obtaining new sharp estimates for
conformal invariants (such as capacities, harmonic measure, and hyperbolic
density) of planar configurations with possible applications to problems on the
boundary behavior of conformal mappings such as a well known Brennan's
conjecture; (iii) Searching for a method to establish symmetry of zeros or
critical points of extremal polynomials in some well known problems on complex
polynomials such as Sendov's conjecture and Smale's conjecture. The PI
anticipates that this study will involve the development of new approaches,
which in turn will enhance our understanding of the theory of extremal problems
in complex analysis and potential theory.

The proposed methodology is targeted towards developing innovative tools in
complex analysis which will have potential applications to other specific areas
in science and engineering on at least two fronts. First, results in the theory
of quadratic differentials impacts other branches of mathematics and has
applications in theoretical physics, in particular, String Theory. Second,
accurate estimates of functional characteristics of planar configurations, such
as half-plane capacity, torsional rigidity, and principal frequency, are
important in the theory of conformally invariant processes and in mathematical
physics. The PI is working with an expanding core group of engaged and maturing
graduate students. He expects the project, especially the problems about complex
polynomials, which although elementary to state are very deep, to provide
interesting research topics for them. Because Texas Tech University is
geographically situated in rural West Texas with its under-served and under-
represented populations, one of the opportunities for this project with its
engagement of graduate students will be to attract more diverse and better
qualified graduate students to careers in the mathematical sciences from the
surrounding populations and ease placing them in good positions upon graduation.
