Because of its geographic and oceanographic setting, the Gulf of California
records a mix of oceanwide and regional oceanographic and climatic signals. The
extremely high rates of sedimentation and frequent occurrence of annual laminae
(varves) make the Gulf an ideal location for carrying out high resolution
studies of paleoenvironmental change on the seasonal to millenial (and greater)
scale. Despite the long interest in Gulf varves, this will be the first project
to use sediment traps to directly determine the process of varve formation. The
results will lead to a better understanding of how the climatic/oceanographic
record is preserved, which will be used in the recover glacial as well as
interglacial sediments. Following hypotheses will be tested: 1) that varve
formation results from the seasonal input of wind-blown terrigenous material, 2)
that the seasonal timing of light and dark laminae formation differs between the
eastern and western sides of the Gulf, 3) that the deposition of nonlaminated
sediment during glacial and Younger Dryas time resulted from increased oxygen
and decreased nutrient content of intermediate depth waters in the Pacific
Ocean, and 4) that deglacial oscillations of Gulf 18-0 resulted from episodes of
lower salinity, perhaps caused by increased monsoonal circulation.
