This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The project is to deploy a field-proven Fe Boltzmann
temperature lidar to the U.S. Antarctic station McMurdo, and to conduct there
multi-year observations pursuing the following scientific objectives: (a) To
establish a temperature record throughout the polar atmosphere at 78Â°S to
monitor climate change, (b) To validate sophisticated atmospheric models that
are used to project the future state of our climate system, and (c) To
characterize the thermal structure, polar mesospheric clouds, heterogeneous
chemistry, large-scale dynamics, and gravity waves in the polar middle
atmosphere. The project's long-term goal is to operate the lidar at McMurdo
through complete 11-yrs solar activity cycle characterizing middle atmosphere
responses to the solar activity and its annual and inter-annual variations, and
extracting long-term secular trends to assess potential climate changes in the
middle atmosphere. These observations will provide crucial information on the
polar middle atmosphere in the critical latitudinal gap region mid-way between
the South Pole and Antarctic Circle, completing observations in combination with
previous measurements made at the South Pole and Rothera stations. Analysis of
the atmospheric gravity wave fields at McMurdo will be particularly useful in
advancing understanding of wave coupling and providing better constraints to
wave parameterizations by utilizing simultaneous lidar, MF radar, and satellite
measurements.
