Nehrir, M. Hashem&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to
explore modeling and control of multi-source wind/photovoltaic (PV)/fuel cell
distributed generation systems to evaluate and improve their performance. Proper
dynamic models of different generation devices (i.e., wind generator, PV arrays,
storage batteries and fuel cells) involved will be developed. Special attention
will be put on studying the electrical characteristics of proton exchange
membrane (PEM) fuel cells for applications such as electric motor starting, load
switching and/or rejection to explore their dynamic behavior and design
controllers to enhance their response and
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic model of different generation devices
will be integrated to form a multi-sourced distributed generation model whose
dynamic performance will also be explored. Based on this dynamic response, a
transient classifier will be designed to manage power flows from different
generation sources with the objective of increasing the overall system
efficiency and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic benefits of both
single-source and multi-source systems will also be
evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
