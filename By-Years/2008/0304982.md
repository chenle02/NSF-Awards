Abstract: Proposal 0304982

PI: Todd M. Kapitula, University of New Mexico

Title: Waves in Hamiltonian Systems with Applications in Nonlinear Optics and
BECs

The proposal concerns the applications of mathematics to two important areas of
physical sciences. The first is centered on the study of arrays of optical
fibers and associated links to inverse scattering for partial differential
equations. The second is in the area of Bose-Einstein condensates. Both major
thrusts are related by the mathematical tool of the so-called Evans function.
The Evans function provides a way to understand and use scattering theory to
solve certain partial differential equations.

The proposed work on optical fibers is positioned to have significant impact on
the national communications infrastructure and will support the drive to deliver
high speed, broad bandwidth access to homes and businesses.
