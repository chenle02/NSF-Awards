0320723 Kennett This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
California Santa Barbara provides funds for acquisition of an isotope ratio mass
spectrometer with a carbonate preparation system, to be used primarily for the
analysis of marine carbonates. The instrumentation will replace a heavily used,
aging mass spectrometer, and it will be installed in a recently refurbished
laboratory and managed as a recharge facility open to UCSB and outsider
researchers. The principal use will be for the study of paleoclimates and
paleoceanography, continuing and extending research on oxygen and carbon
isotopic variations in marine sediments as a tool to understand global
stratigraphy, biogeochemical cycles, land-sea reservoir changes, and CO2 and CH4
exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. The proposal includes plans for
expansion of research into new, interdisciplinary areas involving faculty in
earth sciences, anthropology and biology, and it is expected to have a major
impact on education of undergraduate and graduate students at UCSB. This
instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. ***
