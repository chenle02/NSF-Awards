All college and university science faculty, not just the "thin chalk line" of
science educators, should be prepared to make science more inclusive and
engaging; all science education faculty should maintain a strong science
background and a high level of research enthusiasm. The purpose of this two year
project is to facilitate reciprocal science success for college/ university
science faculty who have taught less than five years and science education
faculty who have taught five or more years, in order to improve preparation of
future teachers, especially for urban environments. In all, 24 participant pairs
will attend four day workshops, plan and implement collaboration for at least
one full semester at their home institution, and assisted by project staff,
conduct an outreach activity on their own campus. Participants will have on-site
urban science experiences at the elementary, secondary, and collegiate level and
instruction in strategies to engage minorities in active learning, the use of
AAAS science standards, and assessment techniques. Teams will construct rubrics
and performance assessments to evaluate their own home-based collaboration and
outreach projects with particular attention to ways that science education
faculty can become more connected to local science research activities to
improve science education for future teachers. Collaboratively, science and
science education faculty will design strategies to enhance the active
participation of minorities in science and teacher preparation on home campuses.
