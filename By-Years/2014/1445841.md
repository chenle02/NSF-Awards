The project, NSF ATE CREATE (California Regional Consortium for Engineering
Advances in Technological Education) Center Longitudinal Targeted Research
Study, will contribute to a growing understanding of the role of two-year
institutions in providing academic and career pathways for technicians in the
advanced technological fields associated with engineering technology, such as
information technology, manufacture technology, and renewable energy. Through
the development and use of data mining and data analytic tools and procedures,
the research team will investigate student educational and economic achievement
over a twelve-year period of time. Building on partnerships among academic
institutions, state-level agencies and industry, the project will develop and
serve as a model for longitudinal data mining and analysis of institutional data
that can be replicated at two-year institutions. The project will investigate
patterns of course-taking, specifically CREATE courses and course materials, to
discover relationships between patterns of course taking and student academic
success (e.g., retention, certificate and degree attainment) and success in the
STEM workforce (e.g., wage increases and wage levels).

This exploratory descriptive empirical investigation will document, identify,
and match a list of courses from 2002 to 2014 to the state-level K-16 system of
student data and employment development department labor market information to
discover student academic and career pathways. To investigate the contribution
of course taking to student academic and career success, the project will
conduct a series of descriptive and regression analyses to identify
relationships between patterns of course taking and expected outcomes (e.g.,
retention, certificate and degree attainment and wage increases an wage levels).
