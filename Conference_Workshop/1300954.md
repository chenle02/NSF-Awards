This NSF grant will be used to organize the conference "Algebraic Geometry and
Hyperbolic Geometry - New Connections", which will take place June 16 - June 22,
2013 in Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The goal of the conference is to
bring together researchers in algebraic and hyperbolic geometry in order to
explore new connections between the two fields, the latter include:
2-dimensional Cremona group, fundamental groups of Kaehler manifolds, minimal
model program, geometrization and geometry of complex ball quotients.

This conference will bring together researchers working in two branches of
geometry: Algebraic geometry, which deals with geometry of solution sets of
algebraic equations and hyperbolic geometry, which deals with concepts like
distances, angles and areas. The goal of the conference is to explore new
mutually beneficial connections between the two areas of mathematics. This
project will benefit the graduate students and young researchers. It will also
promote interaction between the US and Latin American geometers.
