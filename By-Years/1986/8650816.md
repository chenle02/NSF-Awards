The recent establishment of an Instrumentation and Analysis Laboratory at
Northern Michigan University is providing science and applied mathematics
students with instruction and laboratory experience in instrumental techniques
and procedures, including data acquisition and analysis through interfacing with
six microcomputer stations. These improvements are being implemented through a
newly designed interdisciplinary course in Instrumentation and Analysis, and
through expanded experimental work in advanced laboratory projects.
