&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
installation of a laser-based combustion diagnostic system including a Nd:YAG
pulsed laser, a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser, a spectrometer, and an image
intensified camera in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
(MAE) at Princeton University. This equipment will be used to support
fundamental research on microscale combustion, microwave-enhanced combustion,
non-equilibrium plasma-assisted combustion, and high-pressure combustion, and to
augment the educational curriculum. Primarily, the equipment supports research
to investigate unique phenomena in microscale combustion due to wall-flame
interactions and non-continuum mass transport, microwave-flame interactions in
microwave- enhanced combustion, and electron-impact dissociation in non-
equilibrium plasma-discharged flames, as well as flame dynamics at high
pressures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment and the new diagnostic approaches
developed will be integrated into both the graduate and undergraduate laboratory
courses to enhance student training. Filtered Rayleigh scattering and two-line
LIF, developed by use of this equipment, will be demonstrated to both
undergraduate and graduate laboratory classes to familiarize students with the
state of the art capabilities in combustion diagnostics. The participation of
the undergraduates in the research laboratories will provide a unique
opportunity for the students. The equipment will also be integrated into the
summer "hands-on science" program for minority high school students from Trenton
High School. In addition, the equipment will be used in on-campus collaboration
with Princeton Energy Center and inter-university collaboration with the Plasma
Research Center in Drexel University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
