This action is to help defray the costs of American scientists who are
attending an international meeting. The meeting is the 13th Interamerican
Congress which will bring together North American and South American behavioral
and social scientists for the purpose of interacting in meaningful scientific
dialogue. The meeting makes opportunities for these scientists to share their
research experiences as well as a chance to initiate collaborations among and
between scientists of diverse nations.
