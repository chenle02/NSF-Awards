9314895 Evans A one-week workshop will be held in July 1993 on the campus of the
University of Minnesota for the purpose of helping untenured young faculty
members to develop successful research relationships with industry, as well as
developing productive academic research programs. The workshop will attempt to
share the technological management of the University of Minnesota ERC on
Interfacial Engineering with young faculty from other Universities across the
country and will help them develop industrial as well as academic research
collaborations. Mentors from the University of Minnesota will be selected from
faculty of a variety of departments: Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and
Materials Science, Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering,
and Orthopedic Surgery. There will continue to be mentor and participant
interactions for one year following the workshop in order to assure that
strategies for academic-industry interactions are effectively pursued. An
evaluation procedure for improving implementation of the program is part of the
overall program. Two mentors will be drawn from other universities. ***
