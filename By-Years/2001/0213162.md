The class of microbes known as the macronuclear ciliates are instrumental in
telomere research because its members have macronuclei that contain hundreds of
thousands of linear gene-sized "mini-chromosomes" that have telomeres at both
their ends. Electron microscopy of macronuclear chromatin has shown that these
chromosomes are organized into rosette structures in which the telomere ends are
anchored in a central core structure while the DNA of the macronuclear
chromosomes form large loops. The X-ray crystal structures of two different
macronuclear telomere complexes from Oxytricha nova show that its two-subunit
telomere end binding protein (OnTEBP) can form two distinct macromolecular
assemblies with telomeric single-stranded DNA. One is a protective a:b:ssDNA
end-capping complex involving both the a and b subunits of the protein and the
other is a dimeric (a:ssDNA)2 complex that can link telomeres together. These
structures have led to a model of how the two OnTEBP complexes can mediate the
condensation and decondensation of macronuclear chromatin through the formation
of telomere anchored rosette structures. This project examines the role of the
(a:ssDNA)2 dimer in the formation of higher-order telomere complexes. The
experiments will use a multi-disciplinary approach to measure the kinetics and
thermodynamics of DNA binding to OnTEBP complexes, elucidate the structural
basis for the DNA dependent dimerization of the OnTEBP a subunit, and determine
the role of (a:ssDNA)2 dimers in the formation of the a:b:ssDNA end capping
complex. The results will increase our understanding of the structure and
dynamics of macromolecular complexes at telomeres. Telomeres are the protein-DNA
complexes that protect the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes from
recombination and degradation. Telomeres are required for proper cell growth and
viability. This research project focuses on the protein-DNA and protein-protein
interactions found at telomeres and the manner in which larger complexes formed
via telomere-telomere interactions are assembled. The results will provide
insights into how the genetic integrity of chromosomes is maintained in cells.
