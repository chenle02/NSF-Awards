The PIs are organizing the 4th Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on
Telomeres and Telomerase. The telomere field is a highly diverse and dynamic
area, representing a wide variety of research interests (cancer, aging, cell
cycle, meiosis, recombination, replication, etc.), as well as a large number of
different organisms (mammals, fungi, protozoa, plants). This meeting provides
opportunities for members of this diverse community to present and discuss
recent research results. The previous three Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
meetings on Telomeres and Telomerase, brought together this diverse group of
researchers and resulted in vigorous discussion and synergistic interactions
stimulated by the presentation of a very large body of unpublished data.
Previous conferences have provided a good balance of students, post-doctoral
fellows, junior and senior researchers, with an informal atmosphere that
contributes greatly to interactions between younger and older scientists. All
speakers are chosen from submitted abstracts, which maximizes the opportunity
for new researchers and young investigators to present their most recent
unpublished work. Poster sessions and plenary talks provide additional outlets
for presentation of new findings.

To further encourage the participation of junior scientists, the organizers are
requesting funding to help defray the costs of travel, room and board, and
registration for junior scientists. Special consideration will be given to
graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty, women and minority
scientists. Funds will be awarded to participants based on need and submitted
abstracts.
