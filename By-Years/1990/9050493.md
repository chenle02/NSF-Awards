The aim of this project is to improve fundamental science instruction in the
area of cell and molecular biology by acquiring state-of-the-art instrumentation
and expanding the scope of laboratory exercises in several courses. The major
instruments being acquired include laminar flow hoods, and HPLC system,
electrophoretic equipment, and scintillation counter, a water
purification/deionization system and environmental chambers. The equipment
allows examination of cellular phenomena in greater depth in the course
laboratory exercises and fosters enhancement of student research projects to
yield data that may be presented at meetings or published. The project provides
a greatly improved learning experience for the students who are preparing for
graduate school, professional school, or the workforce. By using state-of- the
art equipment, they are better prepared to interact with today's technology. The
university is contributing an amount equal to the award.
