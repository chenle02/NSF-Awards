0113801&lt;br/&gt;Affatigato&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 36 month U.S.- China
cooperative project between Dr. Mario Affatigato of Coe College and Professor
Wencheng Wang, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, to study the structural origin
of photosensitivity in lead glasses, and to provide an REU training opportunity
for four U.S. undergraduate students. This research is designed to uncover the
structural origin of photosensitivity in glass. This collaboration makes use of
Coe College's expertise in glass synthesis and structure characterization, and
Fudan University's work on optical properties. The expertise between the two
campuses is mutually beneficial. The most impressive part of this project is the
educational benefit that the U.S. students can derive from this collaboration.
These exchanges will enrich the research experience of the students at Coe
College, which is an undergraduate teaching college. This project provides the
students a significant research experience in their undergraduate education. The
proposal will be jointly supported by the National Science Foundation of China
and the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
