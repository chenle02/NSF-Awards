Under the U.S.-Japan Large Scale Testing program, phase II - steel structures a
coordinated research program involving full-scale, small scale, component and
subassemblage tests and linear and nonlinear analytical modelling is nearly
completed. Correlation studies are now underway. This project will evaluate
these results and determine their implications for earthquake resistant design
utilization and for improved efficiency in future experimental/analytical
research programs. Two reports, one for the designers and the other for the
researchers, will summarize these implications for broad implementation. This
project will wrap up the U.S.-Japan Large Scale Testing program implemented by
NSF and the Ministry of Construction of Japan.
