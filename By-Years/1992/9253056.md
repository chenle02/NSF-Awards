This project, sponsored by the Fermi National Acceleration Laboratory, will
institute a conference for outstanding Illinois educators to carry out a state
needs assessment and a goals development study for a teacher enhancement program
for the State of Illinois. The conference membership consists of 60 outstanding
teachers, former NSF Principal Investigators from the state of Illinois and five
people representing the Illinois State Board of Education. The expected outcome
of the conference is a suggested outline of a Teacher Enhancement Proposal which
will be prepared by the conference task force. The NSF funds are being matched
by funds from the Illinois State Board of Education in an amount equivalent to
34% of the NSF grant.
