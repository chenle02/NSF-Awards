The unsteady flow which occurs in the passages of high temperature
turbomachinery strongly influences the heat transfer between the fluid and the
walls of the passages. In modern rotating machinery, the unsteadiness arises
largely through the relative motion of the alternating rows of stationary and
rotating annular blades. The instrumentation requested to study the heat
transfer process includes a short duration combustion system, fast response heat
flux sensor accessories, and a high speed data acquisition system and
microcomputer. Research into turbulence modelling, three-dimensional boundary
layers, wakes and jets, high speed flows, and inviscid aerodynamics are other
topics to which the equipment package could be applied. Recent experiments have
demonstrated that flow unsteadiness can affect the aerodynamic and heat transfer
performance of turbine blades. There is a need to develop theoretical models for
this flow. By identifying the mechanisms through which the unsteadiness affects
the blade heat transfer, properly designed experiments can play a vital role in
the development of analytical tools.
