This project will continue to support the development of a "Hierarchic Database
Management System and Networking for Systematic Biology." In particular new data
models and query methods are being developed that employ the concept of "taxon
views", which can carry more historical taxonomic information about a particular
taxon and related taxa than is possible with regular taxon names. In addition,
the project will involve development and testing of tools for greater access of
these database tools by the systematics community.
