The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to use a
more efficient powertrain system to extend the current flight durations of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by 3 to 4 times the currently technological
capabilities. UAVs with this capability will be able to accomplish a much wider
range of missions than current systems. These missions could include, but are
not limited to, search and rescue, large scale industry inspection (pipelines),
land survey, and high-quality photography. This powertrain also has potential
applications in small scale power generation out in the field for portable
electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a UAV
powertrain system using a gasoline two-stroke engine with a coupled
starter/generator able to produce power for flight and other onboard components.
The system itself is an optimization of many components and new technologies to
produce power more efficiently than anything else currently available. Research
on this system has included using a state of the art test stand to optimize
engine performance and development of technologies that allow a coupled
starter/generator system capable of producing varied output of power independent
of input shaft work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
