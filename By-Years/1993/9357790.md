Photorealistic image synthesis is an important problem for such diverse fields
as architecture, lighting and industrial design, remote sensing from satellites
and robots, scientific visualization, simulation systems, and entertainment and
advertising. It also requires enormous computation. Carefully chosen
approximations are therefore essential for making the computation efficient.
Unfortunately, few such approximations admit good error metrics, which makes
controlling image fidelity difficult at best. In many applications this accuracy
is vital. This research develops a controlled-precision rendering approach for
general systems of light transport both to provide reliable bounds on accuracy,
and also to allow an algorithm to concentrate its effort where the error
reduction is largest. In addition to photorealistic image synthesis, research
begins in non-photorealistic rendering, an area with great commercial potential
that has received relatively little attention to date. Mechanisms are developed
to support the generation of effective illustrations from three-dimensional
continuous-tone images. Specific research goals include creating a taxonomy of
traditional illustration techniques; developing new modeling paradigms, imaging
models, and user-interaction methods for specifying and computing illustrations;
establishing methods for simplifying geometric models from models with a higher
level of detail; and developing techniques for simulating traditional artist
tools, such as pencil, chalk, air brush, and watercolor.
