Abstract Baik

The eigenvalues of large random matrices are known to describe the limiting
behaviors of various objects in mathematics, statistics and physics such as
random permutations, zeros of Riemann-zeta function, sample covariance matrices,
non-intersecting paths and random growth models. The investigator plans to study
various intrinsic properties the limiting distribution functions arising in
random matrix theory, as well as to apply the ideas and methods of random matrix
theory to probability models such as last passage percolation, queueing models,
non-intersecting paths and interacting particle systems. Built on the
investigator's and other researchers' earlier work, the long term goal is to
clarify the universality class of models which are describable in terms of the
eigenvalues of random matrices using ideas from both integrable systems and
probability.
