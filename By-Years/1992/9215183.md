Corals are notoriously sensitive to elevated temperatures and this sensitivity
has come to frame debates regarding the responsiveness of reef systems to global
climate change. This project will explore aspects of the dynamics of the coral
vascular system, an inter-connecting system of polyps and stolons or
oscillators. Buss hypothesizes that coral bleaching, and ultimately mortality,
results from the chaotic change in the size of the vascular system. To explore
this possibility, Buss plans to alter the velocity of gastrovascular flow
through stolons experimentally and to monitor radial diameter of stolons using
sophisticated video and image analysis. Then, to visualize the chaotic behavior
of the vascular system, a spatial grid of coupled oscillators will be developed.
The model should predict the behavior dynamics of corals based on perturbation
studies of living material and lead to a better understanding why corals adopt
specific structural forms.
