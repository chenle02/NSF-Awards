The project addresses questions concerning the distribution
of&lt;br/&gt;rational and integral points on higher dimensional algebraic
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;The main problem is to relate the Zariski density and the
asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;distribution of points to global geometric
invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the oldest branches of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Today it is marked by profound connections to
geometry&lt;br/&gt;and analysis. It has a wide range of applications
to&lt;br/&gt;data transmission, storage and cryptography. For
example,&lt;br/&gt;many algorithms are based on arithmetic properties of
elliptic curves.&lt;br/&gt;This research explores the higher dimensional case of
surfaces&lt;br/&gt;and threefolds.&lt;br/&gt;
