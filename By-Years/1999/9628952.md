Many estuarine or intertidal fishes are exposed to fluctuating salinities,
while other fishes migrate between freshwater and marine sites. These animals'
solute balance might change drastically, but they maintain concentrations of
their body fluids in a relatively narrow range with a suite of behavioral,
systems-level, cellular, and biochemical adaptations to offset the passive
fluxes of water and ions. Because the gill is responsible for the majority of
gas exchange, elimination of nitrogenous waste, acid-base balance, and
osmoregulation in virtually all teleost fishes, it represents a key interface
between animal and environment. Relatively little attention has focused on
chemical and physical properties of the plasma membranes of the gill that make
up this interface. Dr. Crockett will test the hypothesis that lipid compositions
of apical plasma-membrane domains from the gill are significantly different in
freshwater- and seawater-acclimated fishes. Lipid changes are likely to occur in
order to (1) ensure membrane integrity and permeability properties, (2) reduce
changes in surface-charge density, (3) maintain such membrane physical
properties as order and phase state, and (4) provide a micro-environment that
permits sufficient activity of membrane-associated proteins. During the 18-month
planning period, Dr. Crockett will characterize restructuring of the lipid
components in gill plasma-membrane domains from fishes during adaptation to
varying environmental salinities. This work will establish which lipid class(es)
(phospholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol) is (are) involved in salinity
adaptation. Results will (1) establish a protocol to prepare simultaneously gill
apical and basolateral domains and (2) provide the first look at gill plasma-
membrane restructuring during salinity adaptation in fishes.
