Gene expression is governed by a number of regulatory sites and mechanisms, many
of which are still unknown or poorly studied. Regulatory sites are more
difficult to predict and study than genes, because they are short, variable, and
change faster than coding regions during evolution. A comparative analysis of
short regulatory sites, including prokaryotic cis-regulatory sites, will be
performed using the genomic DNA sequences from a wide range of species. The
project will develop new methods for predicting sites based on inherent
statistical properties of sequence data and on conservation of sequence across
species, using the sequences of closely related species to improve prediction.
These methods will be applied to multiple bacterial, plant, and animal genomes
and the results made available via a website as well as available to the
community in the form of the new software and databases. The research will
provide insights into comparative characteristic of regulatory sites in
different genomes and can also be used to improve gene prediction software.
