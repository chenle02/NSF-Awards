The objective of this project is to identify and characterize organisms that
can dehalogenate organic substances that are present in soil, water and
wastewater. Research involves determination of the metabolic pathways by which
organisms accomplish dehalogenation, reaction rates and metabolic end products.
The investigators plan to isolate the enzyme(s) responsible for dehalogenation
and establish the chemical mechanisms by which they accomplish this. The
engineering goals to which this project is responsive relates to the development
of processes and methods for removing alkyl halide pollutants from locations
where they constitute a threat to water, land and soil quality. Concepts toward
which this research is directed may constitute the basis for engineering design
of systems to decontaminate environmental resources.
