Continued funding is provided for a fellowship program entitled "On-Site
Research to Advance Industrial Quality and Productivity." Jointly sponsored by
the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), the program will be administered by the American Statistical
Association while NIST acts as the host agency. This program is designed to
bridge gaps between quality assurance efforts in industry, academia and
government through the formation of research teams of industrial, academic, and
NIST statisticians and engineers. Possible areas of research for Fellows ar
statistical design of industrial experiments, process control, studies of
advanced manufacturing systems, computing for engineering and industrial
statistics, and calibration of manufacturing process control. Continued funding
is provided for a fellowship program, designed to have academic statisticians
and engineers studying industrial problems, especially in the area of quality
assurance.
