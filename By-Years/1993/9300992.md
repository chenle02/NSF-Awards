ABSTRACT: 9300992, PI-Pereyra: This Phase II SBIR proposal aims to model, design
algorithms, and produce software to analyze and interpret seismic data. Enhanced
global optimization techniques will be used to filter noisy data and to handle
complex geophysical models that are not accessible to computation with the
present methods. This project builds upon the results of the work accomplished
in Phase I on the construction of global optimization algorithms. The resulting
codes and software will find applications in seismic processing, reservoir
delineation, and will help with enhanced recovery processes in the oil fields.
Applications are also envisioned to non destructive testing of mechanical
components in industrial tools.
