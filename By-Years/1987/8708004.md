The magnetic mineralogy of fine-grained FeTi oxides, 1 um in size and smaller,
in glassy and devitrified rhyolitic rocks and the geologic origin of these
microcrystals are problems whose solution substantively influences any
interpretation of paleomagnetic data of these rocks. These data, from ashflow
tuffs, are routinely applied to structural-tectonic, strati- graphic, and
paleopole studies. The PI will conduct a detailed magnetic, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and Mossbauer spectroscopic study of ash-flow tuff
units from Yucca Mountain, Nevada, in conjunction with a study of
compositionally similar rhyolitic obsidian and phroclastic flows from N.
California and Oregon, to address this problem. TEM and Mossbauer methods will
distinguish amongst hematite, magnetite and maghemite. A tentative model for the
geologic origin of fine-grained NRM carriers, which attributes primary remanence
to Fe-Ti oxides that precipitated at elevated temperature in quenched glass, and
phenocryst phases will be tested.
