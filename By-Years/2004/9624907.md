CTS - 9624907 Russell Stewart University of Utah ABSTRACT The project is on the
fabrication of a microanalytical separation device incorporating the
microtubular motor protein (kinesin) into nano-fabricated machines. A prototype
active chromatography device will be built to recognize, separate and detect
specific DNA fragments on a single micromachined chip. A fluorescent-labeled DNA
fragment in solution will attach selectively to the motor protein and move along
aligned microtubules in a microchannel to a detector. The potential impact of
the project is strong in bioseparations and chemical process monitoring. If
successful, it may be possible to mimic intracellular transport in fabricated
machines. The educational plan includes development of a new lecture and two
laboratory courses on protein engineering and microfabrication. Students will be
trained to apply biological principles to conventional engineering problems.
