The goal of the proposed project is to design efficient algorithms applicable to
security and computational issues that are core concerns of statistical agencies
and database vendors. Results obtained from the project will be implemented to
test theoretical models as well as to advance technology transfers. Building on
the PI's completed work on statistical data security, a number of specific
research directions are pursued to further determine the computational
complexity of detecting and protecting sensitive information in highly useful
types of statistical data bases. These directions involve techniques from a
variety of algorithms areas including combinatorial optimization, dynamic
algorithms, graph algorithms, linear algebraic algorithms, and online
competitive analysis. It is expected that algorithmic insights and techniques
obtained from this project will be useful in various application areas in
addition to statistical data security, such as relational databases and secret
sharing schemes.
