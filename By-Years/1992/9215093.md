In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Brent Koplitz of Tulane University will investigate site-specific
hydrogen-atom production in alkanes, haloalkanes, and organometallic compounds
photolyzed under collisionless conditions. The photochemistry of alkyl radicals
produced by excimer laser photolysis will be followed using time-of-flight mass
spectrometric detection of the Doppler profiles of the hydrogen (deuterium)
atoms via their VUV transitions. Ab initio calculations will also be performed
to gain additional insight into the photochemistry of the radicals. %%% An
understanding of site-specific haloalkane/radical photochemistry is of
environmental importance in addition to its role in understanding fundamental
photochemical processes in general. The studies supported in this project should
impact the understanding of HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) breakdown in the
atmosphere as well as helping to clarify issues involved in the fabrication of
semiconductors.
