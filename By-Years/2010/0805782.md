&lt;br/&gt; "Analytic Geometry and Representation Theory" by J.M. Landsberg
&amp; C.&lt;br/&gt; Robles. This project will make significant progress on
problems originating in geometry and theoretical computer science. Each of the
questions will be approached using techniques that lie on the interface of 3
areas of mathematics: differential geometry (submanifolds, exterior differential
systems), algebraic geometry (projective varieties, geometric aspects of
commutative&lt;br/&gt; algebra) and representation theory (orbit closures, Lie
algebra cohomology, invariant theory). We emphasize that this synthesis yields a
cross-pollination that significantly increases the richness, value an influence
of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Landsberg and Robles will
continue work related to (1) the Hwang-Mok program on Fano varieties in
algebraic geometry, (2) the P = NP? problem in complexity theory, and (3) the
geometric structure of orbits in representation theory. These seemingly
disparate projects are unified by the Principle Investigators' approach. In each
case there is an underlying differential geometry of lines on (and osculating
to) a projective variety.&lt;br/&gt; A through understanding of this geometry
will deepen our understanding of (and in some cases solve) these problems. This
geometry is studied via techniques drawn from differential geometry, algebraic
geometry and representation theory. While the geometric and representation
theoretic tools used are classical, the implementation and resulting
applications are innovative and originated with the principal investigators.
Additional projects include: (1) A study of varieties in spaces of tensors. This
work draws on geometry and representation theory, and will have applications to
statistics, computer science and complexity theory. (2) Calibrated geometries.
Not only an active area of research in mathematics, these geometries are of
interest to physicists as components of string theory models. (3) The
construction of compact G2-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;
