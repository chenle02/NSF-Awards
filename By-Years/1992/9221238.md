This project will continue experimental studies of granivory in the Chihuahuan
Desert near Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots, each
0.25 ha in area. Investigators have maintained the removal of some or all
species of rodents and/or ants from 10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an
additional 14 plots since 1988. Standardized censuses of rodents, ants, and
plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals, populations, and
communities both to experimental perturbations and to natural temporal and
spatial variation in the environment. Results to date demonstrate: 1) long-term
fluctuations in rodent and plant populations in response to precipitation in El
Nino years; 2) surprisingly constant competition among rodent species; 3) direct
effects of seed predation by rodents and ants on annual plant populations; 4)
indirect effects of rodents on ants, birds, and plants, and of ants on birds and
plants; and 5) wholesale changes in vegetation in response to exclusion of
kangaroo rats. The research plan for the next five years includes: 1)
continuation of experimental manipulations and standardized censuses of rodents,
ants, and plants; 2) analysis of long-term population dynamics; 3) investigation
of the relationships between direct and indirect biotic interactions; and 4)
comparison of responses to manipulations initiated in 1977 and 1988.
