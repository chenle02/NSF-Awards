The purpose of this research is to analyze the emergence, operation, and
evolution of non-market institutions which arose in Genoa and England during the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Two types of transactions central to trade and
trade efficiency will be analyzed. The first transaction to be examined is the
provision of the services required in handling goods abroad, while the second
transaction is the organization of the provisions governing exchange of goods
abroad (e.g., credit arrangements). Neither transaction could be organized
through the anonymous market nor supervised by the legal system in these two
historical episodes. An extensive documentary search will be conducted in order
to identify the nature of the institutions that governed these transactions. To
facilitate the empirical research, asymmetric information models of the
organizational problems associated with these transactions will be constructed.
This research is important because the study departs from a long tradition in
economic history that emphasized the contribution of the market mechanism to
European growth. Thus, this research may shed important new light on the
European development process which will enhance our understanding of the
transition from less developed to more developed economies in general.
