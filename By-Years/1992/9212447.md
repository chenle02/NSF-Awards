The Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University will purchase
high repetition rate laser pulse amplifier equipment under this Engineering
Research Equipment Grant which will be dedicated to support research in
engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: (1) A study of ultrafast electronic processes and carrier
relaxation in low dimensional semiconductor structures with the goal of applying
the new knowledge gained from this work to understand the advantages and
limitations of present optoelectronic devices and to develop new ones, (2) An
investigation on a femtosecond time scale of the optical response of the
recently proposed piezoelectric strained-layer superlattices in order to
understand their operation and assess their usefulness as optoelectronic
devices, and (3) Research on the generation of ultrafast electrical pulses and
the response of low dimensional electrons to them.
