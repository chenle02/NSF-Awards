This award will fund a numerical study of circumbinary planets (those which
orbit two stars instead of one) in order to provide a strong dynamical framework
for understanding planet formation and interpreting data from ongoing and
upcoming exoplanet surveys. Roughly half the stars in the Galaxy are in
binaries, and understanding how the planetary masses and orbits are different in
these systems is essential to both a full theory of planetary formation and
undestanding sites of habitability. The PI and her team will train and mentor
graduate and undergraduate students in research with a focus on computational
astrophysics. She will also provide educational resources to the University of
Arizona Astronomy camp program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will
study dynamical packing in multi-planet systems for a range of binary
configurations, and will also carry out hydrodynamic simulations investigating
planet-disk interaction in circumbinary systems. They will develop tools to
evaluate the role of multi-body resonances in setting stability timescales,
implement new thermodynamic modules in FARGO, and predict transit signals that
can be used to characterize circumbinary transit timing variations (TTVs). They
will use the model transit signals to predict the kinds of planetary systems
which will be observable by future surveys.
