Because the cooling times for white dwarfs are very long, the oldest stars in
the galaxy have not yet faded below detection limits. Thus, the white dwarf
luminosity function should show a sudden drop-off below the luminosity they
could have reached in the age of the population from which they evolved. This
fact can be used to determine that age. Unfortunately, the stars in question are
faint and the numbers found in the galactic disk are too small to provide a good
statistical sample. Few, if any, are known in the halo. A CCD camera on the
McDonald Observatory 30 inch telescope in Texas will be employed to search for
cool, faint white dwarfs in both the disk population and the halo. This will
increase greatly the sample of such stars known and will make them much more
useful for studying the star formation history and age of the populations they
represent.
