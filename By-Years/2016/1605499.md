PI: Martinez, Andres&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1605499&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the proposed research is to study fluid flow through the capillaries in
microPADS (a special type of paper that can be used for analytic purposes in
bio-related diagnostics in areas where complex hardware is not available.) A
model for the process is proposed to be developed in collaboration with
researchers at Princeton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
focuses on the experimental study and modeling of evaporation-driven capillary
flow (ECF) through paper-based microfluidic devices (microPADs) in order to use
this type of fluid transport for the development of paper-based diagnostic
devices capable of performing automated multi-step assays. The proposed work
will result in an investigation of ECF in microPADs with infinite and finite
fluid reservoirs; an investigation of the effects of the design of the microPAD
on ECF; the development of mathematical models to describe ECF in microPADs, and
the application of these models toward the design and development of prototype
microPADs for conducting automated multi-step diagnostic assays, including an
enzyme inhibition assay and an immuno-chromatographic assay with signal
amplification. All the experimental work will be conducted by undergraduate
student using relatively simple materials and fabrication methods. The proposed
work will also serve to advance the general understanding of ECF, with
implications for other systems such as plants and plasticbased microfluidic
devices. The work with prototype diagnostic devices will elucidate mechanisms
for developing more sophisticated point-of-care diagnostic assays that are still
very simple to use. Finally, the project will enable the development of new
assays that require at least two, timed, sequential steps, and that were
previously not possible due to limitations with the current capabilities of
microPADs.
