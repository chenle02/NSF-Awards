The existing computer programs for simulation of the motion of multi-body
mechanical systems generally require excessive execution time for realistic
systems and this renders them not suitable or inconvenient for use in design
phase. Additionally, these programs do not have good provisions for common drive
subsystems which often involve planar linkages or geared mechanisms. A dynamic
formulation methodology based on the recognition that a large number of
mechanical system can be modeled as consisting of an open loop chain or tree of
bodies, which are the primary links of the system, and their drive subsystems,
which together with the primary links always form local closed kinematic loops.
The proposed research is to develop such a methodology that calls for the
identification of independent generalized coordinates for the local closed loop
through graph representation concept and kinematic analysis, the use of
efficient recursive formalism for the primary chain or tree and the derivation
of additional contributions from the local closed loops. It is anticipated that
a user-friendly and computationally efficient program can evolve from this
research and can be made commercially available to the public. The resulted
program can enable mechanical system designers to perform effective simulation
in the various design phases to reduce the design turn-around time and the
design costs, and to improve the quality of design.
