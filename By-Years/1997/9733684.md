This CAREER project emphasizes the use of multibody dynamic modeling as a tool
for designing complex dynamic systems via low-order dynamic simulation
algorithms, parallel computing, and an efficient combination of heuristic
genetic and optimization algorithms. The methodology developed through this
research would automatically generate equations of motion and associated
simulation code for a specified complex multibody system, and determine from
these equations the system design parameters that are considered optimal with
respect to some user prescribed design objective. The education plan includes
computer-aided mathematical modeling and analysis oriented course developed, and
their application in undergraduate design projects such as SAE sponsored
electric car race and mini Baja competition. In addition, graduate courses are
planned with multibody dynamics software used as a dynamic analysis and design
tool. Outreach activities include establishing a formal student exchange program
with Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; and strengthening pre-
college level programs in engineering and technology currently in existence at
RPI.
