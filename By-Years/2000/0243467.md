This 48-month project is a collaboration between AMNH and Lehman and Brooklyn
Colleges of the City University of New York (CUNY). It fuses formal and informal
learning experiences to support a Master's program for Earth Science teachers.
Ninety Master's program teachers will be recruited and sustained. Thirty school
administrators will be engaged to support science instruction. Two Earth Science
courses for teachers will be designed and offered by Brooklyn and Lehman
Colleges. Two-week summer institutes at AMNH for teachers and administrators
will serve as the required complements to the two courses. The courses and
institutes will provide 120 hours of professional development as part of their
teacher education Master's program requirements.&lt;br/&gt;
