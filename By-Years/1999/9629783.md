Steroid hormones play key roles in the development of gender differences in
behavior, part of the process known as sexual differentiation. In many
vertebrates, one such hormone-mediated difference is that males often are more
aggressive than females. Features that rarely occur in combination, but are
found in Sceloporus lizards, make them an ideal model for the integrative study
of variation in hormonal mediation of aggression: They are a set of closely
related species that (1) vary reliably in male-female differences in levels of
aggression; (2) have unambiguous aggressive behaviors; (3) are amenable to
hormone manipulations both in the laboratory and under free-living conditions,
and to both perinatal and adult hormone manipulations, and (4) can be reared to
adulthood in the laboratory and will exhibit the full array of typical adult
behavior, including aggression. Dr. Hews will examine the neuroendocrine basis
of dramatic differences among three Sceloporus species in the morphological
color traits used in signaling territorial aggression and in the degree to which
males and females differ in levels of aggression. This Research Planning Grant
will enable Dr. Hews to (1) establish levels of aggression in free-living males
and females of the three study species, using a well-established testing
paradigm, (2) develop a laboratory paradigm for testing aggression in the three
species, (3) obtain breeding-season blood samples for radioimmunoassay to assess
plasma hormone levels (data needed for future experiments in which implants
manipulate hormone level in a physiological manner), and (4) determine the size
of a hormone implant needed to deliver a maximum physiological level.
