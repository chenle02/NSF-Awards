This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two important aims of comparative
biology are to identify characteristics that affect the rates at which new
species form or become extinct, and those that evolve more frequently in one
direction than another. This project investigates whether self-incompatibility,
the ability of some plants to selectively prevent fertilization by their own
pollen, affects the probability of formation or extinction of species. It
combines greenhouse and field studies with mathematical modeling to investigate
(a) the genetics underlying the complex mechanism of self-incompatibility in the
agriculturally important plant family Solanaceae, (b) the conditions under which
this mechanism is likely to be beneficial or detrimental within species, and (c)
develop methods to investigate the effects of self-incompatibility on rates of
formation and extinction of species from the study of groups that are
incompletely sampled, a common problem in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
plant family studied contains potato, tomato, eggplant, tobacco, and many other
cultivated and wild species selected to lose self- incompatibility.
Understanding the basis of evolutionary success or failure of self-fertilizing
plants will have implications for the development of seed banks, conservation
priorities, and invasive species management. Finally, the mathematical methods
developed will be applicable to studies of a wide variety of other traits and
organisms.
