This research is aimed at analyzing and developing iterative methods for solving
the nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in many areas of scientific
computing. Current iterative methods for solving such problems ar sometimes
effective but lack a firm theoretical foundation and may not be robust. Krylov
space methods, such as GMRES, will be analyzed and the idea of choosing
approximations from different spaces will also be considered. The biconjugate
gradient and QMR algorithms will be related and an attempt made to explain their
success. Potential for parallelism in various algorithms will be studied and
parallel implementations will be developed for specific machine architectures.
Collaborations are planned with Nick Trefethen and others in the Computer
Science Department at Cornell. Two main activities for interacting with students
are: teaching a graduate seminar ("CS 722") on iterative methods and matrix
analysis, to familiarize students and other interested scientists and the state
of the art in this field; and introducing a sophomore level practicum where, in
conjunction with the numerical analysis course CS 222, students will implement
parallel numerical algorithms on the machines available at the Cornell Theory
Center. Various undergraduate seminars will be organized related to this
activity.
