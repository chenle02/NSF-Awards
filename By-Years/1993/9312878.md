9312878 Mangel The retina is the tissue of the eye containing the
photoreceptors. In mammals these cells are of two basic types, rods and cones.
The rod cells are most sensitive in dim light, while the cone cells operate best
in bright light. When different light levels are maintained, the change in
visual responsivness is called adaptation. At another layer in the retina lie a
whole class of cells called horizontal cells, because they collect input over a
fairly wide area of photoreceptors. These horizontal cells provide input to the
nerve cells fof the optic nerve, called ganglion cells, which provide the output
of the retina to the brain for vision. This proposal will use physiological,
pharmacological and anatomical techniques to clarify the functional role of the
horizontal cells in the rod and cone pathways. Different levels of light
intentsity will be used to see how the rod and cone cells influence the
horizontal cell activity at different levels of light adaptation.
Pharmacological agents and electrophysiology will be used to determine the
functional connections between horizontal cells and ganglion cells at different
levels of light adaptation. These studies are important for understanding the
basic property of adaptation in visual function, and will have impact on
computational models of visual systems as well. ***
