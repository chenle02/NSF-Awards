The ongoing global COVID-19 outbreak highlights the need to prepare for
pandemics. Early detection, and, to the extent possible, prediction, are the
key. While it is crucial to get as much early warning as possible in advance of
the planetâ€™s next pandemic, the odds are overwhelmingly against the next global
outbreak being an exact repeat of the current COVID-19 crisis. Open source
intelligence (OSINT) is vital to the provision of pandemic early warning.
Diseases, especially infectious diseases, are socio-biological phenomena and
leave both social and microbiological footprints. This Predictive Intelligence
for Pandemic Prevention (PIPP) Phase I: Development Grants project will explore
the feasibility of developing an open-source intelligence system, informed by
biological, environmental, socio-economical, behavioral, and media data from
diverse sources, to monitor human society for signs of unusual activities that
reflect the emergence of novel pathogens with pandemic potential. This
multidisciplinary research will bridge biology, social sciences, epidemiology,
and computer science to address this grand challenge and start construction of a
semi-autonomous system to give an early warning of the next
pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIPP Phase I project will develop a prototype
of an end-to-end pandemic-early-warning system powered by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, data science, and open-source technologies,
which can simultaneously look for signs of an emerging infectious disease or a
known disease, predict its spread, and detect and monitor risk factors over
space and time. The system will embrace human intelligence as an integrated
component and will be transferable and extensible to support additional data
sources and machine learning models, making it suitable for detecting and
predicting outbreaks of a new disease regardless of its nature and scale. The
Phase I activities include four synergistic pilot projects highlighting
innovative approaches to addressing the grand challenges, as well as a detailed
plan to develop communities and capacity of a full
center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the cross-directorate
Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention Phase I (PIPP) program, which is
jointly funded by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Computer
Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences (SBE) and Engineering (ENG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
