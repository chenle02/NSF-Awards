Project Abstract SES 0342751 Patrick McCray, American Institute of Physics "For
the Record: A Workshop on Conducting Oral Histories of Science"

The purpose for this workshop is to familiarize graduate students-and others
who may be new to the technique of oral history-with the craft of conducting
oral histories so to understand better the history of recent science. At the
workshop, discussion will be aimed not just about the value that oral history
interviews may have for understanding modern scientific practice, but also to
work with participants so that they leave the workshop with hands-on skills for
preparing and conducting interviews in the history of science.

The aim of the workshop is to accommodate from 20-25 graduate students who will
be attending the History of Science Society meeting, scheduled to follow the
workshop by one day. The organizers of the workshop will be assisted by three or
four facilitators who have extensive experience in all aspects of doing oral
history interviews with scientists and science managers, and by two or three
invited scientists, administrators, and engineers, who will be asked to
participate as interview subjects.
