9703108 Useful software evolves: It is corrected, enhanced, and adapted to new
platforms. The cost of such software is dominated by the costs of testing and
maintenance; the long-term quality of such software is dependent on the
effectiveness of testing and maintenance. The overall goal of this project is to
improve the state of the art and the state of the practice in software testing
and maintenance. The research component of this work addresses regression
testing: the testing of modified software. This effort has two primary
objectives: (1) to develop efficient, effective, and practical techniques for
selectively retesting modified software; (2) to analytically and empirically
investigate factors in software and test design that affect the regression
testability of software, and develop techniques for measuring and improving
regression testability. The educational component of this work investigates a
maintenance-and-testing- first software engineering curriculum, in which
students experience the problems of maintaining and testing an existing software
system and specify and design enhancements to the system. The objectives of this
effort are: (1) to provide practical experience with testing and maintenance,
and (2) to encourage future software engineers to proactively evaluate the
impact of their actions on testability and maintainability. ***
