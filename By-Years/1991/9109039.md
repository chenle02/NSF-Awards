Grooming is a very common behavior of mammals, including African antelope. This
project is an integrated field and experimental approach to understanding the
interaction of utilitarian (tick removal) and social aspects of grooming of
impala. Impala are ideal subjects for this type of project. The animals are
common in eastern and southern Africa and can be watched for long periods of
time to accumulate quantitative data. Impala are also ideal subjects because
they display a type of highly reciprocal mutual grooming that is unique among
antelope and possibly among all mammals. The field studies comprise behavioral
observations, sampling of tick loads on the various age-sex groups of impala to
correlate with grooming rates, and assessment of ticks in the environment to
correlate with tick loads. Behavioral observations on mutual grooming will
examine the social influences on the grooming system, which may be one of the
few genuine animal examples of evolved cooperation. Systematic field studies are
needed to fully explore this unusual behavior. The part of the project dealing
with mutual grooming explores a complex system in an ungulate species where the
formation of social bonds and alliances is much simpler than in primates. This
multidisciplinary approach to understanding the role of self-grooming and mutual
grooming in the control of ectoparasites is expected to contribute information
critical to the management and conservation of wildlife in African environments
where domestic livestock farming is encroaching upon the habitat of the
wildlife.
