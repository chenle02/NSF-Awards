A high power laser will be used for several innovative research projects on
laser processing of materials. These include beam-splitting for enhanced
materials processing; laser-enhanced diffusion welding of high temperature
superconducting materials; acoustic emission monitoring of laser weld quality;
adaptive control and interpolators in laser processing operations; and laser
machining. The goal of the research is to develop innovative laser processing
techniques and to improve basic understanding of the interactions of lasers with
materials during processing. This may lead to improved productivity in the use
of lasers in industry.
