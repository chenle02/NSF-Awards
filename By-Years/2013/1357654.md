Current commercial instruments in the diagnostic field usually lack one or more
attributes in sample-to-answer systems, specifically: throughput, multiplexing,
sensitivity, fast time to answer, and low-cost. The proposed technology attempts
to develop a diagnostic platform that will address the key weaknesses in
currently available technologies. The proposed diagnostic platform is based on
an optical detection method termed Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor
(IRIS). IRIS has demonstrated single virus and single molecule (both protein &
nucleic acids) detection in whole blood and serum at clinically relevant levels.

The proposed technology provides a turn-key solution for multiplexed sample-to-
answer diagnostic tests. This automated technology can detect clinically
relevant virus directly without a secondary tag or marker. It is believed that
the proposed approach can be competitive with other systems (fundamentally
simpler, reducing the costs of the instrument and consumable, allowing for
competitively pricing the consumable and instrument). In addition to the pure
economics of the system, the proposed technology will help perform detection in
a small form-factor with minimal waste. Finally, the non-destructive sensing
techniques allow storage of samples for further testing if desired.
