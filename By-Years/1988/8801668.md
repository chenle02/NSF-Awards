This Phase II Small Business award is for continued research needed to develop
a highly accurate, miniature probe designed to inspect manufactured parts of
complex geometry. The non-contacting probe is based on laser technology and it
should permit rapid and accurate inspection of a wide class of workpieces with
features such as internal threads, shoulders, slots, and holes.
