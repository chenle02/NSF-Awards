The focus of this project is the analysis of limit laws for certain stochastic
growth models. The main growth model considered is the interacting particle
system called the asymmetric simple exclusion process. This model is a widely
studied model in probability theory and theoretical physics since it is one of
the simplest models of nonequilibrium behavior that exhibits nonclassical
fluctuations. In this project the asymmetric simple exclusion process will be
studied for a variety of different initial conditions. The methods use ideas
from Bethe Ansatz, Yang-Baxter equations as well as techniques from operator
theory and combinatorics. Generalizations of the model to more than one species
will also be part of the project. It is expected that these limit laws will have
a "universal" behavior; and will, in fact, describe the fluctuations in a much
larger class of growth models.

This project involves the study of current fluctuations in the asymmetric simple
exclusion process for a variety of initial configurations. This is a model of
interacting particles on a one-dimensional lattice. The model has attracted wide
attention from both mathematicians and physicists since it is one of the
simplest models to incorporate far from equilibrium behavior with nonclassical
fluctuations. These fluctuations are expected to have a new universal behavior
similar in their applicability to the famous bell-shaped curve (the Gaussian
distribution) of classical probability. A long-term goal of research in this
area is the establishment of new limit laws similar in nature to the classical
central limit theorem. Already these new universal distributions are being
applied to various problems in growth processes, population genetics, and
finance. This project will extend our knowledge of fluctuations to a much wider
class of growth models.
