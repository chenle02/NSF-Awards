This project will investigate the extent to which discursive practices are
structured by region-specific native gender and class categories. The
investigator, a linguistic anthropologist, will test three sets of hypotheses on
gender and discursive practices which have been developed within the
Durkheimian, rational-choice, and neo-Marxist theoretical frameworks. These
hypotheses will be tested in six communities in North and South Vietnam, which
offers a valuable test case because the socio- cultural differences between
North and South allow a controlled comparison. The methods will include
extensive formal interviewing and the extensive tape-recording and transcription
of speech interactions. This research is important because it will create a very
valuable data-set of naturally occurring speech from a developing country,
collected under controlled conditions. The knowledge gained about language
changes with respect to gender relations in a country undergoing rapid socio-
economic change will be valuable as a comparison with gender relations in the
developing world. The increased awareness of the theoretical importance of
subtle markers of inequality such as speech patterns that can result from this
research can help us understand how to deal with inequality.
