This study will document the prevalence, type and quality of recovery plans in
coastal counties throughout the southeastern U.S. and examine the effectiveness
of recovery plans in reducing vulnerability to disasters. Disasters disrupt
communities and people's lives. Socially vulnerable groups, including women,
racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, poor and persons living with
disabilities may suffer disproportionately from disasters. This may be in part
because these groups do not participate in the disaster planning process or
because their unique needs are not typically addressed in disaster plans.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An inclusive planning process that includes public
participation and engagement of socially vulnerable groups will lead to higher
quality recovery plans. Higher quality plans will, in turn, lead to more
disaster resilient communities. A resilient community faces future disasters
with reduced vulnerability, fewer inequities and a more sustainable future.
Research findings will also be translated into practice though partnership with
a demonstration community.
