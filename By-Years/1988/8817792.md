The two most esoteric objects known in the universe are black holes and neutron
stars (our knowledge of the former is indirect). They constitute unique general
relativistic and magneto-hydrodynamic laboratories. Their physics is difficult
and poorly understood. The Principal Investigator proposes to continue with his
theoretical study of these objects, as well as with work on the related
phenomena of gravitational waves and causality. The latter project has as its
aim the determination of general limits on the physics that may be used by
arbitrarily advanced civilizations.
