9522033 Curtis This proposal is on research to develop reactor design and
operational principles for large-scale cultivation of root cultures for the
production of biologically active chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides,
and flavors. Preliminary studies have indicated that oxygen delivery is the
fundamental design constraint for reactor scale-up.Therefore, the primary
measures of reactor performance will be tissue respiration and biomass
accumulation which are assessed by off-gas analysis and nutrient depletion
correlations, respectively. Experiments will elucidate the role of gas
dispersion, liquid mixing and diffusion of oxygen within the root tissue on
reactor performance. Gas dispersion will be measured by argon tracer
analysis/mass spectrometry, while liquid mixing will be assessed by dye tracers
for both submerged and trickle-bed reactor operations. Also, oxygen diffusion
within the root axis has been shown to limit respiration; therefore a study of
root growth and respiration for a range of root species will be performed to
experimentally validate a diffusionally controlled model for root biological
oxygen demand. ***
