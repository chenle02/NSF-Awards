The recent acquisition of a core set of ecological instrumentation is making it
possible for this Department to expand its upper-level courses as well as to
widen the range of the student-oriented research projects it can offer. This
development project thus forms an integral part of an ongoing University plan to
emphasize the sciences. The specific impact of this project is on undergraduate
instruction in Ecology and the Environmental Sciences. Among the new resources
now available to the students are an oceanographic field kit, portable
conductivity/salinity meter, dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen demand
meter, core sampler and electronic soil testing lab, recording weather station,
air quality monitoring devices, and sophisticated laboratory apparati for
studying environmental samples brought in from the field for more exacting
analysis. This improvement will result in a better prepared graduate of the
University who in turn will be better able to perform at the professional level
after graduation. The Caribbean area in particular and tropical America in
general are in urgent need of trained ecologists to help stem the current
catastrophic losses of such natural resources as forest cover, soils and
biological diversity, and to help cope with the effects of such losses.
