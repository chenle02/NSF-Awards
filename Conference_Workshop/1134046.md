This proposal is to support US participants to "An international conference on
Galois representations, automorphic forms and Shimura varieties" which will take
place during June 20-23, 2011, at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences
(NCTS), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The purpose of this conference is to showcase the
multi-facets of Galois representations and their inter-connections. The invited
speakers include experts working on noncongruence modular forms, transcendence
theory over function fields, p-adic Hodge theory, modularity of Galois
representations, automorphic representations, L-functions, and arithmetic of
Shimura varieties. Recent advances in and applications of Galois
representations, automorphic forms and arithmetic of Shimura varieties, from
theoretical and computational aspects, will be addressed. Preceding this
conference, Henri Darmon will offer a short course on "Algebraic cycles and
p-adic deformations" to prepare the students. Two accompanying special day
activities on noncongruence modular forms and arithmetic geometry will be held
after the conference to facilitate further research oriented discussions on more
focused subjects. The slides of talks during the conference will be posted on
the website of NCTS.

The research topics on Galois representations has generated a tremendous
attention after Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. Wiles' proof opened up
new connections among several important areas of mathematics, from analytic and
combinatorial number theory to arithmetic geometry. The topics of the conference
focuses on the interaction among these topics. It is hoped that international
collaborations will be fostered through this kind of activities leading to
further and deeper connections among these research fields. More information
