9410386 Zhou Sequential Function Chart (SFC) and Petri net based methodologies
are addressed in this project. The first objective of this project is to perform
a benchmark study for Ladder Logic Diagrams (LLDs), SFCs, and Petri nets in
terms of their design efficiency, cost, adaptability, and maintainability on a
flexible manufacturing system. The second objective is to perform design
recovery from LLDs to SFCs and Petri nets. The research results will advance the
knowledge, tools, and methodologies for designing and optimizing discrete-event
controllers in large industrial automation projects. Current industrial
automated manufacturing systems work with a number of inputs and outputs varying
from perhaps ten to several thousands and have communication capacity.
Traditional discrete-event control design approaches such as LLDs prove entirely
ineffective on large-scale problems.
