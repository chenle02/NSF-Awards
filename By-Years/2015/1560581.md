The project addresses recent studies on the state of U.S. and international
scientific inquiry, which identify a trend towards increased collaborative,
interdisciplinary, and international research and the increased quality and
importance of the products resulting from this research framework. However,
studies on the practice of collaborative science also demonstrate that, while
digital communication is an important component of team research, face-to-face
interaction is also needed to successfully advance the research, which can be a
challenge to achieve when the investigators are scattered across the U.S. and in
other countries. This program addresses this need and advances collaborative
scientific inquiry, and strengthens cooperation and collaboration among
scientists nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
supports three years of research team seminars in cultural anthropology,
biological anthropology, and archaeology that will be hosted by the School for
Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for anthropology and allied
disciplines. The program will support at least two seminars each year for
research teams that need focused time together to discuss, synthesize, and
analyze the results of their collaborative research and to develop plans for
successful completion of their projects. Eligible research teams will be those
in which the primary focus is on a question of anthropological importance, but
the teams may be interdisciplinary and international in scope. Seminars will be
selected through an annual competition held in February. With the funding
provided by NSF, SAR will cover all domestic and international transportation to
Santa Fe for up to 10 participants, as well as lodging and meal expenses for the
research team to meet in the SAR Seminar House for three days. Research Team
Seminar organizers will be expected to develop a meeting schedule in advance and
provide SAR with a report after the seminar concludes describing the activities
and results.
