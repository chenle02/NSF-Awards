The proposal supports a workshop for early career and doctoral student
researchers in the learning sciences, in conjunction with the 11th International
Conference for the Learning Sciences, to: (1) define productive programs of
research; (2) develop strong evidence-based arguments in research projects; and
(3) identify approaches for creating strong partnerships with practitioners and
education leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a prior funded 2010 ICLS workshop for
post-doctoral and early career researchers, on-line surveys were developed. The
surveys will be administered to this set of workshop participants as well, to
compare outcomes across workshops and gain a sense of how the workshop affects
learning and community building. The workshop includes a small number of
international participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop builds research
expertise of the participants and enables young researchers to participate in
networks with mentors in ways that will be productive for their careers and for
the field of the learning sciences.
