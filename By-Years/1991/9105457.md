Surface topography in principle should be perturbed by the passage of a hot
spot plume because of the heating and cooling of the lithosphere during passage.
However, geologic record of such topographic response is very sparse. This
project will investigate sediments of Neogene age in southwestern Montana that
were deposited in a paleovalley during the possible passage of the Yellowstone
hot spot. The work will involve testing for drainage reversals, to attempt to
date the deposits and to determine source of the sediments. Results will provide
unusual insight into topographic changes that may have occurred during the
passage of the Yellowstone hot spot across Montana.
