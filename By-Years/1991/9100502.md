A diverse group of scientists, ranging from geneticists, molecular biologists,
biophysicists, and structural and theoretical chemists, will gather to discuss
new approaches to elucidating and engineering functional properties in proteins.
The primary focus of the workshop will be on the study of molecular recognition
events as probed by mutational analysis and biophysical methods. The systems of
interest will include enzyme-substrate, antibody-antigen and protein-protein
interactions. Also included will be new biophysical, structural, theoretical and
molecular biology developments that apply to the problems of molecular
recognition in proteins.
