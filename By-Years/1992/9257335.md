Funded under the new National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award
program (NYI), research will be supported for a combined experimental and
numerical simulation approach to hydrodynamic problems related to river
mechanics. Two main topics are the initial focus of this research: experimental
studies of turbulent flow over rough surfaces and turbulence - sediment
interaction, and a numerical simulation of river channel instabilities beyond
the linear perturbation regime. The study will provide insight into the
mechanics of river meandering and bank erosion, of great importance to various
environmental issues.
