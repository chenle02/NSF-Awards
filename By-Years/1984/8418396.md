This research is a fundamental engineering study of the design and operation of
complex chemical plants. Three areas are being investigated: the development of
design strategies which considers both dynamic and economic performance
characteristics, the development of decomposition criteria for complex control
structures, and the development of design strategies for energy management
systems which are flexible, operable, and controllable. The generation and
evaluation of the large number of alternative systems which are involved is
simplified by the development of performance bounds based on physical
principles.
