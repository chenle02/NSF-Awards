Our research program at the University of South Carolina is based at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, we use
high-energy electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle
detectors as powerful microscopes to study the subatomic world. We try to answer
questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we
excite its internal degrees of freedom? Once excited, in which way does the
nucleon decay back to its original state? Does the structure of the nucleon
change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter? Do other subatomic particles
change their properties if they are produced in dense nuclear matter? The
experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the
strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated
in its tiny nucleus. The atomic nucleus is made of nucleons, which are either
positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons). These subatomic
particles, however, are not elementary but are themselves composite objects made
of quarks held together by the strong force via the exchange of glue particles
(gluons). The structure of nucleons is a manifestation of that strongest force
known to mankind. Although ninety-eight percent of the mass of ordinary matter
is due to the strong force, the present theory of that force (Quantum
Chromodynamics) is still not fully understood. This research will help to
advance our understanding. The preparation of junior scientists plays a central
role in the supported activities.
