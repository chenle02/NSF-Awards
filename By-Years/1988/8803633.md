Models of Caribbean tectonic evolution generally indicate a Paleogene Lesser
Antilles arc and a spatially identical successor Neogene arc above the leading
edge of the Caribbean plate throughout much of the Cenozoic, implying east-west
convergence for most of their time period. However, recent findings in Grenada
and the Grenadines indicate that the pre-Neogene rocks experienced north-south
compression prior to onset of arc magmatism related to westward subduction of
the Atlantic below Caribbean lithosphere. This research will test an alternative
hypothesis that the earlier deformation was related to a discrete southern
Lesser Antilles arc that accommodated north-south convergence between the North
American and South American plates prior to the arrival of the Caribbean plate
from the west in the Miocene. The work will include field structural mapping,
study of existing marine seismic data, petrology and paleomagnetic data. Results
will be of considerable importance in understanding Cenozoic interactions
between the North American, South American and Caribbean plates.
