award&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Summary: This proposal requests continued
funding for ongoing time series sediment trap studies in the Santa Barbara Basin
to calibrate climate proxies. The continuation of the sediment trap effort will
establish a time series that is sufficiently long to document how well faunal
and isotopic changes in planktonic foraminifers record interannual climate
variability associated with ENSO. &lt;br/&gt;
