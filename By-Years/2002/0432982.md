The proposal requests funding for partial support of the 2005 Particle
Accelerator Conference (PAC05) to be held at the Knoxville Convention Center in
Knoxville, Tennessee from May 16-20, 2005. This is the 21st in a biennial series
of conferences that provides a leading forum for the exchange of information and
new ideas in particle accelerator science and technology. The funds will be used
to support the travel expenses for young researchers in the field, namely,
students and postdocs from U.S institutions.
