This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project builds upon
earlier work to develop an information security ratings service. When businesses
connect their networks with partners or share data with them, they are often
poorly informed about the potential risks they assume. Businesses have 3rd party
relationships for a variety of operational reasons and these partnerships almost
always involve sharing sensitive and confidential data. Data shared can be
customer information, intellectual property, social security numbers etc.
Businesses are worried about losing data through breaches in partner networks as
they face the consequences - financial, legal, and regulatory. Existing risk
management techniques are based on annual audits and only provide a snapshot of
a partner's security posture. However, new vulnerabilities are discovered
everyday and the industry needs a solution that enables a business to
continuously monitor changing risk posture of all its partners and proactively
manage assumed risks. The Phase II research objective is to build a scalable
fully-automated ratings system. The research will focus on identifying and
incorporating new data sources, improving the statistical properties of the
ratings model, and making the ratings predictive of future behavior.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, credit scoring has been a "cost and time-
saving technology" that has provided tremendous value to lenders and borrowers
alike by reducing costs, predicting future performance, and improving credit
accessibility and affordability. Unlike credit scoring, no industry standard
scoring service exists to rate business with respect to their information
security risk. With Saperix's ratings service, businesses and government will
have the potential to reap the same time and cost savings that lenders do from
credit scoring services. If the research is successful, Saperix's solution would
provide market incentives for improving security outcomes, which would be a
significant change in how security investments are viewed by businesses.
