Partial support is provided for a second international conference and workshop
for the siting and underground geomechanic research portions of ground disposal
of hazardous wastes, to be held in the Fall of l987. The first international
conference and workshop was highly successful and resulted in several benchmark
decisions on the technical approaches to clarify the siting and subsurface
disposal issues for hazardous waste. The meeting resulted in an international
transfer of technologies for siting hazardous waste disposal and has helped in
the emergence of a new field of research in environmental geotechnology. The
second meeting will continue to assess the progress made in this research area.
