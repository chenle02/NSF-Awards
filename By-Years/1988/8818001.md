Local populations of a species are often considered to be genetically
differentiated in response to local differences in environmental factors that
produce divergent forces of natural selection. Most demonstrations of such
"adaptive differentiation" are actually not based on local populations but are
instead focused on populations that are separated by large geographic distances
or are completely unconnected by gene flow. Thus the scale at which adaptive
differentiation can occur remains to be delineated. Prior work by Dr. Travis has
shown extensive local differentiation in apparent response to physical factors
that vary across locations. The next phase of the research will (1) examine the
detailed nature of the genetic differences and (2) test the hypotheses for how
the physical factors in the environment generate divergent forces of natural
selection.
