Many existing models of international population migration ignore the realities
of migration circulation. These circulations begin with movement from an origin
country to a destination country, which ultimately lead to a return movement of
migrants back to their countries of origin. Existing migration models focus on
initial origin-designation migration or on the subsequent return migration. This
project will develop a framework that integrates all aspects of migration into a
unified model of international migration circulation. Hypotheses will be tested
which evaluate the effects of immigrant stocks and economic and behavioral
factors on migration circulation. The study will employ a uniquely disaggregated
data set of international migration to and from Germany from 1970 to 1989. A set
of integrated logit models will be used to test the hypothesis that much
international migration is described as a process of circulation. The results of
this project will enhance the understanding of the dynamics of international
circulations. By simulating the effects of different migration policy scenarios,
the model will be able to differentiate the impact of national policy on
migration over the short run and the long run.
