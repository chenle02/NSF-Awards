Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A signature characteristic of the
federal judicial system is its hierarchical structure; that structure shapes the
goals of the judges within it, and induces concerns about oversight (for lower
courts) and compliance (for higher courts). Such factors, in turn, interact with
both case- and judge-level influences on decision making. A complete
characterization of judicial decision making in the federal system must
therefore allow for the influence of case-specific, judge-specific, and
hierarchical effects, with the latter considering both "upward-looking"
(oversight) and "downward-looking" (compliance) behavior; ideally, such a model
must also measure those factors consistently across the three levels of the
hierarchy, and allow for the magnitude of those effects to vary across divergent
courts. We develop such a model, and analyze its implications through an
analysis of the actions of all participating federal judges in each of the lower
court proceedings for all cases decided in the U.S. Supreme Court which
originated in a federal district court from 1953-2005. By coding data at the
various levels of the judicial hierarchy in each case, our approach allows us to
examine judicial voting within a given case context, and thereby holds constant
the range of case-specific factors that might otherwise influence judicial
decisions. In addition, recent advances in generalized hierarchical and mixed
models allow for a flexible specification of the interaction of judge- and
court-specific influences, including those related to hierarchy effects due to
judges' potential concerns with oversight, compliance, or both. Finally, the end
result of our data collection will be a comprehensive accounting of every
decision made by every federal judge in every case decided by the U.S. Supreme
Court over the past five decades; those data will thus offer scholars an
unparalleled resource for the study of judges' decisions in the U.S. federal
courts. &lt;br/&gt;
