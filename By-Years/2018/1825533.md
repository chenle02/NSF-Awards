A workshop on Groups, Geometry and Dynamics will be held at the Universidad de
la Republica in Montevideo, Uruguay from July 27 to July 31, 2018. The workshop
will bring together researchers from South America, Europe and the United
States. The workshop will foster international collaboration and aid in the
dissemination of recent advances. It is an official satellite conference of the
International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in Rio de Janeiro in August
2018. The funding provided will be focused on the support of U.S.-based early
career mathematicians who are in an especially strong position to benefit from
exposure to recent advances and a broader mathematical community. The organizing
committee and the principal investigator are committed to funding a diverse
group of mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will focus on
geometric group theory, Riemannian geometry and dynamics and their manifold
interactions. The workshop will bring together researchers from South America,
Europe and the United States. The workshop will enhance the worldwide
dissemination of recent results in these fields and encourage interaction and
collaboration between researchers from these varied mathematical communities.
This workshop aims to build on and further develop the connections developed
between the U.S., European and South American mathematical communities in these
fields fostered at a very productive workshop on Geometry of Groups held in
Montevideo in April 2016. Further details about the workshop, including a full
list of speakers, is available at the conference website:

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
