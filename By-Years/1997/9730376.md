9730376 Mix This project will examine a variety of sediment indicators in two
transects of sediment cores from the western margin of South America, to address
questions concerning ocean circulation on glacial/interglacial time scales. The
Pis hypothesize that cooler water in the glacial eastern equatorial pacific
resulted from stronger flow of the Humboldt Current, that mid-latitude westerly
winds shifted to the north as a result of an expanded southern ice sheet, and
that variations in the Humboldt Current were in phase with those Of the
California Current. Analyses will include taxonomic and stable isotope
composition of foraminifera and radiolaria, and alkenone saturation indices.
