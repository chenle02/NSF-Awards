The investigators will study the morphology and small-scale vertical structure
of intense radar echoes from the polar mesopause. Possible generation mechanisms
for these unique echoes, called polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE), are not
well understood, and observations have been limited by the lack of needed
resolution. Frequency domain interferometry (FDI) measurements can potentially
provide information about the vertical structure of the echoes, but the
technique only works when a single layer is present. The investigators have
developed a modified approach called Range Imaging (RIM). In this technique,
numerous transmitter frequencies are used and sophisticated reconstruction
schemes are employed to obtain the desired vertical resolution. The RIM approach
will be applied to data obtained from a very high frequency radar in Tromso,
Norway. Studying mesospheric chemistry and dynamics is important for
understanding the temperature structure of the middle atmosphere. Middle
atmosphere temperature is a sensitive indicator of long-term changes associated
with global change.
