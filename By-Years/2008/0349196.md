Prof. Frank L. Brown of the University of California Santa Barbara is supported
by this CAREER award to develop a dynamic elastic model for lipid bilayers which
is used in simulating complex biochemical and biophysical phenomena. The
research involves the development of Fourier Space Brownian Dynamics, or FSBD,
for stochastically evolving these surfaces. This method will allow the modeling
of cellular motility and membrane protein diffusion. A second project supported
by this award is the development of theoretical and computational approaches to
single molecule spectroscopy. The results of these simulations are used to
interpret photon counting experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a
broad impact on the field of biology, particularly the biophysics of membranes.
Professor Brown is involved with the Computational Science and Engineering
program on the UCSB campus and is working to incorporate computational chemistry
into the program. Courses in atomic and mesoscale simulation techniques are
being developed by Professor Brown as part of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in a co-funding arrangement with both Molecular
Biophysics of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Materials Theory Program of
the Division of Materials Research.
