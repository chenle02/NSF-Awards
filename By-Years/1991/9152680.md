The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Pembroke State University
is updating and upgrading the computer equipment available for use in its
courses for preservice teachers. Preservice teachers need to learn how and when
to use the computer as a tool in their classrooms, especially prospective
science and mathematics teachers. The computer tools they use during their
education must be up to date. These tools should be similar to those they might
expect to encounter as new teachers but preferably somewhat better. Two
important aspects of modern educational computing are computer networking and
multimedia use of the computer. The new equipment is networked and has
multimedia capability to allow the inclusion of these topics in the curriculum.
The equipment is also used to make improvements in the general introductory
course for non-majors.
