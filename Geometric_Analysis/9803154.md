This project is devoted to innovative applications of the geometry of moving
frames and the mathematical theory of differential invariants to problems
arising in computer vision, with emphasis on medical imaging. Since symmetry
forms a basic component of the human visual system, it should be naturally
incorporated into mathematical methods for image processing and object
recognition. The image processing applications to be considered will include
denoising and smoothing, segmentation and edge detection, as well as object
recognition, including symmetry detection and partial occlusions. Practical
implementations will be based on the signature curve paradigm, that is based on
the construction of suitable differential invariants for the symmetry group
under consideration. Metrics that distinguish signature curves of different
objects will be compared, with the goal being to recognize and extract objects
from both two and three-dimensional images. Practical implementations of the
image processing systems will rely on a new method of constructing symmetry-
preserving numerical approximations to differential invariants that is to be
developed as a part of this project. The applications will be based on a new,
practical theory of moving frames, that can be applied to general group actions,
both finite and infinite-dimensional. Part of the project will be devoted to the
further development of this general theory. Various additional applications, to
problems arising in physics, geometry, invariant theory, and the calculus of
variations, will also be investigated.
