AST-0307600&lt;br/&gt;Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a theoretical and
observational program to identify and understand competing dynamical signatures
imprinted on the gaseous media inside and around galaxy clusters. The intra-
cluster medium (ICM) is the principal baryonic component of clusters and carries
unique indicators of the history and state of clusters. A proper interpretation
of the structures seen in X-ray and radio studies of clusters, and of cluster
physical properties and inflows, depends on an improved understanding of
external influences (notably gravitational infall) and internal disturbances
(especially from active galaxies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
include a systematic study of shocks in and around clusters, using very high-
resolution cosmological simulations, a careful investigation of ICM interactions
with high-energy plasma ejected by active galaxies, using magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of realistic media and relativistic particles, and radio surveys
intended to identify extragalactic structures on scales of a few mega-parsecs.
The use of 'synthetic observations' bridges the critical gap between the data
and the theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work contributes to the broader
understanding of cosmic magnetic fields, the energetics of active galaxies, and
the development of structure in the Universe. It will train students in cutting-
edge science, data analysis, and simulation techniques, and it will contribute
to the PIs' major public education efforts, involving K-12 schools, the local
planetarium, and national public television&lt;br/&gt;
