This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
inexpensive carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide sensors for heating, ventilation and air
conditioning (HVAC) controls. The sensors will use&lt;br/&gt;Dioxide Materials'
patent pending catalyst mixtures, to create a series of CO2 sensors using a
novel&lt;br/&gt;design. We expect to create sensors that are an order of
magnitude less expensive than the CO2 sensors&lt;br/&gt;used for HVAC systems
today and yet show comparable performance. The proposed Phase I work
will&lt;br/&gt;include developing solid electrolytes for the device, testing
performance against customer supplied&lt;br/&gt;specs, and checking for
corrosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is to develop a sensors that will enable affordable&lt;br/&gt;control
systems that result in significant reductions in utility costs for homes and
businesses. Most HVAC&lt;br/&gt;systems are inefficient. They run full blast
when buildings are nearly empty, and over ventilate because&lt;br/&gt;the air
quality in a building is unknown. Several, vendors have developed control
systems that use CO2&lt;br/&gt;sensors to assess the air quality and adjust the
HVAC systems accordingly. Energy savings of up to&lt;br/&gt;$0.31/ft2/yr (i.e.
$465/yr for a 1500 ft2 house) have been demonstrated, but the systems have not
been&lt;br/&gt;widely deployed because the needed CO2 sensors are too expensive
and cannot be attached to a&lt;br/&gt;standard thermostat. If the project is
successful through Phase II, Dioxide Materials' new sensors will&lt;br/&gt;make
advanced HVAC control systems affordable. Utility bills will go down. Further,
utilities will not&lt;br/&gt;need to generate as much electricity, so greenhouse
gas emissions will be reduced.
