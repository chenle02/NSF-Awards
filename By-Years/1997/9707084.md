9707084 Pittenger In 1997 Scripps Institute of Oceanography will operate
research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and ROBERT GORDON SPROUL and the new age
AGOR 24, RODGER REVELLE, in support of NSF-sponsored oceanographic research. The
R/V MELVILLE will support a cruise in the Indian Ocean for WOCE and 2 cruises
South of Australia in support of Marine Geology and Geophysical. The vessel will
than work its way back to San Diego doing an MGG cruise. Following a cruise to
the Gulf of Alaska for NAVO, the MELVILLE ends the year with 2 cruises off the
coast of California and Mexico. The R/V REVELLE schedule has gone through many
iterations. In the current schedule the vessel will start 1997 by supporting two
cruise off NOAA cruise. The vessel will undergo final contract trials for the
pending. The REVELLE will end 1997 in support of JGOFS in the southern oceans.
The R/V NEW HORIZON will support a variety of biological and physical
oceanography projects off the west coast of the US and Mexico. R/V ROBERT GORDON
SPROUL will do short cruises off the coast of California and one cruise in the
Columbia River estuary. The SIO vessels are part of a fleet utilized by the
National Science Foundation in support of oceanographic research. Most
oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive
support from the ship's crew members. Increasingly research projects require
equipment which must be permanently installed on the vessel, thus requiring
specialized ships. The ships do not operate the same as general cargo/fishing
vessels, therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels
specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
universities and research institutes around the country.
