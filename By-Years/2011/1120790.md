A fundamental question in biology is how organisms adapt to changes in their
environment or in their social groups in ways that lead to the creation of new
species. A novel hypothesis about how this may happen states that when females
choose attractive mates they may also favor mates that are well-adapted to their
environment. This is because mate-attraction displays can be costly to produce,
so that only males that are well-adapted to an environment may be capable of
producing attractive displays. Mate choice may thus create an association
between attractiveness and local adaptation, and promote divergence when
occurring in different environments. &lt;br/&gt;This study will test this
hypothesis by evaluating the quantitative genetics of behavioral and life
history traits in a group of plant-feeding insects. A sample of families will be
reared on native environments (to which they are adapted), and on novel
environments. The expectation is that in the native environment attractive males
will have the highest performance, but this relationship should break down in
novel environments. By potentially reconciling the ability of mate choice to
promote rapid diversification with the ability to create ecological differences,
this research may transform how biologists view two of the most basic
evolutionary processes: adaptation and divergence. Other broader impacts of this
study include training in research, mentorship, and outreach for students at
undergrad, grad, and postdoctoral levels.
