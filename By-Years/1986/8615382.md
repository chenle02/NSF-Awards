Fractured mirrors from destructive tests performed from 1980 to 1985 were saved;
this collection is unique in that it originated from naturally occurring flaws
on window glass plate and mirror surfaces. Selected specimens will be analyzed
using a scanning electron microscope to determine, among other observations: the
general shapes of naturally occuring critical flows; differences between shapes
and sizes of flaws occurring on the surfaces of new and weathered window glass
plates; the differences between the critical flows for both types of specimens
when tested in full scale under uniform loading, and when using the concentric
rings tests; and the correlation between stress at failure and flaw size at
various flow direction/stress direction relationships.
