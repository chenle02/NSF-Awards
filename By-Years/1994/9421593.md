9421593 Jirsa This project will continue technical coordination for NSF projects
funded under the NSF Initiative on Repair and Rehabilitation which was begun in
1990 when the first group of proposals were funded. During the first four years
of the project, the coordinator has organized meetings of the Principal
Investigators and produced annual progress reports which have been disseminated
to all interested parties. In addition, several technical sessions at national
meetings and a number of presentations have been made to publicize the research
work. These coordination activities will continue until the conclusion of the
five year program. A major remaining activity will be to edit and produce a
comprehensive technical summary document containing contributions from all PI's.
The summary document will provide a single source reference for use by designers
and others interested in implementing the results of the program. The intent is
to develop a document which contains design requirements and sufficient details
for use in engineering practice. ***
