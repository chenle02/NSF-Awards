Aims Community College has upgraded its chemical instrumentation with the
purchase of a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph, a Gas Chromatograph, an
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, and a Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectrophotometer. Through this purchase three important goals were achieved.
First, the Chemical Testing Technology Program is enhanced. Training on modern
equipment facilitate the student's entry in technically intensive jobs in local
industry upon graduation. Second, chemical instrumentation is integrated into
undergraduate courses to demonstrate scientific concepts. Student laboratory
experiments have been developed for general college chemistry, organic
chemistry, human biochemistry, and selected biological science courses A special
set of laboratory experiments have been developed for police academy trainees on
the scientific basis of analytical techniques in criminalistics. Third, the
experiments that have been developed will be shared with others who teach
undergraduate courses through publications and presentations.
