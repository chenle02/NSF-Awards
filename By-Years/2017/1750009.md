The task of designing an algorithm that performs a desired function, or achieves
a desired goal, currently requires expertise in the problem domain.
Consequently, although people have access to powerful computing platforms, most
non-experts are limited to using these platforms through pre-programmed apps.
Automated program synthesis changes this current state of affairs by enabling
computers to convert high-level specification of the problem to a computable
procedure. Apart from the benefit of making technology accessible to more
people, program synthesis has the promise of reducing errors, and improving
performance, of software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program synthesis refers to the
problem of discovering a program that meets the requirements specified by a
user. It is a hard problem to solve in general. However, if the space of
possible programs is restricted, then it becomes feasible to iteratively search
the space of possible programs for some program that works correctly on all
inputs. The quantifier alternation in this exists-forall formulation makes
synthesis computationally difficult and hinders scalability. This project
drastically improves efficiency of program synthesis by developing and
exploiting a notion of duality in programming. Duality between computing and
proving promises to play a foundational role in understanding program analysis
and synthesis. It not only encompasses several well-known concepts, such as
types, abstractions, and abstract interpretation, but also goes beyond them to
provide a general methodology for attaching a proof with a program. Duality
enables approximating the exists-forall synthesis constraint by a relatively
more tractable exists-constraint. This project develops the duality-based
synthesis approach. This project also makes contributions to education,
research, and technology transfer to industry through freely distributed tools
and academic visitor programs that include internships for graduate students.
