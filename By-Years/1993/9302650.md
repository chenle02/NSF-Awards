An unresolved controversy in paleoceanography is the role of warm, saline bottom
water (WSBW), presumably formed at low latitudes in restricted marginal basins,
now occurring in deep water circulation. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data
suggest WSBW may have dominated ocean circulation at several times in the past,
but stale isotope signatures are not unique water mass tracers. Due to the short
oceanic residence time of Nd and the distinct Nd isotope input values to
different water masses, this Nd isotopic system may be a conservative tracer of
water mass. Fish tooth apatite may provide a deep water record through Nd
isotopes. This study should aid in evaluating the timing and mechanism of the
rare earth element (REE) uptake in fish tooth apatite by examining samples from
two deep sea sites with different lithologic controls on diagenetic alteration.
It should also allow us to determine fish tooth composition across the
Paleocene/Eocene boundary, a time of proposed WSBS formation. Major changes in
the mode of ocean circulation in the past would impact nutrient distributions
and redox conditions, as well as the transfer of heat and air/sea exchange of
atmospheric gases that directly influence global climate.
