9421935 Kedem This award is to purchase a small network of workstations with
accessories and software to support 4 research projects: 1) Further development
of Calypso, a software-based execution platform for high-performance computing.
This experimental project grew out of previous theoretical work dealing with
abstract machines. The current prototype will be further enhanced and tested on
selected applications. Special attention will be paid to scalability, load
balancing, and fault tolerance. 2) Experimentation with Persistent Linda, an
implementation of a fault-tolerant Linda built on top of lightweight
transactions. Large-scale experimentation will be conducted using multiple
machines executing long-running parallel computations. 3) Construction of an
experimental platform for the easy implementation and evaluation of fundamental,
symbolic computation algorithms. Special attention will be given to making the
platform robust, flexible, and portable. 4) Distributed extension to a novel,
centralized persistent object system will be developed. The system will be
enhanced by new facilities such as type security, distributed locking,
distributed synchronization, and collaborative applications. ***
