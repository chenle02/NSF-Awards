A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer is acquired to support research in
engineering. The instrument is to be used in conjunction with existing
ultrahigh-vacuum systems for infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS).
Initially, it is used to study adsorbates on well-defined, single-crystal,
metal-oxide surfaces and to probe the local site requirements for adsorption and
catalytic reactions on such surfaces. Specific systems under investigation
include simple molecules on cuprous oxide, and a variety of oxidations over
cuprous oxide, stannic oxide, and chromous oxide. Potential applications from
these efforts exist in commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals, electronic
materials, and pollution control.
