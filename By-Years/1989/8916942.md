The tectonics of south east Asia is a complex of active interactions between
many oceanic, microcontinental blocks and mainland Asia including China with an
overall convergent aspect. As such, the area represents a natural laboratory for
study of terrane amalgamation and accretions at an early stage that may result
in a collage of accreted terranes such as northwestern North America. The
approach taken is this project is to establish, by paleomagnetic data primarily,
the overall paleo- geographic development of this region in order to provide a
framework for more focused tectonic studies. This renewal will continue towards
this goal by Paleomagnetic work in parts of Malaysia and the Philippines. These
results will be used to test competing models of the tectonics of Southeast
Asia.
