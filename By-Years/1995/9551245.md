This project is improving the quality of instruction in computer science by
providing students with a powerful environment in which to learn the basic
principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) when developing software. It also
allows them to experiment with new techniques in developing the HCI component of
a software project. With this lab, students are able to concentrate on the user
interface aspects of a project. They gain experience with modern user-interface
software development tools as well as with a wide variety of hardware input and
output devices. One additional important component of this lab is the
development of systems for special populations, such as the physically
handicapped. This laboratory project exposes students who wish to pursue careers
in industry to the skills that are in high demand. In addition, it prepares
students who wish to go on to graduate school to engage in advanced research
projects.
