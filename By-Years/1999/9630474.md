9630474 Karplus A question central to flavoenzyme studies is how the binding of
FMN or FAD to various protein scaffolds controls the redox potential and
chemical reactivity of the flavin, allowing it to catalyse an astounding
diversity of reactions. High resolution structural information, combined with
extensive enzymatic and spectroscopic data is the most effective way to gain
insight into the mechanisms controlling flavin reactivity. This project extends
studies of recombinant forms of the flavoenzymes ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase
(FNR), old yellow enzyme (OYE), and Mycobacterium smegmatis lactate
monooxygenase (LMO). Studies on OYE include high resolution analyses of the wild
type and mutant OYE structures and, in particular, determining how NADPH binds
to OYE and how much charge transfer interactions contribute to ligand affinity.
Other studies include the structural analyses of wild type and mutant forms of
spinach FNR, pea FNR and corn root FNR, as well as LMO. %%% Enzymes which
require riboflavin are widely involved in metabilic processes. A question
central to understanding these enzymes is how the binding of riboflavin
derivatives (FMN and FAD) to various protein scaffolds controls the redox
potential and chemical reactivity of the flavin, and allows the catalysis an
astounding diversity of reactions. High resolution structural information,
combined with extensive enzymatic and spectroscopic data is the most effective
way to gain insight into the mechanisms controlling flavin reactivity. This
project uses crystallographic and other biophysical studies to further the
understanding of structure-function relations for the flavin dependent enzymes
ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, old yellow enzyme, and lactate monooxygenase. ***
