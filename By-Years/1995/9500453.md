This award supports work on the representation theory of finite dimensional
algebras. The principal investigator intends to investigate certain classes of
representations from a structure-theoretic point of view. This will require a
closer understanding of the geometry of families of uniserial modules and
modules with uniserial building blocks. The principal investigator will also
explore contravariant finiteness of subcategories of categories of finitely
generated modules and, in particular, will develop concrete criteria for the
presence of this finiteness property. She will also examine contravariantly
finite closures of a given modules category obtained by passing through a
sequence of one-point extensions of the underlying algebra. This research is in
the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation
satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to
do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication in not commutative is the
collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings
has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance
to other branches of mathematics and physics.
