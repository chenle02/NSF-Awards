This project, which is supported by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program and
the Biophysics Program, combines ultrafast spectroscopy, mutant generation and
characterization, and pigment protein biochemistry to build a detailed picture
of the dynamics of light harvesting. The project will also address the primary
charge separation step in bacterial reaction centers. Current methods of
membrane biochemistry, and genetic selection will be exploited to simplify and
modify a photosynthetic apparatus for detailed spectroscopic studies. State-of-
the-art ultrafast spectroscopic techniques will be used to study excitation
energy transfer in the antenna systems of chloroplasts and in the reaction
centers of photosynthetic bacteria. Site directed mutagenesis will be performed
so that the influence of specific protein residues on the charge separation may
be examined.
