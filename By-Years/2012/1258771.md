This proposal seeks continued funding for the Marine Geological Sample
Laboratory (MGSL) at the Univ. of Rhode Island. This relatively small facility
loaned nearly 3,000 samples during the previous funding cycle. Institutional
support includes cold storage facilities, support for graduate student
involvement, and support for the senior person in charge of the facility. The
work plan includes continued description and logging of core, and accessioning
of a new collection of analyzed glass separates from oceanic basalts.
