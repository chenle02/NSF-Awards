The fabrication and investigation of novel composite polymer materials is
proposed. The particular class of structures are polymer thin films via
surfactant templates which have been recently developed in the PI's laboratory.
This project will ascertain the scope and uniqueness of the films, and will
further emphasize the characterization of films formed by this new method.
Generality of the thin film process will be explored for various hydrophilic and
hydrophobic substrate, polymers of different type and molecular structure, and
various types of surfactant. Characterization will include molecular weight
determination by gel permeation chromatography, test of film uniformity and
reproducibility by several physical methods, and examination of the films
structures on the substrate by various microscopic techniques. The synthesis of
an unusual type of new surfactant, namely hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon hybrid
surfactant, is also proposed. The hybrid surfactant will be used with the thin
film techniques in order to form patterned polymeric films.
