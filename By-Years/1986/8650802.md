The instructional focus of the industrial technology program in the Department
of Industrial and Engineering Technology at Western Kentucky University has been
reorganized from that of traditional production techniques to one of complete
Computer Integrated Manufacturing Technology (CIMT). With the acquisition of a
materials handling robot, a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) has been added
which completes the laboratory facility. The availability of the FMC allows
undergraduates to use computer assisted techniques and robotics to evaluate
flexible manufacturing methodology and to apply standard production techniques
to experiments leading to the production of high quality, marketable products.
