Under a previous award, the co-principal investigators studied, using cross
correlation techniques, the upper level (tropospheric) circulation anomalies
associated with tropical convection over the Indian and Pacific Oceans on
various times scales during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Their analyses
suggest that tropical convective activity (and the attendant atmospheric
heating), on the timescale of 14-30 days, generates planetary scale waves
sources in subtropical regions which have a significant impact on the east Asian
subtropical jet and planetary scale wave patterns in the midlatitudes. In
contrast, it appears that convective activity in the eastern Pacific on shorter
timescales (6-14 days) is more likely to be affected by extratropical
disturbances. With this award, Drs. Kiladis and Weickmann will extend their
previous results (cross correlation) to other seasons and other regions of the
globe. They also will begin some studies using a simple linear model to explore
the mechanism(s) by which tropical heating influences extratropical circulation
patterns. This research should provide insights into the dynamical links between
the tropics and extratropics and ultimately contribute to improving the models
used for medium range forecasting.
