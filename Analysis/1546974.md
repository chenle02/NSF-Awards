This award provided funding for the conference Analytic and Probabilistic
Techniques in Modern Convex Geometry, to be held at the University of Missouri
from November 7-9, 2015.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially the fields
of random matrices, probability, and convex analysis. The confirmed participant
list includes a number of leading researchers in the fields covered by this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through mailing lists and advertisements in
media maintained by professional organizations. More information will be
available at http://www.bengal.missouri.edu/~pivovarovp/APTMCG.
