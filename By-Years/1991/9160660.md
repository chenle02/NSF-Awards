The proposed project includes monitoring global deep convection via ionospheric
potential because thunderstorm development is extremely sensitive to surface
temperature. The proposed technology will take advantage of the characteristics
of the atmospheric electrical global circuit so that just one reliable
measurement of ionospheric potential at any sub-auroral latitude will serve as
globally representative data.
