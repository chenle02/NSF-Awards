Structuring classrooms in which students work cooperatively rather than compete
or work individualistically has been shown to be powerful in several key ways.
Cooperative learning groups produce a learning environment where more students
learn more material, students are more positive about the subject area and more
motivated to take additional classes. In addition, there is an acceptance of
differences which encourages the achievement of both males and females,
handicapped and non handicapped, students of different ethnic backgrounds, and
students who do not have English as a native language. The goals of the project
are to train leadership teams of science and mathematics teachers in school
systems where cooperative learning has already been introduced and to initiate
basic training in cooperative learning in other prominent school systems,
including at least two inner city sites. Over 600 mathematics and science
teachers from eleven key school districts across the United States will be
trained in how to structure cooperative learning groups in their science
classrooms. In addition, a model for building cooperative learning into already
existing curricula in science and mathematics will be developed and implemented.
