Historically, parallel computers have focussed on a single mode of parallelism:
Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data (MIMD) Single-Instruction, Multiple Data
(SIMD). Some new computers efficiently implement both paradigms in a single
integrated ``universal'' architecture capable of supporting large numbers of
powerful processing nodes in a design scalable to teraflop computation. Clearly,
this capability to perform well on both SIMD and MIMD computation is the basis
for many future high-performance architectures. This hybrid parallelism is also
ideally suited for implementing many algorithms for large-scale mathematical
programming, since these methods require powerful individual processors for the
solution of optimization subproblems (which may take the form of a medium-sized
linear or quadratic program), efficient message passage capabilities for the
transfer of subproblem solutions, and efficient synchronization and SIMD-style
operations across processors. Proper algorithmic design thus allows the solution
of optimization ``megaproblems'' that were intractable on preceding
architectures. This project focuses on network-related optimization problems
because such problems arise in a great variety of real world applications for
which there are real data as well as problem generators.
