This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will involve
production and purification of a powerful Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
contrast agent based on a newly discovered nanomaterial (Trimetasphere),
consisting of a metallic nitride nanocluster inside a fullerene type cage.
Trimetaspheres recently demonstrated a factor of 21 times improved relaxivity
over currently used MRI contrast agents. The project will involve designing and
building a powder-feed continuous reactor, including large rod capability,
developing chemically-based separations techniques and optimizing heat treatment
of the chemically separated Trimetaspherses mixtures. The nanoproduction and
chemical-based separations techniques for these Trimetasphere nanomaterials will
provide the basis for the large-scale production of the Trimetasphere based MRI
contrast agents.

Commercially, these Trimetaspheres have tremendous medical applications that
will benefit US citizens with better medical care through improved diagnostics,
new pharmaceuticals, and simultaneous diagnostic and treatment reagents, at a
fraction of current cost. The development of more sensitive contrast agents, if
translated into smaller, less expensive MRI instruments, will open entirely new
markets for the equipment manufacturers.
