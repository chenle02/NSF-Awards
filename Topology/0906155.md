Culler and Shalen will continue their research on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One of
the main themes of their work is the connection between topologically defined
invariants of such manifolds and their quantitative geometric invariants such as
volume. This has involved interactions between very classical techniques in
3-manifold topology, some of which go back to Papakyriakopoulos's work in the
1950's, and more geometric methods such as the log(2k-1)-theorem of Anderson,
Canary, Culler and Shalen, the work of Kojima and Miyamoto on hyperbolic
manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, and the work of Agol, Dunfield, Storm
and Thurston based on properties of the Ricci flow with surgeries. A second
theme, which recently has grown out of the first, is the connection between the
number-theoretic invariants of a manifold such as its trace field and
quantitative geometric invariants such as its Margulis number. This aspect of
the work depends on combining the earlier work with new group-theoretic
observations, and has already brought into play such deep number-theoretic
ingredients as the work of Siegel and Mahler on the unit equation in algebraic
number fields.

Hyperbolic manifolds are geometric objects that arise in many branches of
mathematics and in many applications of mathematics. The first hyperbolic
manifold, called hyperbolic space, was discovered in the 19th century and
settled---in the negative---the ancient problem of whether Euclid's fifth
postulate could be deduced from his other postulates. Hyperbolic manifolds may
be thought of as geometric objects which at small scales are indistinguishable
from hyperbolic space, but whose large-scale behavior is more complicated. A
major theme in modern geometry is the interaction between the quantitative
properties of a geometric object, for example those defined in terms of
distances, lengths, areas and volumes, and their "topological" properties which
are more qualitative and are unchanged when the object is deformed. In the case
of hyperbolic manifolds, so much progress has been made in recent years in
relating the quantitative and topological theories that they may be said to be
completely unified at an abstract level. The present project involves making our
understanding the connection in a more concrete way. Doing this turns out to
involve deep ideas from many branches of mathematics.
