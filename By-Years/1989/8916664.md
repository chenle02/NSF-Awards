Research will continue on the Early Mesozoic evolution of reefs, reef organisms
and their paleobiogeography. Research will expand the emphasis to fossil reefal
biotas from Triassic and Jurassic rocks of the Wrangellia, Wallowa, Stikine and
eastern Klamath terranes in Alaska, Vancouver Island, Oregon and Idaho and
northern California. Findings will be compared with those from Permian reefal
faunas. The results will be a refined regional synthesis of reef evolution and
dispersal of the faunas during a critical interval of reef history.
