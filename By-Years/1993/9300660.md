This award supports research in two areas. First the principal investigator
will study permutation representations. He will classify all monodromy groups of
primitive branched coverings of Riemann surfaces which are sufficiently large in
terms of the genus. He will also consider similar problems over finite fields
and their algebraic closures, and over number fields. In addition, he will
consider problems involving nonconjugate subgroups which induce the same
permutation representation. The second major area of investigation is matrix
theory. In particular, the principal investigator will determine what can be
said about the minimal polynomial of a symmetric matrix over the integers. He
also intends to investigate the structure of the variety of commuting r-tuples
of matrices. A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation. It
appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. The
fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of
the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the classification of the
finite simple groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal
pages. This research is aimed at using this classification in the study of
arbitrary finite groups and other algebraic structures.
