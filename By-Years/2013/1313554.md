Researchers have developed a new technology, termed anchored hybrid enrichment,
that allows a set of genes to be isolated and sequenced in a broad range of
species (e.g., vertebrates or insects) with minimal preexisting genomic
resources. The purpose of the proposed work is to perform market assessments and
technology developments to expand beyond the current academic research market
into future commercial pharmaceutical and agricultural markets. Anchored hybrid
enrichment integrates emerging technologies (e.g., high-throughput sequencing
and hybrid enrichment) and leverages existing genomic resources in order to
enable a 100-fold increase in the rate that DNA sequence data can be collected
in non-model species. This new approach opens the door for highly efficient
surveys of genetic variation across diverse species. The innovation developed in
this proposal has the potential to advance biodiversity research by releasing
two major bottlenecks: limited availability of genetic markers in non-model
systems and low sample throughput. Anchored enrichment may also open the door
for a new high-throughput mining approach to pharmaceutical discovery and
increased efficiency of insecticides for agriculture applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchored hybrid enrichment is quickly becoming the gold
standard in biodiversity research because it allows large amounts of data to be
collected in non-model species and because it reduces the cost of doing research
by 100-fold. This approach to data collection could greatly increase the ability
of researchers to answer important biological questions in non-model species.
Application of the innovation to pharmaceuticals has the potential to greatly
increase the rate at which new drugs can be discovered by providing access to
novel genetic variants that already exist in nature. Finally, application of the
anchored hybrid enrichment technology to agriculture may allow for the
development of more efficient insecticides by providing genetic information for
a broad array of agricultural pest species. This can result in lower costs and
faster time to market, improved outcomes, higher quality and yields for
genetically-engineered products.
