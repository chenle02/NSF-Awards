The use of "cloud technologies" presents a promising avenue for the requirements
of big data analysis. Security concerns however represent a major impediment to
the further adoption of clouds: through the sharing of cloud resources, an
attack succeeding on one node can tamper with many applications sharing that
node. This project explores the combination of two readily-available, practical
mechanisms to holistically achieve assured cloud-based big data processing: (1)
Byzantine fault tolerant replication and (2) partially homomorphic encryption.
The former consists in replicating computational entities to achieve
availability, and comparing their produced results to enforce integrity of
results as well as isolation of suspicious components. The latter suggests
leveraging the innate ability of existing "cryptosystems" to support certain
specific operations on data in encrypted state in order to ensure its privacy.

The project envisions an efficient application of redundant computation
(replication) and redundant storage (different encryptions of same data) through
a smart breakdown of programs into sub-computations and sub-datasets based on
boundaries identified via program analysis. To enable that vision, the scope of
Byzantine fault tolerant replication is extended beyond the present client-
server scenarios to avoid significant slowdowns when applied to fine-grained
parallelization of large datasets; similarly, partially homomorphic encryption
is made applicable without hampering parallelism and beyond very simple
programs.

This project will have a high impact on software developers given the
continuously increasing relevance of the cloud computing paradigm and of big
data. Results will be made broadly available through scientific publications and
use open-source software systems for implementation.
