With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Glass of the
University of Arizona will develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanism
of electron transfer through sigma bonded systems. Feasibility of efficient
electron-transfer through strained sigma-bonds, carbon-tin sigma bonds, and
nonbonding p-atomic orbitals aligned for sigma type overlap will be explored.
Prediction of sigma aromaticity will also be tested. A number of unique
compounds will be synthesized to demonstrate the concepts proposed.
Understanding how electrons are transported along hydrocarbon chains is
important to both materials and biological processes. These results may provide
a novel basis for designing electrically conducting materials in which sigma
orbitals and nonbonding sigma systems are the basis for conduction rather than
the well-established conduction through pi-orbitals. This project will provide
experimental results which are needed to substantiate theoretical models.
