This award will support Professor Lanny D. Schmidt of the University of
Minnesota in a research collaboration with Professor Miguel Jose Yacaman of the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico. The
researchers intend to establish on a more formal basis an ongoing program on
heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, they plan to prepare catalysts,
characterize their reactivity in different atmospheres, and determine how micro-
structure affects reactivity. Attention will be directed at Rh-Ce catalyst
particles in the NO+CO reaction and Pt-Sn particles in hydrocarbon
hydrogenolysis and isomerization. These systems are used as automotive pollution
catalysts and petroleum refining catalysts, respectively and are therefore of
great importance to both the U.S. and Mexico. This award will help to promote
the exchange of students, senior personnel, catalyst samples, and TEM
micrographics between both institutions. The group at the University of
Minnesota has been primarily interested in the relation of structure and
reactivity while the UNAM group will contribute their expertise in micro-
structure characterization.
