This research is concerned with fundamental problems involving the growth and
characterization of thin heteroepitaxial germanium films on crystalline silicon
substrates with a (100) orientation which exhibits a 2 x 1 surface
reconstruction. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have given support
for dramatic changes in the electronic band structure of germanium/silicon
systems resulting from changing the strain and superlattice composition on an
atomic scale. This group has found evidence for pseudomorphic domains in
germanium films on silicon grown at room temperature. It is now proposed to
investigate the structure of thin germanium films on silicon grown at low
temperatures and also as a function of temperature. This work involves a unique
combination of analytic techniques: transmission ion channeling, scanning
tunneling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Auger electron
spectroscopy. A second emphasis will involve the surface chemistry of adatoms on
strained germanium. It is hoped one can distinguish the seperate roles played by
chemistry, geometry, and strain in determining the bonding site of the adatom.
Initially tin and sulfur will be employed as adatoms.
