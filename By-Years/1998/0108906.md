What are the effects of money in state supreme court elections? Do these effects
vary across selection systems and type of elections (incumbent-challenger versus
open seat, primaries versus general)? Despite the fact that no area of political
science has received greater attention than the study of elections, judicial
elections, the means by which the most judges in the United States attain their
positions, have been virtually ignored. This doctoral dissertation
systematically analyzes and answers two central questions: 1) who contributes to
state supreme court candidates, how much do they give, and to whom do they give?
and 2) how do campaign contributions and expenditures affect the outcomes of
state supreme court elections? The researcher examines these questions using all
contested elections for state supreme courts between 1990-1995 in all states
that require candidates for judicial office to file campaign finance reports.
The researcher combines data to be collected for this project on campaign
contributions and expenditures with a database on state supreme court elections
collected by Melinda Gann Hall (SES- 9911166) and Paul Brace (SES- 9911082).
This dissertation will not only answer the question of whether money affects
state supreme court elections, but also how and under what circumstances.
Further, by comparing the influence of money in state supreme court elections to
elections for other offices as well as comparing partisan elections to
nonpartisan elections and retention elections, this dissertation will enable us
to gain a more complete picture of the factors influencing the electoral
process.
