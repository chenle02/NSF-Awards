The objective of this research is explore the nanostructural and electrical
properties of the near 2 nanometer (~2 nm)-thick interface layer that is formed
between the 5 nm-thick metal oxide film and the silicon substrate when a nano-
size device is prepared. The approach is to experimentally investigate 1) the
influence of the dopant on the interface properties, 2) the above interface with
the existence of a pre-deposited 5A TaNx interface layer, and 3) the
relationship between the interface material properties with the nano device's
electrical behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this research is
critical to the improvement of people's daily lives through the advancement of
manufacturing capability of high-tech products and introduction of new products.
This project also supplies graduate and undergraduate students with milti-
disciplinary education, which increases the country's production competition
capability. Research results will benefit the scientific and engineering
communities. &lt;br/&gt;
