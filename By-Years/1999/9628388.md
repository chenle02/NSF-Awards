9628388 McKenna Support is sought for the acquisition and installation of
controlled environment growth chambers in the biology department greenhouse. The
addition of these chambers will significantly increase research capabilities in
plant science, aid in recruitment of talented undergraduates, graduate students
and new faculty, and provide a facility that can support precollege outreach
programs designed to increase the entry of minority students in science careers.
The installation of controlled environment chambers will extend and enhance
ongoing research in the areas of plant anatomy and development,
phytoremediation, plant ecophysiology, plant ecology, plant systematics,
mycology, plant molecular biology and genetics. The facility will allow the
institution to maintain experimental plant populations over long periods,
maintain clones or plant families for genetic experiments, grow source material
for cellular and molecular experiments including tissue culture, DNA analysis,
and phytoremediation, maintain plants for systematic study, and design
experiments under controlled environmental conditions to study cellular,
physiological or ecological processes.
