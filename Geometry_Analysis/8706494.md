James Isenberg will apply the methods of modern geometrical analysis to examine
certain questions arising in the study of gravitational and other fields in
spacetime. The techniques to be applied will arise from Lie group theory,
symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and the theory of elliptic and
hyperbolic partial differential equations. Amongst the questions to be studied
are 1) Is it true that all spacetimes which satisfy Einstein's equations and are
extendible across a compact Cauchy horizon must contain Killing vector fields?
2) Can the class of spatially homogeneous solutions of the Einstein Yang-Mills
equations be treated as a finite dimensional dynamical system? 3) Can the
behavior of constant mean curvature surfaces or hypersurfaces be systematically
analyzed near singular regions in the ambient manifold?
