9700401 Hsu At low load, reinforced concrete without cracks behaves as an
elastic, isotropic material and its behavior is governed by two material
constants: the Young's modulus E and the Poisson ration v. At service load,
however, a moderate amount of cracking is expected and acceptable. Such cracking
transforms reinforced concrete into a nonlinear, non-isotropic material. The
biaxial behavior of post cracking membrane elements are governed by three moduli
and two Poisson ratios of concrete to be determined experimentally. The research
agenda also includes the development of a finite element program to predict the
behavior of shear walls. This program can be used to verify the functional
applicability of the five proposed mechanical properties.
