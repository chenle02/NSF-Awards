9423465 McKinney The project is a study of the evolutionary relationships among
dabbling ducks of the genus Anas using molecular mDNA sequence data. The
molecular phylogeny will be compared with morphologic estimates of phylogeny.
The evolution of behavioral and plumage characters will then be mapped onto the
tree and used to test hypotheses of the evolution of breeding behavior, parental
care strategies, plumage variation and courtship displays. %%% The study is
significant in providing a phylogenetic framework from which to address broader
questions about the evolution of behavior and the ecology of this group of
ducks. ***
