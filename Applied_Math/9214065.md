The PI will direct his doctoral student, J. J. Cao in a project involving
asymptotic series analysis in solid mechanics and an analysis of the von Karman
plate equations. Furthermore, the techniques will be adapted to study problems
in fluid mechanics and compressible fluid flow. Some of the more intricate
algebraic manipulations will be performed on computers using symbolic computer
algebra software.
