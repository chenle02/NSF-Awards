The goal of this project is to design and implement block-based neural networks
(BbNNs), an evolvable neural network model suitable for dynamic environments. A
BbNN consists of a 2-D array of basic neural network blocks with 4 variable
input/output nodes. Each node can be either an input or an output depending on
the structure represented by the signal flow. A basic block can have different
internal configurations according to the number of input and output nodes. The
structure and connection weights of the BbNN can be encoded as a binary string
in a chromosome. Such binary representation of the BbNN enables simultaneous
optimization of network structure and connections weights using evolutionary
algorithms. Genetic algorithms find a near optimal structure/weight setting
among many possible choices of structure and weight combinations. Chromosomes,
or candidate solutions, can be directly converted to configuration bit strings
of reconfigurable digital hardware as field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs)
for hardware implementation of BbNNs.

Unlike conventional neural network models, BbNNs contain small-sized
reconfigurable neural networks as a building block. The highly regular structure
of the BbNNs enables effective representation of network structure and
connection weights using the signal flow. The signal flow representation enables
simultaneous optimization of structure and weights through the use of
evolutionary algorithms. Incorporating evolutionary optimization and modularity
into neural networks will bring highly adaptive systems to dynamic environments.
It will generate chips which learn themselves how to rewrite themselves for
optimal performance in whatever task then are applied to.

Broader impact: Evolving block-based neural networks may find applications in
areas like pattern recognition, robot navigation, adaptive signal processing,
control, and exploration. With their inherently modular structure, BbNNs can be
easily expanded to handle large-scale problems.
