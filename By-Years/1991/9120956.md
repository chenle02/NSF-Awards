A genetic approach to the investigation of the regulation and function of
calcium channels is expected to increase our understanding of regulation of
intracellular calcium ion that is essential for the normal functioning of the
brain, muscle and secretion of hormones. At the present time, the mechanisms
that control whether these channels are open, allowing calcium to be moved
across the membrane, or closed are largely unknown. By selectively destroying
one component (beta subunit) of the proteins that make up the structure of the
channel the function of the channel can be determined directly from
electrophysiological or chemical studies of the movement of calcium into cells.
These experiments will be done using cells in culture. Genetically altered mice
will be produced that lack this protein. These experiments will extend the
results obtained in tissue culture to allow the determination of the role of
this protein in normal growth and development of the mouse. Understanding how
calcium channels are controlled will provide valuable insight into their role in
normal brain and muscle function.
