The main goal of this project is to increase our understanding of what is

decidable and definable existentially in the language of rings. More
specifically, we concentrate on issues of existential/Diophantine definability
that have evolved from the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem. The main open
problems in the area concern the existential decidability of rational numbers
and rings of algebraic integers of number fields. New methods involving elliptic
curves have shown promise in making these problems more approachable. We also
investigate existential definability over function fields. In the case of
function fields of characteristic 0 we also look at first-order definability
problems since the corresponding existential definability problems seem out of
reach at the moment.





The interest in the questions of Diophantine definability and decidability dates
back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP). At the
beginning of the XX century Hilbert asked the following question (among others):
is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial
equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer
solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matijasevich, building on the work by
Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that Diophantine sets and
computably enumerable sets of integers were the same and thus showed that an
algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matijasevich's result immediately
raised another question which proved to be even more vexing: is there an
algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers? This
problem is unsolved to this day. As is often the case with difficult problems in
Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the
rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions, quite
interesting on their own, which the author of this proposal plans to
investigate. Some of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory
or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences
in Logic. The expectations are that questions originating in HTP will generate
many new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and
Logic.
