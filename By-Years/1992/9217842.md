This award supports a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to examine
exposures of laminated sediments in Laguna Paron, Peru. This sediment section
may provide a unique opportunity to develop a high-resolution paleoclimate
record from the central Andes that will compliment the ice-core record from the
region. The sediments were deposited in a proglacial delta environment. Initial
radiocarbon dates of wood indicate the sediments were deposited during the
Little Ice Age. It is anticipated that the sediments will record glacial melt
and runoff, whereas the ice cores primarily record glacial accumulation, thus
the records in tandem will give a complete seasonal signal of paleoclimate. The
exposures are now at risk of being lost because the lake level, which was
artificially lowered in 1985, is being raised again. The initial lowering of the
lake level produced downcutting in the delta and the first subaerial exposure of
these sections.
