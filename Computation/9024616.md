The principal investigators plan to develop three courses during the period of
the award. The courses are designed to interest students in aspects of
Scientific Computation through computer algebra, numerical bifurcation, and
partial differential equations. The students holding fellowships will have
various educational tasks, such as writing up clear lecture notes and assignment
solutions, software testing, maintenance and consultation. They will also run a
weekly tutorial for lectures and demonstrations concerning the use of software
for applications in the courses. The three courses will be loosely coordinated
through a weekly seminar, in which the principal investigators, and later the
students, will give presentations on topics of common interest, and will lead
discussion. The award recommendation is for a one-time contribution to equipment
and student support for this laudable activity, consistent with the gold of High
Performance Computing and Communications.
