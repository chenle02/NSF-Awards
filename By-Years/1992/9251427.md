Metabolic, vision, and other ergonomics measurement equipment is being added to
the Ergonomics Laboratory of the Industrial Engineering program at Bradley
University to determine the physiological cost of work performed by humans. This
project facilitates the study of human factors in a state-of-the-art laboratory.
Students are able to investigate how to design jobs and workplaces to fit human
capabilities. The new equipment includes a computerized metabolic measurement
system for determining the physiological costs of physical work, a vision tester
for measurement of visual performance, a leg and arm ergometer for simulating
work performed by legs and arms, and a computerized digital goniometer to
measure joint angles and range of motion. Laboratory experiments are conducted
by the students as part of their course-work and through independent studies and
projects.
