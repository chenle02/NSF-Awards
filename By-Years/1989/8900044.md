The proposal requests funds to defray travel expenses for speakers at the 48th
Annual Symposium for the Society for Developmental Biology which will be held at
the University of California, Berkeley, Calif., June 18-21, 1989. The title of
the symposium is Genetics of Pattern Formation and Growth Control. Topics will
include; the establishment of polarity, the involvement of growth hormones and
oncogenes in early development, and the genetic control of lineage
determination, among others. %%% There has been enormous progress recently in
understanding genetic mechanisms active in controlling pattern formation during
embryonic development. This meeting brings together researchers working in a
wide variety of organisms that have been at the forefront of this progress. The
speakers have also been chosen as those able to present this work to the
somewhat more general audience of developmental biologists that attend this
meeting. It therefore serves a valuable educational purpose for the field.
