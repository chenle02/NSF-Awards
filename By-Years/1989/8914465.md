Theoretical and experimental research is to be conducted on the behavior of
drops, particles, and bubbles deformed and transported by the motion of an
embedding viscous fluid. The theoretical modeling effort is largely numerical
and includes the case of strong droplet or bubble deformation. The Reynolds
numbers of interest are such that inertial effects vary from weak to moderately
strong. Both viscous and viscoelastic fluids are to be considered. Specific
topics to be considered are drop formation and breakup, coalescence and particle
capture at a fluid interface, and motion and deformation of drops and bubbles
through an otherwise quiescent fluid.
