The objective is to predict the thermodynamic effects of the polarity of
supercritical fluid (SF) solvents on extraction selectivities and reaction rate
constants. The polarity of supercritical fluids is measured spectroscopically,
using dye probes that absorb in the UV-visible region. The strength of specific
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, is measured over a wide range in
pressure to identify highly selective pure and binary supercritical solvents.
The microscopic spectroscopic data will be used to interpret the selectivity
data for sterols and other solutes. The spectroscopic data obtained in this
project can be used to design highly selective mixed supercritical fluid
solvents for separation processes, and to evaluate potential new reaction
processes in supercritical fluids based on the thermodymanic solvent effect.
