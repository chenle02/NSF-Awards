Maize is the most important American crop today. Therefore, a thorough knowledge
of the function of maize genes is highly desirable. That knowledge can be gained
from maize functional genomics projects that use transposons to disrupt gene
function. In the present maize functional genomics project, a genetic resource
is being developed that will enable investigators to combine the power of the
mutational approach to define gene function with that of DNA sequencing to
define a gene's make-up. The resource consists of a comprehensive set of lines
based on transposons of the Ac/Ds family, which because of their transposition
pattern, will be useful to scientists interested in saturating specific regions
of the maize genome with transposon insertions. A set of 370 randomly generated
transgenic lines with active transposon 'launch pads' will be identified, from
which we expect to identify 124 transgenic lines that are equally spaced across
the genome. In this set most genes in the maize genome will be within 7 cM of a
launcing platform and, therefore realistic targets in localized transposon
mutagenesis experiments. The transposons have been engineered to greatly
facilitate the isolation of DNA sequences adjacent to transposed elements. The
simple genetic scheme to select for transpositions and the ease in isolation of
the adjacent sequences should make this resource particularly user-friendly. The
lines will be made freely available to the research community through the Maize
Genetics Stock Center in Urbana, IL. They will be deposited approximately once a
year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The ability for
researchers to do mutagenesis across the maize genome will enable gene discovery
and empower the corn research community.
