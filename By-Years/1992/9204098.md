This project will explore the dynamics of a small neural network. There are
three major aspects to the project: 1. modelling the neural network as a system
of nonlinear differential equations with explicit representation of ion channels
for each neuron within the network 2. experiments on the pyloric circuit of the
stomatogastric ganglion of spiny lobsters that will be used to provide input
data for parameter values of the models and to test predictions of the models 3.
mathematical research to develop algorithms that will lead to tools for the
explicit computation of geometric features within the models A mathematical
software package called dstool, developed at Cornell for the exploration of
dynamical systems, will be used, and will incorporate algorithmic advances into
this environment. The initial emphasis will be the pacemaker neuron within the
circuit. Guckenheimer will investigate how its response depends upon
multiparameter variations of its environment that come from application of
channel blockers and neuromodulators and from changes in extracellular ionic
concentrations. Data from previous studies of synaptic efficacy and their
dependencies upon amines will be used in modelling the interactions of neurons
within the network.
