In this project Soare will study computability theory, particularly relative
computability (Turing reducibility) of one set from another. The first objective
is to study computability on the computably enumerable sets, and to relate their
algebraic structure to the degree of information they encode and to the speed
with which they can be enumerated with respect to some measure of computational
complexity. Here attention is focused on the computably enumerable sets because
they are generated by an algorithm, and hence most easily approximated by a
computable function. The second objective is to study the relationship of
computability to other mathematical objects, for example to models of Peano
arithmetic, and to algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras, and models of
special theories like totally transcendental ones. For algebraic structures, the
general problem is to determine exactly what information can be coded into the
isomorphism type of that structure. The fundamental aim is to deepen our
understanding of computability and its relation to structures in mathematics and
computer science. In the 1930's various definitions of computable function were
proposed by Turing, Church, Kleene, Goedel, and others. They were soon proved
equivalent and they (particularly Turing's model) contributed during the war to
the development of high speed digital computers. These models can be restricted
with respect to computing resources such as time and space and give rise to
computational complexity, an important part of modern computer science.
Computability and algorithms now permeate many aspects of our lives. Modern
researchers in computability and complexity are heirs to the founders like
Turing and Goedel in that they are trying to classify the computable content of
modern mathematics.
