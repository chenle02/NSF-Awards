9526954 Willett The objective of this research is to construct an improved
orogenesis model and conduct numerical experiments that will reveal the nature
and strengths of feedback between tectonic deformation and surface processes in
evolving mountain belts. The experiments will be guided by a dataset of geologic
and topographic observations of active mountain belts, collected both from the
literature and digital elevation models. To accomplish this objective, two
extant surface-processes models (SPMs) will be synthesized, and a new model
constructed that accounts for orographic climate, chemical weathering, and
alpine glaciation. The macrogeomorphology and exhumation patterns of a few
carefully selected mountain belts will be predicted using the coupled model and
the results tested against observations. The ultimate outcome of this research
should be an improved underqtanding of the nature and strengths of feedback
between tectonic deformation and surface processes in evolving mountain belts.
