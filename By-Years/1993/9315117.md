9315117 Mischaikow This awards supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Konstantin Mischaikow, Center for Dynamical Systems and
Nonlinear Studies, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Professor Yasumasa
Nishiura, Department of Mathematics, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. The
objective of the project is to develop theoretical techniques for use in
dynamical systems by integrating analytical and topological methods, and then to
apply them to several problems arising from systems of reaction diffusion
equations. Two other Japanese researchers -- Hiroshi Kokubu of Kyoto University
and Hiroe Oka of Ryukoku University -- will also participate in the project.
During his visits to Japan, Professor Mischaikow will attempt to combine two
viewpoints of dynamics and bifurcation theory: an algebraic-topologic approach,
based primarily on the Conley index, which is his expertise, and an analytic
approach based on singular perturbation theory represented by the three Japanese
researchers. The long-range goal of the project is to use the information to
understand the appearance of complicated, possibly chaotic, dynamics in
specified dynamical systems generated by partial differential equations. Some
prototype models, new approaches, and preliminary results have already been
achieved through prior collaboration of the U.S. and Japanese research groups.
