The objective of this program is to create DNA single molecule junction devices
and measure their electromechanical properties under precise controls of a
number of variables applying the recent developed single molecule molecular
transport junction (MTJ) system. In combination of theory computation and
modeling, this project will elucidate the intrinsic transport mechanisms of
molecular structure-dependent conductance behaviors and gleaning important
conclusions regarding the enhancement and tuning of charge transport in single
DNA junction devices.

The intellectual merit is to develop a comprehensive approach that utilizes
electrical engineering, chemistry and physics in the development of DNA single
molecule junction devices and control and measure the variables, including DNA-
electrode contact and a rich variety of structures of DNA caused by bending,
orientations and water and counterions conditions, at the single molecular
level. AFM nanolithography and modified SPM-based MTJ technique will enable a
new measurement approach. The proposed work is expected to gain a detailed and
in-depth understanding of electronic transport in DNA single molecule junctions
and provide a major step towards the incorporation of DNA molecules as
functional elements in electronic devices.

The broader impacts are the participation of undergraduate, minority, and high
school students to research opportunities in the emerging interdisciplinary
fields through various recruiting programs to train the next generation
scientists and engineers. The measurement and understanding of electronic
transport through single DNA molecular devices under the native physiological
conditions relevant to the damage and mutation in DNA will have applications
ranging from electronic, biomedical, environmental to human health.
