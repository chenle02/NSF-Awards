This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program Announcement
NSF 86-81, Research Experience for Undergraduates, 1987. Under this award The
University of New Hampshire will provide ten undergraduate students with
training and support while they participate in ongoing research projects in the
University's Computer Science Department. The award recognizes the importance of
hands-on experience in active research for training undergraduates for careers
in mathematics, science and engineering, and that too few such experiences are
now available. The University recruited some of the students from other
institutions, in order to broaden the base for attracting students to scientific
careers.
