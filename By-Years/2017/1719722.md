Cyberbullying is the most common online risk for adolescents, yet the majority
of young people who are bullied online do not tell their parents when it occurs.
The goal of the BullyBlocker project is to advance the understanding of how
cyberbullying, in particular, and behavioral issues, more broadly, can be
effectively identified on social networking sites. This interdisciplinary
project integrates advances in computer sciences and key findings from
psychological research on cyberbullying to (i) design and implement models for
identifying cyberbullying on social networking platforms, and (ii) study usage
patterns of automated tools based on these models and their utility for devising
and testing new hypotheses about cyberbullying risk factors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project stems from its
synergistic integration of computer and psychological science to address a
social problem that negatively impacts adolescents, their families, and society.
The project draws on psychological research on cyberbullying risk factors and
advances in computer science to enable the development of automated
identification models and the integration of these models into an app
(BullyBlocker) that notifies parents about their adolescents' risk of
cyberbullying. The project also entails the design of mechanisms to generate
customized anti-bullying resources for parents and victims, investigation of app
usage patterns and parents' attitudes towards automated identification tools,
the use of automated tools such as BullyBlocker to devise and test new
hypotheses about cyberbullying, and a unique training opportunity that provides
graduate and undergraduate students with the scientific scaffolding to develop
into recognized interdisciplinary scholars.
