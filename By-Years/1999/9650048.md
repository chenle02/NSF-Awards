The Department of Statistics is committed to the utilization of appropriate
technology to increase the learning experience of students. The present
initiative is aimed toward the Statistics 100 (STAT100) course, a general
education course. The primary goal of STAT100 is to enhance students'
capabilities as intelligent consumers of quantitative information. The essential
concepts of statistics are emphasized rather than a variety of statistical
techniques. The students tend to be bright but not technologically oriented,
coming from more than 100 different majors. Most are freshmen or sophomores, and
about two-thirds are women. The enrollment has grown rapidly in the past several
years and is currently at about 400 students per semester. For several years, an
innovative and extremely easy-to-use computer program, developed in the
department, has been used in one-fourth to one-half of the classes to increase
students' hands-on involvement with statistical data and with statistical and
probabilistic experiments. This project makes possible on-line communication
between students and the instructor, and among students themselves, and provides
opportunities for on-line assignments, quizzes, projects, etc. In order to bring
the advantages of the statistical and conferencing software to all of the
sections of STAT100, the department is enhancing its undergraduate computer
laboratory. Previously, there have been only eight computers that could be
utilized for this project, four of which are only marginally effective. Through
this latest enhancement, the number of useful PCs is being increased to 25.
