This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in applied
mathematics and marine environment. The investigators are Fabio Milner of Purdue
University, Michel Langlais of the University of Bordeaux, and Patrick Silan of
the University of Montpellier. The objective of their research is to develop
host-parasite models in a marine environment. Initially they will model the
dynamics of host-parasite systems with hologenic cycle and study their
qualitative and quantitative mathematical properties and their biological and
ecological consequences. They will perform simulations to validate these models
by comparing their results with experimental data. The biological model serving
as the basis for this work is the sea bass. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration considerable mathematical skills and computational resources.
These are complemented by the multidisciplinary expertise of the French
investigators (biology and mathematics) and access to marine facilities and
real-life data offered by the French. The proposed model will advance research
on other models for interacting populations both in land and marine
environments.
