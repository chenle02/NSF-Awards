The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research is acquiring state-of-the
art seismic and ice radar equipment with integrated portable computers for
undergraduates to coduct research work will be conducted on the Juneau Icefield,
Alaska. Undergraduates are determining sidewall effects of ice radar and
gathering more accurate ice depth data. Eighteen cross glacier profiles are
being analyzed for ice volume interpretations. These and allied student projects
are uncovering trends in meteorological and mass balance changes, and obtaining
measurements of radiation energy controlling glacier ablation and affecting the
runoff of supraglacial streams.
