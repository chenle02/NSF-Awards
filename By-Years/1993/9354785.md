9354785 Schneider The New Science Project will change the way Grinnell College
teaches introductory science in biology chemistry, mathematics, physics, and
psychology. This program responds to the barriers that traditionally discourage
the successful pursuit of science by students belonging to underrepresented
groups in science. The New Science Project will serve other colleges and
universities by 1) offering a student-center approach to the problem of under-
representation in science and 2) providing an example of long-term, division-
wide curricular reform, based on encouraging and building on individual teaching
experiments. Nationally, introductory science and mathematics courses need
prompt and serious attention to maintain their productivity of future
scientists, engineers and mathematicians overall, and to entice new students
from traditionally under-represented groups into these fields. With faculty
release time from this grant, Grinnell College will develop a coordinated series
of new, interactive courses in a highly experimental fashion to determine what
course structures most effectively make introductory science accessible to all
populations, and the engaging starting point to science and mathematics that it
should be. We will encourage a variety of models, some as add-on workshops, some
as complete course revisions, so that we can make useful comparisons of
different techniques in the same college environment.
