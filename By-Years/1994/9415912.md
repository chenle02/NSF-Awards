This award will support U.S.-France cooperation in cultural sociology between
Michele Lamont of Princeton University and Laurent Thevenot, Director of the
Political and Cultural Sociology Group of the French National Center for
Scientific Research. They propose to hold research workshops to examine the
principles used in the two cultures to define and assess social matters ranging
from status and friendship to literature and politics. They have identified
seven major topics and matched U.S. and French participants, including 6
advanced graduate students who will conduct research in France related to their
dissertations. The proposal takes advantage of expertise in France and the U.S.
in sociology. It offers a unique opportunity to conduct systematic cross-
national comparisons. It will advance our understanding of theoretical
underpinning of cultural sociology by combining the different approaches of
American and French social sciences.
