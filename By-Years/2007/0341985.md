The goals of this project are to support education and engineering faculty and
students as they work within the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program to explore
synergistic relationships and to develop prototypes for educational products; to
develop the architecture and web-based instructional materials for fundamentals
in engineering mathematics, high school mathematics, and technology education;
to test the concept of a dynamic multilevel web-based instructional system; and
to bring together education and engineering faculty interested in improving
teaching and learning through collaboration. The outcomes include a web-based
delivery system for first-year university mathematics instruction, the
development of prototype instructional materials for K-12 and undergraduate
engineering education, and the active development of an interdisciplinary
faculty research team to implement this project and to seek subsequent support
for major collaborative initiatives.
