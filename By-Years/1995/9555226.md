The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University is in downtown Brooklyn and serves
mostly commuting students who live in the area. Nearly all undergraduates are
first generation college students; 59% are of African-American and Hispanic
origin; and 70% are women. Many are unprepared to succeed in the sciences. Our
project is to redesign the introductory level physics course taken by most of
the non- science majors, a population that includes a large number of education
majors who are teachers in the New York Metropolitan area. The course will
utilize current methodologies that support student-centered learning journal
writing, ethnography, collaborative learning, and study skills. The project will
have these objectives: 1) preparation of material for a student-centered, active
learning course; 2) preparation of faculty to teach the course; and 3)
enhancement of students' academic and personal self-confidence as future
scientists, educators, and citizens. The course is being developed with the
participation of NYC Alliance, an NSF-funded Alliance for Minority Participation
(CAMP) Program. It will be disseminated to serve as a model and resource for
other colleges.
