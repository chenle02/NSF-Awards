Theoretical calculations of coalescing compact binaries (mergers of two neutron
stars or a neutron star and a black hole) will be performed using 3-D
hydrodynamic techniques on parallel supercomputers. These calculations will
include, for the first time ever, a complete treatment of all lowest-order post-
Newtonian effects (i.e., the most important corrections to Newtonian gravity
imposed by Einstein's general theory of relativity). In particular, the
dissipative effects due to the emission of gravitational waves will be included
in the hydrodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These calculations will provide us
with a much more accurate description of the binary coalescence process,
including more accurate theoretical predictions for the gravitational radiation
signals that may soon become detectable by laser interferometer detectors such
as LIGO. They will also help us understand the mechanisms that may be important
for producing the most powerful gamma-ray bursts observed by astronomers
throughout the visible Universe.&lt;br/&gt;
