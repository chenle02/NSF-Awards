This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the "Conference in Geometry, Analysis, and Probability" that will be held May
8-12, 2017, at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) in Seoul, South
Korea. For additional information see the conference website:
http://newton.kias.re.kr/~namgyu/index.html/PJ2017/ .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
overarching theme of this conference is the exploration of the relationship
between analytic objects (e.g., analytic capacity, harmonic measure) and
geometric concepts (e.g., rectifiability, Hausdorff dimension). The long list of
speakers includes the names of a host of the world's leading researchers in
harmonic analysis, complex analysis, geometric measure theory, and geometric
combinatorics. The program provides ample opportunity for early-career
mathematicians to present their work.
