The investigator will study the relationship between the prime ideals of a Hopf
crossed product and the prime ideals of the underlying algebra on which the Hopf
algebra acts. A more general problem is to compare the primes in a Hopf Galois
extension; such extensions include some well-known extensions of quantum groups.
Finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras and their representations will also
be considered, in particular questions on the Schur indicator of an irreducible
representation, as well as other invariants of the representation. Finally some
problems about generalized Lie algebras will be studied, such as when can they
be twisted via a Hopf cocycle to an ordinary Lie superalgebra. These generalized
Lie algebras are Lie algebras in the category of comodules over a cotriangular
Hopf algebra, and include, for example, Lie color algebras, the case when the
Hopf algebra is a group algebra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is desirable in many
areas of mathematics to try to classify certain objects,or at least to know
enough about them to distinguish them from similar objects. Thus one tries to
attach "invariants" to these objects. Hopf algebras appear as such invariants
both in mathematical physics (in areas such as conformal field theory) and in
several areas of mathematics itself (such as studying knots in geometry). Thus
to describe these structures, it would be useful to understand Hopf algebras
better and to begin to classify them, as well as to understand how Hopf algebras
act on other objects. Moreover within algebra itself, Hopf algebras provide a
unifying framework for other algebraic objects, such as groups, Lie algebras,
and their recent generalizations coming from quantum mechanics. Thus studying
them should give new insights within algebra as well.&lt;br/&gt;
