The IUTAM symposium on The Mechanics of Fluidized Beds will be organized by Drs.
G. M. Homsy and G. K. Batchelor at Stanford University in July 1-5, 1991. The
topics of the meeting will be the mechanics of suspensions, fluidized beds,
granular media, and fluid-particle systems in general. The purpose is to provide
an opportunity for engineers, applied mathematician, and applied scientists to
meet and discuss the advances in understanding two-phase fluid-particle systems,
as well as to identify unsolved problems and future trends. About 50
participants are expected to attend. There will be six invited lectures. The
proposed symposium will provide a forum to evaluate the present research on
fluidizing fluid-particle systems and discuss future trends. The meeting will
bring together several of the best researches in the field from USA, Canada and
Europe.
