Recent work from deep sea (Ocean Drilling Project) records around the Antarctic
continent has shown that there were one or more brief, extremely warm,
paleoclimatic events in the Pliocene. This award supports a micropaleontological
study of the deep sea sediment record from the South Ocean to identify Pliocene
warm events in the southern high latitudes. Using microfossil assemblages
(diatoms and coccoliths) the work will determine the temporal and spatial extent
of these warm episodes and estimate the summer temperature for such time
intervals.
