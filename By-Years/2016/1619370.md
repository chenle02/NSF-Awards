With the spread of Internet and mobile devices, transferring information
robustly, safely and securely has become more important&lt;br/&gt;than ever.
Computer hardware associated with such operations performs sophisticated
arithmetic computations, which requires careful, custom design of such circuits.
Custom design raises the potential for bugs in the circuits, compromising their
security. Verification of the correctness of such circuits is an imperative.
However, their arithmetic nature makes them notoriously hard to verify, and
contemporary algorithms lack the wherewithal to address this problem.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the application of computational
algebra, Groebner basis techniques, to formally verify circuits for such
applications. In particular, the project analyzes the use of the circuit itself
as the underlying data-structure to perform Groebner basis computations and
verification. By using logic synthesis as a bridge to connect computational
algebra algorithms with circuit design, the project addresses the challenge and
scalability of hardware verification. The project impacts computer-aided
verification technology, secure system design, and it advances knowledge and
application in mathematics as well as computer engineering. Validation of
hardware for cyber-security also protects the privacy and security of data,
which has a direct impact on our society.
