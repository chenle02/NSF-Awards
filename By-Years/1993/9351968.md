Optoelectronics and optics are becoming an integral part of current electrical
engineering, as optical solutions are being used for everything from compact
disc players and laser printers to neural networks, satellite communications,
and machining. On the whole, however, undergraduates in electrical engineering
receive little exposure to principles and practical applications of optical
devices and systems. This project involves an undergraduate optics laboratory in
which students can learn about a variety of subjects pertinent to contemporary
optical engineering within electrical engineering. Eight individual laboratory
projects covering a broad spectrum of key topics, including fiber optics,
semiconductor optoelectronic devices, electro-optic and acousto-optic
modulation, lasers, liquid crystals, and detection are planned. Students will
become proficient in the use and application of such important optical devices
and instruments as lasers, optical fibers, monochromators, detection systems,
state-of-the-art modulators and photodetectors. An important feature of the
laboratory course is the inclusion of a strong design element. It should also be
noted that significant emphasis is placed on laboratory safety procedures. A
laboratory manual will be published and serve as a prototype for similar
educational laboratories at other universities.
