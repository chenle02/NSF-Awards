This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use a Homolog of
Expansin Domain-2 protein to enhance cellulose performance in large-scale
biomass digestion into sugars for biofuel projection. Due to the economics,
politics and environmental impacts of reliance on petroleum-based fuel, there is
growing interest in using biofuel. Cellulosic biomass provides a readily-
available, high-volume feedstock for biofuel production. Successful completion
of the objectives will optimize unpurified ZM3 for use as a cellulose synergist
in scaled-up conditions for commercialization purposes.

Broader impacts associated with developing strategies to decrease the costs and
improve the efficiency of the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass
include numerous societal benefits resulting from reduction of petroleum use.
Conversion of cell wall biomass from renewable forestry and agricultural
feedstocks into biofuels enables the efficient use of waste materials. From an
environmental standpoint, the widespread use of cellulose-based biofuel as an
alternative renewable energy source could substantially reduce greenhouse gas
emissions due to the ability of plants to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.
