This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of surface chemical and kinetic studies of molecular
transformations at single crystal surfaces. Professor Cynthia Friend of Harvard
University will study the adsorption kinetics of alcohol and thiol molecules at
rhodium single crystal surfaces. The understanding of this chemistry will
advance the study of poisoning on catalyst surfaces. The study of oxidation and
sulfidation of surfaces from organometallic surface chemistry allows
understanding of these surfaces for adhesion and corrosion protection. Thiolate
and alkoxide intermediate adsorption structure and kinetics will be studied
using synchrotron radiation, photoemission and vibrational spectroscopies, in
concert with temperature programmed desorption. The effects of coverage induced
changes in adsorbate structure and desorption kinetics will be followed. The
importance of the oxygen and sulfur heteroatom in C-O (S) linkages, vis a vis
the Rh-O (S) bond strength will be investigated. Kinetically important
intermediates will be investigated. Taken together, these studies will impact
broadly on active metal surface chemistry applied to complex organic molecular
adsorbates.
