This action will provide funds for one faculty and one graduate student to
continue a search for exotically charged particles in the highest energy
particle collisions available. The experimenters use highly sensitive etchable
solid state track detectors for the search of Dirac monopoles and other highly
ionizing particles--magnetic charge may also be identified by its acceleration
in the magnetic field of a spectrometer drift chamber. The project includes the
continuation of two existing searches: one at TRISTAN (KEK Japan) and the other
at the D- Zero area of the Tevatron (Fermilab). One new search at LEP (CERN) in
collaboration with OPAL is an extension of the others in that it is occurring at
the highest e+e- annihilations energy available. Although current theories on
grand unification predict magnetic monopole masses well above any accessible at
accelerators, such a search should still be carried out as experimental checks
whenever better limits can be set at higher accelerator energies.
