In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Geoffrey Strouse and Albert
Stiegman of Florida State University will develop oxygen atom transfer agents
that absorb microwave radiation. With the help of computational methods the PIs
will estimate the microwave absorption cross section for a range of compounds,
and then prepare and examine them in test chemical reactions. Promising reagents
will then be used in the synthesis of metal oxide nanophase materials, and for
this project the PIs will target zirconium oxide, zinc oxide and gallium oxide.
This method could potentially enable unprecedented control over nanocrystal
growth that would have transformative impacts on nanomaterials related
applications. The PIs will also continue to promote research experiences for
undergraduate students and will bring high school students to his laboratory to
gain research experience as interns.
