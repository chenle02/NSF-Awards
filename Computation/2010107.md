This project concerns algorithm design and analysis of efficient, highly
accurate numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. Such
equations are used in simulation of systems arising in diverse application
fields such as aerospace engineering, semi-conductor device design,
astrophysics, and biology. Even with today's fast computers, efficient
computational solution of partial differential equations remains a challenge,
and it is essential to design improved algorithms that can be used to obtain
accurate solutions in these application models. The research aims to produce a
suite of powerful computational tools suitable for computer simulations of the
complicated solution structure in these applications. The project provides
training for a graduate student through involvement in the research.

This project conducts research in algorithm development, analysis, and
application of high order numerical methods, including discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) finite element methods and finite difference and finite volume weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, for solving linear and nonlinear
convection-dominated partial differential equations, emphasizing scheme
robustness, efficiency, and the treatment of stochastic effects. The project
focuses on algorithm development and analysis. Topics of investigation include a
new class of multi-resolution WENO schemes with increasingly higher order of
accuracy, an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for high-order numerical boundary
conditions for finite difference schemes on Cartesian meshes solving problems in
general geometry, efficient and stable time-stepping techniques for DG schemes
and other spatial discretizations, high order accurate bound-preserving schemes
and applications, entropy stable DG methods, optimal convergence and
superconvergence analysis of DG methods, numerical solutions of stochastic
differential equations, and the study of modeling, analysis, and simulation for
traffic flow and air pollution. Applications motivate the design of new
algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematical tools will be
used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and
limitations and to enhance their accuracy, stability, and robustness; and
collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists will enable the
efficient application of these new algorithms.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
