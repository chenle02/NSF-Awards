This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Retrieving novel bacterial genes
involved in aromatic compound degradation from natural environments using
Acinetobacter as a host." Many naturally-occurring aromatic compounds are broken
down by microbes via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. This research manipulates the
genetic system of a naturally transformable soil bacterium and uses it as a
vehicle for understanding the versatility and diversity of this ecologically
important pathway in uncultivated natural bacterial assemblages.
