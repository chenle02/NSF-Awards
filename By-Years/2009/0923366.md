This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award to the Biology department at the University of Virginia a
bioluminescence/biofluorescence imaging system will be acquired to study
molecular signals associated with daily time keeping mechanisms. The instrument
will be used for experiments aimed at gaining a better understanding of the
internal circadian clocks that allow animals to anticipate daily changes in
their environment and to organize a multitude of bodily functions in an
optimized daily schedule. The new imaging system optimally visualizes
bioluminescent signals produced by clock-controlled expression of luciferase
reporter genes in combination with fluorescent signals produced by additional
reporter genes that act as markers for specific cell types or biological
activities. With the new technology it will be possible to image cell-type
specific circadian gene expression at single cell resolution. The proposed
experiments will focus on the cellular and network properties of circadian clock
function in fruit fly and rodent model systems. These research activities will
strongly stimulate the research programs of the (Co-)PIs as well as help in the
recruitment and training of researchers and students to the University of
Virginia. The instrument and planned research activities will be prominently
featured in several undergraduate courses. In addition, existing affiliations
will be used to also incorporate training and outreach at the K-12 level.
Participating researchers and students will not only be involved in projects at
the cutting edge of chronobiological research and imaging technology, but also
receive invaluable training in microscopy and data analysis techniques that will
be an asset to them throughout their scientific or professional careers.
