Fertilization self-incompatibility is an important characteristic of plants
and, at least in a commercial sense, a desirable characteristic. In its simplest
form, the specificity of self-incompatibility is determined by a single genetic
locus, the S locus. The male and female parts of the plant must carry the same
allele of the S-locus for self- incompatibility to occur. In Nicotiana alata,
the protein encoded by the S-locus has been shown to be a glycoprotein and
evidence suggests that the glycosyl moity may play an important role in the
self-incompatibility event. Dr. Paul Ebert, in the laboratory of Dr. A. Clarke
at the University of Melbourne will study this biological phenomenon with the
goal of understanding the molecular events which occur and the resulting
consequences. He will do a biochemical characterization of the glycoproteins and
a cytological study to determine their site(s) and mode of action. This is a
biological problem of significant fundamental interest and one which is poorly
understood at the molecular level. Moreover, the economic ramifications of
understanding the basis of self-incompatibility of plants are immense since
optimal production of many economically important plants depends upon this
phenomonum.
