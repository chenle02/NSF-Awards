The science literacy needs of future teachers and other non-science majors are
being addressed through implementation of a multi-site college level
interdisciplinary science course sequence based on the National Science
Education Standards and focused on real-life issues. Instructional capacity is
also being addressed through faculty professional development and curriculum
materials upgrades involving faculty from five institutions (University of South
Florida, Hillsborough Community College, Manatee Community College and St.
Petersburg College from Florida and Fairmont State College in West Virginia).
Project direct outcomes include a network of 15-25 prepared instructors, 10-12
upgraded modules (beta versions), and measures of improved science literacy of
the target student population, a diverse population of college students
including those preparing to be teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: Faculty in the program are introduced to recent literature on learning
and practice these strategies through the implementation of the "Science That
Matters" courses and curricular material. Faculty reflection and feedback is
used to improve instruction and the curricular materials. Measures of student
outcomes included Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT), The ACT's Collegiate
Assessment of Academic Progress (CAAP), a project developed writing assessment
measuring intellectual progress, and faculty assessment of student learning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project provides a model two course
sequence and curricular materials for achieving science literacy among non
science majors/future elementary school teachers. Implementation at diverse
institutions and among diverse student populations provides valuable guidance
for implementation around the nation and for continuing improvements to
materials. The modular curricular materials and the evaluation instruments are
broadly applicable and useful to a diverse audience.
