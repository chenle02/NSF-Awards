This investigation will continue the field, petrological, and geochemical study
of the early Paleozoic granitic rocks and matamorphic rocks which constitute the
basement of the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. The objectives of this
study are 1) to understand the petrogenesis of the granitic rocks as a well
exposed example of the worldwide early Paleozoic orogenic event, 2) to determine
the age and origin of the Precambrian pre-batholithic basement terranes, 3) to
reconstruct the early Paleozoic evolution of the Antarctic continental margin
and to integrate it into the evolution of other parts of Gondwana. The methods
being employed are field mapping and sampling, petrography, major and trace
element geochemistry, and high precision isotopic analyses of Nd, Sr, O, and Pb.
The proposed study is a continuation of a systematic study of the basement of
the Transantarctic Mountains that has been carried out previously. The central
Transarctic Mountains contain early Paleozoic batholiths intruded into
geosynclinal metasedimentary rocks and Precambrian crystalline basement. The
area is of considerable interest because it is one of the largest exposures of
an early Paleozoic continental margin orogenic belt that has not been affected
by later metamorphic or plutonic events.
