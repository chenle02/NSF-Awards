This project is exploring the vector implementation of speech algorithms on the
torrent processor, which was developed under previous NSF support. Torrent is
specialized for the low-precision digital signal processing that arises in
speech recognition; it combines multiple fixed-point datapaths, a high bandwidth
memory system, and a high-speed RISC general-purpose controller. Algorithms for
the computationally intensive tasks of speech recognition, including acoustic
probability estimation, feature extraction, lexical search, and evaluation of
grammatical probabilities, are being vectorized and implemented on Torrent
processor. The system will be demonstrated using a 2000-word natural speech
recognition task that will run using a free-standing microphone in a noisy
environment.
