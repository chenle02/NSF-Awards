Opportunities for 12 undergraduate students are provided to perform research in
a broad range of mechanical engineering during one of two 12-week summer
periods. During the summer of 1987 a pilot group of students are involved;
during the summer of 1988 a larger group takes part. The research subject areas
include: design, control theory, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, applied
mechanics of composite materials, and manufacturing processes.
