This research is concerned with the analysis of the time evolution of random
surfaces. Special emphasis will be placed on the computer algorithms needed to
implement simulations of the mathematical models. The understanding of the
motion of interfaces and boundary surfaces is of great importance for many
industrial processes (image analysis, crystal growth, thin films, crack
nucleation, etc.) The motivation for this research came originally from the
denoising and enhancement of still images and videos. For this reason, the
efforts will concentrate on the two and three dimensional cases. Very little
attention has been given so far to stochastic versions of such problems, even
though they are believed to offer a more realistic alternative that
deterministic approaches. Many problems in science and engineering involve
moving boundaries and surfaces. Examples range from melting and solidification
to the automatic detection of edges in videos. The mathematical methods that
have been developed for these purposes so far usually do not take randomness
into account. This research will begin to incorporate such effects, focussing on
applications that are related to the denoising and enhancement of images and
videos.
