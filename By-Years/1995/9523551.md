9523551 Komanduri Molecular dynamics simulation is done on the temporal and
spatial scale of atoms, and solves the equations of Molecular dynamics
simulation is done on the temporal and spatial scale of atoms, and solves the
equations of motion using the fundamental forces that hold atoms together. This
is a memory and time intensive computation that is feasible with today's
computer technology. In some fields of science and engineering this simulation
approach has been used for a number of years, but molecular dynamics is still
relatively new in understanding metal cutting processes. This research focuses
on nano machining of various materials with single crystal diamond cutting edges
using both a simulation and experimental approach. The molecular dynamics models
will include the traditional machining parameters. The detailed scale allows the
investigation of subsurface damage and the effects of crystallographic
orientation and defect structure. In addition, it is possible to take a new look
at the wear of diamond tools when machining iron, and the exit failures that
occur when a cutting edge leaves a workpiece. Using a nanometer scale machining
setup inside a scanning electron microscope, experiments will be conducted to
complement and verify the molecular dynamics modeling predictions. The major
impact of this research will be in building the research infrastructure to gain
a fundamental understanding of machining at the nano level. This will give a
technological edge in the design of processes for micro scale precision
components and systems. ***
