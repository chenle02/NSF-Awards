This project is developing and assessing mobile-based learning games for
introductory geoscience courses based on geological features of the Grand
Canyon. Using smartphones with geo-referencing capability, students physically
navigate a scaled version of the virtual landscape, observing, collecting data
and solving problems based on field photographs, maps and other information,
with scoring and rewards native to the gaming environment. Student use provides
a large dataset to assess student learning and game design. The intellectual
merit of the project lies in its innovative approach to leveraging recent
technological and educational advances to improve learning and engagement of the
current generation of students who take introductory geoscience courses,
particularly where real field trips are not possible. Broader impacts include
the dissemination of the games to a wide range of institutions and student
audiences. The educational research of the games' impact also offers insight
into strategies for effective use of mobile-based games in the geosciences.
