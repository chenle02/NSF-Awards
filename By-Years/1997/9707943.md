9707943 Waguespack This research planning grant for women scientists and
engineers entitled Luminescence Studies of a Novel Organo Gel with a "Stacked"
Phenol Microstructure will utilize luminescence studies to explore low
dimensional energy transfer pathways exhibited by these gels. Reaction centers
that are created by doping the gel with photoactive molecules such as 2-naphthol
or pyrenol will provide an opportunity to study the luminescent reaction center
and any low dimensional energy transfer to another intercalated molecule. Laser
lifetime decay curves will be compared for the luminescent gels and one
dimensional solid crystals. %%% These novel gel systems have wide application in
materials science as materials for temperature and moisture sensing.
Furthermore, the highly ordered microstructure can be used to synthesize highly
ordered phenolic polymers, polymer- ceramic composites, and semiconducting
nanostructures such as quantum plates, wires or dots. ***
