This award supports continuation of work begun under a Small Grant for
Exploratory Research. The heart of the work is the utilization of an important
new astronomical instrument, a spectropolarimeter at the Palomar five meter
telescope, to study the nuclei of active galaxies. The use of polarimetry
enables one to infer properties of the central object of such systems, even when
they are obscured by intervening dust in the parent galaxy. This instrument was
designed, built, and will be operated by the group that has led the way in the
study of apparent superluminal motion in some of these objects.
