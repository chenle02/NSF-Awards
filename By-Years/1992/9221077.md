The experiments proposed here will measure the rates of spread, patterns of
infection, and fitness consequences of barley yellow dwarf infection in a
natural plant host in the field. Dr. Kelly will test whether this viral disease
causes an advantage for sex by either (1) more frequent infection of common
genotypes, or (2) more frequent infection of "old" genotypes. The results will
provide evidence of the evolutionary significance of sexual reproduction in
relation to disease, and more generally elucidate the roles diseases play in
favoring genetic and species diversity within communities. Of more practical
significance, the proposed study will provide important data on the natural
ecology of an economically important cereal virus, and provide clues for the
development of suitable strategies of biocontrol of viral diseases in crop
plants.
