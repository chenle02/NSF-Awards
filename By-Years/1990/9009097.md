The overall objective of this project is to develop a new model of immigrant
incorporation and test derived hypotheses for understanding the importance of
family and ethnic bases of action among contemporary U.S. immigrants. Adaptive
strategies of the family are a special focus of the project, unlike previous
research which has more often stressed ethnic solidarity and labor markets. This
research will show how the intertwining of ethnic and family bases of action
influences the incorporation of Chinese, Korean, and Filipino immigrants in the
greater Los Angeles area. This research follows on a prior NSF-funded
ethnographic field study in Los Angeles. This research will conclude the field
study and develop, translate, and pretest a questionnaire for a larger survey
designed to complement the ongoing field study. Analyses of the proposed model
would be carried out with event history, least squares, and multinominal
logistic estimation techniques.
