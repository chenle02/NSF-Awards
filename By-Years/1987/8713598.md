This project proposes to apply recent advances in the development of processing
algorithms and programmable integrated circuits to nondestructive evaluation
(NDE). Two NDE research areas are addressed, data acquisition and flaw
detection. In data acquisition, it is proposed to investigate the use of
adaptive waveform coding to reduce the sampling rate and the digitization word
size and the use of signal decimation to reduce sampling rate. The significance
of these two areas of research is that a lower sampling rate, provided signal
fidelity is preserved, implies easier processing, and a reduced work size
requires smaller data storage. In flaw detection, it is proposed to carry out
research in improving the resolution in pulse echo flaw detection by signal
correlation.
