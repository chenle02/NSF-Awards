Studying polynomial equations and their solutions dates back thousands of years.
For certain types of polynomials, understanding these solutions has important
applications, ranging from engineering to biology to elliptic curve
cryptography. It is still a very difficult question to determine how many
solutions an arbitrary polynomial equation might have, especially if one looks
specifically for solutions lying in the natural numbers or the rational numbers.
A simple example of this phenomenon is Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that
there are no positive integer solutions to an equation of the form an n-th power
is equal to the sum of two n-th powers if n is an integer larger than 2, so for
example a cube of a positive integer cannot be equal to the sum of two cubes of
positive integers. While the theorem is easy to state, the method of proof
involves many deep ideas in number theory and arithmetic geometry, including the
idea of studying many such polynomial equations all at once (the idea of "moduli
spaces"). The PI intends to study such spaces and use them to understand
properties of certain types of polynomials and associated geometric objects,
such as elliptic curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI works in the intersection
of three fields: number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory.
The main theme of this proposal involves the use of representation theory to
explicitly construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry; these constructions
also may be applied to solve counting problems in number theory by using
geometry-of-numbers techniques. The PI intends to use methods and tools
developed in all of these subjects over the last hundred years, including
constructions from classical algebraic geometry, ideas from Lie theory, and
sieve techniques from analytic number theory.
