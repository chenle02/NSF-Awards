Tho goal of the project was to strengthen the chemistry program at Russell Sage
by acquiring a new nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to replace one that
has become obsolete and unreliable. The instrument formerly in use, a seventeen
year old Varian EM360A, long occupied a role of central importance in the
chemistry curriculum, particularly in the area of organic chemistry. However,
this instrument suffered from serious bouts of instability that have limited its
utility. Moreover, it could not perform special NMR applications. The
acquisition of a new Varian EM360L spectrometer with complete supporting
accessories greatly enhanced the chemistry program's capabilities in this area.
In addition to providing stable, reliable performance for routine student use,
this instrument made possible new and highly desirable applications. These
include spin decoupling techniques to assist in the analysis of complex spectral
patterns, variable temperature measurements for use in monitoring reactions, and
the opportunity to record fluorine and phosphorus spectra. The instrument had
major impact on a number of courses, and its special capabilities were
particularly valuable in connection with student research projects. The
University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
