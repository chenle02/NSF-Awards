This is a project to study how information about touch and body position, the
so-called somatosensory system, is processed in the brain. Particularly, it
addresses the issue of how somatosensory information is related to the control
of movement. The inferior olive is a structure in the brain that is involved
with control of movement. It receives somatosensory information directly and
also has inputs from the cerebellum. In this project the neurons from the
cerebellum and somatosensory receptors that terminate in the inferior olive are
to be labeled with dyes so that they can be visualized in a microscope. This
will permit their pathways to be traced, and will permit defining the
organization of the inferior olive with regard to somatosensory information and
movement control. The problem of how movements are controlled is not only
scientifically very interesting, it has many practical applications in
industrial, military and medical settings.
