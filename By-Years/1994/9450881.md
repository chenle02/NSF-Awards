9450881 Mogawer The Deparments of Civil Engineering and Materials Engineering
will enhance the Materials Testing Laboratory with the addition of a modern
computerized universal testing machine. The new machine will enable innovative
development of new challenging laboratory experiments, which are impossible to
carry out previously. These include uniaxial fatigue and creep testing, as well
as determination of the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures (resilience
modulus) and other construction materials under complex states of stress. The
project staff has committed to active participation in outreach efforts to local
high schools which have large populations of underrepresented minority students.
Dissemination will occur via updating of a nationally distributed laboratory
manual.
