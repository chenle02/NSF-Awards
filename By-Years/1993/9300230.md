This award provides funds to the Graduate School at Baylor College of Medicine
(BCM) to continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE. Ten
undergraduates selected from a nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be
exposed to research in a 1O-week summer career development program. Participants
will be selected by a committee composed of faculty from each basic science
department. Students will be matched with faculty mentors and become functioning
members of their laboratories. The unifying focus of the REU Site will be
cellular signal transduction. BCM has an outstanding reputation in this area of
fundamental biological research involving a number of departments including
Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics and
Neuroscience. The projects that will be offered will involve subjects and
techniques that will be appropriate for students with a diversity of interests
and backgrounds. The faculty of BCM have already gained experience in designing
undergraduate research projects and interacting with college students through
participation in a 4 year program and 1 year as an REU Site. The laboratory
oriented aspect of the program will be supplemented by students' participation
in research discussions, seminars, career development activities and
social/cultural activities sponsored through the SMART Program by the Graduate
School. NSF sponsored participants will have the benefit of interacting with 100
other undergraduates from throughout the nation who will be supported by other
sources and of entering an established program that effectively promotes
interest in science and prepares undergraduates to enter research oriented
careers.
