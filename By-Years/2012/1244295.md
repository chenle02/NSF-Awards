An award is made to Syracuse University to undertake a critical step in
understanding how a genome encodes an organism's three-dimensional structure.
Revealing how each gene in a genome impacts the structure and function of an
organism, i.e., "the genotype to phenotype problem" is challenging. Even the
simplest organisms self-assemble through fragile, complex, and often poorly
understood processes involving many different genes. In this context, the impact
of a mutation to any single gene is often too subtle, or too entwined with the
function of other genes, to be determined by direct observation. This project
will achieve a critical step in overcoming this challenge by constructing a
large and well-characterized mutant strain collection based on the genome of
Myxococcus xanthus, an organism used to study three dimensional multi-cellular
structures. The research will also develop experimental protocols to assign
quantitative phenotype profiles that elucidate subtle functional changes linked
to each gene, resulting in more accurate and thorough quantification of
phenotype in the context of the entire genome, and a genome-scale data set
related to function.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing a platform
for training graduate students, all the strains and data will be made available
for education purposes at the undergraduate level. These data will also become
integral tools for students in an ongoing upper- division bioinformatics course
at Syracuse University, and distributed to faculty from primarily undergraduate
institutions to develop similar curricula for their students. In addition, the
PI is engaging with local high school teachers to bring these data into their
classrooms as an introduction to the genotype-to-phenotype problem and
opportunities in life science in the post-genomic era. Information on this
