0450386&lt;br/&gt;Okaya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a summary
scientific workshop for the project, "Geophysical Investigation of a Modern
Continent-Continent Collisional Orogen - the Southern Alps, New Zealand". This
project was funded by Continental Dynamics during the period 1994 - 2000. The
project was a successful collaboration between U.S. and New Zealand
geoscientists. During the project, extensive field observations were made in
several disciplines, and the resulting analyses have produced over 30
substantive peer-reviewed publications with additional ones in review or in
preparation. Over 30 direct participants and an equal number of cooperating
scientists and students from both countries have engaged in scientific research
funded by Continental Dynamics and the N.Z. Science Foundation
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is one step in a larger effort to
create a publication volume focused on the Indo-Australian/Pacific plate
boundary. The volume will contain a series of new synthesis papers summarizing
and integrating much of the results from the existing published papers. As such
the volume will represent the cumulative knowledge gained by the joint US-NZ
project. The workshop will bring together project members who are actively
contributing to and writing manuscripts. The workshop will be held in New
Zealand where US and NZ authors and students will assemble to discuss manuscript
content and writing preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
