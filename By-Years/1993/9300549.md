A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will be established at the
Mechanical Engineering Department at Tuskegee University. Twelve minority
engineering students at the end of their junior year will be recruited to have
the research experience each year. The duration of the research activity for
each student is expected to be one academic year. Each undergraduate student
will be paired with a graduate student in an on-going funded research program
under the leadership of seven faculty mentors. The funded research areas are in
composite materials, fatigue, fracture mechanics, non- destructive evaluation,
microgravity applications and control, electric propulsion and combustion.
Students participating in this program will be required to register for a three
credit hour Research course which will be used as a technical elective. Biweekly
meetings during the regular semesters and weekly meetings during the summer will
provide the forum for progress reports and exchange of information.
