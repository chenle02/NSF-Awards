This project is part of an ongoing effort to build more powerful computer
programs for proving theorems in mathematics and application areas. The work can
be divided into subareas: building provers with large-step capacity; using
analogy to aid in proof discovery; combining known methods for new proofs in
higher order logic; and mechanical methods for streamlining proofs.
