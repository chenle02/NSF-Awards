9409939 Kipke This Research Initiation Award proposes involved understanding of
speech processing in the elaborate neural circuits of the lower auditory system
and to apply this understanding to improving cochlear implants. The objectives
are to develop computer models of the cochlear nucleus to explore central
auditory processing. The specific aims are to: (1) identify anatomical and
physiological parameters that are critical for single-cell responses to tones,
noise, and speech using detailed models of the cochlear nucleus primary types of
neurons, (2) identify parameters that are critical for describing the functional
connectivity in the cochlear nucleus using network models, and (3) investigate
the effects of reduced cochlear function on the processing in the cochlear
nucleus. ***
