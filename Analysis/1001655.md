The first project, Quantum Cold Gases, aims to study the basic properties of
interacting bose systems in low temperature. The main objective is the
identification of the second order term of the ground state energies and the
free energies of these systems. The quantum systems considered in this project
include trapped systems in the Gross-Pitaevskii limit or extended systems in the
thermo-dynamical limits. Furthermore, we also propose to remove the prevailing
assumptions on the positivity of the interaction potentials. A related problem
on the ground state energy of charged bose systems with Coulomb interactions
will also be considered. The second project, Eigen-states, Eigenvalues of Random
Matrices, concerns the eigenvalue gap distributions and the localization-
delocalization transition of eigen-states. We focus on the band matrix ensemble,
the generalized Wigner ensemble, the Wishart ensemble and the symplectic
ensemble. The goal is to prove the universality of the local eigenvalue
statistics of these ensembles and the localization-delocalization transition of
eigen-states of band matrices.

This first project of this proposal is aimed to develop new mathematical tools
for dealing with complex problems in many-body quantum systems. New mathematical
methods lead to different points of view and can thus increase the understanding
of physical systems. The second project aims to establish the conducting
properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems. The mathematical
model for these systems in the simplest form is given by matrices with random
entries. Our project is designed to provide rigorous proof that conduction does
occur in the random matrix models.
