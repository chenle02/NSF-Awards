The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of software technology to safeguard the purchase and distribution of
proprietary data. Many industries face problems associated with data purchasing
and usage, theft and re-distribution, and security and privacy. The proposed
technology is designed to meet these challenges by securing data, tracking its
movement, and then publishing a use receipt to a distributed ledger once it
reaches its destination. The software tags individual data packets so they can
be tracked among multiple transactions, providing visibility throughout a
specific data-use value chain. This method provides a level of security and
control, ensuring data delivery only to certified recipients. The technology has
applications in industries with challenges in data visibility and
redistribution, such as financial services, healthcare, scientific data, and
entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores translation of
a distributed ledger technology offering the potential to prevent redistribution
of proprietary data in a variety of contexts while providing a blockchain-based
record for transactions between data producers and consumers. The proposed
technology offers a distributed ledger for use among multiple players in a
transaction. A secure, immutable system for storing proprietary data on the
blockchain must be developed, as well as the ability to provide both permission-
only access to the data and a trusted receipt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
