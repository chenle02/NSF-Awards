Stochastic models and methodologies for statistical inference will be developed
in the context of modern instrumentation-intensive experimentation. Bayesian,
likelihood- based, semi- and non-parametric methods will be investigated for
prediction, calibration, testing and constructing confidence intervals.
Efficient and numerically stable computational algorithms will be developed and
statistical properties will be investigated both theoretically and via computer
experimentation. Much modern science relies on instrumentation-intensive
experimentation. With instrument-generated data, the problem may be prediction
of responses for new inputs or untried experimental conditions, or calibration
of the responses for the test settings, or understanding which components of the
response bear a scientific relationship to the input variables. A variety of
processes may influence each observed response; the simplest is simple random
error, others include deliberate or accidental censoring, and the limitations
due the precision of the measuring instrument. Proper, efficient and valuable
inferences require statistical models and inferential methodologies with correct
understandings of all these processes.
