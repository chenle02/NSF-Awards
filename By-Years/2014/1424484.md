Under the supervision of Prof. Harriet Ritvo, Ph.D. student Shira Shmuely will
examine the ways the legal regulation of animal experimentation has shaped
science and, reciprocally, how scientific knowledge about animal sentience has
shaped those legal regulations. The coPI will examine how humanistic values have
been translated into laws governing animal welfare and the mechanisms by which
such laws have been administered. Her focus is on how the ethical standpoint of
utilitarianism utilizes science in the ethical calculus, as the primary mode of
expertise about somatic function.

In addition to resulting in a dissertation, this research will contribute to
ongoing debates about animal welfare, and illuminate ethical issues in the life
sciences and biotechnological research.
