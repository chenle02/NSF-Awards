9730865 Blackman The mechanisms by which lower crustal and upper mantle rocks
are unroofed, uplifted and exposed on the seafloor will be investigated via a
series of numerical experiments. Previous models of the formation of metamorphic
core complexes in extended continental regions will provide a starting point for
this modeling of oceanic core complexes. The intent is to develop numerical
predictions that can help guide future mapping efforts.
