This research program is concerned with two related projects. One is the
selection of equilibrium states of a three dimensional, nonlinearly elastic body
undergoing a phase transformation. The selection criterion involves a singular
perturbation problem for a nonconvex functional in a variational formulation.
The second is the study of the long time behavior of the solutions of the Cahn-
Hilliard equation which models the phase-separation of binary alloys and polymer
mixtures that have been rapidly cooled. The results from these two projects are
expected to have significant impact on engineering mechanics.
