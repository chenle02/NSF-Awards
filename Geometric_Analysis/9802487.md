Abstract

Proposal: DMS 9802487 Principal Investigator: Jon Wolfson

In this proposal we will continue our study, joint with R. Schoen, of
variational problems for lagrangian submanifolds: Let M be a symplectic
2n-manifold equipped with a compatible metric. Given a homology class in M that
can be represented by an immersed lagrangian submanifold, find a lagrangian that
minimizes volume among all lagrangians that represent this homology class. The
minimizer is known to exist as a lagrangian rectifiable varifold, so the focus
of our research is on the regularity of these minimizers. When the ambient
manifold M is Kaehler-Einstein it may be possible to show that the lagrangian
minimizers are stationary, in the classical sense. We hope to develop a good
regularity theory of lagrangian minimizers and then to use these minimizers to
study the geometry of the ambient Kaehler or symplectic manifolds.

Many problems in physics and mathematics have solutions that are obtained via an
optimization procedure. In this project we will study a minimizing procedure in
differential geometry. We minimize volume among generalized surfaces (immersed
submanifolds) that satisfy a geometric constraint (that are lagrangian). Because
we require our generalized surfaces to satisfy this constraint many new
difficulties arise. However our solutions often have interesting and important
geometric properties. This problem has many features in common with problems in
nonlinear elasticity. It is hoped that our techniques will be of use in that
subject. However it should be emphasized that optimization procedures in the
presence of geometric constraints have not been studied before. This idea will
eventually be useful in many different contexts.
