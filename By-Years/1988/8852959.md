This award provides funds to The Kellogg Biological Station at Michigan State
University to purchase four items: two basic gas chromatographies, a scanning
spectrophotometer, and a pH meter. Currently, The Kellogg Biological Station
summer teaching program offers a diversity of undergraduate courses in ecology
which emphasize hands-on, field experience in a small group setting. Several of
the courses discuss aspects both of ecosystem processes and of population
ecology. With this new equipment they will eliminate from the teaching
curriculum the separation of ecology into ecosystem-based and population-based
concepts and instead, integrate both along the lines of biogeochemistry and
trophic interactions. To enhance this new teaching focus, they wish to create a
more quantitative framework for those field/laboratory exercises which
illustrate interactions between abiotic and biotic components of terrestrial and
aquatic model systems. These instruments will be used by students to quantify
inorganic and organic precursors and products of organism activities, pigments
of primary producers, and other important abiotic and biotic aspects of
communities. The field/laboratory exercises made possible by this
instrumentation will provide students a practical "feel" for the conceptual
integration of two important areas in ecology. The grantee institution is
matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
