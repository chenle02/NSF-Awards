This research explores sensor-based control of a mechanical snake through
development of obstacle-avoidance and motion-planning algorithms. The mechanical
snake is robot-like mechanism, a prototype of which is now being tested in the
laboratory. It consists of a sensorized head link (that detects obstacles) and
six identical regular links (that provide motion). As an obstacle is detected,
the computer in the head link will be able to recommend a motion of each link so
that when that link arrives in the neighborhood of the obstacle it will not
collide with it. Developing the algorithms to make this system work is a far
more challenging problem than the state-of-the-art, real-time collision
avoidance strategies currently in use for mobile robots and robot arms. When
completed, the snake will be able to move into areas that people cannot enter
(e.g., small cracks in collapsed highway after an earthquake) or are too
dangerous for people (e.g., a radioactive environment). At these locations, the
will perform surveillance (e.g., look for survivors through remote video, check
radioactivity levels) or a task (e.g., bring medicine to survivors).
