This project will produce a concept design for an intermediate ice-capable
research vessel. The design, based on science mission requirements for an
intermediate (about 60 meters) research vessel for operation in the western
arctic, will provide a technical description of the ship including expected
speed, power, stability, seakeeping, range and endurance. General arrangements
including inboard and outboard profiles, machinery and science arrangements and
an artist's conceptual drawing will also be provided. The design will be used
for planning and assessment by the National Science Foundation and the
scientific oceanographic research community. The Project is under the direction
of Professors Vera Alexander, Robert Elsner and Thomas Royer of the University
of Alaska with assistance from an oversight committee from the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System, Fleet Improvement Committee.
