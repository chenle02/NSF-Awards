ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0204174&lt;br/&gt;Marian Neamtu&lt;br/&gt;Verderbilt
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final properties of polymer products are
largely determined by process conditions such a low rate, shape of processing
die and cooling temperature, which are represented as condition parameters in
mathematical models. In this sense, modeling viscoelastic fluid behavior
provides a fundamental explanation of the structure of polymer products such as
fibers and films. Advances in the finite element computational methodologies for
simulating the fiber and film process is a recent development in polymer
industries.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this work is to introduce mathematical
optimization techniques into the nu-merical simulation of viscoelastic fluid, in
order to determine optimal process conditions for polymer products. Two research
projects are involved in the proposal: film casting and a vorticity minimization
problem. The overall strategy will be to integrate recently developed
viscoelastic models and optimization techniques in order to meet objectives
through various control mechanisms such as shape control and boundary control.
As an equation solver for the film casting problem, the commercial software
package Poly ow, which simulates film and fiber processing in various settings,
will be used. For the other problem, a finite element code&lt;br/&gt;currently
under development will be used. In solving the optimization problems, recent
results&lt;br/&gt;from current research will be extended to the more general and
high dimensional viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;regime.
