This grant supports a workshop focused on developing community consensus for the
grand challenges in geodetic technology applications in the solid Earth,
cryosphere, and atmospheric sciences. 77 U.S. scientists have been invited to
attend. Identified session leaders will form a writing committee that will
produce a draft white paper with final publication expected by the end of
January 2010. The long-term science goals developed will guide infrastructure
development and community efforts in geodesy over the next decade. The workshop
also hopes to identify the most pressing needs regarding the training of future
geodesists and the education of scientists so they can use the rapidly advancing
geodetic technology, and rapidly growing data sets, for their research.
