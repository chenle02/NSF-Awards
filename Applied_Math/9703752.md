9703752 Yau The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation have been proved as the
hydrodynamical limit equation of stochastic lattice gas models in dimension 3.
The first project investigates the following three related topics: (i) the
scaling limit of tagged particles, (ii) the equilibrium fluctuation and (iii)
the appropriate time scale for dimensions 1 and 2. The first problem emphasizes
the individual behavior of a typical particle instead of the collective behavior
of all the particles. The second problem is a question about the central limit
theorem. The third problem addresses the time scale in dimensions 1 and 2, which
is conjectured to be very different from the diffusive scale in dimension 3. The
second project studies the relaxation rates of the Kawasaki dynamics of Gibbs
states in infinite volume. This is believed to be a power law. The method is
based on the Poincare inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities and some entropy estimates. The third project concerns the scaling
limit of a quantum particle in a random potential. There are two limiting cases:
the low density limit and the weak coupling limit. In both cases, the phase
space density of the quantum evolution defined through the Wigner transform or
the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to a linear Boltzmann equation
with collision kernel given by the quantum scattering cross section. This
research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the
typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective
behavior of fluid has been studied intensively, the important question of the
propagation of individual particles in the fluid has not. The project will study
this question with stochastic models which are believed to capture the essential
behavior of the fluid. (2) How does a wave travel in random media. It is
believed that with high disorder, a wave in random media becomes loca lized. The
important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a wave propagates.
This can be considered as a model for conduction of current in a semiconductor,
or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical equation governing
all these diverse phenomena is the Boltzmann equation. This study will try to
validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving wave equations
in random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations.
