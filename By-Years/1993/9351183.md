The chemistry department will purchase a GC-MS as a major instrument in the
revamping of their curriculum to include increased exposure to modern
instrumentation. Incorporation of experimental work involving gas chromatography
and mass spectrometry will begin with the freshman course for majors and
continue through organic chemistry and quantitative analysis. It will then be
utilized in the project oriented unified lab sequence and in senior research
projects.
