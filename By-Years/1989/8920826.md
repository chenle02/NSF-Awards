The objective of this proposal is to understand and consequently to control the
mechanism of carbocationic polymerizations, and thus to develop useful new
materials and processes of readily available monomers and equipment,
respectively. This overall objective embraces six major specific (and numerous
subordinate) objectives: 1) To explore the fundamentals of recently discovered
living carbocationic polymerizations; 2) To expand the scope of such systems; 3)
To exploit seed experiments for copolymers; 5) Macromers; and 6) To combine
cationic with living anionic polymerization for the synthesis of other hitherto
unavailable materials. The methodologies toward these objectives are partly in
place (conventional techniques in combination with new techniques) and partly
will be developed. This research is significant for the creation of basic
knowledge which is, however, exploitable for the preparation of new specialty
materials with a combination of unique properties and for new multipurpose
polymerization processes. The possibilities include: New amphiphilic networks
for biomaterials for artificial organs and controlled drug delivery, new
macromers for engineering applications, new coatings, new diblocks for blending,
etc.
