This award will support an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to introduce
junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program, and assist in successful strategies
for proposal preparation. The NSF CAREER program serves a critical role in the
National Science Foundation's efforts to identify, foster and support the
nation's most promising junior faculty in both research and education.
Professionals just starting their careers often have limited experience with
grant writing and evaluation and quite often no interaction with the program
directors at NSF. This workshop brings young faculty members to Arlington, VA
and provides a robust series of opportunities to improve in proposal writing,
focused and strategic interactions with NSF program directors from across CISE
and recent CISE CAREER awardees. The major features of the workshop include
presentations on proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and a
proposal clinic. A limited number of participants will receive travel support to
encourage participation from HBCU/MEI faculty to attend this workshop.
