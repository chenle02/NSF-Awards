9619488 Shaw This project is part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be conducted in June and July,
1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing and climate using
aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. In this project,
measurements of the supersaturation spectrum of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)
will be performed at a surface site at Sagres, Portugal. A newly developed
instrument, the cloud condensation nuclei remover, will be deployed. The data
obtained by this and other research groups will allow a detailed analysis of
aerosol properties and sources.
