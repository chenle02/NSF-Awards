With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Shobhana Chelliah and Willem de
Reuse will conduct three years of linguistic research on Western Apache, a
Native American language spoken by approximately 13,000 people in central and
eastern Arizona. Tribal members, educators, and linguists have been concerned
about the loss of Western Apache, a language that has played a major role in the
culture and history of the American Southwest. At present, less than 3% of
Apache children are acquiring Western Apache as a first language, and thus the
language may no longer be spoken by the end of this century. This project will
result in the first comprehensive dictionary of the language. This dictionary
will provide reliable and consistent spellings, attestations of words no longer
used, grammatical analyses, full conjugations for the verbs, and example
sentences for each word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is significant for
several reasons. The Western Apache Dictionary will be used for the design and
implementation of language revitalization and teaching programs. It will be made
available in paper and electronic format, allowing for the generation of
supplementary children's and learners' dictionaries. The dictionary will also be
a reference for linguists interested in the structure of non-western languages
or in comparing Apache with related languages such as Navajo. Anthropologists
and ethnohistorians may also use these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
