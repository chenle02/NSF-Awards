Haldane's rule is the observation that "when in the F1 offspring of two
different animals races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the
heterozygous [heterogametic] sex" (Haldane, 1922). In the nematode genus
Caenorhabditis, Haldane's Rule is observed in C. briggsae::C. remanei hybrids.
Implementation in this combination is through sexual transformation of haplo-X
hybrids into females. Hybrid sexual transformation likely results from dysgenic
interactions among sex determination genes. This hypothesis will be tested by
mapping naturally occurring variants that suppress the hybrid sexual
transformation phenotype relative to the sex determination genes of C. briggsae
and C. remanei. One such variant has been identified in each of these species.
Mapping of sexual transformation variants will utilize single-nucleotide
polymorphisms(SNPs) as genetic markers. The goal of this project is to map
hybrid sexual transformation variants to the nucleotide. This will be
accomplished in two stages. A resolution of 0.1 mu (0.1% recombination) will be
achieved by analysis of recombinant chromosomes through a single-worm PCR assay.
Depending on the genomic region involved, this resolution will correspond to
between 5,000 to 150,000 bp. Increased resolution (0.0001 mu) will be achieved
through a population-based assay designed to detect recombination between
adjacent SNPs. This work will further the understanding of the evolutionary
genetics of species formation. --
