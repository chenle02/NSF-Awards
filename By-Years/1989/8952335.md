The objective of this project is to develop a lab in which students can design,
test and debug microprocessor based systems. Six 8086 microprocessor development
systems are requested. Each development system consist of an in circuit
emulator, development software and a PC. By mimicking the behavior of an 8086
microprocessor, the emulators bridge the gap between a simulation of the
hardware prototype and the actual prototype. They allow software to be developed
and tested before the prototype hardware has been completely built. The
developments of software allows the students to monitor their systems at three
levels. At the highest level symbolic debugging of source "C" programs is
provided, while the intermediate level allows assembly language debugging. At
the lowest level the emulators provide the capability to monitor the status of
logic signals in the prototype.
