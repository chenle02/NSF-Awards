The Mechanics and Control of Hydrodynamic
Schooling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrodynamic interactions among fish swimming in
a school can &lt;br/&gt;dramatically reduce the school's collective drag. This
drag reduction &lt;br/&gt;has been documented experimentally, but the
interactions responsible are &lt;br/&gt;not fully understood. This problem is of
basic scientific interest, but &lt;br/&gt;it is also of engineering interest.
Biomimetic underwater vehicles are &lt;br/&gt;being developed within the
robotics community to exploit performance &lt;br/&gt;advantages enjoyed by
marine animals; the concurrent deployment of &lt;br/&gt;schools of underwater
vehicles for distributed environmental sensing or &lt;br/&gt;military
reconnaissance is a common objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to derive
energy efficiency through fluid-structure &lt;br/&gt;interactions, particularly
in the context of schooling, practical &lt;br/&gt;underwater vehicles will need
to employ feedback systems incorporating &lt;br/&gt;distributed flow sensor data
into motion control algorithms. No such &lt;br/&gt;systems exist, but novel flow
sensors comprising micromachined hair &lt;br/&gt;cells provide a platform for
their development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce analytical and
computational models &lt;br/&gt;illuminating the dynamics of schooling,
advancing methods from the field &lt;br/&gt;of geometric mechanics to enable the
analysis of both the energetics and &lt;br/&gt;the stability of coupled
swimming. A robotic prototype will be developed &lt;br/&gt;with integrated
biomimetic sensing and actuation, and control methods &lt;br/&gt;will be derived
for this system to demonstrate energy-efficient wake &lt;br/&gt;drafting and
vortex-assisted turning, two essential components of &lt;br/&gt;schooling
locomotion.&lt;br/&gt;
