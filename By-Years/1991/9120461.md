New Zealand's recent movement toward liberalization of all economic activity
provides a unique case study opportunity to both observe and evaluate the
effects of deregulation on the agricultural section of the New Zealand economy.
This cooperative research award supports visits over a two year period by Dr.
Warren Johnston of the University of California at Davis to work with Dr. Gerald
Frengley and colleagues at Lincoln University in Canterbury, New Zealand. The
research focuses on the impact of deregulation on adjustment of farm firms to
changes in input, commodity and capital markets. Emphasis will be on changes in
financial conditions and differential abilities of farm firms with respect to
survival. Analysis includes financial and efficiency assessments, and is
extended to include consequences for family farm households incorporating
expectations and financial stress. The research results should be of interest to
agricultural economists, policy makers and to farmers not only in New Zealand
but also should have important implications for agriculture in North American
and Eastern and Western Europe.
