The objective of this research is to study the applicability of the theory of
chaos to machine tools monitoring with specific reference to the metal cutting
process. The research strives to develop formalisms for monitoring via the
theory of chaos and integrate these formalisms with neural networks so that
effective, practical monitoring systems can be installed on the shop floor. The
focus of the research is completely tangential to the conventional thinking on
sensor data fusion in monitoring. It is a very novel attempt to bridge the gap
between "hard" manufacturing process issues and "soft" manufacturing information
issues using an analytical approach with great potential for serving as an
integration element between these two domains.
