This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Jonathan Lees of the
University of California, Santa Barbara to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Yoshimitsu Okada for six months at the National Research Center for Disaster
Prevention, Tsukuba, Japan. They will apply tomographic techniques developed by
Dr. Lees to determine the 3-dimensional P-wave velocity structure beneath the
Kanto-Tokai district of Japan, and hence to image the subterranean crustal and
upper mantle structures. The method developed by Dr. Lees assesses the behavior
of tens of thousands of earthquake ray paths to determine the composition of the
material along the paths. By superimposing the many linear descript- ions of the
subterranean environment, a 3-dimensional description can be determined.
Application of the tomographic method to the large, high quality data sets that
have been recorded by dense seismic networks in Japan over many years should
lead to a vastly improved understanding of the geological structures and
tectonics of the region.
