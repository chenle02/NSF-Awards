9525755 Williams, Chang, and Peng This project involves a study of the
interactions between tropical disturbances over the western North Pacific and
the easterly waves over the equatorial central Pacific during the Northern
Hemisphere summer and is motivated by the results of some observational studies
by the principal investigators and other researchers. The zonal mean wind in the
lower troposphere converges between the two regions of the tropical Pacific,
causing a confluence zone which may be favorable for energy accumulation and,
therefore, the enhancement of small disturbances. Barotropic and baroclinic
models will be used to investigate how these interactions might occur.
Specifically, the models will be used to study the effect of southeastward
energy propagation from the western Pacific disturbances (including
northwestward propagating waves, tropical cyclones, and the monsoon depression
itself), and westward energy propagation from the synoptic scale central Pacific
easterly waves. Further, the principal investigators will investigate whether it
is possible for disturbances to grow in this region and what the role of
moisture/latent heat release might be in such growth. A second objective, using
the same barotropic and baroclinic models, is to study the formation and
maintenance of the monsoon depression over the western North Pacific. ***
