This Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project brings 32 faculty members from
other schools to Mount Holyoke College for a one week workshop and to a two-day
follow-up meeting preceding the joint mathematics meetings 18 months later. The
project is disseminating materials and methods from the courses Laboratory in
Mathematical Experimentation, Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory, which were
developed at Mount Holyoke with NSF support. Exploration of the course materials
is introducing participants to the interactive, conversational mode of
mathematics teaching that the courses require. Participants also explore the
opportunities the courses afford for broadening the mathematics curriculum and
attracting new students to majors and minors in mathematics through employing
interdisciplinary courses as feeders, creating entry-level courses that go
somewhere and adding a course following the introductory courses which points to
additional mathematics courses. The June workshop has five elements. First,
participants model the learning experience of students in courses by actually
carrying out computer experimentation. Second, by looking at student papers
participants address issues of teaching and evaluating writing and also have a
means of examining some of the ways students' thinking develops. Third,
participants have an opportunity to talk with students who have taken these
courses. Fourth, participants discuss their observations and experiences and
compare them among themselves. Finally, the workshop ends with a presentation of
participants' implementation plans at their home institutions.
