Ithaca College and Cornell University are being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced
research chemists. The program will support students for the summer of 1987, of
which almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities
will include: o Electroanalysis with chemically modified electrodes o Synthesis
and kinetic studies on organic molecules o Organotransition metal compounds o
Variable temperature NMR studies on organic systems
