This research encompasses investigations into three problem areas in the field
of stochastic control theory. In each of the areas, specific problems are
identified for study with the expectation that theoretical insights and a better
understanding of the issues will evolve from the research. The three problem
areas are: (i) stochastic adaptive control: Bayesian adaptive control problems
for diffusions are formulated as partially observed stochastic control problems.
(ii) control of flexible manufacturing systems: These problems are formulated as
control problems with jump markov disturbances. (iii) doubly stochastic control
problems: Models with stochastic parameters will be treated as partially
observed stochastic control problems and their solutions will be characterized.
In all of the three problem areas results about specific prototype examples will
be stressed with the objective of obtaining generic solution techniques. This
research considers several problems in the general area of stochastic control
theory. These problems arise in many important engineering problems such as
adaptive control and control of manufacturing systems. By formulating the
problems as partially observed stochastic control problems it is expected that
this research will lead to new methods of characterizing the solution to these
important engineering problems.
