A Symposium is proposed that is designed to bring together an international
group of experimentalists and theorists interested in new ideas and results that
pertain to nanostructures and mesoscopic systems. Topics will range from physics
to fabrication techniques. A core of some sixteen invited speakers will help
determine the main themes of the meeting. In addition, a dozen or so talks will
be selected from the contributed papers, the remainder of which will be
presented in a poster session. It is planned to limit the number of participants
to about 175. A proceedings will be published in due course. The field, which is
relatively new, is of great fundamental scientific interest. There are also very
important technological implications for such areas as semiconductor devices,
electronics, binary optics, smart sensors, etc.
