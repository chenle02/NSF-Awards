Research examining the extent to which individuals express concern over the
threat posed by climate change finds that expressed concern increases if the
information is conveyed in a way that makes the impacts "psychologically close"
and that this effect is more pronounced among liberal than among conservative
respondents. Research also shows that the increased concern does not translate
into an increase in actual intentions to engage in mitigation activities. This
project applies principles of psychological distance/construal level theory to
examine how messages about types of climate impacts/mitigation actions presented
in psychologically proximate or distant terms can influence levels of concern,
how different emotions elicited by these communications (e.g., fear or anger)
may explain the observed response discrepancies with respect to political
persuasion, and why there is a disparity between "concern" and "intentions."
These research findings are very likely applicable to a variety of social
issues. By shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms that influence human
perception and decision-making, this project will provide insights into the
nature and determinants of the U.S. public's risk perception, emotional
responses, policy support, and mitigation intentions related to a variety of
issues.&lt;br/&gt;The effects of perceived psychological distance (temporal and
spatial/social) of climate change (impacts and mitigation efforts) on perceived
desirability (concern to ameliorate) and feasibility (behavioral intentions),
mediated by emotional responses and self-efficacy, and moderated by cultural
worldview, will be tested using the results of an experiment involving a large
representative survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
