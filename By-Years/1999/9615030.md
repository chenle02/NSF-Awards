Rudolph A. Marcus of the California Institute of Technology is funded by a grant
from the Theory and Computational Chemistry Program of the National Science
Foundation to continue theoretical research in electron transfer in large
biomolecules and at interfaces. Eight research problems will be addressed: 1)
electron transfer and scanning tunnel microscopy (STM) across ordered
monolayers; 2) nonadiabaticity and electron transfer in proteins; 3) charge
transfer rate constants at semiconductor electrodes; 4) bias dependence of STM
images of organic monolayers on graphite; 5) electrochemical inverse
photoemission; 6) sequential approach to electron transfer in proteins; 7)
intramolecular dynamics and unimolecular reactions; 8) mass-independent isotope
effect. This research will address the problem of charge transfer in large
biomolecules and will therefore provide clues for the understanding of the
mechanism of such processes as photosynthesis. It will also clarify the
determination of the structure of surfaces, and will help in the construction of
electronic devices, for example. The charge transfer research has also
implications for corrosion and batteries.
