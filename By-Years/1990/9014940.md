Hodges This research is on systems for instruction in and control of IC
(integrated circuit) manufacturing (CIM). There are two parts: 1. The user
interface. The primary thrust is developing graphical user interfaces and
multimedia applications to improve manufacturing productivity and training.
These include a standard desktop interface for control, scheduling, analysis and
management programs. Also being developed is an engineer's notebook, and a
hypermedia introduction to semiconductor manufacturing. 2. Process control and
development. Research is focused on designing and prototyping object-oriented
systems to support routine manufacturing applications at the equipment level.
Activities include: real-time monitoring, statistical process control, fault
diagnosis, the efficient development of new recipes, and the economical creation
of equipment models. Experiments with real-time monitoring of applications on
equipment (processing and analytical) and equipment maintenance are being done.
Results are being used to create a photolithography workcell prototype.
