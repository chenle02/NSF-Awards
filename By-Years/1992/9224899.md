The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of thioquinones, selena
and telluro anhydrides, chalcogenofulvenes and chalcogenofulvalenes, and
nonclassical thiophenes. The results in the fulvene-fulvalene areas are expected
to lead to one-dimensional conductors and perhaps to new superconductors. Charge
transfer complexes with unusual solid state properties will also be sought as
will new routes to organotellurium compounds. It is possible that the research
will lead to the production of new conducting polymers and near infrared dyes.
%%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Drs. Michael P. Cava and M.V. Lakshmikantham of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Alabama. The research is focused on the bonding,
stability and utility of the C=X (X=S,Se,Te) bond. Results in this area will
lead to a better understanding of the properties of such compopunds and
subsequent application to the design of organic materials including synthetic
metals and those possessing nonlinear optical properties.
