The Snow-Atmosphere Chemical Exchange Working Group, an official working group
under the International Commission on Snow and Ice, will convene a workshop in
March 1992, at the University of New Hampshire. The objective of the workshop is
to define particular problems that currently hinder the quantitative
interpretation of proxy climate records that are being recovered from the
Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) ice core, and to develop a research plan
for the continued utilization of the NSF-constructed camp at the drill site.
This grant will provide support for the participation of twelve American and
foreign scientists.
