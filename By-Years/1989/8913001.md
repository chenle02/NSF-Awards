This grant supports research involving observations at radio wavelengths of
molecular spectral lines in interstellar clouds and near young stars. The data
will be used to deduce the physical conditions within the clouds and to
determine the ages of the young stellar objects. In addition funding for this
research will enhance the science education of female undergraduates at
Wellesley College, with the objective of encouraging them to continue in
scientific fields. Students will take an active role in the research, under the
guidance of Dr. Benson. This award is made under the auspices of the Research at
Undergraduate Institutions program at the National Science Foundation. Gas and
dust clouds in the interstellar medium, of the type commonly known as dark
molecular clouds, appear to be the sites where stars form. Observations at
wavelengths which penetrate the obscuring dusty material indicate the presence
of stars or protostars in many such clouds. Radio wavelength observations of
spectral lines of molecules such as ammonia have proven to be excellent probes
of the physical conditions within the dense cores of the molecular clouds and in
the vicinity of newly formed stars.
