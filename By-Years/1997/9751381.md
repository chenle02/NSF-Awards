This project implements a molecular genetics laboratory course. A course
addition of this type enriches the laboratory offerings in the Biology
Department. There are three primary goals to the project. The first goal is to
teach students the basic biological and biochemical principles underlying
molecular genetic techniques. The second goal is to give students practical
experience in a variety of up-to-date molecular genetic techniques. These
techniques can be used to examine the genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model
research organism for the study of the molecular genetics of plant growth and
development. The third goal is to introduce the students to a sample of research
programs that utilize molecular genetics and familiarize the students with
careers in molecular genetics. The first two goals can be accomplished through
the use of lecture and laboratory sections. The third goal of exposing students
to graduate and career options can be accomplished through the current
departmental seminar series, through which researchers in the field of molecular
genetics are invited to campus to discuss their work.
