This project involves three related areas of research on ant systematics. (1)
Species-level revisionary work will continue on the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae,
a pantropical group with more than 300 species, many of which are involved in
mutualistic interactions with plants. (2) The evolution of ant-plant mutualisms
will be examined by phylogenetic and comparative biological studies of
pseudomyrmecine lineages associated with domatia-bearing plants. (3) The
phylogenetic relationships among the ant subfamilies will be investigated by a
comprehensive survey of character variation (in all castes) and a detailed
cladistic analysis. The proposed taxonomic and phylogenetic studies of
pseudomyrmecine ants will improve our understanding of an important group of
tropical ants, and contribute insight into the origin and maintenance of ant-
plant symbioses. A well- corroborated phylogeny of the ant subfamilies will
provide a valuable framework for comparative studies of ant biology.
