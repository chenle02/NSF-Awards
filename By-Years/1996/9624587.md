The research component of this project will result in the design and development
of portable parallel software for solving architectural-level optimization
problems that arise in the design of VLSI systems. Several of these problems can
be formulated as very large scale integer programs that can be solved in
polynomial time using iterative relaxation techniques. The practical running
times of these algorithms on serial computers can be prohibitively long,
however, especially for interactive design environments. The scaleable parallel
software developed in this project will be able to execute orders of magnitude
faster than conventional serial code. It will thus enable VLSI designers to
interactively explore their design space at an early stage in the design process
and to efficiently consider several architectural alternatives before committing
to any particular implementation. The educational part of this project aims at
the seamless integration of parallel computation in the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum. To that effect, two new courses will be developed at Yale.
The first course will introduce undergraduates to the basics of serial and
parallel computer systems organization. The second course will cover algorithms
for computer-aided design of VLSI systems with a research focus on parallel
electronic design automation. ***
