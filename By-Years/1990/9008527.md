This Research Initiation Award will support an artificial intelligence approach
to kinematics and dynamics, including qualitative analysis of mechanical
systems. Dr. Sacks' system will infer and describe the functioning of simple
machines, made from rigid mechanical parts, based on models of structure and
applicable forces. One research goal is an extension of Dr. Sack's 2D phasespace
analysis technique to higher dimensions. The longrange goal is automation of
engineering design and maintenance knowledge.
