This project has the potential to revolutionize datacenter systems by developing
the first type of system that integrates traditional datacenter memory and
storage systems in one layer. The proposed software platform can potentially be
used to develop various course and research projects. The investigator will
publicly release the developed software to enable a rich set of datacenter
applications and to foster more cross-layer research
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next-generation non-volatile memories (NVMs)
provide byte addressability, persistence, and low-latency performance. They are
poised to radically alter the landscape of memory and storage technologies and
have already inspired a host of research projects. Most previous research on
NVMs has focused on using them in a single machine. It is unclear how to best
utilize NVMs in distributed, datacenter environments. This project takes a
significant step towards the goal of using NVMs in distributed datacenter
environments by developing Distributed Shared Persistent Memory (DSPM), a
framework that uses a pool of machines with NVMs to form a global, shared, and
persistent memory space. Applications can perform traditional memory load and
store instructions to access both local and remote data in this global memory
space and can at the same time make their data persistent and reliable. Unlike
traditional two-layer approaches with a memory and a storage layer, DSPM has
just one layer that serves both as distributed memory and as distributed
storage. Anticipated deliverables include a new kernel-based, software DSPM
system and a set of datacenter applications ported to DSPM.
