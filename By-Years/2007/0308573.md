A grant has been awarded to Dr. Norman W. Miller of the University of
Mississippi Medical Center to help students and young investigators attend the
9th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative
Immunology (ISDCI) to be held in St. Andrews, Scotland on June 29th-July 4th.
This congress convenes every three years and brings together the world's leading
experts in developmental and evolutionary immunology. This congress serves to
foster collaborations and allows young investigators and students to meet some
of the most renowned experts in the field. The congress will include topics
ranging from innate immunity, adaptive immunity and evolution all the way to
environmental and ecological immunology. The most significant developments
presented at the congress will be published by Elsevier in the journal
Developmental and Comparative Immunology. These funds will be used to facilitate
travel for students and junior faculty from U.S. institutions.
