Computing systems that use complex graphic and image based information require
the storage and retrieval of very large data files. Optical disk systems offer
the largest storage capacity of any random access storage system, but widespread
use, especially in the PC market, has not occurred because of their high cost. A
major cost item in these drives is the high power laser diode they require. This
cost can be dramatically reduced by developing more sensitive optical recording
media so that lower power, less expensive laser diodes can be used. We plan to
apply materials and device design concepts we have developed in the course of
our study of phase change materials to develop erasable optical recording media
suitable for use with lower power, less expensive laser diodes. These materials
will have rapid crystallization kinetics and stability in both structural
phases. This new phase change erasable media will have potential application in
business and technical computing, as well as interactive education and
entertainment systems. This superior technology provides an excellent
opportunity to compete in markets recognized for major growth over the next
decade.
