The proposed research will use the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) to address
the role of fixed cells in the recognition of proteins, viruses, bacteria and
red blood cells. It will begin to test the hypothesis that a population of fixed
cells in the gills of the crayfish is the critical component in the initial
recognition and clearance of non-self cells and particles, whereas circulating
hemocytes play a secondary, but critical role in the elimination of foreign
materials after they are concentrated into the gills. Previous studies with the
crayfish, using a unique "transfusion exchange" technique to deplete circulating
cells to less than 1% of normal levels in vivo, indicate that the transfused
crayfish is quite capable of clearing a wide variety of non-self substances to
the gills in a normal manner. In vitro studies indicate, however, that separated
populations of granulocytic and agranulocytic hemocytes are capable of
recognizing (binding, phagocytosising) bacteria, red blood cells and proteins.
The immediate goals of this project will be to define the morphological and
functional properties of the fixed cells lining the gill sinuses, i.e. to
identify them as podocytes or transiently fixed hemocytes. The results of this
research should provide new insights into the mechanisms of non-self recognition
and self defense in an invertebrate, the crayfish, apparently lacking
lymphocytes and immunoglobulins. The proposed studies also will provide
outstanding undergraduate students an opportunity to participate in an ongoing
research program, thus promoting their potential for graduate studies in the
sciences. In addition this project will continue to enhance the research
environment of an undergraduate institution.
