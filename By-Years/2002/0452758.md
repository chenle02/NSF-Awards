TITLE: Microlensing Theory and Galactic Astrophysics

ABSTRACT

Dr. Andrew Gould at Ohio State University will undertake several projects
related to microlensing, as it applies to galactic astrophysics. Among the
projects are investigations of degeneracies in the microlens parallax, in order
to allow for proper interpretation of all microlensing parallax measurements,
and studies of degeneracy between close-binary and wide-binary models of binary
microlensing events. Additionally, new codes to allow for detailed modeling of
finite-source effects will be developed, in order to provide for proper
interpretation of high-magnification events. Another project will involve the
construction of a new catalog of 100,000 halo stars, to probe halo parameters
and substructure. Training of graduate students in this research area will be
among the broader impacts of this work.
