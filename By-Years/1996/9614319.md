This dissertation project is a village level study of environmental thought and
practice in the Kluane region of Canada's Yukon Territory. In the past decade,
studies have tried to understand or document "traditional ecological knowledge"
for use in resource management efforts, environmental impact assessments and
land claims negotiations. However, this project argues that that knowledge is
not simply an abstract product of the human intellect, but is one aspect of
broader cultural processes that are embedded in complex networks of social
relations and practices. By approaching land use in the Kluane area from this
perspective, the project goes beyond traditional knowledge studies and considers
how environmental knowledge and practice are changing and what these changes
mean for local people and resources. The study uses participant observation,
interviews, and archival/library research to examine traditional ecological
knowledge as a process.
