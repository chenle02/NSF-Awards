This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1989, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research in
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, and biochemistry under the direction
of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. A unique feature of this REU
proposal is that only women and minorities will be recruited.
