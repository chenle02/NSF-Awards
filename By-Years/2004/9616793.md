9616793 Spilhaus Support will be provided for regional global change research
planning activities of interest to scientists in Asia, the Pacific and Africa
and to U.S. scientists. These activities include scientific workshops and
planning meetings on development of: a regional climate system model and
forecasting applications network for Asia; a research agenda on variability in
land use/land cover change and its relation to global change in Asia and Africa;
an agenda for research on interaction between global change and human health,
water sources, and agriculture in Africa; and an agenda for research on land-
ocean interactions in African coastal zones, particularly chemical fluxes in
continental shelf regions. These activities will be organized by the Global
Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START) in conjunction with
the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) and the European
Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH). These activities are intended to
also lead to standardization of data collection and analysis; integrated
databases; and exchange of global change data and information. *** ??
