AST-0805832&lt;br/&gt;Narayan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A black hole is one of the
simplest objects in Nature, described only by mass and spin. While many black
hole masses have been estimated, spin measurements have only recently become
feasible. The largest systematic error in the spin estimates arises from
uncertainties in the disk model, particularly the assumption of a vanishing
torque at the innermost stable circular orbit. This project will carry out two-
and three-dimensional numerical general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations of the inner regions of accretion disks. It will provide clear
guidelines for reliable spin estimation, both by fitting the continuum spectra
of X-ray binaries and by fitting relativistically broadened iron
lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public interest in black hole research continues
high, and this work will showcase the intellectual excitement of science in a
way easily appreciated by the public, and by the junior researchers actively
involved in the study. The PI has a strong record in such mentoring
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the NSF Division
of Astronomical Sciences and NASA?s Astrophysics Theory Program.
