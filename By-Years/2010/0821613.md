At orogen scale, rock uplift rates are strongly influenced by erosional
efficiency, which is set by climatic conditions, bedrock quality, and the
sediment load carried by rivers. And, river incision rates ultimately control
regional denudation rates and patterns because rivers set the boundary condition
for hillslope erosion. This project will develop and test process-specific
models of river incision into bedrock. In particular, the quantitative
relationships among bedrock properties, river sediment load (flux, size,
sorting), flow hydrodynamics, and bed morphology remain important unknowns and
support the conceptual framework that erosion rates depend on evolving feedbacks
among bed topography, fluid flow, and sediment transport. A refined, physically
reasonable, quantitative model of bedrock incision into bedrock will be
developed to rationally interpret specific erosional morphologies observed in
the field in terms of flow and sediment transport conditions. Preliminary
experiments have been conducted in (SAFL, UMn) and a new flume to be constructed
at MIT.
