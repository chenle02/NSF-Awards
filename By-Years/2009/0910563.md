This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emily Carter of Princeton University
is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to pursue the development of accurate and efficient ab initio methods
for application to very large molecules. Her goal is to 1) achieve linear
scaling with small prefactors in accurate molecular quantum mechanics by
restructuring the algorithms used and 2) to increase the accuracy and efficiency
of orbital free density functional theory (OFDFT), a method for condensed matter
physics that was developed in the PI's group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods
that the PI and her interdisciplinary research group are developing can be used
to study the energetics of combustion reactions involving very large molecules,
including molecules that are being considered as alternative fuel sources. The
methods are also being developed to study many classes of technologically
important materials such as semiconductors and insulators. Women, members of
under-represented minorities and undergraduate students are involved in this
research program
