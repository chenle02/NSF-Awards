An electronic device laboratory to teach physics and practical operation of
semiconductor electronic devices is being developed as part of a electronic
device course. This undergraduate teaching laboratory demonstrates some of the
"difficult to grasp", but "easy to see" notions in semiconductor device physics.
Starting with experiments to illustrate the concepts of energy band gap and
positively charged quasi-particles in semiconductors, students progress to
examine optical processes and electrical conduction in a variety of important
electronic devices. These experiments each are performed in thirty minutes and
incorporate state of the art virtual instrumentation techniques to reduce the
time needed for data acquisition so that the students will have enough time to
carefully perform the experiment and understand the fundamentals behind the
phenomena that they are examining; a balance is maintained, however, between the
ease of use and pedagogical considerations.
