This project aims to design and build a generic adaptive filtering module for
digital communication systems. The design is based on the multi-channel fast
Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filtering algorithm. The design includes
echo cancellation, equalization, automatic gain control, and timing and carrier
recovery performed digitally on single or multiple digital signal processors.
Fixed and floating point implementations are developed and the finite precision
issues involved in mapping these algorithms to finite wordlength digital signal
processors (DSPs) are addressed. Real time and high level simulations of these
algorithms will be performed over realistic channels. These include fading in
mobile digital radio and voice-band channels with various impairments. Present
digital communication systems based on current adaptive filtering technology
fail in worst case channels for voice-band modems and in the case of mobile
communication systems, during rapid fading. Higher speed communication over
channels with more noise and distortion will become feasible by employing these
new algorithms. Further, the all digital DSP-based design ensures
manufacturability with greater reliability and little or no time consuming
manual adjustments.***
