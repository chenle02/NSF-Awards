This Innovation Corps proposal begins to translate basic science results from
NSF-funded research into commercial applications in next generation,
environmentally sustainable agriculture. The technology goal is the development
of nitrate sensors for field applications in large-scale industrial agriculture,
to monitor and control fertilizer utilization and nitrate pollutant generation
from fertilizer usage. The overall goal is to simultaneously maximize
agricultural productivity, optimize fertilizer usage and minimize environmental
impacts resulting from fertilizer use. The proposed I-Corps funding will provide
a 6-month effort to demonstrate proof-of-concept that proprietary compounds can
be incorporated into a solid matrix (e.g., polymer thin films) to provide an
optical readout that is sensitive for nitrate in the presence of other common
interfering anions and natural organic
matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preserving the environment and
developing agricultural products that do not harm unintended targets were
recently cited as grand challenges for the chemical sciences. This translational
research will enable a team of entrepreneurs and scientists to evaluate a
potential product that could reduce cost, energy usage and environmental damage
in the multi-billion dollar per year agriculture business.
