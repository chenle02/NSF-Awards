9700721 Bass A number of problems from four areas of probability theory are to
be studied. The first, which has applications to partial differential equations,
is an investigation into the squared Laplacian by means of both ordinary
Brownian motion and by iterated Brownian motion. The second area arises out of
both economics and physics and is a stochastic bifurcation model. One has an
ordinary differential equation whose behavior is controlled by a stochastic
process. The third area is diffusions on fractals, together with a study of
their properties. These have applications to physics as well as partial
differential equations. Finally, uniqueness for superprocesses will be
investigated, resulting in applications to partial differential equations and to
mathematical biology. Probabilistic techniques will be used to study a number of
different models that arise in economics, physics, and biology. These include
the behavior of rational players in economics, field theories in physics, and
populations in biology. The results should also have applications to the theory
of partial differential equations in mathematics.
