&lt;br/&gt;Over the last several years, Greenblatt has been working on
resolution of singularities, and &lt;br/&gt;he recently has proved an
n-dimensional local resolution of singularities algorithm for real-
analytic&lt;br/&gt;functions. This method is explicit, elementary, and done in
coordinates. In his subsequent research,&lt;br/&gt;he will apply his methods,
using additional ideas when appropriate, to prove theorems involving
&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory integrals, Radon transforms, and other subjects in which
he has done research. In addition &lt;br/&gt;to these areas, he will branch out
into several other of the diverse areas that relate to &lt;br/&gt;resolution of
singularities. For example, he intends to work on multilinear generalizations of
&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory integral operators, problems related to the stability of
integrals, and associated &lt;br/&gt;problems in algebraic geometry such as
those involving multiplier sheaves. In addition, intriguing
&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic and computational questions arose during the development
of [G1], and he plans to &lt;br/&gt;investigate such issues in computational
algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oscillatory integral operators are a
part of Fourier analysis, a field with wide application in&lt;br/&gt;science and
engineering, such as in signal processing, cryptography, and statistics. As a
result,&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding of oscillatory integral operators
resulting from this research has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to help in the
development of scientific applications that use Fourier analytic methods. In
&lt;br/&gt;addition, Radon transforms are fundamental to MRI and other medical
imaging applications, and also find &lt;br/&gt;uses in diverse fields ranging
from oil exploration to homeland security. As a result, improved
&lt;br/&gt;theoretical knowledge of Radon transforms resulting from this
research may lead to advances in such &lt;br/&gt;fields.
