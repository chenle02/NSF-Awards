Similar yet visually non-identical objects form recurring patterns that are
ubiquitous in the world we live in. Thus an automatic recurring pattern
detection algorithm can serve as a stepping stone towards robust higher level
machine intelligence. The recognition of such recurring patterns is especially
relevant for computer vision since it can lead to saliency detection, image
segmentation, image compression and super-resolution, image retrieval and
semantically meaningful organization of unlabeled data. This project explores
automatic recurring pattern discovery from domain independent images and videos
to capture, robustly and flexibly, varying mid-level visual cues emerging from
any cluttered background. The work leads to effective and efficient object
discovery and scene interpretation. The research team develops an un-supervised
method for discovering recurring patterns in a single or multiple images . The
key property is the nature of recurring without knowing what recurs. Differing
from previous feature- or object-level pairwise-matching-based approaches,
recurring pattern discovery from real images is formulated as a joint,
2-dimensional feature assignment optimization problem where multiple objects and
multiple feature clusters are considered simultaneously.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project disseminates the results through publications
and sharing data with other researchers. The research of this project
contributes to the understanding and capturing of recurring patterns in higher
spatial dimensions and spatiotemporal domains. Besides computer vision and
computer graphics, many other research fields can also benefit from this
research.
