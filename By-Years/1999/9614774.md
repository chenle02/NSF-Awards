9614774 Agnew The PI proposes to do a detailed GPS study along the central San
Andreas fault, examining the transition between creeping and locked segments of
the fault. The PI will compliment the geodetic measurements with modeling of the
strain field in order to test applicability of elastic dislocation models to the
San Andreas region. ***
