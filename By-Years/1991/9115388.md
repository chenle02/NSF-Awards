This proposal requests support for workshop on parallel computer performance,
emphasizing software tools. The workshop, the third in the series, will be held
in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in early October, 1991. The workshop organizers
recognize a pressing need for a continuing and productive exchange of ideas
between scientists engaged in research on performance measurement of high
performance, parallel computing systems. Research areas especially concerned
with performance related empirical and analytical knowledge the design of
hardware and software for parallel systems and research explore the usefulness
of such systems for scientific computing. The workshop, sponsored by Los Alamos
and the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign is designed to bring
together experts from academia, industry, national laboratories and government
agencies to explore these issues. The goals of the workshop are to ascertain the
current availability of tools for parallel computer performance evaluation, to
report experiences with existing tools, and to determine future needs in the
areas of performance measurement, analysis, and visualization. Thel expertise of
the planned attendees, success of the past workshops, and the intrinsic merit
and relevance of the topic area ensures that this workshop will result in
valuable interaction and products. //
