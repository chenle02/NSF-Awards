This research involves development of imputation techniques and variance
estimation methods for survey data with nonrespondents. The investigator focues
on (1) validating and comparing (both theoretically and empirically) the
existing imputation techniques and developing better procedures if necessary;
and (2) developing correct variance estimators for a given imputation method
that produces correct survey estimates. Special attention will be paid on random
hot deck imputation using models, nearest neighbor imputation, cold deck
imputation, multivariate imputation, longitudinal imputation, imputation for
quantiles, and imputation for non-ignorable response. Many variance estimation
techniques (such as the linearization/Taylor expansion, jackknife, balanced half
sample or balanced repeated replication, random groups, and bootstrap) will be
studied. Particular issues that will be addressed in variance estimation include
non-negligible sampling fractions, approximation in applying replication methods
(such as grouping and collapsing), complex and composite imputation methods (in
the sense that a number of different imputation methods are used and/or imputed
data are used to impute nonrespondents for other variables), variance estimation
for nearest neighbor imputation, variance estimation for sample quantiles, and
problems with imputed values that cannot be identified from the data set.

Most surveys have nonrespondents. Item nonresponse occurs when some sampled
units cooperate in the survey but fail to provide answers to some questions.
Commonly used compensation procedures for handling item nonresponse are
imputation techniques which insert values for nonrespondents. It is a common
practice to treat the imputed values as if they had been observed, and compute
survey estimates and assess their varibility using standard formulas designed
for the case of no nonresponse. This, however, could lead to some problems and
biases in statistical analysis. For example, the use of standard formulas to
assess varibility in analysis may seriously underestimate the true varibility,
because standard formulas do not account for the changes in varibility due to
nonresponse and/or imputation. This research involves development of correct and
simple to implement statistical procedures to analyze survey data with
nonrespondents and imputation; and will solve some real statistical problems in
survey agencies such as the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and
Westat.
