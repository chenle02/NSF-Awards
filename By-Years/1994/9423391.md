9423391 Sanchez This U.S.-Mexico Cooperative Program award will support travel
and related expenses for four U.S. scientists and three postdoctoral students to
participate in an international workshop on the theory and applications of the
cluster variation and path probability methods to complex materials systems. The
workshop will be held in San Juan, Teotihuacan, Mexico, during June 19-22, 1995,
The coorganizers are Professor Juan M. Sanchez, University of Texas, Austin, and
Professor Jose L. Moran-Lopez, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico.
Participants will also include leading authorities in this important research
area from Europe, Japal and Latin America. In addition, several students and
young scientists will be invited to participate. The primary objectives of the
workshop are: to provide an up-to-date and in-depth review of the subject; to
foster direct interactions and more collaboration between U.S., European,
Japanese and Latin American scientists, and to provide an international
experience to researchers at the start of their careers. ***
