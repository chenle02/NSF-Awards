Dr. Porter is studying the social and political role of quantification. He
argues that the "objectivity" of quantitative arguments is not simply a matter
of appearing true, but also of being highly standardized, or governed by
explicit rules. Quantitative reasoning is valued in the political realm in part
because it seems to be independent of the biases and interests of individuals,
and hence to be quintessentially "public" knowledge. Dr. Porter is examining
from this standpoint the history of some of the most widely-used modern methods
for reducing decisions to calculations. His research emphasizes the uses of
cost-benefit analysis and, if time is available, statistical methods for
detecting weak causes (such as carcinogenicity in chemicals). This is the first
serious historical study of either of these methods, and indeed the first
systematic attempt to understand historically the vastly-increased importance of
quantification in public life. His standpoint throughout is that of the history
of science, and he compares these public uses of calculation with quantitative
norms for reporting experimental results, such as the significance test.
