Many macro molecules give rise to diffraction patterns when exposed to X-rays.
Previously, these patterns were of use in determining molecular structure of
molecules which contain small, repeating portions or else the analysis was
limited to very low resolution. Over the lst l5 years, the principal
investigator has developed methods of X-ray diffraction analysis (called fiber
diffraction analysis) which have determined the molecular structure of the
Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMVB) at a resolution of 2.9 angstroms. The present
proposal is to develop methods to extend the techniques utilized in the TMV
study to other biological systems. Methodology will be developed using other
viruses, cytoskeletal filaments and nucleoprotein complexes.
