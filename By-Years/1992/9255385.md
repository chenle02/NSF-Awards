The Office of Academic Affairs of the City University of New York, along with
the National Science Foundation's Directorate for Education and Human Resources,
will host a one-day conference on science education for faculty from the City
University and other New York City postsecondary institutions. The conference
will highlight the efforts of the National Science Foundation to strenghten
science, mathematics and engineering education at the pre-college, undergraduate
and graduate levels. Small working sessions will allow professional educators
from a broad range of institutions in the New York metroplitan area to discuss
with the NSF staff the adequacy of existing programs and to discuss ideas for
future programs that focus on such issues as recruitment and retention of
minorities and preparation of mathematics and science teachers.
