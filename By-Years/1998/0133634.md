The goal of this research is to use control-theoretic techniques to develop new
processor-architecture mechanisms for dynamically adaptable control of power and
temperature. To accurately evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the effectiveness of these new
mechanisms, this project will also develop more detailed models for localized
temperatures within a processor and for leakage current within on-chip, memory-
like structures. These models will be constructed for computationally efficient
use in cycle-accurate power/performance processor simulation.
