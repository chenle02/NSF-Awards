This is a proposal from the Technical Education Research Centers, Inc. (TERC)
to focus attention on the needs of educational telecomputing by holding a
founding meeting for a Consortium on Educational Telecomputing with follow-on
organizational activities. The goal of the Consortium is to improve education by
stimulating the provision of quality telecomputing-based learning at the lowest
possible cost to schools. This Consortium would create and disseminate education
telecomputing software and curriculum in mathematics and science both by pooling
funding available to members and by seeking additional funding from government
and business. The Consortium would also coordinate the establishment and
interconnection of networks and hosts. The founding meeting of the Consortium is
tentatively scheduled for Cambridge April 18-19, 1991 with 55 participants of
which 25 will be subsidized by the requested funding. TERC is contributing to
the costs of the meeting and additional funding is expected from corporate
sponsors. The establishment of this Consortium represents a novel development
for educational reform. It is a conscious attempt to employ a strategy of
pooling interests and resources available to states, provinces and corporations
and others interested in education to create and share software, curricula and
expertise. It envisions essentially public dissemination mechanisms which could
result in substantial savings at the school level. Although there are unique
factors which favor the success of this particular effort, the Consortium idea
might have application in other areas of interest to the NSF. The conference
also provides a unique opportunity to both determine and influence the planning
of the states and other organizations concerning educational telecomputing. One
of the results of the grant will be the broad dissemination of a report that
summarizes these issues. This project is jointly supported by the programs for
Applications of Advanced Technology and Science & Mathematics Education
Networks.
