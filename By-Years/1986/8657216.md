This award will support experimental studies of nuclear processes that occur
when energetic atomic nuclei collide. The measurements will be carried out using
accelerator facilities at the University of Rochester Nuclear Structure Research
Laboratory, and elsewhere. Special emphasis will be placed on investigating
mechanisms that lead to the breakup of the projectile nuclei. Apparatus will be
developed to permit the efficient study of multi-particle final states from
these reactions. The awardee is a very promising young scientist. Support is
highly recommended.
