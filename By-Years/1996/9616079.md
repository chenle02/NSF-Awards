Proposal Number: ECS-9616079 Principal Investigator: Margaret Murnane Title:
Enhanced Ultrafast X-ray Generation Using Pulse Shaping In this research,
precisely controlled ultrafast laser pulses will be used to enhance the process
of coherent x-ray generation and thus demonstrate a practical source of x-rays
with extremely short pulse duration. Novel approaches for enhancing and
controlling the efficiencies of soft x-ray generation will be attempted, for the
first time, by engineering the wavefunction in a quantum system using
appropriate waveforms. The set-up will be the first of its kind and will have a
great impact on the study of dynamic processes in molecules and wide-bandgap
materials and also on microscopy and possibly lithography. These areas are
important to the national technology base for optics, ultrafast communications,
sensors, microscopy and x-ray lithography. Strong student involvement and
relevant and multidisciplinary training for students is an integral part of this
research.
