0124821 Ahmann The objective of this project is to perform combinatorial
mutagenesis to improve the functioning of a Fe-hydrogenase for the production of
hydrogen gas from algae in the presence of oxygen. The specific components of
the research include: (1) the Fe-hydrogenase sequences of multiple organisms
will be used as the basis for a PCR-mediated multi-parent shuffle to create
recombinant hydrogenase sequences, (2) these sequences will be cloned into a
Chlamydomonas vector, the vectors will be transformed into C. reinhardtii, and
transformants for oxygen-resistant hydrogen production will be selected using a
chemical selection procedure, and (3) a subset of the survivors will be selected
using chemochromic and gas chromatographic hydrogen production assays. The goal
of this research is an oxygen tolerant Fe-hydrogenase that may ultimately
combined with other oxygen-inhibition-elimination mechanisms to facilitate
commercial algal hydrogen production.
