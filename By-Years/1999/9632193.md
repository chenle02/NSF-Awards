ABSTRACT PI: Beecher Proposal Numbers: 9632193 Bird song is widely recognized
as a model system for nvestigations into the biological basis of learning. It
provides the best example to date of natural learning in a vertebrate, with many
striking parallels to human language learning. Moreover, in recent years many
discoveries concerning the brain mechanisms underlying song learning have
suggested that this model system may reveal much about the general processes of
learning in the brain. We propose to use both field and laboratory studies to
examine song learning. We believe that the field perspective is crucial for
understanding the song learning process, because the rules of song learning we
have discovered in the field turn out to be quite different from the rules that
had been inferred from laboratory studies. The first important goal of the
proposed studies is to resolve and understand the discrepancies between the
field and laboratory findings to date, because the utility of this model system
for study of neurobiological correlates will be undermined if the laboratory
studies are unduly artificial and produce artifactual results. A second goal of
the work is to compare individuals from sedentary populations (resident in the
same area throughout the year) and migratory populations (breeding and wintering
grounds widely separated) of a species. There are a variety of reasons for
predicting that animals from these populations will be very different with
respect to both song learning and song usage in communication. These studies
will allow us to assess the relative contributions of proximate ecological
differences aad population genetic differences in producing song learning
differences between sedentary and migratory populations. A third goal is to
evaluate the role of females in the development of male song. In most North
American species of songbirds, females do not sing, but t here is considerable
evidence that they can strongly influence both the development and phylogeny of
male song traits. A fourth goal of the work is to examine individuals use of
their vocal repertoire for communication in natural ontexts, and effects of
vocal repertoire for communication in natural contexts, and the effects of vocal
repertoire differences among individuals on their survival and lifetime
reproductive success.
