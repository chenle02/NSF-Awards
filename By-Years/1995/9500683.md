9500683 Storm The first U. S. Gordon Research Conference on "Biodegradable
Polymers" will be held this coming February in California; the last was held in
San Miniato, Italy in May 1993. The goal of the Conference is to facilitate
interdisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum
of researchers with interests in biodegradable polymers, both natural and
synthetic polymers. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of
young American scientists. %%% There are emerging opportunities related to the
design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of synthetic polymers for
materials applications requiring biodegradation. Advances in areas of
biodegradation of materials will have a positive impact on the environment wich
is a strategic area of emphasis at NSF. ***
