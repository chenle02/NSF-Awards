The Maryland Dynamical Systems Conference is a conference in dynamical systems
that has been taking place since 1992 at the Department of Mathematics of the
University of Maryland in College Park, MD, every year in March or April. The
2020 conference will take place on April 16-19, 2020. The goals of the
conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to
facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to
nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; to promote
the participation and visibility of women and under-represented groups in the
field of dynamical systems; and to contribute to the training of graduate
students and recent PhDs and to their integration into the dynamics community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of the conference are in the broad area of
dynamical systems, and for the 2020 meeting they include rigidity of higher rank
actions, statistical properties, homogeneous dynamics, in particular unipotent
dynamics, ergodic theory of smooth parabolic flows, and ergodic theory of Cantor
systems. Additional information about the conference can be found on the
conference webpage at&lt;br/&gt; https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
