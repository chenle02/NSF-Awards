Lay Abstract PI: Currie, Scott Proposal Number: IBN-9723973 Coordinated
movements are characterized by precise temporal sequences of muscle activation,
referred to as "motor patterns." These motor pattern sequences are produced by
networks of neurons (nerve cells), called "central pattern generators" (CPGs) in
the central nervous system. This project examines the neuronal mechanisms that
are utilized by a spinal cord CPG network to generate rhythmic and coordinated
movements of the hindlimb. The excitatory and inhibitory chemical transmitters
utilized within this CPG will be investigated, as well as the intrinsic cellular
properties of CPG neurons. These experiments permit the investigation of
cellular mechanisms contributing to the construction of complex, coordinated
limb movements. The mechanisms revealed will provide fundamental information
about vertebrate spinal cord function, and may eventually contribute to the
understanding of human movement disorders.
