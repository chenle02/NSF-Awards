ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Novik, Isabella
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0801152&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;Title: Around the theory of
f-vectors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue studying the face numbers of
various classes of cell complexes. Specifically, she proposes to work on
centrally symmetric polytopes, simplicial complexes and posets whose geometric
realization is a manifold, and cubical complexes. As previous works suggest,
this will require applying existing and developing new combinatorial, algebraic,
topological, and possibly analytical techniques, thus strengthening connections
between different parts of Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell complexes
provide a convenient way to build various shapes from smaller and simpler
blocks, such as for example pyramids or cubes. A natural question then is what
restrictions on the number of building blocks are imposed by specific shapes.
Variations of this question (e.g., what is the minimal number of blocks
required) have practical importance when one wants to represent/store such a
structure in a computer.&lt;br/&gt;
