This research concerns work on the following topics in the area of commutative
associative rings and algebras. The first is birational normal spots and
exceptional prime divisors over a 2- dimensional normal local domain. A specific
question here is whether a 2-dimensional normal local domain that satisfies
Muhly's condition (N) necessarily has torsion divisor class group. The second
topic concerns finite generation of ideals contracted from a polynomial ring
extension. An interesting question in this area is whether a 1-dimensional
coherent domain has the property that its integral closure is a Prufer domain.
The third topic concerns ring and field extensions that are not finitely
generated but have the property that each proper subextension is finitely
generated. Other topics in commutative ring theory concerned with the behavior
of the Picard group under ring extension, the structure of rings of interest in
control theory, and the multiplicity of adjacent ideals in a 2- dimensional
regular local domain will be considered. Commutative rings are algebraic
structures possessing a commutative addition and a commutative multiplication.
These structures occur throughout mathematics and algebra and common examples
include polynomial rings, and rings of algebraic integers in extension fields of
the rationals. This project is concerned with a variety of questions on the
structure of commutative rings.
