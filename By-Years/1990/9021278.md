Feeding behavior is critical to survival in all animal species. Each type of
animal employs different motor strategies in order to achieve this behavior.
These movements are under neural control in all species. Invertebrate animals
with simple nervous systems are useful model systems for understanding neural
control of behaviors in more complex vertebrates. Dr. Ayers will study feeding
behavior in lobsters. Although much is known about the isolated activity of
neurons controlling motor patterns in lobsters, little information is available
about how the motor patterns function in the freely-moving animal during the
time that it is searching for, ingesting, and digesting its food. Using the
sonar telemetric instrumentation under development, recordings from muscles can
be made in undisturbed animals while they are feeding in a natural environment.
This work will contribute significantly to basic understanding of how elements
of the nervous system control feeding behavior.
