In classical geometry, one studies geometric objects whose coordinates commute.
Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical theory specifically designed to study
"geometric objects" whose coordinates do not commute but which do occur
naturally in mathematics and physics. In the last decade or so, with the help of
new ideas from noncommutative geometry, great advances have been made toward the
solutions of long-standing problems in classical geometry, topology, and
mathematical physics. K-theory serves as a bridge between noncommutative
geometry, classical geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. The principal
investigator and his students plan to develop a quantitative operator K-theory
to investigate problems arising from these areas of mathematics. This project
will contribute to US workforce development through mentoring of graduate and
post-doctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his
students will focus on the applications of quantitative operator K-theory to
problems in geometry, topology, almost representation theory of discrete groups,
and structure theory of operator algebras. In particular, the investigator
intends to apply quantitative operator K-theory techniques to solve problems in
higher index theory of differential operators, quantitative behavior of scalar
curvature, norm stability of almost representations, and the universal
coefficient problem in structure theory of
C*-algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
