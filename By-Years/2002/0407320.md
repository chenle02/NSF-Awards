AST-0407320&lt;br/&gt;Giblin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue
development of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) rapid response observing campaign at the
College of Charleston, in collaboration with the University of the Virgin
Islands. Optical and long-wavelength afterglow observations of GRBs are
invaluable for understanding their nature. The NSF-supported updated Etelman
Observatory in St.Thomas is very well placed geographically to conduct such
studies, and its extreme eastern location should allow recovery of events that
will have faded before they come into view at other telescopes. The current
research comprises the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of afterglow
data, including light curve modeling, probes of outflow geometries and
progenitor environments, measurement of color indices and break times in the
light curves, and comparison with high energy prompt
emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team and these institutions have a rich
tradition of undergraduate research, which will continue with the support of the
current program. The system to be created will also join other telescopes across
the globe in GRB follow-up campaigns, which should lead to varied collaborations
and enhanced scientific return.
