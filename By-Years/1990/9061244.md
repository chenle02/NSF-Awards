Infrared and ultraviolet image detection and processing requirements have
created an urgent need for high resolution and high gain frequency conversion
mechanisms to shift wavelengths to the visible regime. Solid state imaging
systems and optical processors for the visible regime have approached the
performance of the retina; in contrast, their IR and UV counterparts suffer from
high cost, poor detectivity, and low resolution. Optron Systems proposes to
explore the development of a Thin Film Optical Frequency Converter (TFOFC) which
can resolve, amplify, and convert infrared and ultraviolet images to visible
wavelengths for direct viewing, imaging, and optical processing. We intend to
use a monolithic thin film sandwich structure that couples a visible-emitting
electroluminescent film to a photoconductive film with an optical gap tailored
to the regime of interest. The principle of operation of the TFOFC involves
using the incident IR or UV radiation as a trigger and amplitude modulator for
the emission of visible light. If successful, such a device could be mass
produced in large areas and at low cost and it would find immediate applications
in, remote earth sensing, optical computing, laser alignment, real-time image
processing, machine vision, multispectral image fusion, edge detection, and
astronomical imaging.
