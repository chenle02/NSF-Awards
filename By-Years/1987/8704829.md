This project is an award for engineering research equipment, namely, equipment
to automate a flow calorimeter. PROJECT: Intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds)
represent a form of molecular attraction intermediate in strength between the
physical van der Waal's forces and a true chemical bonding. When they occur,
H-bonds have a dramatic effect on the fluid's thermophysical properties, and
thus a thorough study of this phenomenon is extremely important from both a
scientific and an engineering perspective. The research being conducted at
Colorado School of Mines is a systematic study of bonding in an important class
of materials; the five-membered heterocyclic ring compounds composed of both
aromatic (furan, thiophene, pyrrole) and nonaromatic (tetrahydrofuran,
tetrahydrothiophene, and pyrollidine) species. Both equilibrium association
constants (K) and bonding energies (WHO) are being determined by measuring the
heat effects that occur when a dilute solution of an associating species in an
inert solvent is taken to infinite dilution in a flow calorimeter. Automation of
the calorimeter facility will increase research productivity by at least 50
percent. PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The experimental results of this and future
investigations of other more complex heterocyclic groups will substantially
increase our understanding of H-bonding effects in aromatic and nonaromatic
compounds, as well as add to the data base necessary for developing improved
thermodynamic models for process calculations.
