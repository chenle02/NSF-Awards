This project seeks to analyze the voltage data from existing gyre-scale
submarine cables in the North Pacific. The data will be compared with other
oceanographic data sets, including TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry, XBT sections, and
ATOC thermometry results. The cable data will also be compared with calculations
from general circulation models using observed winds, with the aim of
establishing to what extent the voltages and altimetry are sensing the same
transports, and to what extent they provide complementary contributions.
Attempts will be made to determine the most effective way the voltage data can
be incorporated into oceanographic data sets.
