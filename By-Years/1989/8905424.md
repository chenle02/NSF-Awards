The research aims at unified theoretical model of nuclear scattering and
structure. Various approaches to the Dirac random phase approximation for
isoscalar and isovector nuclear excitations will be combined with the Dirac
distorted wave impulse approximation to study inelastic polarized proton nucleus
scattering to discrete states and the quasi elastic continuum. A feasability
study of finite nucleus renormalisation problems will be made.
