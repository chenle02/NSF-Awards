This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Stephen E. Strom and four other astronomers from the Five College Astronomy
Department, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and Professor Yasuo Fukui of
Nagoya University. The investigators will carry out molecular line observations
of circumstellar disks associated with solar-type stars spanning a range in ages
from t - 1 Myr to t - 50 Myr. The goals are to determine the physical and
chemical properties of circumstellar disks associated with young solar-type
stars and evolutionary changes in the disk gas mass from the time solar-type
stars first become visible to the time when all circumstellar gas has been
accreted by the star, dispersed or accreted onto rocky cores to form giant, gas-
rich planets. The project combines sensitive molecular line observations
obtained using both U.S. and Japanese mm-wave telescopes, with infrared and mm-
continuum measurements obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (ITRF)
and the Cal Tech Sub-Millimeter Observatory (CSO). The ultimate success of the
project depends on using the world's largest mm-wave antenna -- the 45-m
Nobeyama Radio Observatory telescope -- and the Nobeyama Millimeter Wave
Interferometer to measure gas emission from circumstellar disks at ultra high
sensitivity. A total of nine astronomers, five from the United States and four
from Japan, are participating in this project.
