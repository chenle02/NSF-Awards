Fundamental materials research is proposed with scanning probe microscopes: 1)
crystal growth and etching will be observed in real-time as they occur at
liquid-solid interfaces for detailed comparison with theoretical models, 2) the
imaging of molecular crystals and other soft materials will be investigated and
improved by focusing on static and dynamic probe-surface interactions, and 3)
the development of new scanning probe microscopes for materials research will be
continued with special emphasis on new techniques for imaging ultra-fast
processes. %%% Scanning probe microscopes, in particular the Atomic Force
Microscope, are evolving into powerful tools for materials research. They can
image processes involved in the formation of materials at unprecedented
resolution. They can image these processes as they occur in many cases.
Commercially available microscopes can already do many jobs in materials
research and are finding there way into more and more materials research
laboratories. This research is focused on pushing the frontiers and developing
new microscopes and new methodologies for handling more and more problems and
finding solutions that are impossible with current instrumentation. For example,
the possibility of getting ultra-fast time resolution to study fast processes
such as magnetic domain wall motion will be explored. As another example,
fundamental research on the imaging of soft materials is proposed. Soft
materials are hard to image for currently available microscopes because the tips
can deform them. Though much progress has been made, more remains to be done.
Microscopes can now image some soft surfaces but they have a hard time imaging
polymers weakly attached to surfaces or processes involving aggregation of
polymer chains. The long term goal is the creation of better materials as the
result of fundamental studies done on the formation of materials with new
microscopes and new ways to operate those new microscopes.
