9619746 RALEIGH This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel MOANA WAVE a Navy-owned ship operated by the University
of Hawaii and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The
Ship`oard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Barry C.
Raleigh is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
equipment. This project will allow the institution to acquire an oily water
separator, a reverse osmosis water maker membrane care unit and an oil
containment boom and to repair the overhead in the ship's laboratory. ***
