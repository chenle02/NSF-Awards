The award is for partial funding in support of the "International Conference on
Cold Warm Forging Technology - 1992," to be held at Ohio State University in
October, 1992. The conference will address issues related to the improvement of
productivity in cold and warm forming and in the adaptation of low temperature
forging processes to the forming of parts that are conventionally formed by hot
forging. The funds will be applied to defraying part of the travel costs of
seven invited speakers from universities in Europe and Japan, where the subject
technologies are much further advanced than in the United States. This will
allow United States attendees to be exposed to cutting edge technologies from
abroad and will encourage the diffusion knowledge concerning the best available
manufacturing technologies, worldwide, into the manufacturing research
community, in industry and at universities.
