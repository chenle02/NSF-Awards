9310633 Moyer Science and technology are a part of culture. They both shape and
are shaped by the society that creates them. To understand contemporary American
society and American science, one must understand its sources. Joseph Henry,
physicist, founding member and president of the National Academy of Science,
first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, played a central role not only
in creating an American style of science, but also for creating the major
institutions that have nurtured the develop of science in America. Dr. Albert
Moyer is undertaking a three year study of Joseph Henry and his pivotal role in
shaping the ideas and institutions of American science. He is also probing
Henry's more subtle impact on individuals and ideology in the United States
during a crucial, formative era--an era in which he came to symbolize the ideal
scientist and even "American science" itself. Dr. Moyer's study also reveals how
Henry himself was being shaped by contemporary practices, interactions, and
beliefs at home and abroad. In effect, this study is the story of the
"invention" of American science, to the extent that Henry helped forge a modern
vision of the scientist and science in American society. ***
