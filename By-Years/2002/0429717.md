PROPOSAL NO: 0429717&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Cincinnati Main
Campus&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Vemuri, Ranga&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
Performance Macromodeling for Synthesis of Electronic
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any engineering design process consists
of two broad activities: Analysis and Synthesis. Analysis is the process of
predicting the performance of a given design. Synthesis is the process of
proposing alternative designs. During any real-world design process, analysis
and synthesis tasks are carried out repeatedly until a suitable design is found.
Computer-aided design systems use synthesis software which generates a large
number of designs each of which is analyzed by an analysis software module. For
this process to converge to an acceptable design in a reasonable time, the
analysis processes must be fast and accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional
analysis methods use simulation of the design using detailed models of the
design building blocks. Unfortunately, this approach, while fairly accurate, is
quite slow for use in conjunction with automated design systems. An alternative
is to use performance macromodels which are fast, but tend to be less accurate.
This research addresses the problem of developing fast, yet accurate,
performance macromodels. Although this research will use applications in
electronics design to guide the research direction and to evaluate the research
results, the techniques developed will be broadly useful across any engineering
design discipline. Thus, this research has the potential to make significant
contributions to the development of efficient software systems for fully
automated engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
