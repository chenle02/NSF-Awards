This is a SUNY College at Brockport three-year program to integrate real-world
applications into the mathematics curriculum of the secondary schools in New
York. In each of two summers, fifteen teams of two teachers each will
participate in a four-week workshop with project staff and industry
representatives to become acquainted with a wide range of applications. The
teams will prepare materials for their own use, then share their materials and
experiences with colleagues in in- service workshops and with students in class.
The total number of participating teachers is sixty. Much of the project will
center around the new twelfth grade precalculus course under development by the
New York State Education Department. The recently revised three-year integrated
sequence for 9-11 will provide a secondary focus of effort. A strong effort to
ensure participation by under-represented groups is included. Suny Brockport,
the sixty participating districts, and the New York State Education Department
will contribute an amount equal to 88% of the National Science Foundation
request.
