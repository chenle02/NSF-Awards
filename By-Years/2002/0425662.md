Pugh&lt;br/&gt;0425662&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this research is
to construct a computational model that replicates changes in gene expression in
response to experimental perturbations of the transcription machinery. Hence,
there is a strong coupling between the construction and validation effort for
the computational model on the one hand and experimental observations on the
other. As elaborated in the body of the proposal, the number of potential
experiments that can be attempted to fully test all possible response
permutations is beyond exhaustive experimentation or computation, necessitating
the following simplifying compromise: (1) Construction and validation mode: The
trove of existing experimental results will be employed in this mode. A portion
of the data will be used in constructing the model, i.e. computing its
parameters, then the remaining data will be used to validate and refine the
constructed model, (2) Predictive mode: The model will be executed for new
settings not in the experimental database that will then be verified
experimentally. Some of the cases will break the model and new parameters will
be computed to satisfy previously catalogued experiments. When a new set of
parameters cannot be found this will indicate deficiency of the model and a new
connection scheme will be sought and verified. The validation sequence is then
repeated, and (3) Prospective mode: An important utility of the computational
model is to guide future experiments by identifying new experiments to perform
that are deemed interesting from the biochemical/ biological viewpoint based on
certain criteria. Achievement of these objectives and the computational tools
that enable them will establish the framework for a comprehensive model of
transcription complex assembly in yeast.&lt;br/&gt;
