With the general goals of better understanding the ecological and evolutionary
consequences of behavioral, anatomical, developmental, and physiological
variation, we will use the capacity to adequately record and analyze animal
motion for the study of a wide variety of behaviors and functions in vertebrates
and invertebrates. By studying different individuals within a single species and
different species, motion analysis will be used to define, quantify and compare
different behaviors (movements) and determine the relative effectiveness of
animals performing tasks such as sprinting locomotion, feeling, and
communicating with potential mates. Simultaneous records of motion and muscle
activity, will be used to examine the neural control of animal movements and its
evolutionary interrelationships with anatomical variation. Playback experiments
using video images modified with animation techniques will be used to asses the
relative importance of different movements versus anatomy in the species
recognition and mating behaviors.
