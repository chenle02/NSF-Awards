There are many problems whose solutions take the form of patterns that may be
expressed using grammars (e.g., speech recognition, text processing, genetic
sequencing, programming language development, etc.). Construction of these
grammars is usually carried out by computer scientists working with domain
experts. Grammar inference (GI) is the process of learning a grammar from
examples, either positive (i.e., the pattern should be recognized by the
grammar) and/or negative (i.e., the pattern should not be recognized by the
grammar). This research makes a fundamental contribution toward software
engineering and grammar inference technology by: 1) advancing GI algorithms
which may also have new applications in other areas of computer science (e.g.,
bioinformatics), 2) facilitating development of domain-specific languages
(DSL's) for domain experts, thus increasing productivity and reliability, and 3)
providing tools for recovering software model descriptions (metamodels) from
models which have evolved independently of the metamodel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Memetic programming (MP) will be researched for recovering DSL's from example
programs. MP extends genetic programming with local search and provides more
effective solutions to many NP-hard problems. A local search technique based on
incremental learning of context-free grammars (CFG's) will be developed along
with memetic algorithms for CFG induction, in order to allow inference of DSL's.
To perform metamodel inference, this research will: 1) improve abstraction
hierarchy inference algorithms for metamodels, 2) recover the type information
of metamodel entities, using program transformation, and 3) infer the
modularization of large multi-tiered metamodels. These advancements are expected
to allow inference of detailed, accurate and large scale metamodels.&lt;br/&gt;
