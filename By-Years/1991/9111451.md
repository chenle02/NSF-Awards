The training program, "Molecular Approaches to Ion Channels", will provide
advanced graduate students and professional scientists with in-depth exposure to
a modern, multi-disciplinary approach to the study of ion channels in cell
membranes at the molecular level. Methods covered include patch clamp applied to
native cells and transformed cells expressing cloned gene products, and
biochemical and molecular analysis of channel expression. Training provided by
this course will directly have an impact on the scientific community by guiding
the efforts of students and established investigators who are seeking to explore
new aspects of current research problems.
