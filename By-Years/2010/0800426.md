The aim of this project is to further the understanding of how vertex algebras
are related to geometry of manifolds. While vertex algebras, a relatively new
concept in algebra, have always been understood as an essential part of
conformal field theory, their relation to higher dimensional geometry, even
though implicit in string theory, had been rather obscure for a while. In 1998
Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob proposed the notion of chiral differential
operators as a direct such link. Later work has found several applications of
this new theory and, rather recently, Witten and Kapustin identified algebras of
chiral differential operators with the so-called Witten half-twisted model in
string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One characteristic feature of
this proposal is that it truly belongs to the interface of several disparate
disciplines, such as algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. Indeed, vertex
algebras are purely algebraic objects, which only relatively recently were found
to be closely related to geometry of manifolds. On the other hand, this area of
research is essentially a mathematical counterpart of the physics of strings.
The results of the proposal are therefore expected to have a broad impact on
research community.&lt;br/&gt;
