This is an award to support research on a biotechnological process for removal
of organic substances from highly saline wastewaters produced in manufacturing
chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides and polyhydric chemicals. The process
being studied is conducted in a periodically operated sequencing batch reactor
within which halophilic microbes are suspended. They also become attached to the
exterior of gas-permeable silicone tubing that is submerged in the wastewater
and through which oxygen is passed. The oxygen required for respiratory needs by
the biofilm diffuses through the tubing and into the biofilm. Saline wastewaters
resulting from industrial processes have the potential for being made less
environmentally damaging by a process that removes organic contaminants from
them before being reused or discharged to the environment. Results of this
research are expected to provide the basis for engineering design of an
innovative biotechnological process for treatment of highly saline wastewaters
such as those produced in the manufacture of pesticides, herbicides and
polyhydric chemicals. ***
