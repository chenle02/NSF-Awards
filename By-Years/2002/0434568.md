With this Chemical Bonding Center (CBC) Phase I, Step II award, the Division of
Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate jointly support the research of Karen I. Goldberg,
of the University of Washington, who will lead a collaborative of twelve PIs
from a variety of institutions in investigations of the activation and
transformation of strong chemical bonds. This CBC brings together chemists with
expertise in synthetic methodology, catalysis, computational chemistry, and
spectroscopy with the goal of developing efficient and environmentally friendly
methods of synthesizing organic materials. This innovative approach to chemical
transformations, which focuses on the activation of strong bonds rather than on
functional group modification, will allow utilization of chemical feedstocks
ranging in complexity from natural gas to complex biological molecules. These
investigations are expected to have major impact on large scale industrial
chemistry, pharmaceutical synthesis, and chemical recycling. This CBC, with its
focus on modern environmentally benign solutions to a historical chemical
problem of major significance, will provide important training for students and
increase public awareness of the role of chemistry as a driver in solutions of
societal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical Bonding Centers are designed
to focus innovative collaborative efforts that address a "big problem" which
will lead to a major advance in chemistry or at the interface of chemistry and
other sciences and will have the potential to attract broad scientific and
public interest.&lt;br/&gt;
