The physical processes involved in the generation, maintenance, and dissipation
of marine stratocumulus will be studies using observations and theoretical
models. These processes will be represented (or parameterized) in the current
version of the NCAR community Climate Model (CCM) to provide improved
simulations of low-level cloudiness and the associated surface fluxes of
moisture and energy for both solid and partially cloud conditions. The
thermodynamic and dynamic models that will be used to develop this
parameterization will be tested and developed by using data collected from
aircraft and satellite observations made off the coast of southern California
from June 29 to July 19, 1987 during the field phase of the First International
Satellite Cloud Climatology Regional Experiment (FIRE) and by a regional
application of the parameterization. These studies will make use of mean,
turbulence,cloud microphysics, and radiation measurements obtained from NCAR
Electra and the UK C-130, cloud observations from satellites, and synoptic-scale
analyses from the ECMWF. The focus of the proposed process studies will be on
entrainment and mixing at cloud top,convective circulations in marine
stratocumulus, and factors that control the spatial and temporal variations in
the cloud structure. The theoretical work will involve the use of a radiatively-
forced 18-coefficient moist spectral model that include horizontally varying
cloud- based and cloud-top heights an dan above-cloud inversion layer. The
theoretical results from this model will be compared with the structure obtained
from the FIRE measurements and will provide the dynamical basis for the
circulation velocities that are parameterized in the boundary layer model that
will be embedded in the CCM. This research is important because it intends to
increase understanding of how clouds influence climate.
