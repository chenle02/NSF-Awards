The goal of this proposal is to provide the essential practical counterparts to
lectures, textbooks, and the primary research literature relevant to the study
of proteins and nucleic acids. The liquid chromatography system and a
scintillation counter acquired are used to introduce students to these
instruments in the context of structured laboratory investigations in
intermediate and advanced courses. Subsequently, students are given the
opportunity to integrate their literature-based and practical knowledge in the
design and performance of independent research projects that incorporate
chromatographic methods and use of radioisotopes.
