9711076 Smith It has long been known that mountains influence not only local,
but also regional and synoptic-scale weather. The understanding of how mountains
influence the weather and climate has advanced considerably over the last forty
years, but there remain significant areas of uncertainty which limit accurate
weather forecasting and environmental decision making. Two important scientific
frontiers are (1) the influence of mesoscale mountain features on regional,
synoptic and global weather patterns and (2) new technologies for observing
orographic influences and testing numerical models. Methodology to be utilized
by the Principal Investigator will include the use of theoretical fluid
mechanics and numerical calculations using a simple, two-layer fluid model and
an advanced three-dimensional mesoscale numerical model. Additionally, the
Principal Investigator will pursue a variety of observational techniques by
conducting small, focused field efforts. The Principal Investigator also will be
a major participant and coordinator of the U.S. component of a large,
international research project know as the Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP). The
MAP will focus on several aspects of the impact of mountains on local, regional
and synoptic-scale weather. Successful completion of this research will result
in enhanced knowledge of the impacts of orography on weather. This may lead to
better representations of orographic impacts in numerical models which in turn
could result in improved weather forecasts. ***
