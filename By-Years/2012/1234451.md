The objective of this research is to develop prognostic methods for improving
the safety and availability of battery-powered systems such as electric vehicles
and unmanned aerial vehicles. Battery-powered systems suffer from two problems.
The first is "range anxiety" problem, which refers to the fear of running out of
battery power during vehicle operation. The second problem is related to the
safety of a battery pack, which can rupture or even explode under certain
conditions. To address these problems, an approach for predicting the (1) end-
of-discharge (the time at which a battery will run out of electrical charge),
and (2) remaining-useful-performance of a battery with a known level of
confidence will be developed. This approach involved machine learning algorithms
to address future loading conditions, unit-to-unit variations, and modeling
uncertainties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve the operation
readiness and safety of battery-powered systems that are used in applications
ranging from commercial (electric vehicles) to defense (unmanned aerial
vehicles) sectors. In 2011, President Obama announced his goal of having one
million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. The proposed research will make
significant contributions to reaching this target, since it can ease user
concern about the safety and reliability of electric vehicles by providing
robust battery state and health information in real-time, thus encouraging their
widespread use. As a result, it will also decrease US dependence on foreign oil
and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The content of this research will
assist in the advancement of prognostics and health management techniques which
will be disseminated to the engineering community through online graduate
courses, seminars, workshops, and short courses thereby benefiting people from
academia, industry and the military.
