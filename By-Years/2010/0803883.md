&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307912&lt;br/&gt;Gaskell&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his
extensive set of collaborators will carry out a large-scale, four-year, multi-
observatory, international study of the regions surrounding the super-massive
black holes in active galactic nuclei, with two main objectives: (1) to
understand how to produce the intense radiation seen, especially the X-ray,
ultraviolet, and optical emission, and (2) to study the distribution and motions
of the dense gas close to the black holes by using its response to variations in
the ionizing radiation. Simultaneous ground-based optical continuum observations
and space-based X-ray measurements will be the largest study undertaken to
address the question of the relationship between these two emissions. Collecting
a large homogeneous sample of high signal-to-noise optical spectra to combine
with the X-ray and continuum data will permit "reverberation mapping" of the
rapidly moving dense gas close to the black
hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant effort is devoted to developing
international partnerships between the US, Mexico, China, and observatories in
the Former Soviet Union (FSU) republics of Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The wide range of longitudes spanned by the FSU sites
fills in the problematic "Asian gap" in previous studies, enhancing the
capability to do time series analysis, and permitting studies on shorter
timescales than before. The project has heavy student involvement, extending to
gifted high school students, with significant participation at the PI's
University by under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;***
