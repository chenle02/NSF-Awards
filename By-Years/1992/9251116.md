The Department of Geology is purchasing microscope equipment for use in a
variety of geology courses, undergraduate research, and lecture demonstrations.
This acquisition represents a major step in the modernization of the geology
curriculum. In the economic geology course, microscopic studies are carried out
on a number of ore and mineral samples. In petrology courses, students are able
to use the reflective capabilities of the instrument to study various silicate
systems. A recent undergraduate research project involved a study of ore
mineralization adjacent to a granitic dike.
