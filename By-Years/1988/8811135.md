This proposal is to examine parallel computing for network optimization problem
from three different directions: small scale parallelism and vector
supercomputing, medium scale parallelism, and massively parallel computing. A
primal truncated Newton algorithm will be specialized for the environment of
vector and multiprocessor supercomputers. Novel algorithms based on speculative
decomposition will be implemented on medium scale parallel computers. The
suitability of massively parallel computers - - with thousands of processing
elements - - will be investigated using distributed relaxation algorithms. A
comparison across algorithms and machines and with currently used procedures
will be used with real data. The final goal is to solve ultra-large problems
having about 10,000 nodes and 1,000,000 arcs.
