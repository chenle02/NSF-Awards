A novel pH-dependent locus ina, mapping at 48.5 min, has been isolated through
lacZ operon fusions in Escherichia coli. This locus exhibits pH-dependent
induction by membrane-permeable weak acids and by protonophores, but not by
external acidification alone. These data could be explained by the detection of
internal acidification by ina. The ina fusions will be cloned and sequenced, and
the sequence analyzed for promoters and regulatory sites. Acid-sensitivity of
the regulatory DNA will be tested by in vitro transcription of the cloned
fusions. The possible regulatory role of H-palindromes, which produce H-form DNA
at low pH, will be investigated. Regulator genes for ina will be isolated, by
screening Tn10 insertions and ethylmethanesulfonate mutants for isolates which
are either constitutive or uninducible. Interactive activities include teaching
a course in molecular biology, presenting a public lecture on the topic of women
and science, and forming a support group for young scientists attempting to
balance competitive research careers with family life. This project furthers VPW
program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF
and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by
providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
