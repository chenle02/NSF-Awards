Almost all software today is developed in two stages. First, a human writes a
program and subsequently various automated tools process that program to produce
the actual computer code that is the software application. Over time,
researchers have found ways to shift more of the burden of developing software
from the programmer to the automated tools, which has gradually made software
development more and more productive. One area of software development that has
not changed for a couple of decades is the way in which the structure of data is
programmed. The organization of data is still described in relatively low-level
terms as links between individual objects in memory, which is too low-level for
the tools to reason successfully about. As a result, programmers must spend
significant time hand-coding and tuning their data structures, and there are
significant missed opportunities for improvements to program performance,
correctness, and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to try a new approach
to this problem, consisting of two parts: we will synthesize data structures
from high-level relational specifications. We will also use inference techniques
to automatically analyze the program?s use of the relations. In a relational
style of programming explicit pointers are eliminated, removing one of the
biggest impediments to automatic reasoning. We believe recent advances in the
analysis of control flow, destructive updates, and low-level indexing operations
make it feasible to capture most other aspects of
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, programs, including concurrent
programs, will be written at a higher level and be more easily retargeted to new
situations because the data representations are not fixed in advance, and tools
will be able to do a more reliable, efficient, and scalable job of optimizing
resources and verifying properties of programs. As part of the project, we will
seek to demonstrate these benefits by conducting studies of our techniques
applied to realistic challenge applications.
