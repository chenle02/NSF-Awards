This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Lerner's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at Oregon State
University. The thrust of Dr. Lerner's research is the synthesis of highly
oxidized graphite fluorides by novel chemical routes. The synthesis to be
examined will not employ elemental fluorine as an oxidant. Instead, powerful,
but convenient, oxidants such as Mn(VII) and Cr(VI) in combination with
solutions containing small, readily-intercalated ions such as fluoride or
bifluoride will be utilized. These reactions can be carried out under ambient
conditions in aqueous acid solvents. A variation will be to employ graphite
salts such as those of stable fluorometallate or oxometallate anions rather than
graphite as a starting material. The structural, electronic and electrochemical
properties of the graphite fluorides will be examined by X-ray diffraction,
4-probe conductivity measurements, vibrational spectroscopy and coulometric
reduction.
