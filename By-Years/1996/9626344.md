9626344 Vitek This study is a combined, experimental and theoretical project on
mechanisms of plastic deformation in titanium aluminide, TiAl. The experimental
portion is used as input for the theoretical portion and vice versa. The
objectives of the study are to fully characterize and identify the deformation
modes in polysynthetically twinned single crystals and in lamellar polycrystals
of TiAl-based alloys, to show how deformation is transmitted across the various
types of boundaries (including domain and grain boundaries), and to determine
the sources of the dislocations and twins. The experimental techniques to be
employed are mechanical tests on single crystals and polycrystals, followed by
characterization of the deformation modes using optical, atomic force, and
transmission electron microscopy. The theoretical program involves atomistic
modeling of dislocation core structures, interfacial reactions, and twinning
processes, using a variety of interatomic potentials. The potentials to be used
are the embedded atom and/or Finnis-Sinclair type, as well as quantum
mechanically- based bond order potentials. The development of new interatomic
potentials for use in this non-cubic structure will be an important part of the
program, as will the development of new experimental techniques for the
determination of deformation modes. %%% The results of the study are expected to
be of great utility in understanding how, and under what circumstances, low
symmetry materials can be toughened. Furthermore, it could show what techniques
might be used to toughen intermetallic compounds. ***
