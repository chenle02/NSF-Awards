Among the most pressing issues facing society today is the need to transition
from dependence on fossil fuels to alternative renewable fuel sources. Alcohol
derived from a plant material called cellulose is considered to be one such
alternative. Cellulose, a major component of woody and leafy plants, is one of
the most abundant biomaterials on earth and constitutes a major potential source
of renewable energy. However, to take advantage of this energy, efficient enzyme
systems must be identified that can convert cellulose to its component sugars
and then to alcohol. Shipworms are wormlike wood boring marine clams that
contain such enzyme systems. Shipworms are the only marine animals that are
known to grow and reproduce normally with wood as their sole food source. This
unusual ability may be due, at least in part, to their association with a
consortium of intracellular symbiotic bacteria. These symbionts are thought to
provide shipworms with enzymes that aid in wood digestion. The purpose of this
research project is to use advanced methods of genomics, proteomics and imaging
to 1) uncover the physiological and enzymatic systems that allow shipworms to
thrive on this unusual diet, 2) reproduce these enzymes in the laboratory, and
3) evaluate qualities of these enzymes that may be useful for development of
commercial cellulosic alcohol production. The research will also help to broaden
scientific understanding of beneficial interactions between bacteria and
animals. The project will result in the training of one postdoctoral research
scientist, as well as several high school and college level interns through the
Ocean Genome Legacy's active educational outreach programs.
