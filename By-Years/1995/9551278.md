"Retooling Mathematics" addresses the modernization of the undergraduate
mathematics curriculum in a complex educational system involving several hundred
secondary schools, seven 2-year colleges, and a large university. The basic
approach of this project is the incremental implementation of precalculus and
calculus reform curricula at the University of Reform Movement, with frequent
assessments and dissemination of information, coupled with continuing education
courses to train secondary school and 2-year college teachers. Women and
minorities are a special focus of "Retooling Mathematics." The project tracks
how these groups respond, both materially and by attitude, to the reform
curriculum relative to other students. Finally, the facility is used to enhance
the undergraduate research program, particularly the summer research programs
for minorities and the less privileged.
