This one and one-half day workshop will focus on the meanings, implications and
impact of increased transparency and accountability in scientific research and
scholarship for qualitative research. The workshop brings together practitioners
from the disciplines of political science, sociology and anthropology to discuss
the multiple meanings of transparency and accountability, both across and within
different practices of science. This workshop focuses on ethical questions about
the when, why, where and how of the impact of evaluation, transparency and
accountability on qualitative work. The research agenda developed from this
workshop will be of interest to researchers, policymakers and participants in
qualitative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together
qualitative researchers to focus on: (1) underlying assumptions of various calls
to "make transparent" particular kinds of qualitative research data; (2)
clarification of appropriate implementation activities to increase transparency;
(3) the role of professional associations in discussion, development, and
implementation of disciplinary standards; and (4) the role of data management
plans in qualitative accountability. The workshop will contribute to improved
understanding of issues arising from the calls for data access and transparency
in the context of qualitative research. It will generate a white paper on the
challenges identified for qualitative research, transcparency and
accountability.
