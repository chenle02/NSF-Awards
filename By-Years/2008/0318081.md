The proposal is funded to determine the connection among productivity,
ventilation, and sea surface temperature climate variability at decadal to
orbital time scales from the Peru Margin, a region sensitive to ENSO.
Reconstruction will be based primarily on examining denitrification processes in
existing very high resolution cores from the Peru Margin. The proposed will use
the newly developed 14C dating technique using alkenones.&lt;br/&gt;
