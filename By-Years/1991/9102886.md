This project is concerned with the regularity theory for a class of nonlinear
elliptic equations and associated variational problems involving derivatives of
the rearrangement of solutions, as well as related questions concerning convex
symmetrization. The main emphasis is to be placed on variational problems which
are approximable by sequences of multilayer free boundary problems. Regularity
and structure of the level surfaces of solutions will be studied. This project
has been motivated by a model of quasi static equilibrium of confined toroidal
plasmas in thermonuclear fusion research, and the study of rotational fluid
flow. The technical questions to be addressed have fundamental implications in
areas such as fusion energy.
