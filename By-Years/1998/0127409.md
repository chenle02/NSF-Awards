Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;Based on knowledge and skills
developed in a previous CCLI grant we intend to develop CD-ROM based tutorials
on functional materials. These CD-ROM based tutorials are designed, using a
blackboard analogy, to support important classes of functional materials that
are currently missing from introductory material science curricula. The
tutorials will be contained on CD-ROMs that will receive international
distribution. They, along with an included interactive Glossary and an
Animation/Video player will be available for&lt;br/&gt;instructors who wish to
use them to support traditional lecture courses. The tutorials, along with the
textbook being written to accompany them, could be used in a number of other
learning situations, including distance learning, continuing education, and
courses at institutions that do not have an engineering curriculum. The topics
covered will include dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, magnetostrictive,
and optical properties of materials. In this project we plan to create a new set
of interactive, self-paced, multimedia tutorials for a new sophomore engineering
course being developed at the University of Pennsylvania. The subject matter
will be structured using a case study approach. Our new tutorials are designed
to enhance student learning before a lecture is given. The material in these
tutorials will be used to introduce students to specific materials concepts that
they will be tested on before the lecture. We plan to use these materials in
conjunction with a textbook. Our long range goal is to create a collection of
online instructional materials that serve as the core for a one semester
freshman level course. &lt;br/&gt;
