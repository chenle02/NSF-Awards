The Government of China has introduced significant reforms into the country's
scientific system during the past decade and has increased financial investments
into the system substantially. The objectives of these actions are to support
the country's drive towards modernization. This award will support a major
international conference to assess the actual and potential contributions that
science and technology are making, and are likely to make, to China's
modernization and globalization aspirations, as well as to global scientific
progress. Participants will include established scholars working in the area of
Chinese science and technology, younger scholars, individuals with working
knowledge of multinational firms in China, as well as government officials. The
conference will result in a publication containing edited versions of the
scholarly presentations from the conference. This publication will be the first
major assessment of China's actual and potential scientific and technological
trajectory in over a decade
