Susan E. Hanson Rutgers University The objective of the Research Workshop
proposal is to stimulate development of a comprehensive geographical perspective
on urban sustainability. The workshop will bring together approximately 20
geographers working in three sub-fields that heretofore have been relatively
separate and distinct. There are six goals. These include placing urban
sustainability on the research agenda within geography, establishing lines of
communication between leading geographers in disparate realms of inquiry,
salvage the concept of urban sustainability, rethink the ways in which graduate
students should be trained and to develop and disseminate a research agenda on
this theme. The workshop will be held at the Center for Urban Policy research at
Rutgers University in June, 1998.
