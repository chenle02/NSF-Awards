This is a workshop in which a relatively small number (19) of neuroscientists
are brought together for intensive discussions of principles of how the cerebral
cortex functions. The group includes experts in many disciplines, such as
neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, brain theory, and psychophysics. The format of
the workshop is that each will present his/her views on how some part of the
cortex functions. This is followed by general discussions, which includes
critical analysis of such concepts and principles as the roles of layers,
multiple maps, columns, reorganization and plasticity, dynamic timing and
synchrony, learning by selection, statistical fluctuations, and connectivity.
The proceedings will be recorded stenographically and the transcript will be
edited into a publishable report.
