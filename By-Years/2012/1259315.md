Stanford University doctoral student Yasemin Ipek Can, supervised by Dr. Sylvia
Yanagisako, will undertake research on public space and youth activism in post-
conflict societies. The research will be conducted in Lebanon where there has
been a recent valorization of youth (shabaab) activism. She will study the
popular and dynamic notion of shabaab in Lebanon both as a social agent that
claims control over the public space and as representative of Lebanese identity.
Focusing on youth activism offers a unique lens for understanding everyday
contestations, anxieties, and anticipations of the future in the context of
post-civil war sectarian polarization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ipek Can will
conduct 12 months of fieldwork in Beirut where she will examine everyday youth
social interaction in two multi-sectarian neighborhoods. Her methodology will
combine traditional ethnographic methods with insights from linguistic
anthropology and social network analysis in order to document the diverse
dynamics of interaction among young people. Life history interviews with young
residents, participant observation of their family settings, everyday gatherings
and conversations, and analysis of their use of social media will be supported
with social network analysis. This research also entails semi-structured
interviews with state officials, local governors and youth-based NGOs, as well
as content analyses of their published materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will be a pioneering ethnography for theorizing the affective and
temporal dimensions of identity and belonging among youth in post-conflict
societies. The findings of this research will also increase collaboration among
Lebanese scholars, Lebanese government, local youth-based NGOs, transnational
organizations focusing on youth, and scholars studying youth, sectarianism,
conflict-resolution, everyday publics, affect, temporality and the role of
language in everyday social interaction. Funding this research also supports the
education of a graduate student.
