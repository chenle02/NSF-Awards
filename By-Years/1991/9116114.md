This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment for the
research vessel MOANA WAVE a Navy-owned ship operated by the University of
Hawaii and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The Shipboard
Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed
essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program
provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment
such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the
location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers
and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and
other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and
from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Keith W. Kaulum is fully
qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in managing
the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This action transfers
funds to the Office of Naval Research, (ONR). NSF and ONR are contributing equal
shares toward a new hydrographic winch for the R/V MOANA WAVE.
