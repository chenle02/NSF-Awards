The need to concentrate optical radiation to dimensions less than a wavelength
will increase as lightwave technology develops. This will arise out of the
desire to have an increasing conentration of devices per unit wavelength squared
as well as the necessity to guide optical radiation among the devices. The
present effort is directed toward this end. Beginning with a micropipette, a
fiber having exceedingly small dimensions is drawn.
