Professor David J. Wilson of Vanderbilt University is a recognized leader in the
fields of flotation science and colloid absorption. These separation methods are
established in several commercial processes including ore treatment and advanced
wastewater treatment. The potential and needs from several other applications
are great. Professor Wilson is one of the few people using NMR analysis to study
the nature and bonding of sorbed species. The thrust of this proposed research
will feature several kinds of sulfur compounds and certain phosphorous species.
This work will be very relevant in the improvement of specificity of the
technique. I recommend that Vanderbilt University be given a 2-year continuing
grant to support Professor Wilson's research in the amount of $45,000 for each
of the 2 years.
