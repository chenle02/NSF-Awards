This project will engage and inspire the next generation of computational
scientists&lt;br/&gt;through a series of training and engagement activities,
including: a four-day Open&lt;br/&gt;Science Grid User School for undergraduate
and graduate students; participation by&lt;br/&gt;students in the XSEDE12
conference; and supporting attendance by XSEDE Campus&lt;br/&gt;Champions from
minority serving institutions (MSIs) and smaller colleges
and&lt;br/&gt;universities at the XSEDE12 conference. These activities build on
prior successes with&lt;br/&gt;the TeraGrid student program and OSG Summer
School and expand the breadth of the&lt;br/&gt;impact that XSEDE and OSG will
have with the participating students.
