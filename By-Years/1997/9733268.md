ABSTRACT CTS-9733268 Randall Q. Snurr/ Northwestern U. This grant is awarded
through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Randall Snurr at
Northwestern University. The objectives of the project are (1) to develop a
research and educational program in the area of applied molecular modeling for
engineering design (2) to use molecular modeling together with experiment to
determine the role of molecular segregation in adsorption thermodynamics and
transport in molecular sieves. The elucidation of molecular segregation in
adsorbed systems is a focus of the research effort, and molecular simulation
will be used to determine why segregation occurs and how it affects diffusion
and adsorption characteristics in zeolites. The educational plans address the
development of graduate courses, the development of short modules introducing
molecular concepts to the undergraduate curriculum and providing continuing
education opportunities on molecular modeling and computational chemistry. The
chemical process industries face several challenges in tailoring products and
processes to meet the demands for improved economics and environmental
friendliness. These challenges require design at the molecular level for the
next generation of materials for chemical separations and reaction. Molecular
modeling is a tool that can deliver an understanding of molecular-level
phenomena and the link between microscopic and macroscopic properties. The
molecular understanding provided by modeling can lead to new and improved
chemical processes.
