A grant has been awarded to Dr. Edwin M. Westbrook at the Molecular Biology
Consortium (MBC) in Chicago, to develop a state-of-the-art X-ray detector for
structural molecular biology research. When the prototype has been completed, it
will set the standard for future detectors in this class. The application for
this detector is protein crystallography, to be conducted at a synchrotron
beamline of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBL). Protein crystallography is progressively taking advantage of
the nation's synchrotron X-ray sources, because they provide million-fold
brighter X-ray beams than can be had at home laboratories, and the beam is also
much narrower and of more uniform energy. Once the molecular biology community
learned to use these magnificent beamlines, enormous advances have been made in
structural knowledge of biological systems at the molecular level. Recent
determination of the molecular structures of the ribosome subunits and of the
RNA polymerase II are merely examples of results that could not have been
achieved without synchrotron X rays. The detector that will be developed in this
project will further amplify the capabilities of the synchrotron beamline on
which it will be installed.&lt;br/&gt;While the science of molecular biology is
the driving reason for developing this detector, the project itself will be
predominantly one of electronic engineering. The detector will feature advanced
new Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) that have recently been developed that have
lower noise and faster performance than previous CCDs. Application-Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) will be
integrated into the control system of the detector, and its readout system will
be the new S-LINK parallel fiberoptic interface. The MBC electronics group is
well known for its extremely low-noise analog electronics, but this detector
will also feature radically new digital signal processing to reduce the
uncertainty of reading the electronic charge of each CCD pixel, permitting up to
18-bit readout registration.&lt;br/&gt;The new detector will have a square
active area 32 cm on each side, that can be repetitively observed every 0.67
seconds. It will have a dynamic range- the ratio of strongest/weakest signals it
can simultaneously detect- exceeding 250,000:1. Its spatial resolution will
permit neighboring Bragg spots to be measured even when they are only 0.6 mm
apart, so this detector will be able to resolve over 500 spots across its 32 cm
width. All of these characteristic parameters exceed those of existing
crystallographic detectors, and taken together as a whole this detector will be
dramatically better than any now available.&lt;br/&gt;
