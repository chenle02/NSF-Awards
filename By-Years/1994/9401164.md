Levine The principal investigator will continue his study of the motivic
category and other related constructions. He will investigate the relationship
between the integral motivic cohomology and Bloch's higher Chow groups, to
construct a weight structure and a duality on the motivic category, and to
relate the motivic Tate category with the motivic Lie algebra constructed by
Bloch and Kriz. He plans to lift various constructions in Hodge theory to the
motivic setting and to study mod n motivic cohomology. The principal
investigator will also use some new ideas of Hoobler to attack Kato's conjecture
and will give a construction of a candidate for weight two cohomology. This
research is concerned with algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic
K-theory concerns the evolution of concepts from linear algebra such as basis
and vector space. This work has significant implications for number theory and
algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections between a number
of different areas in mathematics. ***
