This grant provides funding to support a Student Travel Program for the 2023
IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)
that will be held June 28 to July 1, 2023, in Seattle, Washington. The AIM has,
for over 25 years, been the worldâ€™s leading forum for scientific and engineering
researchers from all over the world who share an interest in mechatronic systems
and control theory and the applications of systems and control technology. The
conference will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers,
tutorial sessions, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE/ASME AIM provides a unique opportunity
for students to interact with members of the professional community in a
stimulating setting and to exchange ideas with a broad group of colleagues. The
large number of workshops and tutorial sessions during the conference and the
interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional
opportunity for training and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
