This is a proposal for a two-day meeting. The meeting will host system reform
researchers in science, mathematics emphasizing technology. These researchers
represent a number of distinct disciplines including mathematics and science
education, organization research, technology and policy. The goal of the meeting
is to produce a working research framework by taking stock of the research from
these cross-disciplinary fields. The framework will bring some coherence to the
systemic movement from the perspective of research. The deliverable will be a
report that compares and contrasts what research models work and don't work in
an effort to better map this now burgeoning field. The ultimate deliverable will
be a series of adaptation studies that will shed light on the possibility for
research based systemic studies fundable in ROLE's quadrant IV.
