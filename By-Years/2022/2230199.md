This award will support a two-day NSF Project Scoping Workshop on the topic of
"Accelerating Progress Towards Practical Quantum Advantage". The workshop will
be hosted at the Ohio State University on June 27-28, 2022. This Project Scoping
Workshop will provide a forum for the U.S. Quantum Information, Science,
Engineering, and Technology (QISET) community to take stock of recent scientific
advancements, identify current challenges, discuss opportunities to overcome
those challenges, and map a way forward for Accelerating Progress Towards
Practical Quantum Advantage. The workshop participants will discuss
opportunities for goal-oriented, use-inspired translational research that brings
together a convergence of the physical sciences, engineering, technology,
computer science, and software engineering. If successful, such activities will
give rise to new industries and must engage all Americans – regardless of
background or location – and lead to new career opportunities in QISET. This
project advances the goals of the National Quantum Initiative
Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
