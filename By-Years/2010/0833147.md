Next-generation high-end machines will include interconnected computer nodes,
each having heterogeneous accelerators and multi-core CPUs with complex memory
hierarchy. They demand a programming model with a unified abstraction for
programming dramatically different on-chip and off-chip parallel processing
capabilities. None of the existing models is suitable for this need. The most
fundamental challenge here is natural expression of parallelism in applications
and efficient mapping of such parallelism to the hardware, including data
distribution, locality, communication, synchronization, and load balancing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research between Syracuse University
and Sandia Labs aims at developing an efficient programming model for high
performance computing (HPC) applications using multi-core and heterogeneous
processors. The specific goal of this study is to develop a high-level parallel
programming abstraction with new high-level language constrctions, data types,
and runtime library. Hardware features such as cores, memory hierarchy,
processor heterogeneity, and interconnection will be embedded in the semantics
of the language constructs and data types. The programming abstraction will
guide the design and expression of parallel algorithms in the high-level
language, mapped automatically onto the hardware for efficient execution. Users
will be free from the low-level hardware details. The approaches include: memory
virtualization,communication virtualization and processors virtualization.
