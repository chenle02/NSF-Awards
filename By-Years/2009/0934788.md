This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven science and five
mathematics majors are being awarded scholarships during each of the first three
years of the project leading to the production of thirty-six middle and high
school STEM teachers. Both one and two-year scholarships are available. Most
mathematics majors are expected be in their last two years as an undergraduate
and would receive two-year scholarships. The science majors may have already
completed an undergraduate degree and receive a one-year scholarship to complete
a MAT program or be in last two years of a five-year double major undergraduate
program and receive a two-year scholarship. The double major consists of a
science discipline major and a science education major. It is anticipated that
most of the science scholars are enrolling in the five-year undergraduate dual
major option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university has a partnership with the
North Carolina Community College system and is recruiting extensively throughout
system for students interested in a pre-college teaching career. Another partner
is the Latham Clinical Network, a thirty-five member network of school
districts. Thirty-four of the school districts are classified as high needs
districts. The Noyce scholars are completing their service requirements in one
of these largely rural high needs districts. The Scholars receive support as new
teachers through an induction program that includes a virtual learning community
as well as face-to-face mentoring.
