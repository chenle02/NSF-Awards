This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are
becoming pervasive in both civilian and military domains. Low cost and ease of
deployment of these networks necessitate the use of batteries as the primary
source of power. As a result, battery capacity has emerged as a critical design
parameter for maximizing the operational lifetime of the network. In this
project, a comprehensive battery-charge-oriented framework for energy management
in WSNs is developed. Its key novelty is its accounting of unique nonlinear
battery characteristics, including passive recharge, load-profile dependence,
and capacity fading. Such characteristics have significant impact on the usable
battery capacity, and consequently on the network lifetime. Novel, physically
justified analytical models for battery charge/discharge are exploited in
designing adaptive control strategies for data processing and communications in
a WSN, with the aim of maximizing the network lifetime. These strategies are
used to operate individual nodes as well as a hierarchical network of nodes.
Battery-aware adaptivity is performed on CPU voltage/frequency, RF transmission
power, transmission rate/modulation scheme, sleep/wakeup scheduling, cluster-
head assignment, cover selection, etc. Models and algorithms developed in this
project are validated and their feasibility demonstrated through simulations and
experimentation. The activity includes an education component involving
undergraduate and graduate students, and a strong technology transfer plan. The
project is expected to lead to novel designs and control strategies for sensor
networks, with significantly longer operational lifetime and highly efficient
energy management.
