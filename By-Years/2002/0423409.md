The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamental mechanisms
affecting the design and operation of a novel Plasma-Assisted Net-shape
Deposition (PAND) system for microfabrication. The deposition is carried out
under atmospheric pressure and this eliminates the need for high-vacuum
reactors. Plasma reactions will be carried out within the microdischarge and on
the substrate surface at the base of the reactor. The 'photolithography-less'
feature of the proposed PAND reactors will enable fabrications of sensors, small
structures and devices rapidly and inexpensively. The proposed plasma reactors
will be developed for depositing metals, dielectric materials, and polymers.
Innovative modeling strategies will be used to simulate the unique discharges
addressed here. High-resolution 'discharge physics models' will be developed for
the reactor to examine the effects of various process parameters on the
ionization and dissociation characteristics of the feed gases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the proposed research will lead
to the development of an efficient and inexpensive microfabrication process.
Significant amount of data on deposition and etching reactions under atmospheric
plasma conditions will be obtained. Such data will be useful not only for
developing the proposed reactors but also for further applications of the
atmospheric cold plasma in other scientific areas like spectroscopy.
Collaborative research in model development will be carried out with CFD
Research Corporation, Huntsville, Alabama. We also plan to partner with Trion
Technology, Tempe, Arizona - a plasma etch and deposition system company for
characterizing the microdischarge and for further development of the PAND
system.&lt;br/&gt;
