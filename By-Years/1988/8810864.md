During the last four years the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
has successfully sought to attract new faculty members who are active
researchers in several developing areas of molecular evolution. In addition, a
number of new and established researchers are increasingly beginning to
molecular techniques t answer evolutionary questions. Collaborations with
researchers in other departments such as Molecular and Cellular Biology and
Biochemistry are also increasing. These trends are expected accelerate in the
future resulting in even greater interest in utilizing the most modern
techniques which are applicable to evolutionary research in a broad range of
areas. The renovation and equipping of laboratories to meet these new research
needs has involved major capital expenditure which has largely been met through
departmental set.up funds for new faculty members and equipment purchased on the
grants of individual investigators. However, one major item of equipment, a
preparative ultracentrifuge, is still not available in the department. This
equipment is currently being borrowed from members of the Departments of
Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry and Veterinary Science (located in
another building). This is an increasing unsatisfactory arrangement for all
concerned. There are serious problems of availability and scheduling and the
goodwill of colleagues in other departments is being taxed. An ultracentrifuge
for the shared use of members of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology is therefore an urgent necessity.
