This project provides support for a 3-day workshop on the molecular engineering
of ultrathin polymeric film systems for new and emerging high technologies. The
purpose of this workshop is to create an awareness among the research community
about the technological importance of ultrathin polymeric films, to point out
the important contributions that engineering and related disciplines can make,
to highlight areas with special opportunities, and to permit NSF management ot
use the results of the workshop to assess research opportunities and, if
appropriate, to plan future funding dfforts in ultrathin film systems. In
particular, the workshop will focus on the study and use of ultrthin film
systems in laser technology, communications, electro-optical devices, integrated
circuits, storage media, biomaterials, permselective membranes, biosensors, and
catalytic active surfaces. The workshop presentations and conclusions regarding
research opportunities will be presented in a Workshop Proceedings document.
