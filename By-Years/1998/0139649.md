This award supports an REU site that was initiated in 1999 with the purpose of
introducing students and faculty members at Clark Atlanta University to
interdisciplinary studies in geosciences. Ten students are selected each year
from Clark Atlanta and other academic institutions to participate in a ten-week
summer program consisting of lectures and research projects. These activities
are designed to complement the regular program in Earth System Science (ESS) at
Clark Atlanta. The projects include data analysis and modeling activities on
topics related to (1) the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols on solar
radiation, and (2) micrometeorological processes in the atmospheric boundary
layer. The students work closely with the principal investigator in defining and
planning their research projects, writing final reports that document their
summer activities, and preparing oral and poster presentations on their research
findings. Objectives of the program are to enable students to think critically,
to encourage them to approach problems from an interdisciplinary point of view,
and to increase the number of minority students seeking graduate degrees and
careers in ESS and related areas of study.
