The goal of this project is to explore the heritable components of social
behavior. Some heritability estimates have been reported on a number of$attitude
items. A series of studies will be undertaken on the heritability of social
influence, attitude correlates, and personality. This approach extends the
current trend in social psychological research to investigate the biological and
physiological correlates of social behavior. The main question to be addressed
by this research is whether the heritability of attitudes is correlated with
other known attitude parameters.
