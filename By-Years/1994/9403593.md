Abstract BIR9403593 The purpose of this project is to maintain and improve a
well- established, well-characterized collection of maize mutants that have been
produced by treating pollen with the chemical mutagen, ethyl methanesulfonate or
other mutagenic agents. Five objectives are proposed: (1) to continue freely
sharing this collection, upon request, with all members of the scientific
community; (2) to establish a smaller "core: collection of the most interesting
stocks that will be maintainable by a single faculty member here at the
University of Missouri; (3) to provide those stocks that have been appropriately
characterized, including a duplicate of the core collection; (4) to enhance the
existing electronic database by more fully characterizing the core collection of
mutants, and to incorporate that information into the national Maize Genome
Database (Columbia, MO); and (5) to ensure that each mutant is available in a
good, well- characterized background with a good, reasonably current seed
source.
