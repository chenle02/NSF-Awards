This Noyce Capacity Building project will contribute to the national interest by
creating a viable and attractive pathway for STEM students at Neumann University
to become certified as teachers. The project aims to supply additional highly
qualified STEM teachers to meet workforce needs and to develop a partnership
with local high-need schools to ensure that the revised curriculum prepares STEM
teachers who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, competencies, and
mentorship to excel in the classroom. The project also seeks to deepen
partnerships between STEM and education faculty through the curriculum revision
process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will revise an existing degree
program leading to a Biology degree with certification in Biology and/or General
Science teaching so that it can be completed in four years rather than five.
Prior work to revise the Mathematics Education curriculum at the institution
will be leveraged to inform the revisions. Activities will include the
development of two online general education courses, which will be offered in
summer to reduce schedule crowding and allow time for early teaching experiences
during the academic year. The project will provide professional development
opportunities for STEM and education faculty, establish a formal partnership
with a local high-need school, and develop recruiting strategies involving
school visits, a showcase during the annual Science Olympiad, and targeted
redirection of existing majors. A mentoring program and induction support
activities for new teachers will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
