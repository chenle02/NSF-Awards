9706439 Zhao Measurements of the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field in the
past are critical for understanding the processes in the core that give rise to
the Earth's magnetic field, and how and why the Earth's magnetic field reverses
polarity. In addition, variation of the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field
over geologic time may signal modulation of dynamo action in the core by the
convective state of the lower mantle, and thus could also carry information
about the rates of sea-floor spreading, hot-spot volcanism and Earth's tectonic
cycle. The PIs propose studies of two important geophysical problems which are
currently debated: (1) to obtain mid-Cretaceous paleointensities (91 Ma) to
examine the question of intensity of the geomagnetic field during the Cretaceous
Superchron, in particular whether the field was persistently low or unusually
high during times of low reversal rate; (2) to determine the paleointensity from
7 Ma and 32 Ma old basalts to test whether the field strength is responsible for
the relatively higher amplitude of marine magnetic anomalies that is observed in
most of the world's oceans between 30 and 80 Ma. ***
