The funding partially supports the "Transport Phenomena in Processing"
conference being organized in Hawaii, March 1992. The objective of the
conference is to address many of the barrier transport issues e.g., heat
transfer, mass transfer, chemical reactions, fluid flow, and micro mecha-nics of
transport phenomena in processing of advanced materials. The topics addressed
will include processing issues in polymer composites, crystal growth and
advanced electronic materials, micro-mechanical issues in transport phenomena,
chemical vapor deposition, ceramics and ceramic matrix composites, and computer-
aided process analysis and simulation. A better understanding of the underlying
science related to the improvement of materials processing will allow for the
development of more productive and efficient manufacturing.
