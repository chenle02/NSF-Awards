Access to the scientific literature has changed significantly due to the
immediate availability of most new research over the World Wide Web. Taking
advantage of this opportunity, new search engine tools have been developed such
as Google Scholar and CiteSeer followed by CiteSeerX. CiteSeerX has become one
the most comprehensive and widely-used online public resources for the CISE
research community. The Semantic CiteSeerX project builds upon the work of
CiteSeerX and will continue its original goal of research assistance. It will
also provide more tools and features. Using the established CiteSeerX
infrastructure, Semantic CiteSeerX extends and enhances this resource for
community development. Semantic CiteSeerX will expand the CiteSeerX architecture
to increase use, performance, reliability and applications while continuing to
expand the breadth and depth of CiteSeerX's collection. In addition new metadata
such as algorithms, figures, tables and equations will be extracted and indexed
and this data will be provided as an RDF resource. Personalized CiteSeerX search
and author recommendations through an extension of MyCiteSeerX will be developed
by useing individual search histories combined with exploiting patterns of
citations and searches within the community. The impact of CiteSeerX and new
features will be evaluated and methods will be explored to increase the
availability of CiteSeerX as a community resource. As in the past all software
will be released open source. For more information please see:
