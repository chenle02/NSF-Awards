The project will develop a course that will involve monitoring the accumulation
of pollutants in a marsh that is used as a component of a storm water treatment
system. A high performance liquid chromatography system is being requested to
give the students necessary training on that instrument and also to serve as an
essential analytical tool in the project. The project will expose more students
to the true excitement of scientific inquiry by challenging them with
opportunities to participate in projects that investigate relevant problems.
They will define the problem, design the protocol, collect and analyze the data,
and draw serious conclusions when reporting the findings.
