Recent cutting-edge and near-future quantum devices will push the boundaries of
information processing in communication, computation, and measurement in ways
that will probe new physical realms and enhance the foundational understanding
of physics. This project studies quantum entanglement and other nonlocal
properties that power the "quantum advantage" of these revolutionary
technologies. The PI seeks to design useful applications for quantum computers
and quantum communication networks. In addition to achieving scientific progress
through new results, a major project component is scientific development of
undergraduate students through participation in real
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement a systematic
framework studying local unitary and permutational symmetries of many-body
states to probe multiparticle quantum entanglement and to develop applications
for quantum protocols. A main tool for entanglement analysis is the use of
isotropy subgroups (that is, the set of unitaries that leave a given state
invariant) of the group of local operations; the isomorphism classes of these
isotropy groups are entanglement invariants that can be used not only for
classification, but also for designing algorithms and protocols. Methodology
includes the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, representation theory and
Schur-Weyl duality, together with the proposer's past
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
