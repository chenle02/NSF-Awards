In meeting the national need for a stronger and more diverse future workforce,
the Foundation seeks and embraces contributions from all segments of the STEM
community through investments in a number of programs targeting underrepresented
populations and institutions. This LifeSTEM initiative represents another
opportunity for the Foundation to provide a mechanism for minority serving
institutions to strengthen their capacity to help the nation meet the growing
demand for a more diverse future STEM workforce. To accomplish this goal, a
workshop will be held in the Greater Washington, DC area to provide an
opportunity for representatives from surrounding minority serving institutions
to share best practices about ways to prepare and retain underrepresented
minority students in STEM fields. Specifically, the workshop will advance
knowledge and practices about high quality research and discuss ways to create,
implement, and evaluate innovative models of intervention in the life sciences
and bioscience.

In collaboration with MERAssociates, Morgan State University will host a
workshop for up to 25 teams (three to four-member) of key university
administrators, STEM educators and researchers, and sponsored research office
representatives. Through carefully crafted sessions, workshop attendees will be
able to obtain a deeper understanding of research-based practices and
interventions shown to be effective in retaining underrepresented students in
STEM pipelines. The workshop will promote foundational research methods about
STEM education, contribute to the achievement of desired societal outcomes of
increasing minority participation in STEM careers, and establish a more
connected community of scholars from institutions that produce large numbers of
underrepresented students with degrees in STEM fields.
