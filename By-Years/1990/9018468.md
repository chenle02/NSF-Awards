The primary goals of this research are an enhanced understanding of how organic
compounds respond to aqueous alteration and the relation of this response to the
observed distribution of organic compounds in petroleum, oil-field brines, low-
grade metamorphic rocks and hydrothermal fluids. These objectives will be met by
computing the relative stabilities of organic compounds in coexisting gas,
aqueous, petroleum and disseminated phases, and using these calculations to help
interpret field, analytical and experimental observations. Relative stabilities
will be evaluated from thermodynamic data as functions of temperature, pressure,
fugacities of various gases (O2, H2, CO2, CH4, NH3, N2, H2O, etc.), and
activities of organic and inorganic aqueous species. Where experimental data are
not available, existing estimation methods will be used. In the case of aqueous
species, these methods will be enhanced to account for a variety of organic
compounds (branched and cycloalkanes, polycyclic aromatics, dicarboxylic acids,
sulfur-bearing compounds, etc.) which have not yet received attention, and for
which high temperature/pressure data are generally not available. The geologic
focus of this research will be conditions at which aqueous solutions interact
with organic compounds in petroleum reservoirs, sedimentary rocks, hydrothermal
systems and metamorphic terranes. This research requires an interdisciplinary
approach combining theoretical equations, thermodynamics and kinetic data,
computer techniques and field and laboratory observations to achieve these
goals.
