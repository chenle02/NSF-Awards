Santa Monica College's (SMC) STEM Scholars program will investigate the impact
of scholarship assistance and targeted interventions both in and out of the
classroom to improve student success in STEM among community college students.
Many of these students are the first in their family to attend college and
represent demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.
These interventions will bridge the academic curriculum with comprehensive
student support services and will include STEM-focused counseling and career
planning sessions, a STEM speaker series, STEM skill building workshops, and
applied learning activities, including research opportunities with local
university and industry partners. This project will provide additional support
in math, which is often the primary barrier to success in STEM for community
college students, many of whom enter underprepared in math.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The STEM Scholars program evaluation plan includes both formative and
summative components that will assess the effectiveness of the project in
improving student outcomes, as well as measuring the institution's capacity to
support student success. In collaboration with SMC's Office of Institutional
Research, the formative component will assess the establishment of a program
database to evaluate applications, development of marketing materials,
initiation of classroom presentations, distribution of scholarship funding, and
facilitation of cohort activities. The summative component will assess the
overall impact of this project on both students and the institution and will
focus on the project's four primary objectives and how the project has helped
achieve the S-STEM Program Goals.
