The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "The Regulation of Pollen Specific Genes". The planning activities
will include completion of preliminary studies and collaboration with an
established researcher. Support of the project will assist a well trained black
biologist to improve her research capability and to complete the planning and
development of a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful,
will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI
and other research support.
