The project will develop a fuzzy set framework to deal with the effects of
climatic changes on water resources management and with the uncertainties in the
prediction of hydrometeorologic extremes, such as floods and droughts, under
changing climatologic conditions. Probabilistic and fuzzy set analyses will be
combined and historical data will be used to link local climate elements to
global circulation models for the generation of circulation patterns. Anomalies
in these patterns usually produce drought or flood and these events will be
developed as time series. Forecasting will be carried out of such time series on
the basis of circulation pattern series and some of these forecasts will be used
in water resources decision-making, e.g., reservoir operation. The value of this
research will be to provide theoretical bases to engineering techniques for
taking climatic fluctuations and global changes into account in decision-making
related to extreme droughts and floods.
