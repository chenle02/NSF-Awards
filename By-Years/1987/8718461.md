This proposal requests funds to obtain a computer system that is capable of
performing an analysis of the response of the vertebrate retina to stimulation
by white-noise. The responses will be viewed from several aspects in several
projects. Signal transduction in the neuronal network of the catfish retina will
be analysed both functionally by microelectrode recording and morphologically by
determining synaptic connections with the electron microscope. Cell form and
function will then be compared by the computer. In addition, the interaction
between retinal cells during light or dark adaptation and under pharmacological
stimulation will similarly be determined during stimulation by white-noise.
Lastly, white-noise modulated light signals will be used to determine the full
range of frequency response of the human cone cell system.
