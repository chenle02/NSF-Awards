Whereas the positions all other atoms in chemical structures can be determined
unambiguously by the technique of X-ray diffraction, hydrogen atoms do not have
sufficient mass to diffract X-rays efficiently. Consequently, the technique of
neutron diffraction must be used to locate hydrogen atoms, and this technique
requires neutron sources which are available at only a few sites in the United
States. This research project involves a collaboration between the University of
Southern California and Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the neutron source
is located. The structures of metal hydrides are of considerable academic
interest because they provide examples of unique chemical bonds, such as
structures in which a single hydrogen atom is bonded to three metal atoms, and
compounds containing dihydrogen molecules bound to metals. Structural studies on
metal hydrides and related compounds are important also to a clearer
understanding of catalysis of reactions of hydrogen, of hydrogen storage in
metal hydrides and of hydrogen embrittlement of metals. It is proposed to
determine the crystal structure of transition metal hydride complexes using a
combination of X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques, in collaboration with
Dr. Thomas F. Koetzle of Brookhaven National Laboratory. Emphasis will be placed
on compounds having hyrogen-bridge and metal hydride cluster complexes. Of
special interest are complexes involving dihydrogen ligands, compounds
containing hydrogen atoms at the center of a trigonal plane of three metal
atoms, and compounds illustrating C-H-metal agostic interactions. Structures
containing hydrogen in the cavities of metal clusters will be examined in a
search for examples of 5-coordinate and 8- coordinate hydrogen.
