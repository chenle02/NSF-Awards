The use of heavy media separation processes in the treatment of coal and oil
shale, in the concentration of mineral ores, and in the reprocessing of
municipal solid waste and industrial scrap is significant today, and its use is
expected to increase greatly in the future. However, fundamental research at
American universities in this important process has been practically zero. Most
of the advances in the past 50 years have come from applied research and
development in the industrial sector. An experimental research program in 'Heavy
Media Separations' with some analysis and model building is being conducted.
Since its greatest potential is as a pre-concentration step, the goals of this
research are to: increase the ability of the process to separate particles with
only a specific gravity difference of 0.02 and improve the process by minimizing
misplaced particles.
