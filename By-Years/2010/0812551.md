A plethora of digital data is being generated at unparalleled speed with an
inordinate number of dimensions. Machine learning and data mining are approaches
that can assist us in keeping pace with the rapidly advancing data gathering and
storage techniques and help us mine nuggets or patterns from high-dimensional
data. Semi-supervised learning can be interpreted as supervised learning that
uses additional information from unlabeled data, or as unsupervised learning
guided by constraints formed from labeled data. This research is addressing two
key pressing issues with massive data: high dimensionality and a shortage of
labeled data. In particular, this project is: investigating semi-supervised
feature selection to remove irrelevant features; studying the combination of
feature extraction and model selection to further reduce dimensionality; and
developing a novel framework to integrate feature selection and feature
extraction based on sparse learning. This study is an explicit attempt to
connect and unify feature selection and extraction for hypothesis space
reduction. The project is directly facilitating basic machine learning research
and practical data mining and advances innovative research beyond feature
selection and extraction. The work is engaging students in both teaching and
research, and the algorithms, tools and databases will be made publically
available for research purposes and for use as teaching resources.
