This research program will focus on the development of new femtosecond
measurement techniques and their application to ultrafast processes in condensed
matter and microelectronic device physics. A major thrust is the forging of a
new combination of femtosecond laser technology with the techniques of angle-
resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy to permit simultaneous
measurement of an electron's evolving energy and crystal momentum in photo-
excited solids. Conventional femtosecond optical measurements are insensitive to
electron momentum. This experiment will provide new insight into femtosecond
electron scattering processes which underlie the basic electronic properties of
III-V semiconductors and metals.
