This award funds the development of new methods for the statistical analysis of
social science data. The project focuses on 'regression discontinuity' (RD)
models, which are very widely used in practice. This kind of statistical model
is used to estimate the effect of a treatment on an outcome when unobserved
factors may threaten the validity of the statistical analysis. While RD models
are widely used to analyze data, many important methodological and statistical
features of the models are not well understood. This project develops novel
methods for the analysis of RD models and applies the results to concrete
empirical problems in Economics and other social
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research develops new methodological and
practical tools for estimation, inference and falsification of RD designs. This
includes a method that accounts for the fact that RD estimators are sensitive to
the choice of bandwidth, a method that is valid in finite samples, the analysis
of RDs with multiple cutoffs and the development of new tools for spatial RD
designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research will come from
the use of these new methods to provide better insight for economic policy.
