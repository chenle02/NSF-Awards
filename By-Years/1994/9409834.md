IRI-9409834 Dorsey, Julie University of Pennsylvania $57,519 - 12 mos. (Jointly
funded with Cross Disciplinary Activities - Total Award $68,519) RIA: "Inverse
Interactive Computer Graphics Techniques for Acoustic Visualization" This is the
first year of a three-year continuing RIA Award to investigate acoustic
simulation techniques to improve accuracy of acoustic space evaluation,
utilizing theoretical and interactive techniques to indicate specific acoustical
effects in a three dimensional computer model. By creating and altering these
effects, the surfaces, sound emitters, and geometry will be indirectly modified.
The purpose is to have the system cary the burden of searching the design space,
allowing the user to focus on the goals of the acoustical design rather than on
the details of the model specification. The project benefits from analogous work
done in lighting simulation and interactive graphics techniques.
