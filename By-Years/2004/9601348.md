Efforts to increase the number of women in science have met unexpected
difficulties, despite great efforts and good intentions. Why this failure? A
varied array of literatures has offered tentative answers to this question, but
conceptual and institutional rifts between approaches have made it difficult to
assemble ideas and findings into a consistent explanation. For example,
historical studies have examined the lives of women scientists within the
contexts of institutions that have held them at arm's length; sociological
studies have uncovered women's limited access to the means of scientific
production; research in the life sciences has shown how science has studied
women; feminist theories of science have examined how gender shapes science and
science education; and natural scientists themselves have shown how gender
analysis has yielded new research insights. To date these rich and suggestive
fields of study have not been drawn together into dialog with one another. The
central purpose of this project is to develop such a dialog, within the
framework of a book, and to illustrate how foundational questions from the areas
of study interact with one another.
