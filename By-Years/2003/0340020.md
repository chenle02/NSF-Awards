This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
Smart Optical Sensor (SOS) technology (hardware platform and embedded software)
that is able to provide localized intelligent image processing capability to
existing visible or infrared cameras used in video surveillance systems.
Existing video surveillance networks typically utilize multiple visible/infrared
video cameras connected to one or more central control station(s) where motion
detection and digital video recording take place. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts from this technology will be computationally intensive smart
video processing algorithms -- custom designed, embedded, low power hardware
platform placed at the camera location, this can eliminate much of the video
transmission bandwidth requirements demanded by current systems, facilitate
wireless links between cameras and control stations, reduce the huge amount of
video storage equipment, and perform more reliable video surveillance. Such a
centralized video surveillance will help meet the ever-increasing demands of
homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;
