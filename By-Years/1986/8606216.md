Research is underway to extend the range of temperatures in which metal
chemistry is understood. Also to be studied are the reactions involving metallic
oxides and monohalides. This higher range (up to 1900K) requires the design of a
pseudo static photochemistry reactor (HTP) where reactions can be initiated and
monitored without wall interference. In these experimental conditions where the
wall limitations disappear, the former, well understood, fast flow technique
(HTFFR) can be used in addition, and the cross validation of these two methods
become possible. The addition of an excimer laser would make possible the
photolytic generation of a broad range of metals from their compounds. The
reactions contemplated involve Mn, Ba, Cu, Al and Ca. The presence of these
elements in fly ash and soot is the cause of problems of corrosion fouling or
even dust explosions. Conversely, some industrial processes (e.g. carbon black
generation, chemical vapor deposition in electronics manufactures) depend on
such chemical activities. The impact on such new knowledge on industrial
practice could be substantial.
