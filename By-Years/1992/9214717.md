This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award funded jointly by the
Chemistry Division and the International Programs Division will support travel
for participants from the U.S. and regional developing countries in a
"U.S.-Latin American Workshop on Reactive Intermediates and Mechanistic Organic
Chemistry," to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 9-13, 1993. The
organizers are Joseph Lambert of Northwestern University and Norma Nudelman of
the University of Buenos Aires. The purpose of the workshop is to assess
priorities of research areas in the field of physical organic chemistry and to
enhance collaboration among US and Latin American scientists. Support will cover
travel expenses for eight US scientists and three developing country scientists
(from Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Colombia). The workshop will emphasize
participation from throughout Latin America, particularly of younger scientists,
for whom access to researchers and current information in this field is
critical. Expected benefits include the establishment of ties for future
international research collaboration, with applications to the chemical industry
that will be both economic and scientific.
