This project studies the climate effects of the conversion of the Amazon forest
to a grassland, using simulations with the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM)
and simple analyses for the surface parametrizations. Emphasis is on the
hydrological cycle, in particular precipitation and evapotranspiration and
inferred runoff. Besides the full deforestation scenario, short numerical
simulations will be used to reveal the relative importance of changes in albedo,
surface roughness, and surface longwave emission. The problem studied is used as
an example to yield a better understanding of mechanisms operating in a climate
model coupled to a land process model. This study is important because the
increased understanding derived from it will be used to determine needs for
further improvement in the land component of climate models. This research is
funded under the Climate Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (CMAP) initiative of
the Global Change Research Program.
