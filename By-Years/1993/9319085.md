9319085 Nastrom The objective of this research is the investigation and
interpretation of vertical motion, gravity waves, and there vertical flux of
horizontal momentum as measured by several 50 MHz radars, including the flatland
radar at champaign, Illinois, White Sands, and several tropical stations in the
Pacific. In particular, a new theory of gravity wave momentum transport will be
further developed and tested to explain the (mean) downward motion in the
midtroposphere at the Flatland site. new and existing measurements of momentum
flux will be examined with respect to various composite synoptic systems at the
same site. ***
