The research team will use a systems biology approach to understand the process
of MAP kinase (MAPK) signal transduction in Arabidopsis. Whole-genome sequencing
has indicated that there are 20 genes that encode MAPK proteins in Arabidopsis.
Functional redundancy and cross-talk between these proteins make it difficult to
determine which signaling pathways are controlled by a given protein. In order
to overcome this complexity, the research team will use a novel high-throughput
genotyping pipeline to create single plants that are heterozygous for mutations
in all twenty MAPK genes. The progeny of these 20-tuple heterozygotes should
segregate all of the possible combinations of MAPK mutations. By genotyping
selected sets of progeny, it should be possible to determine which mutant
combinations are causing particular phenotypes. The research team will not
search through the population to try and isolate examples of all 1,140 different
triple-mutants. Instead they will let the biology of the plants indicate which
mutant combinations are informative. The outcome of this work will be an
improved understanding of the many signal transduction pathways controlled by
MAPK cascades in Arabidopsis. Educational materials will also be developed that
highlight the concepts of systems biology and high-throughput technology. Dr.
Krysan will incorporate the high-throughput genotyping system into his Plant
Functional Genomics course in order to give students hands-on experience with
these methods. At the high school level, a local teacher will collaborate with
the research team to develop practical exercises suitable for use in a high
school setting that capture the essence of high-throughput genotyping. These
materials will be disseminated to other high school teachers through a summer
workshop that will be offered.
