This project contributes to implementation theory, one of the most important
areas in the last ten years of economic theory. Implementation theory tells us
in very general terms what can and cannot be accomplished through incentive
contracts. This project pursues three directions: mechanism design in dynamic or
repeated environments, application of general results of implementation theory
to specific economic settings, and theoretical modelling of processes by which
agents choose a mechanism. The first part extends the basic model of full
implementation to dynamic settings, i.e., settings in which allocations and
payoffs occur over a sequence of periods. The second part applies implementation
theory to problems of public goods provision, bargaining, and auctions. The
third part explores the question of how mechanisms are selected. In particular,
if the decision of which mechanism to play is made by the players themselves at
the interim stage, then the actual process of selecting the mechanism may reveal
information. The project studies the effects of this information transmission on
mechanism choice. It applies this to the study of how cartels of diverse firms
share information and collude. Advances in implementation theory are important
because this theory provides analysts with powerful analytical tools for
studying institutional design. The early work in this field resulted in general
impossibility theorems, proofs that certain basic societal goals could not be
reconciled and that trade-offs were necessary. Recent work by the investigators
and others have obtained remarkable results about what can be accomplished by
changes in economic institutions. By extending these models to a dynamic
setting, the investigators will be able to rigorously study the economic
implications of the evolution of institutions over time.
