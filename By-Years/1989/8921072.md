The high conductivity, fast nonlinear response, and charge storage in
conjugated polymers reflects their Pi-electrons, and especially Pi-electron
excitations. The frontier orbitals in sigma-conjugated polysilane polymers lead
to similar models. We propose extension of Pariser-Parr-Pople theory via
diagrammatic valence bond methods to obtain exact dynamic nonlinear coefficients
in conjugated molecules or in polymeric fragments. This novel approach takes
advantage of the large but finite VB basis for fourteen or less Pi-electrons and
of sparse-matrix methods. We obtain, for the first time, exact NLO coefficients
for interacting electrons and demonstrate major differences with current
approximations. Extrapolations to polymers are proposed, with special emphasis
on the frequency dependence of the responses. This grant is jointly supported by
