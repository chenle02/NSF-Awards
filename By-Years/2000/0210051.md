Nanowires/tubes have the potential to contribute significantly to the continued
size reduction of micro/nano-mechanical systems. Knowledge of the thermal
characteristics of nanowires/tubes is the basis for predicting, controlling, and
achieving desired thermal performance of micro- and nanosized devices. This one-
year exploratory research is to develop a novel experimental characterization
tool to characterize the thermal transport along nanowires/tubes. The proposed
experiment involves modulated laser beam heating on one side of a substrate
while nanowires/tubes have been grown perpendicularly on the other side.
Variation of the thermal radiation from the laser-heated side is detected and
related to the thermophysical properties of nanowires/tubes. The unique thermal
depth profiling capability of the experiment makes it possible to identify and
characterize the thermal conductivity of nanowires/tubes and the thermal contact
resistance between nanowires/tubes and the substrate. The quantitative
investigation of this thermal contact resistance is a first step, also an
essential step, toward the thermal design of joints between nanowires/tubes and
micro- and nanodevices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
