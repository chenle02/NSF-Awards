This grant provides partial support for the 1987 Gordon Conference on Nuclear
Structure Physics. This conference, the latest in a continuing series, is unique
in that it surveys the most recent theoretical and experimental developments in
nuclear structure, heavy ion collisions, intermediate energy nuclear physics and
baryon structures. A good fraction of the funds will be used to attract and
support outstanding young scientists in the field.
