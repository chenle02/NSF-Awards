This project is a comprehensive inservice program involving Washington State
University, the State Office of Public Instruction, private foundations,
government and private industrial laboratories and local schhool districts. The
program is targeted at out-of-field teachers of high school chemistry and
culminates in a Master of Arts Degree in Chemistry. Thirty teachers from the
Northwest states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana will be selected each
year to participate in a three- year program which will include two one-month
periods of instruction on the University Campus, four semesters of instruction
during the academic years via satellite and a capstone six-week assignment in an
industrial laboratory coupled with on-site instruction. Ninety teachers of high
school chemistry will participate in this program, earning an MA in Chemistry.
Satellite two-way video and audio telecommunications will allow participants
from long distances to benefit from on- site instruction. This new program will
include offerings such as General Chemistry from an Advanced Point of View, a
two semester Organic and Biochemistry Sequence and Physical Chemistry for the
Life Sciences. These are not regular departmental offerings, but are based on
the expressed needs of these teachers. The third summer will be spent in a
laboratory, such as Battelle and other industrial labs. This program will
provide a firm basis for the teaching of chemistry including modern applications
and an enhanced knowledge base of instructional strategies as well as career
opportunities for future chemists. The NSF request is for the support of the
first group of thirty teachers plus the instructional costs for all three years.
The support for the sixty other teachers as well as the institutionalization of
the program will be forthcoming from other funds. NSF funding is approximately
20% of the cost of the whole project.
