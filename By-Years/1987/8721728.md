Recent studies of intraseasonal, low frequency variability in midlatitudes of
the Northern Hemisphere have strongly suggested that the probability density
distributions of the planetary long waves (k = 2 to 4) are significantly
bimodal. In contrast, the speed, horizontal and vertical shear of the zonal mean
flow possess unimodal probability density distributions. The physical basis for
such partitioning has not yet clear. The possibility that the bimodal structures
are an artifact of data stratification method or numerical truncation during
assimilation has not yet been discounted either. The present study addresses
these issues through further dignostic analyses of observational data and
numerical model simulations. The Northern Hemisphere data would be examined to
delineate the processes involved in transitions between the two modes for the
planetary long waves and analysis extended to include the Southern Hemisphere
data. Output from selected long integrations of a general circulation model
simulations will be analysed to determine the probability density distribution
functions of model planetary long waves. The possible influence of bimodality on
the predictive skill of global numerical forecasts would be evaluated. This work
would contribute to our basic understanding of the dynamical process important
in intraseasonal climate variability.
