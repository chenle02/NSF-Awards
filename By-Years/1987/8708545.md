Retinal pigment epithelial cells are highly specialized phagocytic cells which
remove discarded photoreceptor outer segments during the normal visual process.
Preliminary studies designed to investigate the recognition signals which
trigger phagocytosis of shed, but not intact, outer segments have led to the
hypothesis that there are mannosyl residues of glycoproteins of the shed
segments which are recognized by mannose receptors on the epithelial cell
surfaces, and that this mannose-recognition system is the basis for the
receptor-mediated endocytosis. This research is designed to investigate this
hypothesis directly. This work will elucidate the normal mechanism whereby the
eye naturally disposes of the used, discarded photoreceptor outer segments which
would otherwise accumulate in the eye.
