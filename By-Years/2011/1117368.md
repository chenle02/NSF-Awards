The massive energy consumption of today?s datacenters translates into high
monetary and environmental costs; the latter because most of the electricity
produced in the US comes from burning coal, a greenhouse-gas-intensive approach
for producing energy. We refer to such energy as ?brown?, as opposed to the
?green? energy produced by clean energy sources.&lt;br/&gt;An increasingly
popular approach for reducing both costs is for datacenters to generate their
own green energy or draw power directly from a nearby green energy plant. In
light of this trend, the goal of this project is to study how best to exploit
solar and wind energy for lowering energy costs and brown energy consumption in
datacenters. The major challenge in using these types of green energy is that
they are not always available.&lt;br/&gt;In this context, our research focuses
on: (1) Characterizing and modeling datacenter workloads and green energy
production; (2) Designing load scheduling and energy usage policies; (3)
Designing energy management policies that account for green energy; and (4)
Designing systems that leverage our models and policies.&lt;br/&gt;Our project
will impact society in many ways, including: (1) reducing the brown energy
consumption and the carbon footprint of datacenters; (2) promoting the
generation and consumption of green energy; and (3) creating the machinery
needed to exploit green energy in datacenters for highest bene&amp;#64257;t.
Furthermore, we believe that undertaking work with such clearly
de&amp;#64257;ned societal impact will help us attract and train a diverse and
committed set of undergraduate and graduate students.
