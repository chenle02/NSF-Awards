This mathematical research project will undertake spectral and variational
analysis of several topics originating in theoretical physics. It is both pure
and applied mathematics: applied in the sense that one of the goals is the
derivation of formulae that a physicist can actually use, and pure in that it
consists of proving rigorous theorems. Quantities of physical importance are
frequently minimizers of certain functionals or eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
linear operators. In this research most of them originate in quantum physics,
such as Schroedinger operators for individual particles or bulk matter, or the
Skyrme model for baryons. The principal investigators will continue their work
on these and other subjects by combining abstract techniques, primarily from
functional analysis, with more particular tools, e.g. from the theory of
differential equations or perturbation techniques. Intuition from physics and
from numerical calculations is also expected to help.
