Dynamic network analysis of collective movement and herding in a complex primate
society

This project combines field-based data with computational network analysis to
understand how social relationships and ecological pressures mediate collective
movement and herding in a complex primate society. The application of dynamic
network analysis in this research will transform how biologists understand the
adaptive value of association in changing environments. The project will focus
on the gelada (Theropithecus gelada), a primate species that lives in an
extremely large modular society with high fission-fusion dynamics. Behavioral,
ecological, and demographic data will be collected from a population of
habituated geladas living in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia.
Potential findings will be of great interest to computational scientists and
behavioral ecologists interested in the evolution of cooperation, coordination,
and complex systems.

This research will help conserve the Afro-alpine habitat of the Simien Mountains
National Park, Ethiopia--a UNESCO World Heritage Site designated as "In Danger".
The fellow will give public talks on conserving Ethiopian biodiversity at a
local ecotourism lodge and train Ethiopian nationals as field assistants to
collect behavioral, ecological, and GPS data for the duration of this project.
The fellow will also organize a workshop on applying network analysis to biology
at Addis Ababa University. Additionally, the fellow will give talks to high
school biology students and maintain a science blog while in the field. Open
source software will be used when possible, and all code derived for analysis
will be made freely available on the Internet upon completion of the project.
