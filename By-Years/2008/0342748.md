With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Cornell University will acquire a four
circle, CCD X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: a) solid state chemistry of binary and
ternary compounds; b) intermetallic topologies and organic metals relevant to
the superconducting state; c) new catalysts for polymer synthesis; d) new
stoichiometric reagents for dinitrogen functionalization; and e) supramolecular
transition metal compounds for small molecule activation. The X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. This instrument will enable stronger
collaboration with faculty at Ithaca College, a local liberal arts institution,
Boston University and Montana State University. These studies will have an
impact in materials chemistry, polymer science and synthetic chemistry.
