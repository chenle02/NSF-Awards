As the second part of a 5-year plan to revitalize the chemistry program, the
General Chemistry laboratory experience has been completely restructured. Three
new projects implement the use of visible-ultraviolet absorption
spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), and high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the UV-Vis, taking advantage of
the speed of a diode-array instrument, students design a dye "pH-meter" by using
a selected plant dye for spectrophotometrically determining pHs. The AAS project
asks students to decide the changes in the aluminum concentrations in a rhubarb
sauce, or similar food, after cooking in an aluminum container. Finally, the
HPLC project has students isolate and purify lysozyme from egg white, tears, or
nasal mucus. With the instrumental projects included, presentations are planned
for the American Chemical Society (ACS) and Midwestern Association for Liberal
Arts Colleges (MACTLAC) meetings. Publications of the redesign of the laboratory
and the individual instrumental projects are planned for publication.
