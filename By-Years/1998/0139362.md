This Research Experience for Undergraduates Site project, Training American
Indians in Environmental Biology - 2, has four objectives. It will: (1) Increase
the number of American Indian students entering graduate school and careers in
environmental biology by providing research experiences and mentoring; (2)
Expand the existing collaborative relationship between the University of Montana
(UM) and Salish Kootenai College (SKC) to include the other tribal colleges in
the state; (3) Increase the knowledge of UM faculty and students about minority
issues; and (4) Disseminate throughout Indian country the relevance of training
in environmental biology. It will provide support to expand and improve an
existing NSF-funded program, Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology:
Project TRAIN by providing support for eight additional summer fellowships and
increasing the number of fellowships from six to fourteen per summer. Students
will be recruited from Montana's seven tribal colleges and those from other
tribal colleges in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer research
experience will consist of an eight-week program, with possible extension to 12
weeks based on student interest and performance as well as project requirements.
Each fellow will participate in an independent research project under the
supervision of an academic mentor. Fellows will have the opportunity to choose
from a broad array of topics in Environmental Biology. Faculty and staff from
both UM and SKC will conduct a summer course in research methods as well as
arranging orientation and other events as part of a multilayered mentoring
structure where students interact with faculty, previous program participants
and one another.&lt;br/&gt;
