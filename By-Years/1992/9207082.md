With National Science Foundation support Dr. Timothy Earle and his colleagues
will continue their archaeological research on the Thy peninsula which is
located in northeastern Jutland, Denmark. While limited work has been done in
this area, the region is known to be rich in archeological remains including
large numbers of barrows or burial chambers. In a first season of survey and
excavation Dr. Earle located a number of additional sites which are settlement
or living areas. During the next two seasons a number of these will be
excavated. He and his team will first conduct a reconnaissance survey of 2
square kilometers in two parishes and undertake intensive line walks over 5
square kilometers to locate more sites. Surface materials will be collected and
the upper "plowzone" level of the soil will be sampled. More intensive
excavation will be conducted at 15 sites distributed across the Neolithic and
Bronze age periods. On this basis it should be possible to determine how complex
societies developed in this region. Following the development of agriculture and
pastoralism in many parts of the world, one can trace changes in social
organization which lead, ultimately, to the rise of states. Early in this
process, chiefdoms arose and anthropologists still do not understand the
mechanisms through which this happened. Some argue that population growth
permitted by a more stable subsistence base provided the driving force while
others point to other factors such as the development of long distance trade.
Over the course of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Scandinavia, chiefdoms underwent
cycles of rise and decline. The data collected from this area will allow
comparison with cases from other parts of the world. From this it should be
possible to separate historical particulars from the more basic underlying
mechanisms. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data
of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase our understanding of
the processes which led to the rise of complex societies such as our own.
