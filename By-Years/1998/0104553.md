Dr. Keating is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
out a program of research, education, and public outreach at California
Institute of Technology. His research program focuses on studies of the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation (CMB) provides a snapshot of the epoch at which radiation
and matter decoupled, approximately 300,000 years after the Big Bang. The
spectrum, spatial anisotropy, and polarization of the CMB can constrain theories
of cosmological structure formation. He will work to develop and deploy novel
polarization-sensitive detector systems, such as the Polatron, which is designed
to measure CMB polarization at arc-minute scales, where the signal is expected
to be at a maximum. He also plans a program of education and outreach that will
introduce students to astronomy through the construction of a small radio
telescope, which is used as payload in a mock Earth orbiting satellite. The
program will bring astronomy education to a low socio-economic region in
Southern California and will be developed as a model that can be duplicated in
other schools. ***
