Changes in brain cell energy affect activity throughout the brain, but the exact
mechanisms that link brain energy metabolism with brain activity are not well
understood. Nevertheless, the relationship between brain energy and brain
activity is central to understanding how brain function is regulated and how
metabolism influences ongoing behaviors such as sleep, sensory processing,
learning and memory, and cognition. ATP and its core molecule adenosine provide
a unique link between energy and brain activity, and may play a key role in
translating changes in cell energy directly to changes in brain activity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will test the hypothesis that ATP and
adenosine link brain energy to brain activity both at the cellular level and the
behavioral level by performing a combination of electrophysiological recordings
of brain activity, measurements of ATP and adenosine using an enzyme-based
sensor, and behavioral testing. These experiments will provide new insight into
the evolutionarily important relationship between brain energy and brain
activity. In addition, the investigators will mentor undergraduate students as
research partners both during the academic year as part of their academic
courseload and support them in doing research full-time during the summer.
Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this interdisciplinary
proposal, participate in weekly laboratory meetings and attend and present
research at several local, regional and national conferences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken together, this project is an ideal use of both
research monies and tax dollars: it offers innovative and important research on
the relationship between brain metabolism and brain activity, and provides a
comprehensive year-round educational and training environment and individualized
mentoring for a diverse set of undergraduate students aimed toward a career in
scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;
