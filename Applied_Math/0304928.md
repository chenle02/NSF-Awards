This research project is to design stochastic approximation and optimization
algorithms, and to develop regime switching dynamic system models for solving
problems arising from existing and emerging applications. Several stochastic
iterative algorithms featuring non-smooth dynamics or multi-time scales, or
leading to non-autonomous limit ordinary differential equations or limit systems
given by differential inclusions are proposed. Their asymptotic properties such
as convergence and rates of convergence will be examined through the associated
dynamic systems. Variants, improvements, and efficient procedures will be
developed. The proposed algorithms for tracking time-varying parameters will
lead to limit regime-switching ordinary and stochastic differential equations,
which are not obtainable using the existing methods in stochastic approximation.
Research on regime switching models modulated by Markov chains for both
discrete-time and continuous-time systems will be conducted. Aiming at reducing
complexity, hierarchical structure of the dynamic systems and time-scale
separation will be used. Properties of these systems will be investigated
through aggregation and decomposition methods and singular perturbation
methodology. These properties will further be used to guide the design and
development of procedures for optimization and control of dynamic systems.

To meet the growing demand for efficient computational algorithms and methods
for optimal decision making in wireless communications, manufacturing systems,
financial engineering, signal processing, and queueing networks, this project
aims to design mathematical models useful for existing and emerging
applications, and to develop algorithms applicable to such problems as CDMA
communication systems, production planning, mean-variance portfolio selections,
and communication networks. To accommodate systems in the real world, shifts in
regimes need to be taken into consideration. Take for instance, the situation in
a stock market, the market parameters depend on the market mode that jumps
between the "bullish" and "bearish" states. In these states, the corresponding
market parameters are quite different resulting in markedly different behavior.
In addition, the stock market also exhibits multi-time-scale structure. Such
models and time-scale separations also appear in communication networks,
production planning and other applications. The proposed research work aims to
design feasible models and procedures for the aforementioned systems. The
proposed research will yield new insight, and advance state of the art of
stochastic optimization methods.
