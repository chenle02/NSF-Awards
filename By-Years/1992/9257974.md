This NYI award is made in recognition of significant achievements as a
researcher and teacher and high potential for future contributions to this
country's scientific and engineering enterprise. It supports research in
operating systems for high performance computer architectures and applications.
In particular, the appropriate division of responsibility between the operating
system kernel and each application will be investigated from the standpoint of
delivering major improvements in application performance on high performance
computer systems.
