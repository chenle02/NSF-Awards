This research is to determine the Quaternary slip rate at two sites along the
Garlock fault and at one site along the Owl Lake fault, in southern California.
At all three sites, channel walls on alluvial fans are left-laterally offset
several tens of meters. Photogrammetry and trench excavation techniques will be
used. Dating of events will be done by a number of techniques depending on
material uncovered in the excavations. The results of these projects will
provide information useful for evaluating the seismic hazard posed by the
Garlock fault, as well as for constraining tectonic models of the region
surrounding the Garlock fault. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
