This award supports the synergy between new scientific technology and new
scientific information on the narwhal to the public through a transformational
technology, HoloLens. Microsoft's HoloLens has transformed academic and
professional platforms of learning. The holographic computer headset brings
holographic wonders into the viewers own world superimposing virtual objects
over the wearer's field of vision. As opposed to virtual reality that isolates
and transports the viewer into a different world, multiple wearers of HoloLens
can participate in the same holographic experience. Case Western Reserve
University Interactive Commons was selected by Microsoft as the experimental
ground for the academic implementation of HoloAnatomy, teaching anatomy through
life-like holograms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HoloLens technology will bring
narwhal anatomy, ecology and behavior to Museum visitors by exploring
holographic narwhal images as told by a holographic Inuit narrator. The
innovative technology will transform the museum experience as multiple
participants can enter a traditional background exhibit of fixed objects while
holographic narwhals are swimming in the same room. Through 3D holographic
animations, museum visitors will be actively engaged in the Inuit hunter
presentation and be able to experience and understand and even walk around the
3D Holographic narwhal and hunter animations. As one example, Inuit observed
differences in body and tusk form will help direct the body of scientific
knowledge and direct transformative scientific discoveries of the tusk. Outreach
through collaborative museum narwhal exhibits and educational programs will be
implemented.
