Internet users reasonably expect their online identities and web browsing
activities to remain private. Unfortunately, this is far from the case in
practice; in reality, users are constantly tracked on the internet. As web
tracking technologies become more sophisticated and pervasive, there is a
critical need to understand and quantify web users' privacy risk, that is, what
is the likelihood that users on the internet can be uniquely identified from
their online activities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses web privacy
from an information theoretic perspective. Based on statistical models for
online activity and social network connections, the project develops a unified
information theoretic framework to quantify the privacy risk that web users face
from online attacks. The proposed research addresses internet privacy through
three interrelated thrusts focusing on fingerprinting, social network de-
anonymization and synergistic attacks, and provides an evaluation plan to
experiment with real-world networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
