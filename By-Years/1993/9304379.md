The Wrangell volcanic field (WVF) defines the northeastern- most expression of
late Cenozoic volcanic activity associated wit plate convergence in southern
Alaska. The primary goals of this research are: identification and
characterization of mantle and crustal reservoirs responsible for WVF volcanism;
quantification of the relative roles of these reservoirs in the evolution of WVF
mafic silicic products; and evaluation of the relationships between magmatic
evolution, mantle-crust interactions, and lithospheric structure and composition
in the WVF as a model for understanding continental arc processes. In order to
achieve these goals, combined field, petrographic, mineral chemistry, elemental
(including REE), and isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb) studies of eruptive products from
three major WVF volcanic centers, Mount Drum, Mount Churchill, and Skookum
Creek, are planned.
