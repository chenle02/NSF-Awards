9603681 Polacco The long-range goal of the work is understanding of nickel
metabolism in plants. The specific objective of this work is to understand the
insertion of nickel into urease. Two mutants of soybean are available which
abolish nickel insertion insertion into urease without affecting the amount of
urease protein - which is inactive - in the plant. The mutants encode proteins
that bind nickel and these two proteins seem to be urease accessory proteins
which insert the nickel into the enzyme. The work will involve genetic analysis
of the two mutants, molecular analysis of the interaction between urease and
accessory binding proteins through a yeast two-hybrid system, and biochemical
analysis of urease activity reconstitution by the presence of the two accessory
proteins. The analysis will provide information on the mechanisms of metal
insertion into enzymes, protein/protein interaction and regulation of urease
activity.
