AgrowKnowledge transitions from a National Center of Excellence and continues to
advance its work over the next four years as a National Resource Center focused
on resource development in four technical areas identified by partners as
critical growth areas in agriculture, 2008-2012. The mission of AgrowKnowledge
is to encourage and support improved technical education for community college
students enrolled in agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) programs.
The AgrowKnowledge network includes community colleges, universities and
secondary school partners; and is informed by a 12-member Industry Council,
professional and trade organizations, and a 10-member National Visiting
Committee. The Center engages in activities developed and sustained by well
established partnerships with industry and education representatives throughout
the county. Among these activities are professional development workshops for
secondary and postsecondary educators that demonstrate how new and emerging
technologies may be creatively used in AFNR courses and curricula. The Center
maintains a continually updated database of curriculum and planning resources
and learning modules. AgrowKnowledge works with its educational and industry
partners to encourage the development of seamless linkages in AFNR education
along the secondary-postsecondary continuum, and fosters an improved
understanding of the technical knowledge and quantitative skills often required
for employment in AFNR industries. Partners align their colleges and
organizations with work in one of four Resource Technology Teams representing
these critical growth areas: (1) Agricultural Environment, Natural Resources and
Security; (2) Alternative Energy for Agriculture; (3) Agricultural GIS/GPS
Systems; and (4) Agricultural Biotechnology.
