This award will support a graduate student doing his thesis on modeling the
interaction of the tidally induced residual circulation with the density forced
circulation produced by river inflow, in Long Island Sound. The interaction of
buoyancy flows with tidal currents is an important estuarine problem which has
not received much attention. Both mechanisms have been postulated for the type
of circulation observed in Long Island Sound but this work will be the first to
treat the interaction between the two processes. The work will have important
applications on pollution control.
