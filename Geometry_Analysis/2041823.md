Metrics with singularities are important objects in differential geometry and
arise naturally in algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, number theory,
representation theory etc. The PI in particular studies constant curvature
metrics with singularities, which naturally appear for instance in the
degeneration of smooth metrics and geometric flows. These objects also have
interesting applications in physics as they can be viewed as solitons in gauge
theory, and are related to Higgs bundles and magnetic vortices. Such metrics
solve partial differential equations, called curvature equations, where
singularities can be viewed as boundary data. Recently there have been many
developments in the interplay of analysis and geometry in this field, featuring
new and surprising phenomena such as stratification and bubbling. The goal of
the project is to develop new techniques that will help discover new features of
such objects, and give insight into problems related to singular metrics,
including singular uniformization, moduli spaces, and solutions of partial
differential equations on manifolds with singular geometry.

This project involves studying singular metrics using geometric microlocal
analysis. The central idea is to introduce new objects, called compactifications
or resolutions, to resolve the singularities. These resolutions will in turn
suggest which analytic techniques need to be developed. The PI intends to use
this method to study problems such as the moduli space construction of constant
curvature conical metrics and its relation to vortices, hyperbolic metrics with
cusps and asymptotic geometry of the compactified Riemann moduli space, and
gauge-theoretic partial differential equations with singular metric background.
