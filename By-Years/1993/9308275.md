9308275 WELLS This project tests methods for determining the accuracy of
eyewitness identifications. Eyewitnesses to crime often must attempt to identify
crime culprits from line-ups or photospreads, and this is an important form of
evidence for police investigators, judges and juries. Unfortunately, scientific
studies indicate that mistaken identifications (of an innocent suspect) are not
easily distinguished from accurate identifications (of the actual culprit).
Especially problematic is the fact that the confidence of the eyewitness in
response to a question such as "How confident are you that the person you
identified is the person you saw steal the money?" shows little or no consistent
relation to the accuracy of the identification. This causes considerable
difficulty for crime investigators and for triers of fact (such as jurors), who
must decide whether the eyewitness is accurate or mistaken. The project will
undertake a series of five experiments designed to discover better ways to
determine whether an eyewitness has made an accurate versus inaccurate
identification. Thefts will be staged repeatedly before groups of unsuspecting
people (totaling approximately 1,500 subjects for the five experiments) who will
then be given photospreads and asked to identify the thief. Various conditions
will be used across these five studies to test whether eyewitnesses' direct
judgments of resemblance between their memories and the appearance of the
identified person better predict accuracy of identification than do
eyewitnesses' confidence in their accuracy, and whether the former are less
vulnerable to extraneous influences than the latter. These studies will make an
important theoretical contribution to our scientific understanding of eyewitness
confidence stability. The results will also provide useful tools for determining
the accuracy of identification evidence in actual criminal cases. ***
