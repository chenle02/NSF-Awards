Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at
Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the spectra, dynamics, and reactions
of small polyatomic molecules. The work supported under this grant is
specifically concerned with spectroscopy and with time-dependent vibrational
dynamics; it is divided into three main topics. First, there is the study of the
high energy vibrational spectra and dynamics of three representative molecules.
Second, new mathematical and computational methods are being developed for the
efficient treatment of the challenging computations which occur in the first
topic. In the third topic, research is being carried out on new theoretical
methods which are required in order to be able to study very large molecular
systems. The common theme which links the various parts of the work being
carried out under this grant is to obtain information about and understanding of
the time, spatial, and energetic aspects of the evolution of vibrationally
excited states. The dynamical properties and the spectra of molecules are
consequences of the way in which the electrons and the nuclei which compose the
molecule interact with each other. A goal of the supported research is to learn
how information about these fundamental interactions can be extracted from a
knowledge of the molecular dynamics and spectra.
