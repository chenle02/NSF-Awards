This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist studying small-
scale irrigation systems in Spain. The project will study systems in the
mountains and in the lowlands of Spain, to compare with a previous study of a
highland and lowland irrigation system in Peru. Using a methodology borrowed
from "expert system" computer models, the project will create a model of small-
scale irrigation system management. Built from specific cases of conflict and
management decisions, the model will reveal the underlying values and
constraints operating on this case. The model will then be compared with that
fitting the Peruvian irrigation systems, in order to separate the influences
attributable to altitude from those attributable to cultural history. This
research is important because small scale irrigation systems are natural models
of resource management that have usually worked over periods of time. In a world
where there is current concern about global conservation and environmental
degradation, this sort of case study of a naturally evolved management system
can yield valuable insights to help planners design management systems for other
resource domains.
