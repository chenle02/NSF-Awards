The Dash project is building a prototype kernel for very large distributed
systems (VLDS) of the future. This kernel is being used to experimentally
validate and compare design components. DASH is investigating kernel
architectures that exploit shared-memory multiprocessors by generating
parallelism in the kernel, and that remove communication performance bottlenecks
such as data copying in software. Both problems involve complex interactions of
virtual memory, scheduling, and hardware architecture. Very high bandwidth wide-
area networks to interconnect very large numbers of diverse nodes may be built
in the future. The DASH project is an attempt to predict and influence the
hardware and software environments of such networks.
