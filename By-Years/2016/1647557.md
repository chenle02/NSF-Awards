The future management of water resources in the Western United States poses
significant challenges from human-derived change, along with tremendous
opportunities to improve the efficiency of water allocation for the very diverse
needs of humans and ecology. This workshop will bring together scientific and
engineering leaders from academia to define the major issues and to develop a
plan to guide research, technology and infrastructure capacity needs for the
future. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Tahoe Summit which is
attended by local, regional and national policy makers focused on the needs for
water sustainability in the Western United States and the importance of science
to guide sustainability development.

A diverse mix of early career and senior faculty, graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers will participate in the meeting. Established
investigators will be brought together with new and under-represented
researchers, as well as policy makers responsible for water management in the
Western US, providing excellent opportunities for both scientific mentoring
exchange and translation of scientific knowledge to practice. The young
scientists in particular will benefit significantly from the networking and
synthesis activities of the symposium.
