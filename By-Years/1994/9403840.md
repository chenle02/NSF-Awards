ABSTRACT 9403840 Richard Masel This is a combined experimental and theoretical
study of the structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions on metal surfaces.
Ultrahigh-vacuum surface spectroscopic techniques are used to examine the
interactions of simple hydrocarbon ligands with a series of platinum single
crystals that expose various index planes. The experimental observations are
compared to the results of density functional calculations, and the process
iterated by designing new experiments to test predictions of the theoretical
calculations. The objective is to identify the key interactions that control the
reactions of hydrocarbons and describe how those interactions vary from one
crystal face to another. It has long been known that catalytic activities for
various reactions on metals vary from one crystal face to another; in many
cases, the distribution of exposed planes is a predicter of selectivity. While
some extreme cases can be explained by crude steric or geometric arguments,
there is no satisfactory theoretical framework to address this issue, which is
critical for many processes in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and fuel
industries. This effort addresses that need. ***
