This project involves a grant for training in ethnographic research methods to
the department of anthropology at Brown University. The funds will be used over
a period of five years to insure that Ph.D. students in social/cultural
anthropology who take a specified course of study in scientific research design
and methodology have fieldwork experience before they begin their Ph.D.
research. This activity is important to insure that the training of social
scientists is as well-developed as possible, so that the new cohort of social
researchers will be capable of advancing our knowledge of contemporary problems
as well as of basic research issues.
