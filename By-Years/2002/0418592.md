0418592 Mercer This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award,
jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place
at the McLaughlin Research Institute in Great Falls, Montana in early 2005 on
the topic of unconventional myosins. The Institute will comprise approximately
30 students and 10-12 active Latin American and U.S. researchers in the field,
covering the disciplines of genomics, genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and
biophysics in yeast, plant, and animal systems.

The PASI is designed to provide an introduction to the field to senior graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows. Second, it will provide a venue for
initiating Inter-American collaborations. Third, the program will promote
interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations between established
investigators and those new to the field. Fourth, all Institute lectures and
materials will be made publicly available on a Web site.
