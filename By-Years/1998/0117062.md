ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0117062&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two researcher
from the State University of New York-Stony Brook will continue their research
into the effects that bottom-dwelling animals have on the rates of diagenetic
reactions, sediment-water solute exchange and storage of organic/mineral phases
in sedimentary deposits. To achieve these objectives, the PIs will focus their
research along the following three, interrelated experimental efforts: (1)
irrigation, diffusion structure and optimal scaling of coupled oxic-anoxic
reactions; (2) diffusive permeability of burrow linings and mucoid secretions in
sediments; and (3) multi-dimensional solute distributions in the bioturbated
zone. This team of scientists also plans to add CO2 and specific exoenzyme
sensors to their radiometric pH/O2 sensor and use these planar sensor techniques
for in-situ measurements on the REMOTS lander system. The long term goals of
this research will be a model that outlines the types of transport and reaction
balances occurring during early diagenesis in the bioturbated zone and an
exploration of the corresponding elemental cycling and ecological
implications.&lt;br/&gt;
