California State University at Chico is acquiring instrumentation which improves
the quality of undergraduate research and updates the laboratory portion of
water pollution analysis courses. The instrument being purchased is a gas
chromatograph with an electron capture detector capable of analyzing water
samples for pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and halogenated hydrocarbons.
The project enable students to participate in all phases of research from
project design to presentation of results at a symposium or in a journal. Their
study of monitoring groundwater pollution is being done in cooperation with the
California Department of Water Resources. The new equipment allows the students
to use the best available technology in their study of contemporary water
pollution problems. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
