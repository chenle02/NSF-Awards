The World Media Foundation is producing and distributing "Emerging Science of
Environmental Change." This radio-based project presents new and cutting edge
research to the public through National Public Radio broadcasts, Internet radio
broadcasts, multi-media web presentations, Internet-based discussion, formal
school curricula and public lectures. The goal of the project is to provide the
public with a longitudinal view of how those engaged in cutting-edge science
formulate theories, structure their inquiries and monitor the ongoing processes,
pitfalls, unexpected results and successes of their research. The production
team will closely follow the work and processes of one or more research teams
over major portions of the 36-month project in order to provide an in-depth
understanding of the research process.

The project will deliver nine one-hour radio specials and nine additional hours
of shorter program segments that will be included in the NPR "Living on Earth"
series. The online component of the project will present expanded versions of
the audio through its daily web radio service, as well as multi-media web pages
with references and discussions linked to the core subjects of the specials.
School outreach will be directed primarily at largely urban, under-served middle
and high schools. It will use the audio and multi-media web presentations of
current research as frames of reference for student instruction in environmental
science.
