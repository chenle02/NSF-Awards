This award will provide travel support for ten students to attend the 14th
annual International Ionospheric Effects Symposium (IES2015) will be held May
12-14, 2015, in Alexandria, Virginia. The meeting will bring together a broad
spectrum of scientists, engineers, and program managers to review impacts of
ionospheric phenomena and space weather events. &lt;br/&gt; This year the
National RF Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop will be combined with the
IES2015. The focus of the RFII workshop is the interaction of high-power RF
waves from ground-based transmitters with the ionospheric plasma and resultant
phenomena such as the generation of ELF waves, ionospheric irregularities, and
induced optical emissions. There is a community of researchers dedicated to
understanding these effects and an annual meeting provides a forum for
communicating their results.
