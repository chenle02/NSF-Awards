Ship operations play a vital role at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School
of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) with respect to the School's outreach
and education missions. The School is committed to improving scientific and
environmental literary among students and adults regionally, nationally, and
internationally. RSMAS owns and operates R/V F. G. Walton Smith, an aluminum
hull catamaran. The vessel has been service since December, 2000, and has
performed will in supporting a variety of marine scientific missions. She has
the unique capability of operating in shallow coastal waters which are
inaccessible to deeper draft vessels, and as such represents an important asset
in the Academic Research Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
