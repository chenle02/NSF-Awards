The primary aim of this research program is to study the applications of modular
and automorphic forms, and hypergeometric q-series. These applications include a
wide selection of different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, such
as the theory of integer partitions, combinatorial probability and Markov
processes, bootstrap percolation models, affine Lie superalgebras, and
(quadratic) Hurwitz class numbers. The automorphic objects of interest include
modular and Jacobi forms, as well as mock modular and Jacobi forms, which have
seen a great deal of recent interest thanks to work of Borcherds, Bringmann,
Bruinier, Funke, Ono, Zagier, and Zwegers. Mock modular forms are of particular
interest due both to their connections with harmonic Maass forms, as well as
their famous history as objects of mystery dating back to Ramanujan and Watson.
As an example of the interplay between automorphic forms and other topics, the
PI and Bringmann recently used combinatorial probability bounds for gap-avoiding
sequences (that first arose in Holroyd, Liggett, and Romik's study of finite-
size scaling in bootstrap percolation) in order to prove a cuspidal asymptotic
expansion for a family of hypergeometric q-series considered by
Andrews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its scope, this research program has the
potential for wide-ranging applications. An underlying theme is the universality
of the tools and techniques of modern number theory, whose best-known uses
include cryptography and cellular communication. This research will also
illustrate applications to high-energy physics (where wall-crossings and black
holes are described by mock theta functions), and biological 'growth' processes
(where the the large-scale behavior of cellular automata is determined by the
asymptotic expansions of modular forms).
