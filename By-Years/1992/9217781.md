A field program to collect piston and gravity cores form N. Atlantic to
ascertain the source of material in "Heinrichs" layers and to search for
climatic events recorded in ice cores. Heinrich layers are devoid of
foraminaferal shells and contain different ice-rafted debris than underlying
glacial sediments. Is this PIs will use color variations to identify millennia
duration events back to isotopic stage 5 at Site 609. Fresh cores will be
obtained in high sedimentation rate areas in sediment drifts. AMS dating will
provide chronology.
