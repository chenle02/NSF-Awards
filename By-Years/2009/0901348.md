This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
acquire a better understanding of the charge transfer that takes place at the
interfaces between organic semiconductors and metal, over a broad range of
disorder in the organic material. This charge transfer strongly affects the
electrical properties of such interfaces, which are critical to organic
transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic devices. The approach is to
perform three types of measurements (nanoscale electronic transport; alternating
current scanning tunneling microscopy; and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy)
on three of the most technologically relevant materials systems. By combining
data from these complementary techniques, and working with theorist
collaborators, a systematic knowledge of the charge transfer and energetic
alignment in these systems will be acquired. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
of this project is that it would improve understanding of device physics that is
essential for optimization and establishing the limits of organic device
performance. Simultaneously, these issues involve some of the most challenging
questions in condensed matter physics. Combining the expertise of the PIs will
lead to new experimental techniques that span from the nanoscale to the
macroscopic and from DC to the THz frequency regime.&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this project are threefold. First, the insights into these issues may
have direct impact on commercial applications of organic semiconductors,
including photovoltaics and lighting. Second, the project will support the
research training of two graduate students, as technical workforce development.
Third, the PIs will use outreach opportunities to educate the broader community
about organic semiconductors and related technologies.
