The Symposium on Atomic Spectroscopy and Highly-Ionized Atoms brings together
two important international conferences. The first-the Symposium on Atomic
Spectroscopy-has been held quadriennally for some decades. It focusses on the
well-defined field of atomic energy levels. The second-the more recently
organized Conference on Highly-Ionized Atoms-deals with the new topic of the
properties of atoms with most of their orbital electrons removed so they are
isoelectronic with the simplest atoms. The merging of these two conferences
promises to provide a meeting ground for the exchange of new ideas in a broad
range of atomic physics.
