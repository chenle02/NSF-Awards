The 6th International Conference on Legume Genetics and Genomics (ICLGG) will
convene in Hyderabad, India from October 2-7 2012. The ICLGG provides a common
meeting to increase interaction among researchers working on various legume
species, both as crops and as model organisms. Legumes occupy a unique position
in both agricultural and natural systems. In particular, they are well known as
a primary source of reduced nitrogen and phosphorus in farming systems, due to
their root nodule and mycorrhizal symbioses. These same properties underlie the
high protein nitrogen content in legume seed, making them an important source of
nutritional nitrogen in the human diet. In both basic and applied research for
legumes, there remain large gaps between theoretical and actual yields for many
legume crops under many agronomic situations. Understanding the fundamental
genetics, genomics, and biochemistry of traits that underlie natural fitness and
agronomic performance is a major challenge for plant biology, worldwide, and has
profound implications for improving human nutrition and increasing agricultural
sustainability. The ICLGG meeting will bring together a diverse group of
international scholars for dialogue on the most current topics of legume
genomics, genetics, and biology, with strong focus on the translation of basic
research in model systems to applied outcomes in crop legumes.

The resources derived from this proposal will be used to broaden participation
and provide provide novel opportunities by defraying the costs of participation
for US graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, with specific emphasis on
women and members of underrepresented groups who might not otherwise have the
financial means to attend and participate in the ICLGG.
