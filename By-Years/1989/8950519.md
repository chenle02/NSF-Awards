The acquisition of Thornton physicological systems will provide rigorous
laboratory courses for students interested in the study of physiology. The
upgrade in equipment will enable the department to expand experiments,
facilitate data analysis, reduce set-up time and enhance safety in nine
physiology courses. It will greatly increase opportunities for more students to
take physiological laboratory courses and to participate in individual student
research projects. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
