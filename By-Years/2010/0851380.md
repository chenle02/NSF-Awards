This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5). The proposed work is to examine changes in
structural and physical properties along the southern Costa Rica subduction zone
using 3D seismic imaging. At this location the plate boundary transitions from
stable sliding to unstable sliding. Understanding subduction zone processes is
important for assessing geologic hazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis in
these environments. In the proposed work, seismically imaged structures will be
used to address several fundamental problems such as 1) the structure and nature
of large sediment lenses that are being subducted; b) the effects of existing
seafloor topography on subduction processes; c) the changes in plate boundary
fault geometry along the trench; and d) the variations in the structure of the
upper plate along the subduction zone. This work will support the education and
training of graduate students. There is international collaboration with
scientists from Spain, Germany and Costa Rica. There is also a component of
industry support.
