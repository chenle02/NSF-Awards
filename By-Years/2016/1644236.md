This project aims to improve transfer student success at Arizona State
University (ASU). A significant problem is that although transfer students make
up 33% of entering science majors at ASU, they have lower retention rates, a
slower time to graduation, and do not participate as much in undergraduate
research as students who begin their college experience at ASU. This project
uses a scholarship program to give transfer students access to a set of courses
that help support and mentor them in undergraduate research experiences. By
focusing on transfer students, the project will broaden the participation of
students underrepresented in science at ASU because transfer students are a more
diverse student population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
integrate transfer students into the high impact practice of scientific research
through a scholarship program. Fifty transfer students will progress through
four levels of courses that will take them from novice to practicing scientist.
These course-supported undergraduate research experiences will provide the
structure for a unique research learning community among transfer students in
biological sciences, physical sciences, and geosciences and the integration of
these transfer students into the established scientific research community. The
impact of this program is being measured to determine factors that increase the
quality of the experience of transfer students, specifically leading to better
research experiences, graduation rates, and entry into the workforce or graduate
school. This project will advance understanding of how participation in research
can positively impact the experience of transfer students. Further, the
curriculum will be packaged for broad dissemination and could be used as a model
for other institutions who are interested in engaging transfer students in
research.
