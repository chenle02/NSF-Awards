9422182 Irene The principal scientific objective of the research is to elucidate
the mechanisms of deposition, film formation and interface reactions for high
temperature superconductor films and heterostructures. In order to accomplish
this objective two complimentary techniques, namely time of flight ion
scattering and recoil spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry will be used
for in-situ real time analysis of the film formation and interactions of the
high temperature superconductor films and heterostructures. It is anticipated
that this research program will not only produce considerable information about
the formation and interface reactions of high temperature superconductor and
ferroelectric films and heterostructures, but also the knowledge necessary to
implement a fully integrated time of flight ion scattering and recoil
spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, ion beam sputter-deposition system for
the preparation of these complex materials and structures.
