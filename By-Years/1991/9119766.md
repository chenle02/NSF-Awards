The goal of this project is to find the simplest atmospheric model that
captures the essential physics of the dynamics of long-lived planetary features
such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other coherent vortices, the Dark Spot of
Neptune, the polar vortex of Saturn, and the Earth's Antarctic polar vortex. The
philosophy is that a simple, but qualitatively correct model is the key to a
good physical understanding of the mechanisms that govern planetary vortices,
their wakes, and their waves.
