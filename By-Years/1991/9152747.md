This project provides an integrated PC-VAX environment which will be used: 1) to
implement an innovative Systems Analysis and Design course; 2) to make
innovations in teaching Comparative Programming Languages; 3) to enhance the
computer lab experience available to all the other computer science courses; and
4) to update and expand access to computing for improvement of the other science
and math courses. The equipment consists of a VAX 3300, ten IBM-AT compatible
microcomputers, four MAC SE computers, assorted network hardware, and software
for networking and for programming. This configuration prepares students for the
kind of computing environments found among employers who are using distributed
processing systems with centralized data bases. In addition, the access to
computing facilities will be vastly improved for all Navajo students attending
this Tribal College on the Navajo Reservation.
