This is an application for partial funding of a conference on the molecular
biology of organelles, being held under the auspices of the University of
Florida from February 22-25, 1990 at the Belleview Biltmore, Clearwater Florida.
Participation will be limited to 200 scientist applicants who will be selected
on the basis of their expertise and interests as being the most likely to help
create a stimulating and informative meeting. The topic of the meeting focuses
on DNA containing organelles in animals, plants and fungi and will emphasize
research on control of replication and transcription, post-transcriptional
regulation, nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, protein targeting, and genetics
and evolution. The conference will consist of five, half-day scientific
sessions, each with six speakers; in addition two afternoons will be devoted to
poster sessions. All session chairpersons have been invited and have accepted,
and most other speakers have been confirmed as well. We anticipate this meeting
to become a regular organelle molecular biology conference in years when no
Gordon or Cold Spring Harbor Conference is offered.
