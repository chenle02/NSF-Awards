This project aims to characterize the mobility of the receptor or epidermal
growth factor (EGF) using digital imaging optical microscopy and a novel methods
of visualization of receptor location. Additionally, the changes in free
cytosolic calcium ion activity induced by EGF stimulation will be measured at
the level of the individual cell. EGF is a polypeptide which binds to a specific
plasma membrane on various different cell types. It triggers a number of
responses in the cell ultimately leading to a stimulation of DNA synthesis. In
addition to the stimulation of proliferation, EGF induces early and late
responses which may play a role in the transduction of the signal initiated by
the binding of EGF and culminating with mitogenesis.
