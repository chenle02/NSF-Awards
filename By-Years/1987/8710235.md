Previous studies of the immune responses of tadpoles and adult South African
clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis, have shown that tadpole responses are generally
poorer, indicative of an immature immune system. Because immune responses
improve after metamorphosis, and this improvement appears to be thyroxine
dependent, it is postulated that the hormonal changes at metamorphosis transform
the larval immune system to an adult- type system. Specifically, it is proposed
that a population of larval lymphocytes is destroyed at metamorphosis and is
replaced following a new wave of hematopoiesis by another population that will
function in the adult. The studies proposed here are designed to examine further
the immunological deficits that result from low thyroid hormone concentrations
during development and metamorphosis, to establish more clearly whether a
distinct larval lymphocyte population exists, and to examine the effects of
altered thyroid hormone concentrations during metamorphosis on the decline of
the putative larval population and emergence of the adult population. Direct
effects of thyroid and corticosteroid hormones on the viability and function of
cultured lymphocytes from premetamorphic tadpoles, metamorphosing tadpoles, and
adult frogs will also be studied. Finally, a study of the expression of Class I
MHC antigens in precociously metamorphosis frogs will test the hypothesis that
altered skin allograft rejection responses in these frogs is due to premature
expansion of the adult lymphocyte population prior to expression of Class I
antigens. Because tadpoles develop as free-living organisms they need a
functional immune system to protect them from environmental pathogens. The
larval immune system must change during metamorphosis to accomodate new adult-
specific antigens, or these antigens would be recognized as foreign and the
metamorphosing tadpole would begin to destroy itself. Understanding how the
immune system changes at metamorphosis and the role of various metamorphosis-
related hormones in these changes should give us greater insight into the
process by which self-recognition and immunological tolerance to self develop.
