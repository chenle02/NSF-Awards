This project involves the creation of a Mathematica calculus laboratory to
allow for the introduction of a reformed, laboratory-based, calculus course
using the Duke/Bowdoin Project CALC materials. The 3-semester calculus sequence
is the project's major source of contact with science majors. Mathematica is
perhaps the most powerful piece of software currently available for use by
mathematicians and scientists. The project's effort to present a laboratory-
based calculus course enables the mathematics department and the science
departments to build on the students' knowledge of Mathematica to enhance
instruction in advanced courses. The project's immediate goals are construction
of an optimum hardware/software teaching environment for a Mathematica calculus
laboratory where students can use the calculus materials developed at Duke
University, Bowdoin College, and Rockhurst College; dissemination of information
regarding issues of teaching and group-learning mathematics in a laboratory
environment to colleagues at both the collegiate and precollegiate level;
forging of new relationships with five high schools in the area by offering
calculus workshops based on laboratory experiences to faculty and students from
those institutions; and comparison of the results of a 3-year project using
Hewlett-Packard 48G graphing calculators in calculus with those using a
Mathematica computer laboratory.
