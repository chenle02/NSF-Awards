The Ruoff group will undertake studies of the mechanical properties of
atomically thin membranes. Two tools will be used to make these measurements: An
atomic force microscope will directly stress the membranes. An optical
profilometer will separately be used to measure the deflection of the membranes
as a function of applied pressure. Several different materials will be measured:
atom-thick graphene, oxidized graphene, single layer clays, and very thin
amorphous carbon films. Models will be developed to better understand the
mechanical behavior of these very thin films and to extract the basic mechanical
properties from the experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such atomically thin
membranes will find use in a host of important applications, such as for
pressure sensing, and as electromechanical and chemical sensing elements. The
database established for the mechanical response of individual layers and few-
layer stacks will be relevant to understanding the role such thin platelets play
in composite materials, and in a variety of applications such as nanoelectronics
and senors. The project includes significant outreach such as research training
for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, summer research experiences for
high school and undergraduate students and high school teachers, additions to
course materials used at UT Austin, and curriculum development for grades 7-12.
Research results will be disseminated by publication in quality journals, and
invited talks at universities, national laboratories, institutes, and other
public forums, at international conferences, and on a highly visible web site.
