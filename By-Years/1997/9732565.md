*** 9732565 Ruetzler This small award will allow the Caribbean Coral Reef
Ecosystems Program and its lab in Belize to acquire a small research boat to
accommodate visiting scientists working in the coral reef, seagrass and mangrove
systems of the Belizean barrier reef complex. This will allow scientists at the
lab to optimize their investigations of coral bleaching in the Belize barrier
reef complex as well as to accommodate studies of the possible responses to ENSO
perturbations. The NSF supports many scientists using the CCRE lab for short-
term experimental studies and excellent field access. The new vessel will
improve the capability of the lab and will facilitate many research projects.
