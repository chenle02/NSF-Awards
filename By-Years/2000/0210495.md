0210495&lt;br/&gt;Carney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in
response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category
NER. Nanoscale science and engineering is the bedrock upon which 21st century
technological progress will be based. Large carbon molecules, such as buckyballs
and nanotubes have gained recognition as promising tools for use in developing
nanotechnology. Due to the electronic structure of the carbon atom, large carbon
molecules can display a range of conduction behavior from insulator to
semiconductor to semimetallic to metallic. The molecules also display striking
mechanical properties that have already been brought to application in
technology such as atomic force microscopy where nantubes have been used as
probe tips. The optical properties of nanotubes remain largely
unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As device development continues, optical
inspection methods also become more important. The PI's will perform exploratory
theoretical investigations of the interaction of carbon nanotubes and light.
This work is timely and is needed to direct experimental studies and device
design in the near future. They will compute the electronic (excitonic) mode
structure of a realistic device: a carbon nanotube of finite length. The
electronic structure calculation will be carried out with a fully quantum
mechanical treatment. They will then compute the coupling of these modes to an
external electromagnetic field. The resulting description of the nanotube will
facilitate analysis of the structure in an optical field. This will enhance
their understanding of the results of optical measurements and will also point
to uses of nanotubes as components of a nano-optical system. Near-field
microscopy is one application of particular interest here and will be
investigated in some depth. Practical applications of the theory will cover a
great breadth of fields ranging from near-field microscopy to integrated optics.
