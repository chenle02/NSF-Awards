0110577&lt;br/&gt;Riley&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the Gordon Research
Conference on Nuclear&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is to provide the international
community of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;scientists with a unique forum in which the
newest developments at the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of this science can be presented
and subjected to detailed and&lt;br/&gt;extended discussions and criticism. The
purpose of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;encourage communication and the
discussions to be conducted in an&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere conducive to open
interactions between the scientists,&lt;br/&gt;provoking new and even
speculative ideas for future research. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish these goals
requires the participation in all of the&lt;br/&gt;conference activities of a
significant number of leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;However, a science as
rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites&lt;br/&gt;and needs cooperative
efforts on all levels, including efforts both&lt;br/&gt;national and worldwide
in scope. The participation of younger&lt;br/&gt;scientists is essential to
address the future manpower needs of this&lt;br/&gt;rapidly changing field.
Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers and graduate
students have been specially selected for&lt;br/&gt;participation in this
conference and encouraged to present their ideas. &lt;br/&gt;Their participation
in this conference provides them with unique and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to
the leaders in their field, exposes them to new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities
and techniques and helps prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they
will assume in the future. This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation
from these junior scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
