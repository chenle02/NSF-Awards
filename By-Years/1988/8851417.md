An electronic theodolite coupled to an electronic distance meter, a small hand
held computer and a field printer, subsequently interfaced with the field
laboratory microcomputer, enhance the ability of students to participate in the
analysis of data in an archaeological field school context. The same equipment,
by increasing the efficiency of data collection, allows on campus students in an
archaeological field methods class to map data for the more satisfactory
completion of research projects. The award will be matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
