9707602 Ketterson This award will provide funds that will be matched by the
American Ornithologist's Union (AOU) and used to help defray part of the travel
costs of U.S. scientists to attend the XXIInd International Ornithological
Congress to be held in Durban, South Africa, in August of 1998. The award will
help allow U.S. scientists to attend numerous plenary lectures and symposia, and
to participate as speakers in these and other sessions (e.g., contributed
papers, round-table discussions) at the Congress. In addition, participation by
U.S. scientists will facilitate exchange of new information and foster
collaborative-international agreements. Selection procedures for awards from the
AOU are in place, and attempts will be made to support younger scientists.
Because awards by the AOU to individual scientists are fairly small, the NSF
award could be used to help defray tavel costs for more than 30 scientists.
