The Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences (ISDS) at
Duke&lt;br/&gt;University will purchase high-speed computing equipment to
be&lt;br/&gt;dedicated to support of several linked projects in statistical
and&lt;br/&gt;computational methodology for bioinformatics. Specific
research&lt;br/&gt;projects involve stochastic modeling of biomolecular sequence
and&lt;br/&gt;structure, models and computation for large-scale
functional&lt;br/&gt;genomics, and statistical modeling for gene
characterization studies.&lt;br/&gt;The grant will provide high-throughput
networking equipment, high-speed &lt;br/&gt;numerical servers, a file server,
and a high-throughput ethernet switch &lt;br/&gt;and connectors. This equipment,
together with desktop machines providing&lt;br/&gt;platforms for local, non-
numerically intensive computations, will provide&lt;br/&gt;a numerical/file
server cluster for the three faculty investigators,&lt;br/&gt;post-doctoral
associates and graduate students working on the
proposed&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics projects.&lt;br/&gt;
