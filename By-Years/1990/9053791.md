This two-year project will double or triple the time spent on science and
mathematics by elementary students in Marshall County, West Virginia. The
Science and Mathematics Education Enhancement Council (SciMEEC), an incorporated
group of citizens, parents, teachers, and scientists, is collaborating with 12
public and 4 private schools in the county to develop 32 weekly after-school
hands-on science and mathematics experiences for children in each grade, K
through 6, whose parents wish to enroll them. Each of the seven levels will
build upon those which have come before but will also be sufficiently self-
contained to permit students to enter at any grade level. Two parents whose
children are enrolled will be recruited and trained to serve as volunteer
assistants for each of the school teachers who are involved in the project.
Additional support is being provided by the corporate sector in both cash and
in-kind contributions. At the end of NSF support the project will be a self-
sustaining program through contributions from the corporate sector and fees from
participants.
