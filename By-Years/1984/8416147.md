The demand for upgrading and retrofitting structures to meet current seismic
standards is increasing and there is a pressing need for codes of practice and
methodologies to guide engineers in this large task. Generally, current building
codes do not address repair and strengthening problems and the success of repair
and strengthening schemes is highly dependent on the experience of the engineer
as well as the overall construction quality process. This research project will
address specific topics related to the strengthening of reinforced concrete
frame structures. These topics include shear-transfer problems associated with
jacketing existing concrete members with new concrete, increasing the strength
and ductility of moment-resisting frames by providing a system of steel braces
to resist earthquake loads, improving the performance of frames with weak beams
and weak columns by jacketing the members, and providing the lateral resistance
by infilling single bays of frame structures.
