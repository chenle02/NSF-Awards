9451355 Eastlake This project provides students with hands-on experience with
Design For Manufacturing (DFM) as well as the latest in CAD software in an
integrated package. This is accomplished by acquiring a developed and proven
computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM) hardware/software package which
can be directly incorporated into the two-semester capstone aircraft design
sequence in the Aerospace Engineering program. Initially, this system is being
employed for manufacturing wind tunnel models in the Aircraft Preliminary Design
course and for designing, analyzing, and manufacturing proof-of- concept
structural components in the Aircraft Detail Design course. Solid modeling and
rapid prototyping employing stereolithography have been successfully introduced
and DFM/CADAM is the next logical step. This exposure demonstrates one of the
ways that increased attention to the practical realities of modern manufacturing
within engineering education can assist in making industry more efficient and
productive.
