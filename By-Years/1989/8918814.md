This research is concerned with developing models to aid decisions about the
trade-offs between competing telecommunications technologies and the services
offered through them. The work is particularly concerned with planning models
for communications satellites. This work is part of a larger study of
technological and market factors on the cost effectiveness of terrestrial and
satellite communications systems in competitive environments. It aims to develop
quantitative tools to manage the development and operation of such systems. The
models under study in this research relate to decision on key technical
parameters, performance requirements, types of communications service is to be
offered, the volume of each type of service to be carried on the system and the
price to be charged. The work will develop the mathematical models, develop
efficient solution methods for them, test and validate them with available data,
and design a user interface with access to a database of economic and technical
information. The work is significant for increasing our understanding of the
interplay between a variety of technical and economic factors in making choices
about expensive, long lived telecommunications assets and the services they will
be capable of providing.
