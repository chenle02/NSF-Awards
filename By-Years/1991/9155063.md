The Florida Institute of Technology will initiate a four-week, residential
Young Scholars project in Environmental Science for 20 students entering grades
10-12. The program combines challenging academic work with extensive field
experiences and stimulating physical challenges. Participants apply scientific
principles to real-life environmental problems while exploring the unique and
diverse habitats of Central Florida and the Great Smoky Mountains. Academic work
focuses on environmental science but includes related topics from resource
management, conservation biology, and research methodology. Field experiences
will emphasize the development of the knowledge, skills and techniques needed to
prepare ecosystem profiles of natural communities. In follow-up activities
participants will prepare ecosystem profiles of natural communities near their
home or school, make comparisons with communities studied during the summer, and
prepare and present a report of their findings in their own schools.
