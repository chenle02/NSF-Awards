Researchers at Harvard University and Aurora Flight Sciences are developing the
Perseus unmanned aircraft as a dedicated platform for high-altitude atmospheric
science research. Its initial mission is to carry a 50kg (110 lb) payload to an
altitude of 25 km (82,000 ft) and return it for reuse. The combination of
computationally based low Reynolds number aerodynamics, lightweight composite
structures, and advanced microelectronics represented in Perseus promises to
offer significant capability enhancements for a variety of atmospheric
investigations, both research and operational. Some of the missions proposed to
date include measuring the stratospheric chemistry, earth's radiation budget,
determining sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4, studying stratosphere-troposphere
exchange, hurricane research and forecasting, and tropical meteorology. Many of
these missions require platforms with either high altitude capability or long
duration.
