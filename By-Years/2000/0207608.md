Dziewonski&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207608&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objectives
of this project are the systematic investigation of global seismicity and the
three-dimensional mapping of the Earth's interior. The earthquake studies are
focused around the Harvard CMT project. All earthquakes with magnitudes greater
than approximately 5.2 are analyzed for their source mechanisms using digital
data from globally distributed seismographs. Unusual seismic phenomena, such as
slow earthquakes, volcanic collapses, and unidentified seismic signals, are
investigated in detail. Results are disseminated using electronic mail and the
Harvard Seismology web page: http://www.seismology.harvard.edu. The imaging of
the elastic properties of the Earth's interior is pursued by development of new
data sets and the joint inversion of various existing data sets, such as
absolute and differential travel times, surface-wave dispersion curves, full
waveforms, and normal-mode spectra. Particular consideration is given to the
inclusion of anisotropy (radial, azimuthal, and general) in the model
parameterization and inversion. Models and derived data sets are available on
the investigators' web site.&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
