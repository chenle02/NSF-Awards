Multiple Imputation: Research for the Third Decade DMS-9705158 Donald B. Rubin
and John Barnard Harvard University The third decade of multiple imputation
begins with ever-growing applications, even into areas not originally proposed
(e.g., environmental studies, chemistry), an increasing availability of
software, and an increasing amount of statistical research work being conducted.
The expanded, almost routine, use of multiple imputation means that many
technical issues, considered relatively minor in its early development, need
attention. This research addresses several of the most important issues, in
particular: (1) creating multiple imputations under more general and flexible
models; (2) creating "nested" multiple imputations in data sets with large and
highly variable fractions of missing information; (3) using cross-match
techniques to analyze data sets having only a few multiple imputations but large
fractions of missing information, especially for obtaining valid p-values; (4)
analyzing data sets with nested multiple imputations; and (5) conducting
exploratory and diagnostic analyses on multiply-imputed data sets. Missing
values are prevalent in many data sets and can be a great hindrance in making
inference. Multiple imputation has proven to be a useful mode of inference in
the presence of missing data. The basic aim of multiple imputation is to allow
users of incomplete data sets, who typically have little information about the
missing-data mechanism, to reach valid statistical inferences using only (1)
standard complete-data analysis techniques and (2) simple rules for combining
the output of the complete-data analyses. Multiple imputation has been
successfully used in many contexts including in the social and economic
sciences, the history of science, and in biomedical applications. This effort
extends the applicability and the ease of use of multiple imputation, which
enters its third decade where it should become an important tool in everyday
statistical practice.
