The objective of this industry internship is to develop a Computer Integrated
Production Planning and Control (CIRR &amp; C) system for the process of
furniture manufacturing. The project will be carried out in collaboration with
the Forestry Science Laboratory in Princeton, West Virginia. The work will focus
on the functional and mathematical integration of the network of methodologies
which constitute a CIRR &amp; C system for this environment. This research is
generic in nature and will be applicable to other industrial settings.
