AST 95-29225 PI: Lev Kofman Inflation and the Origin of Matter in the Universe
According to inflationary cosmology, all the elementary particles which we see
now were not present at the moment of the Big Bang, but were created by the
decaying scalar field at the end of the inflationary stage. The process of
creation of matter during the decay of the scalar field and the subsequent
process of thermalization of the created particles is called reheating. The
theory of reheating is still incomplete, and is interrelated with the dark
matter problem. Recent studies by the PI and his colleagues have discovered more
efficient methods of reheating which have important implications for
cosmological models. For example, standard inflation theory results in a flat
universe (Omega = 1); with different reheating parameters, a different
distribution of density fluctuations may result, with a different amount of dark
matter. Since current observations produce densities well below those of a flat
universe, the amount of dark matter can be critical in establishing whether
inflation theory does indeed hold. The PI intends to investigate the production
of elementary particles when the new reheating methods are allowed for, and to
examine the influence of the cosmological constant on the models with the new
reheating methods, using an analytic approach.
