9422452 Wills This activity will study a highly parallel computer that features
a three dimensional, optical interconnection network. The extremely compact
system is design to process high throughput data streams in applications such as
image processing. The high density and large I/O bandwidth result from optical
communication channels between Si-based processors. By using integrated
optoelectronic devices operating at wavelengths to which silicon is transparent,
through-wafer vertical optical communications channels are formed between
stacked silicon circuitry. Thin film optoelectronic devices are bonded directly
to SI integrated circuits to realize this self contained vertical optical
interconnect. To construct the system, silicon chips containing a digital
processor, network interface, and router, plus analog interface circuitry for
the thin film devices, are fabricated through a standard IC foundry. The chips
are then post processed to integrate the thin film optoelectronic devices using
standard, low cost, high yield microfabrication techniques. Two dimensional
planes of these chips are then stacked to form the three dimensional system
which is connected by the vertical optical channels. The use of integrated
through-wafer optical interconnect will lead, long term, to extremely dense
systems (4096 processors in a four inch cube with high throughput (820 Gbits/sec
external I/O bandwidth, 3.2 Tbits/sec aggregate bandwidth). The proposed system
will accelerate an established, interdisciplinary collaborative group of faculty
and students in the areas of parallel computational architectures, analog
circuits, optoelectronic devices and integration, and crystal growth. It is this
type of collaboration that enables the realization of a revolutionary,
predominantly electronic system with simple point-to-point optoelectronic
interconnects, and helps to identify for each of the researchers the critical
points and trade-offs which must be considered from a system perspective.
