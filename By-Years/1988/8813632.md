This proposal seeks to develop mathematical methods of computer science for the
purpose of testing program correctness. The simpler but nevertheless nontrivial
problem of deciding whether or not a given program on a given input outputs the
correct answer will be investigated. Consider a program P that, while having
been written to solve general instances of a certain problem, is actually run on
just one or a few select instances. In this case, instead of proving the
correctness of program P on all inputs, it suffices to prove that the output of
P on the given few instances is correct (or to exhibit a bug in P). For example,
suppose program P is supposed to decide if two graphs G and H are isomorphic. If
P supplies the isomorphism, then it is easy to check that the isomorphism really
works. Interestingly, the interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism serves to
test the correctness of a program that asserts that G and H are not isomorphic.
Given any program for graph isomorphism, this test procedure either gives
quantifiable mathematical evidence that the program's answer is correct, or else
it proves that the program has a bug. This raises the question: which
computational problems (such as graph isomorphism) have the property that a
program for the problem on any given input can be efficiently tested for
correctness? Initial studies show that a large collection of programming
problems drawn from block designs, graphs, codes, matrices over GF(q), latin
squares, etc., can be tested by similar techniques. A useful natural (group
theoretic) description of a broad class of computational problems, including
those mentioned above, whose programs can be tested by such schemes is sought.
