ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruev,
Victor&lt;br/&gt;1603933&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, cancer surgeons use
their naked eye and palpitation because other imaging technologies are not
conducive to the operating room. This proposal deals with the design of an
image-guided surgical platform where surgeons would wear goggles and a
specialized imaging device to obtain an enhanced view of the boundaries of a
tumor site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many imaging technologies
exist, none are conducive to the operating room either due to size or
incompatibility with surgical tools. To address current limitations the PIs
propose a biologically inspired solution that mimics the compound eye of the
mantis shrimp. They will employ pixelated filters with a transmission ratio of
90% and the pixel pitch will match that of a CMOS photodiode array
