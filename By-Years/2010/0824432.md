This conference proposal brings together researchers from the cognitive sciences
and science education who are actively engaged in conducting research around
learning progressions. The PIs argue that learning progressions represent a
promising framework for developing organized curricula and meaningful
assessments in science. For this reason, they are gaining popularity in the
science education community. However, the PIs identify a number of issues that
must be addressed around learning progressions and these issues form the strands
for the conference. They include (1) the need for clearer definitions; (2)
developing and validating assessments; (3) using statistical modeling to
summarize students' level on a learning progression; and (4) implications of
learning progressions for curriculum, teacher education and
assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a workshop format to discuss
the above challenges, to identify concrete examples of how researchers are
addressing these challenges and to develop where there is consensus to guide
productive next steps.
