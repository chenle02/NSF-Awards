9634499 Sansalone Currently, evaluation of post-tensioned structures is
performed predominantly by relying on invasive testing. The project will develop
methods based on use of impact- generated stress waves. Preliminary studies on
single ducts located in plate-like structures have shown that such methods have
the potential to detect voids in grouted metal tendon ducts. However, a
comprehensive and basic research study is still needed to (1) understand the
propagation of transient stress waves in typical post-tensioned structural
geometries, (2) to understand the interaction of stress waves with partial and
full voids in ducts, as well as water- filled voids in ducts, (3) the effects
caused by the use of plastic tendon ducts, (4) the interaction of stress waves
with ducts closely spaced and ducts located two and three deep in a cross-
section, and (5) to determine whether the extent of grouting in ducts can be
determined during the grouting process. ***
