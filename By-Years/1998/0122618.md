This project will utilize data from the international Geotail satellite to
examine the properties of the dense sheet of plasma that is found in the
equatorial region of the Earth's magnetotail. The work will determine the
properties of the particle drifts, the pressure tensor, the transport of
magnetic flux, the structure of the current sheet, field-aligned currents, and
magnetic reconnection. The data will be binned according to solar wind and
geomagnetic parameters in order to determine how the solar wind and the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control the properties of the plasma sheet.
Three-dimensional models will be generated for different solar wind and IMF
conditions.
