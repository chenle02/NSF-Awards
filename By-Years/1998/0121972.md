ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Geosciences in Alaska&lt;br/&gt;Field Explorations and
Research for K-12 Teachers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Geosciences in Alaska" is a
collaborative project among the University of Alaska Museum, the University of
California Museum of Paleontology, and the West Contra Costa Unified School
District. It provides a professional development opportunity for teachers that
combines both field and research experiences and evaluates the impact of these
experiences on their teaching. &lt;br/&gt;Working with faculty and staff
associated with the University of Alaska Museum and the University of California
Museum of Paleontology, teachers participate in an introductory local field
trip, and four weeks of field experience in Alaska, followed by an additional
excursion locally in which they will apply what they have learned. This
comparison between two distinct yet similar geological settings, Alaska and
California, reinforces the major concepts learned and allows for a better
understanding of the Earth as a dynamic system. Using an inquiry-based approach,
the field and research experiences focus on geologic processes, evidence for
tectonics, and paleontology. Following the field experiences, teachers work with
one another and their mentors throughout the school year to incorporate what
they have learned into their classrooms, develop a rigorous course of study in
the geosciences for the district, and expand the project to reach a total of 60
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
