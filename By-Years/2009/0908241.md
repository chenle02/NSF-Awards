Dr. Sheth will extend his work on the statistics of dark matter halos, to
address halos that form in surroundings that are described by an ellipsoidal,
rather than a spherical, perturbation of the dark-matter density. The research
will be largely analytic, checked by comparison with cosmological N-body
simulations. In ellipsoidal collapse, three numbers determine the fate of each
halo: the local overdensity of dark matter, and two quantities related to the
ellipticity and prolateness of the surrounding distribution of mass. Thus the
abundance and the formation history of dark halos depend on the surrounding
large-scale structure: the halo population in filaments of the cosmic web should
be different from that in sheets and voids. Dr Sheth will calculate how
ellipsoidal collapse should affect the relation between 2-point, 3-point and
higher-order clustering statistics. The next generation of galaxy surveys will
measure these quantities to within a few percent. This work is essential for
interpreting those measurements accurately, to estimate the level of
fluctuations in the dark-matter density and determine how its distribution
differs from that of the luminous galaxies.

A graduate student will be trained by participating in this research. Models of
the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos are required to interpret
measures of galaxy clustering and the baryon acoustic oscillation signal, and
hence constrain the equation of state for the dark energy.
