This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), Jacob W.
Petrich from the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University will acquire a
cyber-enabled accurate-mass liquid chromatography, quadrupole (LCMS/MS) mass
spectrometer for the Department's Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. This
spectrometer possesses a solution-based sample introduction, quadrupole/ion trap
precursor selection, and a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. This instrument
will accommodate several forms of atmospheric pressure ionization (API) and two
ionization methods: electrospray (ESI) and chemical ionization (APCI). The
spectrometer will support the efforts of a diverse group of faculty and
scientists involved in fundamental research to developing solutions to complex
chemical problems varying from biological chemistry to catalytic processes to
improve processing of soy bean oil to production of new materials to capture the
energy of sunlight and light emitting diodes. Students from research groups of
professors Larock, Pohl, Kraus, Verkade, Jenks and Jeffries-EL will utilize the
instrument as well as other research groups from departments including
chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, agronomy, food science, botany,
geology and entomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LCMS/MS-TOF-mass spectrometry is an
important technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on very large
molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a LCMS/MS-TOF mass
spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique, especially in studies
involving biomolecules. This research will have a significant impact in a number
of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research.
