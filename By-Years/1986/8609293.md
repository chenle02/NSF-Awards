This effort will attempt to develop mathematical models to describe the kinetics
in bioreactors in which the nutrient media comprises mixed substrates. Previous
studies have shown that certain substrate-mixtures lead to a sequential
utilization of substrates in some order of preference, while others provide for
joint (or simultaneous) utilization. In sequential utilization, the preferred
substrate is the one which supports the highest growth rate. When this nutrient
is exhausted, there follows a period of new growth during which a new set of
enzymes needed for the utilization of the second nutrient is produced. This is
followed by growth on the second nutrient. In simultaneous utilization the
growth rate is some intermediate value between the slowest and fastest possible
for the individual nutrient. The mathematical models will establish an
optimality condition to describe these phenomena and these models will be tested
using mixed substrates in batch and continuous systems.
