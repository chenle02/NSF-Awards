Despite the ease of deployment and prevalence of WiFi (a.k.a., 802.11) devices,
the resource-constraint Internet of Things (IoT) devices used in residential and
campus environments struggle to meet the necessary energy efficiency and
communication delay requirements to address applicationsâ€™ demands. In addition,
although the high data rates offered by WiFi can satisfy the communication rate
requirements of mission-critical applications such as industrial automation, the
complexity and unpredictability of the WiFi stack make new applications
development an impractical undertaking. The proposed research investigates and
develops new methodologies, algorithms, and software frameworks to facilitate
the development of new classes of WiFi-based applications and
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research targets two broad classes of
applications: (i) non-mission-critical systems where regular user devices (e.g.,
smartphones, laptops) and IoT devices (e.g., cameras, thermostats, smoke
detectors) coexist, and (ii) mission-critical systems where deterministic end-
to-end delays&lt;br/&gt;between devices and controllers (i.e., control loop)
must be enforced. Towards facilitating innovation in the realm of WiFi
communication and investigating the operation of these networks, this research
proposes a software framework for scalable and programmable monitoring of
the&lt;br/&gt;WiFi stack. In addition, a reference testbed design and traffic
characterization and generation methods are developed to build testbeds that
represent real-world deployment scenarios. For non-mission-critical systems, new
methods will be developed to enhance IoT devices' energy&lt;br/&gt;efficiency
and communication timeliness in environments exhibiting dynamic traffic
patterns. Specifically, this research introduces packet delivery delay
prediction as a novel approach to develop methods for improving devices'
communication delay and energy efficiency. Third, for mission-critical
applications such as industrial automation, this research will develop a
framework that integrates a user-space implementation of WiFi stack and provides
programming primitives to facilitate the development of deterministic
communication scheduling algorithms. Using this framework, scheduling algorithms
will be developed to enforce end-to-end communication delay guarantees in
dynamic environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
