Through this project, the faculty in the Mathematics and Computer Science
Department of Essex Community College are improving the quality of the
developmental mathematics program through new teaching methodologies. In
particular, faculty developed software is being utilized to provide explanation
and tutorials in an interactive learning environment. Materials produced for the
developmental curriculum will be available to the Essex Community College Web
Page. Through this project, the department will be able to offer students a true
multi-media approach to developmental mathematics and a rich selection of
teaching alternatives.
