The South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (SCAMP) is comprised of
two major research universities (the University of South Carolina and Clemson
University), four historically Black colleges (Benedict College, South Carolina
State College, Voorhees College and Claflin College), one large community
college (midlands Technical College), and an array of industrial partners. SCAMP
will put in place programs at the undergraduate and graduate level to
substantially increase the number of Blacks entering research careers in
science, engineering, and mathematics. Minority undergraduates at the allied
institutions will have available to them full and partial scholarships,
intensive transitional mathematics worships prior to college, innovative and
intensive educational programs, and interconnected mentoring network,
opportunities for summer and academic year research, and possibilities for
experience in local industry. Minority graduate students at the allied
institutions will work in highly competitive research programs, develop industry
mentors and associated, and have the opportunity to be role models and mentors
for undergraduates. The progress and impact of these programs will be
systematically and professionally evaluated on a statistical basis throughout
the course of the project. The evaluations will be used to assess and improve
the effectiveness of the various project components. The findings of the
evaluation process and descriptions of innovative programs developed by the
project will be published in appropriate journals for national and international
dissemination and will comprise a Special Monograph Series published by the
National Center for the Freshman Year Experience.
