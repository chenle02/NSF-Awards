This award provides funding for the final analysis of data collected under NSF
Grant CES-8308744 and its amendments. Under this grant, over 1700 interviews
were conducted with samples of households in comparable cities in six countries
including U.S.A.-California, Peru, Mexico, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Turkey, for
purposes of developing and testing a cross-culturally valid method for measuring
disaster impact on household living conditions. Data on the cost of housing and
household equipment and furnishings was also collected along with detailed
inventories of community infrastructure. This work was extended to conduct data
collection in Mexico City after the 1985 earthquake to test the methods of
assessing damage under real disaster conditions. A monograph will be published
which will present the measurement technique in a manner that it can be employed
by other scholars wishing to measure household level damage and loss or to
measure progress toward the restoration of household level living conditions
following a disaster.
