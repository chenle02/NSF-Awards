A research program is proposed aimed at developing and evaluating arrays of
superconducting devices (tunnel junctions and microbridges) for use in mm/sub-
mm-wave rf applications. Materials, fabrication, and the electrical and thermal
aspects of array design will be considered. The arrays will be imbedded in rf
packages suitable for device test and/or inclusion in larger systems.
