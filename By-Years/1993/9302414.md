Scott H. Elder has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Elder's doctoral dcegree was from Cornell University under the supervision
of Professor Frank DiSalvo. Dr. Elder will continue his research at the
University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor Neil
Bartlett. Dr. Elder's postdoctoral training will provide him with skills in
preparing solid state fluorides including handling and manipulation of HF and
elemental fluorine as well as advanced characterization methods. Longer term, he
plans to develop new synthetic strategies for preparing new solid state
nitridofluorides and sulfidofluorides. These little-studied compounds are
expected to show a high degree of covalency and tunable electronic and magnetic
properties. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
