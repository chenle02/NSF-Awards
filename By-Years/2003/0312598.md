ABSTRACT CCR-0312598 PI: Mitchell Wand Northeastern University

Modern software systems depend on the interaction of a large number of
components. For such systems to function reliably, this complexity must be
controlled. Traditional system-composition methods, such as modules and
layering, have turned out to be brittle when confronted with the need for
adaptation to new contexts. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a promising
recent technology for allowing adaptation of program units across module
boundaries. However, AOP as currently practiced sacrifices many of the benefits
of traditional module systems. The goal of this research is to develop a new
language constructs for AOP that will retain the benefits of traditional module
composition. A second goal is to extend program analysis, a well-known set of
techniques for understanding programs in the small, to help understand the
interaction of components in AOP systems. Such analysis techniques also have
implications for reliable scientific computing.
