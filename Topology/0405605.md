This project concerns the classification of geometric structures on manifolds,
the geometry of their moduli spaces, and dynamical systems on moduli spaces
arising from automorphisms of surfaces. For example, complete affine 3-manifolds
behave similarly to hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. For a large class of examples,
the deformation space has recently been shown to be a bundle of convex cones
over the deformation space of hyperbolic surfaces. One aspect of the project is
the classification and dynamical study of such manifolds, and their conformal
and constant curvature generalizations. Another aspect of this project deals
with dynamical systems arising from the classification of geometric structures
on surfaces. The action of the mapping class group on the character variety is a
dynamical system associated to the fundamental group of the surface and the
geometry associated to a Lie group. These moduli spaces support invariant
symplectic structures, as well as finer structures depending on a Riemann
surface with the given fundamental group. How do these structures change as the
Riemann surface varies? How do the geometry of these structures influence the
dynamics of their topological symmetries of the surface? How does dynamical
complexity of the mapping class group action accompany topological complexity of
the moduli space?

These questions lie at the interface between geometry and topology, unified
through the notion of symmetry. While geometry involves metric quantitative
relationships, topology concerns the loose qualitative organization of
``points'' in abstract ``spaces.'' Geometry relates to topology through their
respective symmetries, which can be studied algebraically through the techniques
of group theory. These questions are natural for experimental investigation. The
Experimental Geometry Lab at the University of Maryland provides interested
students opportunities for mathematical experimentation in a stimulating
environment. Its goal is the dissemination and promotion of mathematics, related
to the projects described above. The Lab will continue to be a center for
Undergraduate Research Experiences, outreach presentations, and interactive
projects at all levels.
