The proposed research at the State University of New York at Stony Brook aims to
provide new understanding of the underlying causes for the symmetry breaking in
the fundamental interactions of nature. The electromagnetic and weak
interactions, though unified in phenomena at high energies and in the first
moments after the Big Bang, appear at lower energies to be quite distinct. The
Standard Model of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter builds in
this symmetry breaking through the Higgs boson. One strand of the proposed
research is the search for the Higgs boson. Another strand of the proposed
studies seeks evidence for phenomena that will show how the Standard Model is
modified, and help illuminate the more comprehensive theory. These aspects of
symmetry breaking will be explored through work in the D0 (at Fermilab) and
ATLAS (at CERN) experiments. The proposal also outlines a new participation in
the KOPIO experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, aimed at the measurement
of a rare neutral kaon decay (to a neutral pion, neutrino and anti-neutrino).
This would not occur unless there were a lack of symmetry between our world and
one in which particles are replaced by antiparticles and viewed in a mirror (CP
symmetry). The observation of a deviation from the value predicted by the
Standard Model will signal that new non-standard mechanisms are at play in CP-
violation, and should aid in understanding the origin of the asymmetry between
matter and antimatter in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is
constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms
is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists
alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students
and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the
fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and
tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously
educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal
includes elements of outreach to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;
