This project seeks to assess student competency and growth in response to
exposure and instruction in a number of content and skill areas. The content and
skill areas selected for study are those building blocks upon which advanced
concepts depend for their complete understanding. These building blocks tend to
be thematic elements in engineering education and form trajectories through a
given curriculum. This project measures student competency in a specific skill
area using pre-instruction and post-instruction assessments each time a student
encounters the skill as they progress through two years of an undergraduate
engineering curriculum. This longitudinal study is also designed to identify the
strategies students use outside of traditional instruction to develop competency
in key areas. The data are also being analyzed to determine common failure modes
and misconceptions which in turn can be used to improve instructional content
and delivery and to design specific interventions to improve student competency.
The rubrics and methodologies used throughout this project are being freely
disseminated to interested engineering schools.
