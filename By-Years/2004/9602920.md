9602920 Rafelski This U.S.-Brazil Planning Visit will bring together Dr. Johann
Rafelski of the University of Arizona and Professor Takeshi Kodama at the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro to prepare a research project on the
properties of matter at extreme density and temperature, as formed in
relativistic heavy ion collisions, and to develop the required kinetic theory
methods. This project would consist of two components: the development of the
theoretical tools and techniques, and their application to the dynamical
physical systems. The combined efforts of these researchers will lead to
considerable progress in a number of important physical problems. ***
