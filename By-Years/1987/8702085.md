Regulation of Glucose Transport in Yeast: Glucose and galactose transport in
yeast cells is regulated by addition of phosphate to the sugars catalyzed by
sugar kinases. In cells containing active kinases, the sugars are transported by
a high affinity process, which may couple transport and phosphorylation. In the
absence of ATP or in mutants deficient in the sugar kinases the sugars are
transported by a low affinity, facilitated diffusion process. To understand the
mechansims of sugar transport and the basis of its regulation, the sugar
carriers are being isolated from yeast cell membranes and reconstituted in
artificial proteoliposomes. Three approaches are being used to isolate and
purify the carriers: (l) fractionation of membrane extracts, (2) the use of
affinity labels, and (3) gene cloning techniques. Most cells can regulate the
rate of glucose metabolism by controlling the rate of sugar transport, however,
the mechanism of glucose transport is not fully understood much less the
mechanism of its regulation. Yeasts are convenient cells in which to study the
process of sugar transport and its regulation. They have a high rate of glucose
metabolsim and they can be manipulated genetically. The study of sugar transport
with the purified carrieres from yeasts should contribute to an understanding of
this important process.
