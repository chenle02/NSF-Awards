This award supports research in field theory and commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will study the relationship between the multiplicative
structure of field extensions which are Galois and certain associated groups and
invariants. He will also work on a scheme for computing Picard groups of affine
rings over fields that are not necessarily algebraically closed. The
computations are heavily influenced by the multiplicative structure of the
finite extensions of the base field. A ring is an algebraic object having both
an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Every element a in the ring has
an additive inverse usually denoted -a. However, elements are not required to
have multiplicative inverses. A ring in which every nonzero element has a
multiplicative inverse is called a field. This project concerns the relationship
between the multiplicative structure of a field and that of its subfields. It
involves a combination of techniques from field theory, group theory and number
theory.
