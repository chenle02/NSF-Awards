A uniquely collaborative, inquiry-based course in introductory statistics is
developed to serve 100 students per semester across both divisional and
departmental boundaries. The curriculum combines new learning materials and
innovative teaching strategies to pursue a multidisciplinary model of
statistical inquiry, providing training in flexible application of knowledge,
opportunities to analyze data in real world contexts, and education about
statistical concepts through computing. A comprehensive resource infrastructure
is established to provide intense multilevel support to students, allowing them
to work independently and creatively to explore their own scientific questions
and make decisions about data analysis. The resources that students utilize will
be dictated by their research question and results at each stage of their work.
That is, beyond basic data management and hypothesis testing themes, students
are learning most about what they need to know to answer their specific research
questions by doing the work themselves. The course represents 50% of the
student's semester curriculum, permitting full immersion in the process.
Substantial recruitment efforts are focused on engaging women and
underrepresented students during their freshman year, so that their experience
can maximally impact the direction of their undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education.
The broader impact is to provide more quantitatively literate individuals, and a
larger, more gender and ethnically-balanced population with the kind of skills
needed to communicate quantitative information across disciplines. Finally, a
strategy is developed to disseminate the course model and to make the newly
developed teaching tools and supportive resources widely available to other
universities.
