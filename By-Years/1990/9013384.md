This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. Professor David Laude will study the means to
manipulate the packet of ions which cycle in ion cyclotron resonance. Dynamic
trapping techniques will be used to control the kinetic energy distributions of
ions within the cyclotron cell. This leads to improvement of resolution and high
mass detection in Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS). Further work with
the improved detection system will focus on design and construction of a fiber
optic interface for laser desorption FTMS. Suspended trapping techniques will be
used to control the concentration of neutral species within the cyclotron cell.
This research will have impact on the coupling of chromatographic streams to the
FTMS enabling direct analysis of very complex mixtures.
