The print version of Foundation Science, a comprehensive high school science
curriculum, has been extensively field tested and shown to be effective in
increasing student learning and changing teacher practice. Carolina Biological
Supply is scheduled to publish a digital version of Biology and Chemistry
portions of Foundation Science that goes well beyond the conversion of print
text to digital delivery by September 2012. Many digital enhancements have been
developed and tested in the biology unit of Foundation Science, which was used
as a model to develop a system to incorporate Universal Design for learning
features in materials development and in on-line professional development for
cross-over teachers. Some of the digital resources include a digital book
reader; a notebook in which notes can take various forms such as text, drawing,
voice recording; separate unscored assessments; an interactive glossary;
graphing capabilities and an online research tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus
this project provides a model of how existing, tested digital enhancements can
increase student learning. Increasing the quality of science education requires
careful coupling of effective, research-based curricula with innovative digital
features that deepen and enhance science learning and teaching. This RAPID is to
ensure that the content and pedagogical expertise is present during the
development of the digital version of Foundation science.
