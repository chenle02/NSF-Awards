The principal objective of this exploratory research program is to develop a new
approach for the study of geologically important amorphous materials such as
glasses. The methodology involves a combination of high-pressure diamond anvil
techniques and site selective laser spectroscopy. The study will utilize
synthetic analogues of common silicates and aluminosilicates that are doped with
low concentrations of probe ions such as Cr3+ or Eu3+. The resultant data will
be used to elucidate the pressure-induced changes in the local coordination
environment of these ions and to study the structural mechanisms of high-
pressure amorphization. Results of the research may ultimately find application
in elucidating the chemical and physical behavior of silicate melts within the
Earth's interior.
