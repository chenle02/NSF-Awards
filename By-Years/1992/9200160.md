This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Wisconsin, Parkside to continue a successful Research Experiences
for Undergraduate SITE in southeast Wisconsin. Eight highly qualified
undergraduates will be recruited to conduct research, at the Biomedical Research
Institute laboratories on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in
Kenosha. Based upon extensive experiences with undergraduate research together
with active research programs, faculty representing the focus of Molecular and
Regulatory Biology will serve as potential project supervisors. This program is
deigned to develop each participant's intellectual confidence, technical
competence and research independence via: 1) guidance and daily nurturing by
active researchers in the areas of Molecular and Regulatory Biology, 2) a
program of specific goals for each student's research progress via a meeting and
seminar schedule plus instruction in literature search and seminar presentation
techniques complementary to each project, 3) leveraging of the NSF effort
through a commitment to support additional students each summer and/or to carry
over meritorious students for a second summer of research using internal
funding, 4) Aggressive regional and in some cases national recruitment of
superior candidates with special efforts to attract underrepresented groups plus
housing arrangements proximate to the UW-P laboratories, and 5) immediate and
long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU experience.
