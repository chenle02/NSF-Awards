9319373 Cooper The goal of this work is to understand how the connections
between nerve cells (call synapses) in the visual cortex of the brain change
during maturation from newborn to adult. Dr. Cooper has developed a theory that
during the critical period in development when the brain must receive visual
input to develop properly, it is a change in the neuronal circuits with the
brain that is critical for proper development rather than changes in the
properties of the synapses, as has been proposed by others. The experiments that
will be done by this team of investigators will test this theory by doing
experiments on neurons in in vitro brain slices from rat visual cortex at
different times during development and from rats raised in different visual
environments. If this theory is proven to be true, the work outlined in this
proposal will change significantly the way in which we view the developing
brain.
