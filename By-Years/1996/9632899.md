This project will help support a conference on the magnetization of the ocean
crust. In the past two decades there have been a number of developments that
have led to improved understanding of ocean crust magnetization; the acquisition
and analysis of near-bottom data, a much larger availability of upper crustal
rock samples from the ocean floor, and recent access to lower crustal samples
from drill holes, fracture zones, and ophiolites. The last conference that
specifically addressed this issue was held in 1978.
