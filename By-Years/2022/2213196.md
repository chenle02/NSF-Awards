The study of quantum systems is fundamental in modern mathematical physics. This
project aims to study the long-time behavior of quantum systems by building new
bridges between direct and inverse approaches. The direct approach asks one to
describe the attributes of a given system, while the inverse approach asks what
systems may exhibit specified attributes. The project plans to support education
and diversity though a summer school in mathematical physics, the supervision of
undergraduate research, and the writing and publication of a graduate textbook
on ergodic Schrödinger operators aimed at introducing graduate students to this
field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the spectral analysis of
Schrödinger, Jacobi, and Dirac operators with coefficients obtained by
continuously sampling along the orbits of an ergodic topological dynamical
system. This framework includes many models of interest, such as crystals,
quasicrystals, and disordered media. The project will study open questions
related to the quantum evolution for such models as well as the structure of the
spectrum for pseudo-random models, periodic operators on graphs, and aperiodic
tilings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
