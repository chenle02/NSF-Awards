This project will establish a campus microcomputer network for students and
teachers to access computing resources and software at Stetson University. The
network will be linked with national networks. A modern teaching environment
adapting the latest software for students and teachers will be established to
explore ways of learning and applying mathematics. The curriculum of calculus,
linear algebra, differential equations, and chaotic dynamical systems will be
enhanced by this network. There will be an internal and external evaluation of
the effectiveness of the network and curriculum impact. The grantee is providing
an equal sum for the equipment obtained from non-Federal sources.
