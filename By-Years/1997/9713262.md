Abstract - Economou ECS - 9713262 This is a combined theoretical/experimental
investigation of ion-ion (virtually election-free) plasmas in inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) sources. Topics addressed include the formation and
spatiotemporal dynamics of ion-ion plasmas in pulsed discharges at very low
pressures, the mechanism of negative ion extraction and acceleration under the
influence of an externally applied bias, and etching by ion-ion plasmas,
especially the contribution of negative ions. Both fluid and kinetic models are
developed in a hierarchial manner from analytic to full-scale two-dimensional
numerical models. Experimentally, the temporal evolution of negative ions,
positive ions, and electrons in pulsed chlorine ICP discharges is measured for
pressures in the 1 to 20 millitorr range. The flux and energy distribution of
negative and positive ions, and the etching induced by each, are also measured.
Ion-ion plasmas are formed in the late afterglow of pulsed discharges in
electronegative gases. Such systems are known to produce superior quality
etching when used in microelectronic device manufacture. This study provides
fundamental insight into this potentially valuable but poorly understood system.
