This research project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
designed to provide deeper understanding of how certain key organic compounds
are synthesized in plants. Cell-free systems containing specific enzymes will be
obtained from various parts of alkaloid-producing plants. The ability of these
cell-free extracts to catalyze the transformation of known or suspected
intermediates in the biosynthesis of the ultimate alkaloids will be examined. In
general, the enzymes will be assayed by the use of specifically labeled (carbon,
tritium, and deuterium) substrates, the use of which will facilitate
identification of products and transient intermediates. Some transformations
which will be studied (with the potential source of the enzymes indicated in
parenthesis) are the following: (1) the demethylation of nicotine (Nicotinia
glutinosa leaves); (2) cocaine biosynthesis (Erythroxylon coca leaves); (3)
phenylalanine conversion to (s)-tropic acid (Danutura innoxia roots); (4)
tropinone conversion to tropine (Datura innoxia roots); (5) octanoic acid
conversion to 5-oxo-octanoic acid (Conium maculatum leaves); and (6) o-succinyl
benzoic acid conversion to shihunine (Dendrobium pierardii stems and leaves).
