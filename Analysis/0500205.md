ABSTRACT

Quantum unique ergodicity and rigidity in dynamical systems

The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems and several
other mathematical disciplines, and in particular number theory and the theory
of automorphic form. It is well known that the collections of invariant
probability measures and closed invariant sets for hyperbolic maps or flows is
very large; remarkably, in many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where
there are two (or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is conjectured
that there are actually very few measures or closed sets invariant under this
bigger action. Substantial progress has been made in the study of such systems,
which has yielded a proof of arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity of compact
arithmetic surfaces, and has given a partial result towards Littlewood's
Conjecture in diophantine approximation. The author proposes to build on his
research on the various facets of this problem to further our understanding of
this rigidity phenomenon, as well as to apply these techniques and methods and
the methods developed by other authors towards potential applications in number
theory and other subjects.

In dynamical systems we study evolution of a mathematical system. Ergodic
theory is a specific flavor of the theory of dynamical systems. The tools of
ergodic theory applied to concrete algebraically defined dynamical systems can
be used to prove theorems and conjectures in other seemingly unrelated fields,
notably number theory. In our previous work we have shown how these tools can
also be used effectively to study problems motivated by quantum mechanics,
specifically the arithmetic case of the Quantum Unique Ergodicity Conjecture.
The connections that have been found between these special dynamical systems and
problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and automorphic forms (the
study of the spectrum of certain fundamental arithmetic manifolds) suggests that
this interdisciplinary approach is likely to have additional applications. In
addition to the research itself, substantial effort will be given to human
resources development, particularly at the graduate level.
