&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to do an analysis for stable isotopes in human
remains from the eastern Canadian Arctic, in addition to AMS radiocarbon dating
on additional sites from the region. The main objective of the research is to
identify the major species making up the Classic Thule v Modified Thule diet in
an attempt to shed light on the debate over the role whaling played in the
economic, dietary and cultural lives of these groups. In addition questions
concerning the Sadlermiut skeletal collection will be researched in an attempt
to answer long-standing questions concerning their cultural
affiliations.&lt;br/&gt;
