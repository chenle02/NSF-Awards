Chern 9504915 A number of projects in the general area of classical and global
differential geometry are proposed. In particular, the proposer wants to
continue his work in complex projective geometry and Finsler geometry. The
project on complex projective geometry emphasizes the holomorphic aspect rather
than the more fashionable Kahler aspect; the project on Finsler geometry is in
part motivated by Hilbert's 23rd problem. Finsler geometry could become more
important as several new applications have been found, for example in control
theory. Chern has an impressive track record of reviving old ideas with new
applications. Chern's transgression formulae for the Chern-simons characteristic
classes have recently found applications in physics. Also, proposed research on
geometric transformations relates to soliton theory which is a mathematical
theory of solitary waves.
