9521493 McCord The purpose of this project is to prove the worth of presently-
classified satellite-sensing data bases for research on volcanoes, with the
ultimate goal of getting them declassified so they will be available to all
scientists who could use them. Th. PI will work with the classified material on
Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, which is well studied already, and see how it compares
with the known work. After the material is declassified, his results will be
published, and the volcanological community will be able to determine how useful
the entire data base might be.
