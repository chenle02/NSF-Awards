This SGER builds off previous NSF-funded work in developing new algorithms for
graphics processors (GPUs) in areas such as ray tracing, matrix multiplication,
radiosity and radiative heat transfer, subsurface scattering, radiance transfer,
clustering, scene graph processing, and dynamic adaptive surface sampling.
Advances in these areas allow the PI to propose focused exploration in goal-
directed parameterization and investigate optimization methods for mapping
meshed surfaces to a planar domain based on new metrics. Specifically, work is
proposed to extend the current support for dynamic multiresolution meshed atlas
to include capability to deal with moving surface domains in an interactive
model context with no loss of detail. That work is balanced with the
aforementioned work in developing application-driven metrics.
