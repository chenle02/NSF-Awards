9523124 Donat This study will examine the influence of various inputs on the
complexation and speciation of copper and iron, and the concentrations and
complexation constants of their complexing ligands in the western Atlantic. The
work will also determine the vertical and horizontal distribution of dissolved
platinum in these waters, to help elucidate its "true" distribution. This
research is performed on the third Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
(IOC) Baseline Expedition for Trace Metals and Organic Contaminants in the
western South and equatorial Atlantic, for 1996. The cruise track provides
opportunities to collect samples from a detailed surface water transect across
the western boundary currents in the South Atlantic, the Amazon plume (high
levels of suspended sediment, terrestrial organic ligands, and colloidal
matter), the ITCZ (high wet deposition of Saharan dust), and the equatorial
Atlantic upwelling zone (low levels of organic ligands?). The study is
consistent uith the goal of the IOC expeditions which is to characterize the
major water masses of the world's oceans for as many contaminants as possible to
allow future changes in anthropogenic activities to be identified.
