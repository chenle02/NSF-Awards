This is a 12 month award for research coordinated with a project at the
Pennsylvania State University, Erie, under the direction of Jeffrey Pinto (see
Award IRI-9630634). The aim of this research is to begin to formally identify
and verify factors and processes influencing government agencies' sharing of
geographic information across organizational boundaries, both with other
departments within the organization, and between organizations. The project
particularly focuses on the behavioral and organizational factors that can
facilitate or inhibit the free flow of geographic information. A further goal is
to model the decision process by which key actors and decisionmakers determine
whether they will or will not share such information, and to describe the
practice of sharing. This work is a substantial step toward a realistic and
useful model of the information sharing process of agencies that would benefit
from free information exchange but to-date have been loathe to make their data
available to other parties.
