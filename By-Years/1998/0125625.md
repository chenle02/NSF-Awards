&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronology of the Late Pleistocene
Yellowstone Ice Cap&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;Joseph M. Licciardi and Mark D.
Kurz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An understanding of climatic linkages
between western North America and the North Atlantic region is essential for
identifying causes of abrupt climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere
during the last glacial period (over the past ~21,000 years). Advances and
retreats of alpine glaciers are sensitive indicators of changes in Ice Age
climate. The former Yellowstone Ice Cap was the largest alpine glacier system in
the western U.S., and the deposits it left behind preserve a valuable record of
past climates in western North America. In prior research, we successfully
established a high-resolution chronology of fluctuations of the northern
Yellowstone outlet glacier. The initial investigation at Yellowstone, however,
was restricted to a single drainage, and therefore did not resolve many aspects
of the complex Yellowstone glacial history. Here we propose a further
investigation of this important climate signal and its origin. We will apply
isotopic dating techniques to glacial deposits in additional drainages within
the Yellowstone region. The new results will greatly enhance current knowledge
of the Yellowstone glacial history, and will provide an alpine glacial
chronology of unprecedented resolution in the western U.S. An improved
chronology of Yellowstone glaciation will enable a compelling and detailed
comparison with alpine glacier records elsewhere in the western U.S., and with
the timing of abrupt climate events in the North Atlantic region. Consequently,
the improved chronology will strengthen and refine climatic interpretations
derived from the glacial record, and will provide an important base of evidence
for further evaluating the origin of millennial-scale climate variability in the
Northern Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
