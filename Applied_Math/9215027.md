This project will study a class of semipositive elliptic operators and their
associated boundary value problems. The interesting case, where the nonlinearity
is negative at the origin, will be investigated and the existence and
bifurcation of the positive solutions will be analyzed. The results will further
our understanding of the properties of these solutions, as well as the global
nature of the set of solutions. Semipositive elliptic equations occur in the
modeling of a wide variety of real life phenomena such as predicting the rate of
growth or depletion of a population subject to predators, competition, or
harvesting. The main results will be applicable in areas ranging from density of
bacteria in an infected medium to expectation of the survivability of a company
subject to strong competition.
