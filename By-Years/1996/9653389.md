Electronic advancements of recent years have placed a challenge to
undergraduate chemistry faculty to incorporate the use of modern chemical
instrumentation into the undergraduate laboratories. To meet this challenge,
undergraduate faculty members need to understand better the use and capabilities
of modern instrumentation. This project addresses this need to update two-year
college faculty in the area of chemical instrumentation. This project is a
three-year effort which continues a successful Instrumentation Workshop
currently funded by NSF. We have made modifications to the content of some of
the workshops to respond to the changing needs of two-year college chemistry
faculty. The existing coalition consists of East Coast (Northern Virginia
Community College and George Mason University.), Midwest (Sinclair Community
College and the University of Dayton), and West Coast (Shoreline Community
College and Western Washington University). A one-week workshops will be offered
during the summer. Instruction will focus on undergraduate general and organic
chemistry, introduction to instrumental analysis and associate degree chemical
technology course applications. The goal of this project is to train a total of
72 chemistry faculty from two-year colleges across the United States on the
theory, techniques, and laboratory use of state-of-the-art chemical
instrumentation. Two-year college chemistry faculty will select instruction in
the following areas: Fourier-transform infrared, ultraviolet/visible diode
array, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopies, vapor phase and high performance
liquid chromatography, computerized data acquisition and treatment, multimedia
approaches to chemical education, and environmental chemistry.
