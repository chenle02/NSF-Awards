This proposal addresses the optimization of the movement of spatial closed
chain robotic systems formed by two or more robots holding the same object. The
proposed research is to generalize an already developed planar motion
optimization algorithm to spatial closed chains, and form an interactive system
for motion optimization and design of closed chain robotic systems. The work
proposes to develop three items including (1) the local path optimizer for
optimizing the motion of the closed chain along a given path using a linear
programming algorithm for time optimal control, (2) the feasible path generator
which generates the initial path between the start and goal configurations, and
(3) the motion optimization routine which varies the path to find the optimum.
These items will be packaged to enable the user to vary the start and goal
positions to study optima, and to vary the dynamic parameters of the robots and
workpiece as well. This work is of potential engineering importance in optimal
planing for multiple robot systems. Initially, the resulting algorithms will be
computationally intensive, but ultimately, they will be streamlined to make them
compatible with future robot design.
