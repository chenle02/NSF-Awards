This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the research collaboration
of Edward Green of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and
Eduardo Marcos of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The project aims to
explore the category of graded modules of a graded ring by studying the local
theory which the two researchers have introduced. The PIs will investigate two
specific problems. First, they will study finite dimensional algebras which are
locally of finite type (a notion they have defined for graded algebras). They
expect that these graded algebras should have the property that the number of
"gradable" components in the Auslander-Reiten quiver is finite. Second, they
will investigate the local structure of the category of graded Cohen-Macaulay
modules over a graded local commutative algebra by studying an equivalent
subcategory of the category of modules over a finite dimensional algebra. The US
side will contribute expertise in graded modules and finite dimensional
representation theory. The Brazilian side will contribute expertise in Cohen-
Macaulay modules. Through this collaboration, both sides will gain a better
understanding of representation theory, an important topic in mathematics.
