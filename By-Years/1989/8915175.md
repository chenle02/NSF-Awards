The appearance and interpretation of colors used on maps is a function not only
of how each color looks individually, but also of how each color is interpreted
with respect to the other colors that appear on the map. Cartographers and
cognitive scientists have developed a number of models to explain the processes
by which people perceive different sets of colors when displayed together on a
map, but those models have not been well integrated with one another. This
doctoral dissertation research project will perform two experiments that should
permit a more coherent integration of some of the prevalent models of color
appearance and perception. In the first experiment, subjects will be shown
different sets of colored polygons and asked to select which free-standing
polygons most closely replicate the colors of specific polygons. Measurement of
how closely colors selected by subjects match the actual colors of the specific
polygons will provide a means of calibrating and reconciling two extant models.
In the second experiment, the combined model refined in the first experiment
will be tested using different color schemes on actual maps, with subjects again
asked to determine which specified areas have similar colors. Although these
experiments will provide specific information regarding how viewers interpret
specific color combinations on maps, the project's primary value will be in
providing a realistic test of general behavioral models, thereby increasing
broadly based understandings of the ways in which color combinations affect
cartographic communication. This project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising graduate student to expand and refine her basic
research skills.
