This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled "NUE: Undergraduate Laboratory Experiences in Nanotechnology Devices
and Systems (U-LENS)", at Boston University (BU) under the direction of Dr. Anna
K. Swan, will develop and implement lab modules in two nanotechnology
undergraduate junior level courses ("Nanophotonics Devices Laboratory" and
Nanometer-Scale Processes in Living Systems") that will be part of the BU
College of Engineering new "Concentration in Nanotechnology" open to all
undergraduate students in the college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lab courses
will strengthen the experiential learning for engineering undergraduates in the
Concentration and also serve as a gateway into further research with faculty and
startup companies in nanotechnology areas. In addition, outreach to minority
students will take place via "Nanocamp" in the BU Upward Bound program, where
modified versions of the developed labs will be used for daylong experiments.
