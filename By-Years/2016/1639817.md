The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that
will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what
we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning
CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of
cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other
ways. The Annual Meeting of the Association for Educational Communications and
Technology provides a forum for interchange of ideas around designing
technological support for learning and training. This project supports an Early
Career Symposium at the conference which allows early career scholars to receive
mentoring from established cyberlearning researchers from both computer science
and learning research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports travel for
advanced graduate students and new faculty from U.S. universities to attend the
Early Career Symposium at the AECT 2016 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine
forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the
types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding
agencies and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the
Symposium is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that
technology can transform teaching and learning.
