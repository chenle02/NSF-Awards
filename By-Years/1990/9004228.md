Water column properties (temperature, salinity, nutrients) will be sampled
every 30 nautical miles along hydrographic line P14C in the southwest Pacific
(between New Zealand and Fiji) as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) hydrographic program in the Pacific ocean. The relative velocity profiles
calculated from the density profiles will be combined with other observation in
the region to obtain absolute velocities and mass transport.
