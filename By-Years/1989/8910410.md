This research is designed to develop and test a process model that explains and
predicts the maintenance of aggressive mother- son interactions. The
significance of examining the relations between attributions and aggressive
behavior is that coercive mother-child interactions place children, especially
boys, at risk for exhibiting antisocial behavior in other contexts, even into
adolescence and adulthood. The specific aims of this study are (1) to examine
the relations between mothers's and children's attributions and the coerciveness
of their interactions: (2) to chronicle stability and change in conflictual
mother-son interchanges and their social cognitions over one year in order to
(3) assess the extent to which attributional processes contribute toward
aggressiveness (coerciveness) and aggressive interactions contribute toward
mothers' and sons' attributions; and (4) assess whether there are particular
setting conditions (e.g., maternal depression, spousal/ex-spousal conflict,
economic stress) that increase the tendency of some mother-son dyads to make
negative attributions and engage in coercive interactions. Mother-son dyads from
married, separated, and divorced families will be studied prospectively. Two
assessments (each separated by one year) will be made of mothers' and their
sons' (7-9 years of age) attributions and coercive interactions. The subjects
will be divided into two cohorts of 100 families each. Cohort assessments are
staggered such that replication of findings in each wave can be accomplished
within 12 months. In addition, assessments will be made of personal-social and
socio-ecological setting conditions that may contribute toward some mother-son
dyads being particularly vulnerable to making negative attributions and engaging
in coercive interactions. This research will extend our understanding of the
relationship between social cognitions, coercive interactions, and ecological
circumstances.
