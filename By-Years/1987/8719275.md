Heat transfer augmentation techniques and devices can be used to optimize the
heat transfer efficiency in a wide range of applications. The objective of this
research program is to increase the heat transfer rate without significantly
altering the required pumping power in devices where convective boiling occurs.
This research will benefit heat exchanger designs in the refrigeration and power
generation areas. The particular research topic addressed in this work deals
with droplet flow augmentation by twisted tapes. This flow regime has poor heat
transfer characteristics compared to single-phase flows as well as other two-
phase flow regimes. Therefore, heat transfer enhancement can make important
contributions to this flow regime. This investigation will experimentally
determine the heat transfer in dispersed swirl flow with an existing facility. A
phenomenological correlation and comprehensive model will be developed for this
droplet flow regime.
