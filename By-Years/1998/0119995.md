Novel instrumentation will be developed to measure the fluxes of trace gases
between the atmosphere and the biosphere. The measurement systems, based on
disjunct eddy flux methods, will be applicable to both tower based and airborne
platforms. A complete airborne flux system will be maintained at Purdue
University and made available to the biosphere/atmosphere science community. The
technology will also be made available for duplication for different
applications. The Disjunct Eddy Sampler (DES) will be coupled with an Fourier-
Transform Infrared (FTIR) system capable of quantifying stable carbon isotope
ratios. These measurements provide a means to partition the net ecosystem
exchange of carbon dioxide into its gross components, photosynthetic uptake by
vegetation and respiratory emissions by plants and soils. The DES system will
also be employed to quantify fluxes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by
combining it with a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS).
Emphasis in this application will be in determining landscape scale fluxes. The
third application area will be to couple the DES with nitrogen detectors for
determination of deposition rates of atmospheric nitrogen containing species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of this instrumentation will provide
undergraduate and graduate research training opportunities. All team members are
participants in the NSF IGERT program at the University of Michigan Biological
Station and intend to involve IGERT students in this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientifically, the broader impact of this work
will be in the area of biosphere-atmosphere exchange which is an integral part
of all biogeochemical cycles. The determination of accurate transfer rates for
inorganic and organic species between terrestrial and atmospheric reservoirs is
a critically important need to enable reliable prediction of the future state of
global climate and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.
