A central goal of the National Consortium on Violence Research's (NCOVR)
capacity-building activities is to increase the number of new researchers
trained in cross-disciplinary violence research. The objective is that by
training young scholars, NCOVR can impact the field of violence research. NCOVR
has three strategies for attaining this goal. The first is to increase the
number of NCOVR fellowships that are awarded. The second is to establish
affiliations with selected minority-serving institutions to increase the pool of
underrepresented students introduced to violence research. The third is to
conduct special outreach to minority undergraduates to encourage their choice of
violence research as a career. NCOVR will increase the number and discipline
diversity of researchers participating in the NCOVR experience. They recruit
senior researchers from new disciplines and establish affiliations with other
extant research teams. They sponsor a number of intellectually compelling
substantive and methodological workshops each year designed to appeal to senior
researchers by promoting intellectual scientific exchange and research that cuts
across disciplines. Some workshops bring together diverse perspectives on
important research questions or address a difficult methodological question.
Others develop proposals for outside funding, using small grants for pilot
projects needed to strengthen the proposals. Some synthesize research findings
in areas where there are already extensive significant findings. The objective
of these workshops is to foster both new and expanded collaborations. These
collaborations may lead to the preparation of larger proposals for outside
funding that can provide opportunities for young researchers to participate in
multidisciplinary research.
