In this project a model of instrumental and normative incentives for
participation in collective political action will be evaluated in dynamic and
comparative perspective and tested against alternative explanations. The data
are from national samples and protest-prone community sub-samples in three
countries, Peru, Israel, and West Germany, that differ substantially in regard
to macro economic, social, and political conditions, as well as in regard to
aggregate levels of legal and illegal collective action. Two-wave panel surveys
are used to determine the structure of causality between attitudes and
behaviors. The researcher's approach to the explanation of collective political
action, defined broadly to encompass both legal and illegal behaviors by which
groups may exert influence on public policy, is innovative theoretically and
methodologically. The model that is being developed comprises two general
motivations for participation in collective political action: outcome-oriented
rational choice and adherence to norms of appropriate behavior; and it
distinguishes further between two sources of rational motivation, private
outcome incentives and collective outcome incentives, and between two sources of
normative motivation, personal moral norms and social norms. This `rationality-
norms' model is an alternative to grievance and relative deprivation
explanations, and it subsumes other more ad hoc social-psychological approaches.
The innovative methodological features of the approach are, first, a `maximum
difference' data collection design that affords powerful tests of the cross-
national generalizability of results across countries differing substantially in
economic, social, and political characteristics and enables the investigators to
bridge the micro and macro levels of analysis; second, a multi-sample design
within countries that permits a determination of the extent to which
relationships between attitudes and behaviors are conditioned by facilitative
social environments; and, third, a longitudinal data analysis design that takes
into account possibilities of reciprocal causation and allows for the estimation
of both lagged and simultaneous effects between variables.
