Abstract:

Some impact of topology on variational problems

In this project, we will focus on variational problems involving vector- valued
maps. In particular, we will study upper and lower bounds of the energy
functional for maps with suitable topological information, the weak sequential
approximation of Sobolev maps by smooth maps and the structure of singular sets
for solutions of some variational problems. Various tools from geometric measure
theory and differential and algebraic topology are used in handling these
issues. On the other hand, our approach to the problems sheds light on new
relations among these topics.

Variational problems involving vector-valued maps appear naturally in analysis,
geometry and physics. Besides their mathematical interests and importance, they
are crucial to various models in mathematical physics. Typical examples include
models for superconductivity, magnetic material and liquid crystals. The
research in this area will lead to better understanding of certain type of
physics phenomenon as well as new impetus in mathematics in this direction.
