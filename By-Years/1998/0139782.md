The process of gravitational collapse with an emphasis on strong field effects
and the threshold of black hole formation will be studied. This work will
examine the collapse of a variety of matter fields with axial symmetry. A
numerical code which has been developed and successfully tested for vacuum
gravitational collapse and scalar field collapse in axisymmetry will be extended
in new directions in order to consider additional fields and more extreme
scenarios. Included in these directions is the incorporation of adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) which will provide high resolution for large dynamic ranges. An
additional gravitational degree of freedom will be added as well as
electromagnetism. Work will continue on examining the head-on collision of black
holes and boson stars using black hole excision.&lt;br/&gt;This work will
advance understanding of strong field gravity and will provide new and important
dynamical results concerning black hole formation and evolution. In addition,
this work will aid in the ongoing development of a computational laboratory with
which to explore the gravitational processes and astrophysical objects in the
universe.
