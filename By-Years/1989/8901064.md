This investigation is a continuation of work on computations in the theory of
modular functions of one and several variables. The principal investigator's
recent work highlights several related areas in which the use of computers,
particularly, the use of computer algebra systems has provided both clues and
limitations to investigations in modular function theory. For modular functions
of one variable there is a renewal of explicit computations of modular equations
relating j (z) and j (nz). Computer algebra has been used to increase the range
of values of n for which the computations can be carried out explicitly. The
purpose of these computations is to study the singular moduli, where j (z) and j
(nz) are numerically equal. Likewise for Hilbert modular functions, it is now
possible to find modular equations. Here the singular moduli are more important,
since they provide a clue to the manner in which ring class field theory extends
beyond the rational base field. Indeed these modular equations determine a
manifold which has to be treated by its ideal. The application of resultants to
finding singular moduli is a practical computer algebra problem.
