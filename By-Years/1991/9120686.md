Microparasites have recently caused the collapse of populations of a dominant
insect competitor in coldwater streams in Michigan. This has provided a unique
natural experiment to examine the organization of entire stream communities. The
major objectives of this research are:1) to utilize this natural experiment as
well as manipulative experiments, to assess mechanisms by which this dominant
species affects the structure of trout stream food webs, 2) to determine the
extent to which communities dominated by this species represent stable community
configurations; and 3) to study the important processes regulating the
abundances of this dominant consumer. The PIs will monitor responses
(composition and abundances, biomass, and growth rates) of all trophic levels to
the treatments created by the natural experiment. A powerful feature of the
natural experiment is that essentially identical food web perturbations have
been experienced at a series of diverse sites, with a variety of environmental
characteristics (e.g., stream size, trophic structure, physical/chemical
attributes). Thus, the results should have considerable general applicability.
Manipulative experiments will be performed to:1) determine the pathways and
strengths by which interactions stemming from the dominant consumer affect the
remainder of the community; and 2) identify the processes regulating the
abundances of the dominant consumer. By utilizing this combination of
approaches, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanisms structuring coldwater stream communities and the stability of stream
communities. This study will be one of the first to document the role of
parasites in the population dynamics of lotic invertebrates.
