This project will examine the relationships between physical theories, using
both a very technical examination of the mathematics and a more philosophic
reflection on the implications of those mathematical relationships. The purpose
of this investiagtion is to reach new philosophic understandings about the
nature of physical theories and to develop new insights into relationships
between theories, such as reduction and explanation. To do this the PI will use
recent advances in the mathematics of asymptotic expansions to examine the
properties of functions that describe physical theories as a fundamental
parameter of the theory (say, Planck's constant) approaches a limiting value.
Since it is often the case that one physical theory represents the limiting case
of another--a kind of intertheoretic reduction--this examination will offer new
insights into the meaning of reductive relationships between theories. From all
this technical analysis the PI will then draw inferences about the nature of
theories and their relationship that have general utility in the philosophy of
science.
