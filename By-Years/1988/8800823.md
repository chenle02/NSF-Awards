The theory of analytic functions of a complex variable (those that are
expandable in power series, so roughly speaking the limits of complex
polynomials) has enriched all of mathematics for over a century. Such functions
enjoy many remarkable properties, for instance that their values at points
inside a closed curve are determined completely by their values on the curve. It
happens that such functions readily aggregate themselves into Hilbert spaces,
and the theory of operators on Hilbert space gains extra vividness when
specialized to these spaces of analytic functions. The investigators will study
specific classes of operators on the Hardy, Bergman, and Dirichlet function
spaces, as well as algebras of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc.
