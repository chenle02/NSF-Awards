This U.S.-Russia "Workshop on Time Reversal Invariance and Parity Violation in
Neutron Scattering" will send ten American researchers from TRIPLE (North
Carolina State University, Duke University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory)
to work with a group of Russian scientists led by Dr. Yuriy P. Popov at the
Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, Dubna. The workshop will focus on the study
of parity and time reversal symmetry violation in neutron physics. A prime
motivation for holding the workshop in Russia is that much of the early work in
the study of parity violation was carried out by scientists in Moscow, Dubna,
St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. Since 1987 much of the major work on symmetry
violation has been carried out by the TRIPLE collaboration working at the Los
Alamos Neutron Scattering Center. Half of the funds are to support attendance by
graduate students and research associates. This project in physics fulfills the
program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S.
and Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in the
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
