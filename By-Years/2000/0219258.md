This proposal will explore fundamental research issues that impact performance
and scalability of Wide Area Applications. The proposed research undertakes a
comprehensive study of the access latencies and changing behavior of digital
resources over time and across different applications, when accessed via the
dynamic WAN. One objective of this research is to develop appropriate latency
profiles and resource profiles to characterize this behavior. Latency profiles
will be developed to reflect the end-to-end delay experienced by a cluster of
clients and resources (servers). Resource profiles reflect appropriate metrics,
such as existence checking, testing reachability over time, and learning
patterns of updates. These profiles will be used to customize service and
information delivery to clients, considering both application requirements and
the noisy WAN environment. The corresponding algorithms will explore the trade-
offs between end-to-end latency and data obsolescence for different application
requirements. Research results will aim to establish a consistent framework for
profiling and to answer the following question: to what extent can profiling be
used in improving clients' availability to resources. Formal results developed
in the theoretical study will be evaluated on large scale applications.
