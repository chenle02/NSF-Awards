This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of Oklahoma. Her Ph.D.
research was in the area of systematics. She plans to carry out her postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Claude W. dePamphilis at Vanderbilt
University. Dr. dePamphilis was a former recipient of the NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Plant Biology. The proposed research entitled "Plastid
gene evolution along hemi/heloparasitic continuum" will expand the scientific
experience of this Fellow into molecular evolution and will explore the process
of plant adaptation.
