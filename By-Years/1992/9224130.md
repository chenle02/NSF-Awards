The general problems presented by terrestrial environments are carried to
extremes by subtropical deserts, which are notable for their high temperatures
and their capacity to desiccate organisms. Traditional views suggest that small
insectivorous birds encounter little difficulty in maintaining water balance
because of the high fractional hydration of their prey. There is remarkably
little direct evidence to support this view; water balance in small
insectivorous birds exposed to environmental conditions normally prevailing in
subtropical deserts is essentially unknown. Recent analyses, however, suggest
that even under cool conditions, small birds may show either a water deficit or
barely balance their water budgets over the daily cycle. This research focuses
on (a) the physiological and ecological bases of the suppression of vital
activities by a very small, diurnal bird, the Verdin, during the hottest
portions of the summer day in the Sonoran Desert, and (b) dissecting the
physiological foundation for occupancy of this most extreme terrestrial habitat
by developing a complete water budget for animals exposed to ecologically
realistic conditions. This project will examine Verdin daily activity patterns,
microclimate selection, avenues and rates of water intake and loss, field
metabolic rates, patterns of resource utilization and resource availability and
abundance.
