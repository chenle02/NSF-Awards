This research is radiation heat transfer in anistropically scattering, absorbing
and emitting media. The principles of heat transfer will be applied to develop
scaling laws to predict the radiative heat transfer in these media. The effects
of real gases and scattering particulates will be considered. Nongray effects
will be included by using the exponential wide band model. The gaseous mean beam
length concept will be applied for multidimensional scaling. Some of the
existing techniques for multidimensional radiation calculations will be tested
in this research.
