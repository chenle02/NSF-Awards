This project develops and tests a theory of relational cohesion that indicates
how and when power in negotiations affects the development of commitment among
parties to an exchange. It does so through three laboratory experiments, one on
each of three commitment behaviors: (1) staying in the relationship even if
better ones become available; (2) giving each other gifts that do not require
immediate reciprocity; (3) contributing to a joint fund with the other. Each
experiment will assign 80 same-sex dyads to one of four experimental conditions
in a standard two-party explicit bargaining setting. The theory and experimental
test will suggest how an exchange relationship having an instrumental foundation
becomes more expressive if exchanges are successfully negotiated over time. This
project will contribute to our understanding of the emergence of commitment in
human interactions, illuminating how people come to have positive emotions
toward each other quite beyond the satisfaction of self-interested needs. It
provides an important link between laboratory social psychology studies of
exchange and the sociology of emotions, a field that has grown substantially in
very recent years.
