Tomorrow's biologists need a firm foundation in the concepts, techniques, and
applications of molecular and cell biology, experience in the use of computers
and the Internet as research tools, and the problem-solving and communication
skills to function within research teams. For these skills to be developed, labs
require adequate equipment and computers to fully support investigations that
reflect real-world molecular biology studies. This project is designed to use a
project-based approach to teach applied molecular biology, build computer
literacy in DNA research, and develop students' problem-solving, teamwork, and
communications skills. Computing, cell culture, and molecular biology equipment
are being obtained for a capstone Molecular Biology and Biotechnology course and
its prerequisite courses in Cell Biology and Genetics. The Molecular Biology and
Biotechnology course challenges student teams to plan and conduct an integrated
project of molecular cloning, expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells, and purification of engineered proteins. Baculovirus-
infected insect cells provide experience in eukaryotic cell culture and protein
expression. Computers promote learning of molecular genetics in several courses
through virtual cloning and DNA sequence analysis software and provide on-line
access to World Wide Web biocomputing resources, e-mail, and newsgroups. The
funded equipment supports the creation of model baculovirus-based molecular
cloning, protein expression and purification investigations for undergraduates,
and DNA science teaching materials using computers and Internet resources.
Course materials and protocols can be published and described on-line in a set
of course Web pages.
