Six microcomputers equipped as laboratory controlling devices for a new student
laboratory facility in the Psychology Department are enhancing and facilitating
Skidmore College's instructional capabilities in at least three ways. First, the
kind of lab projects and simulations previously possible to conduct in the
experimental psychology lab were limited to those that minimized the use of
peripheral devices and that lasted for 20 minutes or less. Students received a
somewhat distorted view of the kinds of questions psychologists address, and, as
a consequence, a distorted view of the range of theoretical issues of concern to
psychologists. This new lab facility, therefore, is important for the enrichment
of this experimental laboratory course and other advanced courses (e.g.,
perception, cognition) as well. Over the past 5 years an increasing number of
students have engaged in independent research and senior theses. This facility
contributes in important ways to the development of their research efforts.
Finally, a large number of students will be able to participate in laboratory
simulations directly, rather than by indirectly observing another person conduct
the simulations. A modest amount of computing equipment with its attendant
instrumental interfacing will have a large impact upon the quality of laboratory
work available to upper division students in numerous classes and in independent
study.
