9414256 Krogh The 11th International Conference on Analysis and Optimization of
Systems organized by INRIA will be the second specialized conference of the
series. This time, the specific field covered will be discrete event systems
(DES). It can be considered also s the second WODES/CODES conference (series of
Conferences on discrete event systems). This conference is aimed at engineers
and mathematicians working in the field of Automatic Control, Operations
Research and Statistics who are interested by the modeling, analysis and
optimization of discrete event systems. Many formalisms have been developed to
describe such systems. The comparison of the different mathematical approaches
and the global confrontation of the mathematical approaches with the
applications are the main goals of the conference. ***
