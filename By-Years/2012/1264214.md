This project builds on prior studies that were designed and conducted by
researchers to significantly reduce or remove key limitations to most current
cancer treatment processes. A crucial limitation has been that most current
therapies cannot effectively restrict drugs to tumor cells. The drug delivery
system designed through this work may accomplish a selective targeting and
delivery of anticancer drugs to solid tumors. This targeted delivery, achieved
via a thermally responsive, biopolymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) of a pre-
determined molecular weight, can facilitate drug aggregation in tumors exposed
to an externally applied, clinically utilized heat source. The proposed
biopolymer carrier can exploit the passive targeting properties of
macromolecular carriers and the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect,
along with active targeting properties that make use of heat at the tumor site.
Through this cell penetrating peptide?s mediation, an efficient, intracellular
delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumor can be achieved. Researchers have
applied this approach in the lab within several experimental cancer models to
confirm its potential for clinical use as a human therapeutic.

Cancer, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, has been difficult
to treat through therapies targeted at specific tumor sites. A tremendous need
exist for therapeutic approaches that both increase treatment specificity and
efficacy within tumors and reduce cytotoxicity in healthy tissues. This proposed
tumor-targeting drug delivery system uses a biopolymer ELP in tandem with
hyperthermia techniques to augment standard-of-care by selectively inducing
intra-tumoral accumulation of a broad range of anti-cancer therapeutics. This
treatment methodology may allow doctors to administer chemotherapeutics at doses
sufficient for tumor reduction without also harming healthy tissue, thereby
enormously impacting treatment success. Moreover, this therapy, although new, is
cost-effective: it can be readily integrated into systemic therapies and
harnesses hyperthermia and standard-of-care techniques already common in cancer
clinics. Successful completion of this project and its clinical translation may
lead to greater health and cost effectiveness in cancer treatment.
