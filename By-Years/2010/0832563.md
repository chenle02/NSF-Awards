0832563&lt;br/&gt;Gomez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning
visit to enable Professor Romel Gomez at the University of Maryland in College
Park, to meet with Professor Giselle Concepcion at the Marine Science Institute
of the University of the Philippines in Quezon City. The visit will help develop
a collaborative plan for nanotechnology biosensor applications. The researchers?
goal is to develop versatile label-free chemical sensing technologies for
biological and environmental monitoring. They plan to develop fast, accurate and
cost effective methods for detecting biologically and environmentally relevant
compounds. The sensors they plan to develop will be based on carbon-nanotube
field-effect transistors and similar nanostructures that are designed to detect
nucleic acids, peptides and other inorganic compounds. These sensors will be
optimized for studying marine species that are unique in the Philippines and
contain byproducts that have important pharmacological implications. Sensors
based on polymer and semiconducting nanowires will also be developed for
monitoring heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants in the environment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers have complementary scientific expertise in
the field. The Philippines is ideal for a collaboration of this type that brings
together groups that are culturally and technically diverse. Due to its location
and geography, this country is comprised of an archipelago of more than 7000
islands situated close to the equatorial belt. The Marine Science Institute is a
lead center in the Philippines and is equipped with world-class instrumentation
as well as very enthusiastic and highly skilled faculty and student populations.
It is anticipated that this project will provide unique training and educational
opportunities for two U.S. graduate students to obtain a global research
experience. These early collaborations between the scientists and students from
each country will likely lead to long-term collaborations that will benefit both
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
