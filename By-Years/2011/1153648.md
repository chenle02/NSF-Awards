The objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to improve physical understanding of Graphene - the thinnest possible
sheet of just atomic thickness. In addition to its remarkable mechanical
strength, Graphene has tantalizing electronic, magnetic, and optical properties
which could lead to a host of applications ranging from nanoelectronics, highly
sensitive sensors, strong materials and energy storage devices among others. One
property missing from Graphene is the so-called "piezoelectricity," which allows
a voltage to be developed when a material is mechanically deformed and vice-
versa. Thus the specific research objective of this investigation is to
elucidate "if" and "how" Graphene can be endowed with piezoelectricity (even
though it may not be expected to exhibit such behavior ...). Advanced quantum
mechanical calculations and state-of-the-art fabrication and testing techniques
will be employed to realize such goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project puts
forth a high-risk high-payoff concept and, if successful, will establish a new
paradigm in creating multifunctional materials and the use of Graphene as the
thinnest material capable of a variety of functions - sensing and actuation,
among others. Piezoelectricity is important in a host of applications where both
sensing and actuation are needed - piezoelectric Graphene, for example, could be
used to create artificial muscles. Other potential applications range from
biomedical to space. Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project
will develop a strong foundation in the highly multidisciplinary areas of
nanotechnology, computational materials science and mechanics. Plans are in
place to reach out to school-children through the concept of "Science behind
Harry Potter."
