Randomness is useful in many areas of computer science, including algorithms,
Monte Carlo simulations, cryptography, and distributed computing. In practice,
however, it is expensive or impossible to get truly random numbers. Therefore,
computers rely on pseudorandom generators. However, scientists have reported
problems with practical pseudorandom generators. Can we construct pseudorandom
generators that are provably good? The PI proposes to address this question and
the related question of how to extract high-quality randomness from low-quality
random sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions have unexpected connections
to error-correcting codes and distributed computing, which the PI proposes to
explore further. He also proposes to attack fundamental questions in these
areas. In coding theory, these questions relate to his recent results on
decoding the important Reed-Muller codes. In distributed computing, he proposes
to advance his work on network extractor protocols. These are protocols to
extract high-quality randomness from low-quality random sources in a distributed
setting. Such protocols could be very useful in cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;
