Instrumentation: Integrated Video Encoding and Networking This research
instrumentation grant contributes to enable the following research projects: -
Multiple Description Coding and Multiple Path Transport for Video Communication
over Unreliable Networks, - Video Packet Transmissions with Renegotiated Service
Parameters, - Traffic Control and Admission Control for Video Networks, - Dense
Motion Field Estimation and Representation for Video Compression, and - Stereo
Sequence Compression. The next generation Internet must support many
applications with widely varying performance requirements. Among these, the
transmission of delay-sensitive compressed video traffic poses a unique
challenge. The main objective of this project is to show that the efficiency of
a video network can be improved by increasing the integration of video coding
and video networking. Solutions with practical impact can only be achieved if
the concepts are shown to be practically feasible in an actual testbed. The
requested instrumentation will be used to set up a Video Networking (VINE)
testbed. This testbed will enable collaborative research in robust video
encoding and transport, video-aware resource reservations, and traffic control
and admission control of video services. The requested video equipment will also
facilitate other video coding research.
