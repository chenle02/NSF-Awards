9704744 Rosinski Professor Jan Rosinski intends to investigate representations
of non-Gaussian infinitely divisible processes under a general framework of
stationarity with respect to groups of transformations. To accomplish this goal,
he proposes to develop new connections between the theory of stochastic
processes and ergodic theory, group representations, particularly those induced
in the sense of Mackey, and functional analysis. These general results can be
applied in the structural analysis of stationary, self-similar, and isotropic
infinitely divisible random fields. He also intends to continue research on
asymptotic independence of stochastic processes, sample path continuity, and
multiple stochastic integrals. Infinitely divisible random processes appear
naturally in many areas of theoretical and applied probability, communications,
networking, mathematical finance, and statistics. Roughly speaking, a process is
infinitely divisible if its behavior is determined by a large number of mutually
independent random factors. Stationarity is a notion describing statistical
symmetries of a random process. Stationary infinitely divisible processes, which
may exhibit high variability, are not well understood at present because the
traditional methodology of Gaussian processes is not applicable here. This
project is intended to develop tools and methods for analysis of infinitely
divisible processes which can be used in modeling of highly variable phenomena.
