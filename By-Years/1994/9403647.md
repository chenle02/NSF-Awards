9403647 Weller The LAII Science Management Office, located at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks, is part of the LAII-Flux Study, but is also involved in the
integration and coordination of the Flux Study within the broader aspects of
LAII, and indeed the entire Arctic System Science program of NSF. The SMO will
also establish connections to other international programs of global change
research in the Arctic. The SMO will facilitate project planning and integration
by providing active scientific leadership and coordination service to the LAII
projects, by holding science planning and synthesis meetings, providing
communications between PIs and ensuring linkages to related programs.
Specifically, long-term science plans for the Flux Study will be developed,
modeling and data management requirements will be specified in the context of
the overall ARCSS program, and logistics needs will be coordinated. The SMO will
be advised by an Executive Committee of four, including the director of the SMO,
and a Steering Committee of both external members and LAII PIs. The
establishment of the LAII Science Management Office is in response to a
recommendation from the NSF review panel for the LAII Flux Study. ***
