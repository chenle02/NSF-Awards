Theoretical research will be done on a wide range of topics in condensed matter
theory including quantum antiferromagnets with impurities, the properties of
flux line liquids, anyon theories of superconductivity, the physics of red blood
cells and polymerized membranes with disorder, the behavior of directed polymer
melts, electrons in strong magnetic fields, transport in disordered systems, and
spin glasses. %%%
