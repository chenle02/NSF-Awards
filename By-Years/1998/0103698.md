This project develops concepts, perspectives, and tools leading toward a
conceptually well-founded theory and methodology of nonparametric and robust
data analysis in arbitrary dimension. The general framework being developed
includes extensions of the traditional tools of one-dimensional analysis as well
as tools unique to the higher-dimensional context. A theory of "median oriented
quantile functions" having probabilistic interpretations similar to univariate
quantiles is being pursued. A central approach is based on statistical depth
functions. A major secondary objective is to bring the depth-based approach to a
definitive degree of completion. Topics receiving special focus include
multivariate quantile functions, depth functions, vector-valued L-statistics,
matrix-valued scale statistics, generalized quantile processes, and generalized
L-statistics. Linearization techniques via functional representations are used.
Overall, the project advances nonparametric and robust multivariate analysis
using quantile methods and addresses a range of specific
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the scope of application of multivariate
statistical modeling has widened, the treatment of multivariate probability
distributions and data has become increasingly important and central. A great
deal of univariate statistical analysis is carried out in terms of percentiles,
which lend themselves easily to interpretation. The use of percentiles has
become fundamental. This project extends such methodology to higher dimension,
to support a coherent and meaningful "percentiles" approach to the analysis and
interpretation of multivariate data. Users of multivariate statistics in diverse
fields of application thus acquire a tool that is of fundamental importance and
conceptually well understood.&lt;br/&gt;
