Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative research effort
between the University of Arizona (Drs. R. Emrick and J. Vuillemin) and Cairo
University (Dr. M. Mostafa) in Egypt. The objective of this research is to study
the magnetic properties of some novel magnetic insulators; these materials not
only have interesting magnetic properties, but also interesting electrical
properties. In addition to practical device applications, they can be used to
verify theoretical predictions for systems of lower dimensionality. The work
will be conducted in the laboratory facilities at the University of Arizona and
Dr. Mostafa will spend one year there. This project in materials research
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents
and conduct research in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
