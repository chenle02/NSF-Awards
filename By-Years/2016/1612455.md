The significance and importance of this project lies in developing a novel and
attractive form of a college-level introductory Computer Science course. The
course will integrate the traditional topics of a programming-based introductory
Computer Science course with a consideration of the law and public policy issues
surrounding online privacy and security. For example, a topic like 2-dimensional
arrays will be illustrated by building a map of murders in a city like Chicago
instead of the board of some computer game; and will be accompanied by
discussion of the pros and cons of a Police Department's use of such maps for
predictive policing together with the legal issues predictive policing
raises.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The specific education research goals of the
project are testing three claims. First, whether new introductory curricula,
with content drawn from a field (law) whose students are roughly 50 percent
female, can attract more women to major in Computer Science at a public
university. Second, whether the same practices aimed at increasing the
participation of women in computing might also increase the participation of
other underrepresented student groups. Third, whether an introductory Computer
Science course grounded in a subject of wide interest to much of the general
public (law, and especially online privacy and security law) will succeed in
drawing more non-CS majors into taking additional Computer Science courses.
