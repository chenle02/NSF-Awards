Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a novel family of diode
lasers based on single-crystal semiconductor nanomembranes, featuring several
potentially transformative attributes. Specifically, these devices, because of
their extreme structural flexibility, could be employed in environments that are
inaccessible to traditional rigid semiconductors. Their emission properties can
be controlled with externally applied mechanical stress, e.g., leading to
unprecedented wavelength tunability. Furthermore, the nanomembrane geometry may
even allow for laser oscillation in materials that are normally inadequate to
this purpose. In particular, this program is focused on the demonstration of
nanomembrane lasers based on germanium, where tensile strain can produce a
direct fundamental bandgap, thereby enabling optical gain.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is provided by several potentially
disruptive applications of the proposed devices. Nanomembrane lasers in general
can create novel functionalities in mechanically flexible optoelectronic
systems, such as sensor foils, smart clothing, and artificial skin. Furthermore,
the proposed Ge lasers could be directly fabricated on silicon-based
microelectronic chips as a means to enable the integration of electronics and
photonics at an unprecedented scale.

Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are provided by related educational and
curriculum development activities. The research involvement of undergraduates
and high-school interns will be emphasized, leveraging existing programs with a
strong focus on underrepresented minorities. The more innovative themes of this
research will also be incorporated in courses taught by the PIs. Furthermore,
the aforementioned applications may ultimately produce important benefits to
society, e.g., by creating radically new sensing capabilities.
