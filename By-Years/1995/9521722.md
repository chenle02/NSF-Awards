ABSTRACT 9521722 This proposal is to extend thermodynamic optimization of
components and power systems, particularly for turbine engine, using finite time
thermodynamics; optimization will be carried out by adjusting pressure loss
distributions and flow rate to maximize power output. The results could lead to
improved engineering design of both components and systems.
