This renewal award is supported jointly by the Solid State Chemistry Program in
the Division of Materials Research and the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry. This
magnetochemistry research program is devoted to the investigation of the
chemical and structural features which determine the nature of cooperativity in
low dimensional compounds, especially systems that have unusual structures or
exhibit phase transitions. The importance of low-dimensional systems has been
demonstrated by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductors, which
are thought to be propagated through low-dimensional networks. New one-
dimensional magnetic compounds, mainly bridged Cu(II) compounds, will be
synthesized and characterized, both structurally and magnetically. Observed
magnetic properties will be correlated with ab initio calculated values. %%%
Low-dimensional systems may have other important properties and may find uses in
switches, actuators, sensors, display devices and in logic circuits. A better
understanding of the fundamental properties of low-dimensional systems will
permit the design of substances with prescribed properties.
