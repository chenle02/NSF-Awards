This proposal concerns support for printing of a National Academy of Science
book about chemistry, and distribution for teachers and students in conjunction
with "Chemistry Day". The schedule of this event is very short, and a principal
virtue of the activity is its role in encouraging participation of practicing
research chemists in the problems of science education. So the proposal was
given special ad hoc review by SEE staff members. The subject matter disparate
judgments are infact quite consistent, and the views of the proposal's strengths
and weaknesses are both clear and consistent. The subject matter is a well
recognized study of the state of chemistry research. The audience and impact are
worthwhile though limited. Without NSF support, it is doubtful that the volume
is viable. The support requested is nominal and the funding is largely supplied
by other sources: NAS and private corporations. Responding to suggestions from
the scientific community, the NAS is seeking to expand dissemination of the
report, OPPORTUNITIES IN CHEMISTRY, to the high school level. A special edition
of the report, suitable for high school chemistry teachers and advanced
placement students is being prepared to be available nationally. The bulk of the
costs..fees to the authors, printing, and distribution..are being borne by the
NAS and by non.federal organizations dedicated to the welfare of chemistry,
including the American Chemical Society, and the Council for Chemical Research.
This proposal requests $25,000 from NSF as partial support for supplemental
printing and distribution of the report, in an overall budget of $95,000.//
