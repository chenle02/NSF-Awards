This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in mathematics
between researchers at the University of South Florida and the French National
Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at
Sophia Antipolis, France. The teams are led by Edward Saff and Laurent Barachart
respectively. The research concerns the interplay between linear dynamical
control systems and function theory; in particular the use of approximation
theory to engineering systems. They will investigate problems related to
identification schemes for system modeling. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in potential theory and convergence theory for rational
approximation. This is complemented by French expertise in dynamical control
systems. The project takes advantage of combined expertise and will advance
understanding of control theory and its mathematical foundation.
