This grant is on a study of the mechanical properties of bulk nanocrystalline
materials produced using different techniques such as cryomilling, severe
plastic deformation and electrodeposition. A major objective is to elucidate and
understand the mechanical properties of nc-materials, particularly including
their strength, ductility, creep, superplasticity, and fatigue. Pure metals with
different crystal structures (FCC, BCC and HCP) will be considered along with
superplastic Zn-22%Al eutectoid as well as commercial alloys such as Inconel and
ultra-fine grained structural steel. The goal is to use novel indentation
technique in-situ in electron microscope along with tensile, shear and fatigue
tests on bulk nanocrystalline samples. Along with the experimental studies,
computational models based on atomistic simulations will be developed to predict
the mechanical response and to correlate with the experimental results. The
focus of the research on mechanical behavior of nc-materials is on their
potentially high strength, the possibility of enhanced creep rates at moderate
to low temperatures by grain boundary diffusion, the possibility that these
materials may permit superplastic forming at exceptionally high rates or low
temperatures, and their response under cyclic loading. The possible applications
for chemical, mechanical and electromagnetic technologies will be
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing improved understanding
of mechanical behavior in nanocrystalline materials, with implications for how
they can be exploited in engineering applications, the program will provide
graduate and undergraduate students with useful educational experiences that
will contribute to their training, skills, knowledge, and professional careers.
Five investigators at three different academic institutions coordinate the
research program with plans to establish collaborations with national
laboratories such as Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
