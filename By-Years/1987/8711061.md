The research capabilities of this group will be expanded by constructing and
testing apparatus which, in conjunction with existing equipment, will allow the
simultaneous measurement of the charge state of a target recoil ion, the
velocity distribution of one or more free electrons, the projectile charge state
and its energy loss in a fast ion atom collision. Such a collision will be
(nearly) completely characterized by measuring the energy loss and charge state
of a projectile ion, which has produced a high electron moving with near zero
velocity in the projectile rest frame. In addition, the formation of three body
final states just above the dissociation limit will be explored under various
collision conditions by detecting two electrons moving near zero velocity in the
projectile rest frame. The outcome of these experiments will determine if
experiments exploring threshold laws in fast ion atom collisions are feasible.
This work will help elucidate basic phenomena in atomic collisions.
