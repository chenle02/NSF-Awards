The F1 ATPase is large, membrane-associated protein which links an equilibrium
reaction between the two adenine nucleotides, adenosine triphosphate and
adenosine diphosphate, and the translocation of protons across the membrane.
Thus, with a suitable proton electrochemical potential difference across the
membrane it can drive the net synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. This system
will be studied by phosphorous solid state nuclear magnetic resonance. Attempts
will be made to detect intermediates in the reaction and to measure rates of
reaction. Attempts will also be made to determine distances between a bound
metal ion required for reactions (manganese will be substituted for magnesium)
and the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. %%% The overall goal of this work is
to define the structure and kinetics of the active site of the enzyme in situ;
previous studies have relied on extraction techniques which may not reflect the
true concentrations of reactants on the enzyme itself. Longer term aims of this
study are to extend the NMR experiments and measure the proximity of specific
amino acid residues on the protein to the bound adenine nucleotides.
