This Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the
feasibility of scaling Yb:KGW based lasers to high powers and high beam quality
through well controlled crystal growth of high quality crystals, accurate
measurement of critical materials properties, and extrapolation of performance
and manufacturability. Ytterbium (Yb) doped lasers are appealing for high power
applications due to efficient diode pumping by commercially available diode
lasers in the 900-980 nm spectral range. Yb:KGW is interesting in that high Yb
doping concentrations are achievable. More significant are the unique properties
of efficient self-cooling through anti-Stokes fluorescence and beam cleanup
through stimulated Raman scattering. Another application exploits the wide
emission bandwidth for mode-locked femtosecond pulses of high peak power leading
to new sources for nonlinear spectroscopy and commercial high power pulsed
sources. Critical data required to extrapolate the effectiveness of power
scaling Yb:KGW lasers have been obtained from crystals of variable quality and
from a limited subset of possible crystal compositions. The broader impacts of
this technology would be for commercial solid state laser systems. Significant
advances in the fields of industrial, medical, and research laser applications
can be anticipated. Power scaling and reduced thermal management requirements
lead to more efficient and lower cost high power 1m industrial lasers used in
materials processing (cutting, welding, marking). Medical laser applications
include therapeutic and surgical lasers, and picosecond pulse hard tissue dental
lasers. Direct diode pumping allows for simple mode-locked ultrafast systems
with reduced complexity and cost over conventional argon ion or frequency
doubled Nd:YAG-pumped Ti:sapphire systems. In addition, the 1m mode-locked
operation extends beyond the 900 nm limit of Ti:Sapphire creating new
possibilities for optical parametric oscillator pump sources.
