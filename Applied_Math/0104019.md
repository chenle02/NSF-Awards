It is proposed to study the shock wave theory for conservation laws and the
Boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory. Shock waves occurs in many natural
phenomena, such as supersonic flight, sonar wind, earthquakes and hurricanes.
There is now a satisfactory mathematical theory for the inviscid plane motion.
It is planned to study the multi-dimensional gas motion as well as the
dissipation effects. The Boltzmann equation models the gas motion on the
microscopic level. This is necessary for important physical phenomena such as
the thermal effects of the boundary on the gas motion. The nonlinear waves and
the boundary effects for the Boltzmann equation will be studied.

The Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations for the gas dynamics are
considered. The project will include the study of the nonlinear stability of
shock waves for these and more general systems of hyperbolic-parabolic
conservation laws. The approach combines the pointwise estimates and the energy
estimates and is based on the new understanding of the structure of the Green's
function for the equations linearized about the shock. For the Boltzmann
equation, the positivity of Boltzmann shocks has been shown and the boundary
effects such as the thermal creep are being studied. These are based on the new
macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann equation and time-asymptotic
analysis.
