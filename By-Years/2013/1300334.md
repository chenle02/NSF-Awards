In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Clay S. Bennett of the Department of Chemistry at Tufts
University will examine the development of methods for the stereoselective
construction of deoxy-sugar linkages using shelf stable glycosyl donors. While
approaches to deoxy-sugar construction do exist, they frequently rely on the use
of temporary directing groups to control selectivity. This introduces multiple
additional steps in their synthesis. The proposed research will involve
developing a set of reagents to activate deoxy-sugar donors in such a fashion
that they undergo SN2-like reactions, thereby eliminating the need for directing
groups. Through proper choice of reagent it will be possible to selectively
synthesize either diastereomer of a deoxy-sugar starting from the same glycosyl
donor. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies directed at understanding
the mechanism of these reactions will also be undertaken.

The proposed research could lead to the creation of a modular set of reagent
combinations for the facile construction of stereodefined glycosidic linkages
with a broad set of substrates. By streamlining oligosaccharide construction,
this chemistry will eliminate chemical waste arising from multiple solution-
phase manipulations of temporary prosthetic groups and difficult purifications
of diastereomers. Thus, it will also provide a more environmentally benign
approach to these molecules. Importantly, the insights gained from mechanistic
studies will guide the application of these methods to other classes of
monosaccharides. Successful development of the methodology will impact all areas
of activity that requires carbohydrate synthesis, including the pharmaceutical,
chemical, agricultural industries, and the biological and chemical research
communities. This project will also provide training for pre-undergraduate
through graduate students, including students from groups that are historically
underrepresented in the sciences.
