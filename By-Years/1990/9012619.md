This project will identify and weight factors influencing upward and downward
socio-economic mobility through analysis of the Current Population Surveys for
1973 through 1987. Methods include description of rates by gender and race,
loglinear analyses, multinominal analyses, and logistic regression analy- ses.
These methods permit examination of mobility determinants taking into account
individual factors in addition to race and gender, and changing organizational
structures. Individual determinants and organizations have not been included in
previous work due to lack of statistical tools to include them. They are
important because there is wide individual variation in success rates within
race and gender categories, and because most mobil- ity occurs within
organizations, whose opportunity structures change with economic changes and
other factors. Results of this study will show changes in mobility which have
occurred recently due to such factors as laws against discrimination in
promotions, growth of service sector employment, increasing employment of women
outside the home, and declines in durable goods manufac- turing.
