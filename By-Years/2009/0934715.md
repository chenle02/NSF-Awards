Hampton University (HU) School of Science and the Division of Professional
Education are collaborating to support the implementation and evaluation of a HU
Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program which prepares STEM undergraduate
majors and/or STEM professionals to become K-12 science teachers in the Hampton
City School District (HCSD). The project builds on the University's existing
high quality teacher preparation program in which the emphasis is on modern
pedagogical approaches that stress student inquiry in the classroom. The program
provides the students scholarships and mentoring during their time in the
classroom, and supports them as teachers during the induction year. The project
plans to prepare 30 highly qualified elementary and secondary teachers in
biology or mathematics over five years.&lt;br/&gt; .
