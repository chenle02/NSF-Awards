Under this funding, the PIs will carry out a pilot program of Ar/Ar dating to
determine whether volcanic rock samples can be found of appropriate age and
chemistry along a well-characterized across-arc transect in SE Guatemala. If so,
it may then be possible to determine (1) the relative contributions of flux and
decompression processes to partial melting (2) how these processes vary across
the arc and (3) how these processes have changed in time, associated with
changing geodynamic boundary conditions. Southeastern Guatemala provides access
to an across-arc transect with recent volcanism occurring nearly continuously
for ~125 km transverse to the subduction zone. Sorting out the timing of fluid
addition and its influence on partial melting is the main goal of the this
study. U-series isotopic analyses will eventually be used to constrain the
timing and character of slab fluid additions to the source of arc magmas and
their relationship to partial melting processes. A U-Th-Ra-Pa disequilibrium
study will eventually be done on young volcanic rocks from the volcanic front to
over 100 km behind the front. 40Ar/39Ar dating of the young front and behind-
the-front lavas will be carried out as an integral prelude to U-series.
