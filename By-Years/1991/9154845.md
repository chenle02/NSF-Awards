The University of Kansas is offering a three year teacher enhancement project
to develop elementary teacher-leaders in northeast Kansas schools. For each of
three years 42 elementary teachers will attend a three-week workshop on
mathematics content and pedagogy consistent with the NCTM Curriculum and
Evaluation Standards. The workshop will be led by a team of university
mathematicians, mathematics educators, and elementary teachers. Staff will work
closely with participants to design appropriate follow-up activities during the
school year and will make regular site visits. A workshop for principals will
also be held. Since teachers will be encouraged to return for a second summer,
and the workshop designed to facilitate such participation, it is estimated that
the project will involve directly approximately 100 teachers. Cost share by
school districts and the university is approximately 21% of the project budget.
