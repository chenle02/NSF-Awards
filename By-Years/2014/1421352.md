Many systems ranging from consumer electronics to military equipment are
dependent on integrated circuits (ICs). Thus, if the underlying IC in a system
is maliciously manipulated by a hardware trojan, then the security of the entire
system can be compromised. This project investigates hardware Trojans that do
not rely on additional logic to affect security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers study a class of Trojans that can be realized using low-level
manipulations like subtle changes in logic, circuit or manufacturing process.
They investigate scenarios where an attacker may take advantage of such
manipulations, and develops countermeasures to protect ICs against hardware
Trojans. This project explores new threat assessments for many applications of
practical relevance. Considering society's reliance on integrated circuits,
understanding the threat posed by low-level Trojans in IC design and
manufacturing supply chain is of great importance.
