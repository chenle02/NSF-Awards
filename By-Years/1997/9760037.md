*** 970037 Berman This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
evaluate the possibility of extending the Photocatalytic Removal (PCR) process
for the removal of gaseous pollutants to higher concentration and higher flow
rate air streams and air streams containing difficult to remove pollutants. PCR
will be coupled as a polishing process to the Low Temperature Plasma Removal
(LTPR) process which is known to remove pollutants at good energy efficiencies
but not sufficiently high removal percentages. The primary goal is to
demonstrate that the PCR/LTPR combination destroys pollutants with a better
efficiency/high percentage removal figure of merit than either process alone.
Successful proof and development of the combined process is estimated to be
applicable to a commercial market of about one billion dollars. ***
