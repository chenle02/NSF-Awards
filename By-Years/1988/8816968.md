Asia, south of Siberia, is composed of a collage of micro- plates much like the
western part of North America. This project is a paleomagnetic study of several
microplate terranes in portions of eastern Tibet, western Sechuan and western
Yunnan, China. Samples were collected by K. Huang of the Institute of Geology
and will be applied to quantifying rotations and transla- tions of these
terranes during accretion and subsequent escape tectonics related to the
collision of India.
