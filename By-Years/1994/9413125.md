This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma in the purchase of a
modern 400 MHz multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will be used in the
following areas of research: (1) Chiral transition metal complexes; (2)
Oxidation chemistry and biochemistry in the brain; (3) Liquid crystals and
polymerized electrolyte gels; (4) Catalytic asymmetric reactions; (5)
Organotransition metal chemistry; (6) Marine natural products; (7) Siderophores;
(8) Synthesis, stabilization, and application of reactive or organic moieties;
(9) Nucleotide analogs; (10) Nitrosylmetalloporphyrins; and (11) Divalent
transport by polyether ionophores. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
