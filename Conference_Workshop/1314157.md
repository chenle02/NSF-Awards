This proposal requests funding for US-based participants to attend the
conference "Global Dynamics Beyond Uniform Hyperbolicity" which will be held at
the Banach Center in Bedlewo, Poland May 27- June 7, 2013. This conference is
sixth in a series of international conferences held since 2001, two of which
were held in the US and funded primarily by the NSF. The conference will focus
on the global qualitative study (topological and ergodic) of differentiable
dynamical systems, especially diffeomorphisms and vector fields, that are not
uniformly hyperbolic. Among the main topics to be covered are: -Beyond
Hyperbolicity: Partial hyperbolicity, Nonuniform hyperbolicity, Singular
hyperbolicity, Lyapunov exponents, Dimension, Statistical properties. -Global
and Semilocal Properties: The C1-topology, Bifurcations. -Other Topics: Interval
Dynamics, Foliations.

This study of smooth dynamical systems has its origins in early efforts to
establish the stability of the solar system. Early pioneers such as Henri
Poincare and George Birkhoff discovered mechnanisms for stability and
instability, thus initiating the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Around
the same time, the geometer Eberhard Hopf used hyperbolic methods to study the
long-term behavior of geodesics (straight lines) in negatively curved spaces
(such as those modelled on Minkowski space). A century later, the study of
hyperbolic dynamical systems has blossomed into a mature field, one of the
cornerstones of dynamics. This conference, one in a series held every few years,
brings together a truly international group of experts, representing 5
continents, to explore the latest developments beyond hyperbolicity. Exposure to
this cutting edge work through these workshops has spurred research advances in
a previous generation of US graduate students, many of whom will speak at this
workshop. Previous incarnations of this workshop have also led to international
collaborative teams, and we anticipate future benefits of a similar nature.
