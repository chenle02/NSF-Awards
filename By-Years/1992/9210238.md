Dystrophin related protein, DRP, is a large, recently identified protein that
is similar to dystrophin. Preliminary studies suggest that DRP is specifically
localized in the brain to cells associated with the blood-brain-barrier which is
critical to maintaining the normal physiological conditions in the brain.
Dystrophin is essential to the maintenance of muscle and DRP may well perform a
similar, significant role in maintaining the organization of membrane proteins
in cells which compose the blood-brain-barrier. High resolution light and
electron-microscopic techniques will be applied to characterize the distribution
of DRP in the developing and adult brain in vivo. This information will help
elucidate the significance of this protein in the establishment and maintenance
of the blood-brain-barrier.
