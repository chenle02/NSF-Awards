Access to remote facilities, data bases, supercomputing resources, and
libraries and to distributed collaborators has become essential to research in a
variety of disciplines and to science and engineering education at Portland
State University. This proposal provides for this remote access by linking
Portland State University to a midlevel network, NorthWestNet, with medium speed
telecommunication lines (56,000 bits per second). NorthWestNet is connected to
the NSFNET Backbone Network which in turn provides high speed access (1.5
million bits per second) to all NSF sponsored Supercomputer Centers and to other
Regional Network Operation Centers. The gateway/routing equipment and the
communication lines will be provided by the Western Interstate Council on Higher
Education (WICHE) through a supplemental grant to their current award for the
management of NorthWestNet. They will provide network information services and
training as well as network operation and management services in linking
Portland State to other universities on the midlevel backbone and to the NSFNET
National Backbone Network. The university will provide necessary support and
technical expertise for the operation and maintenance of the gateway node on
campus as well as information services for the scientific users at the
university.//
