DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Examining genetic similarity, mating behavior and fitness
consequences in a simultaneous hermaphrodite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Andrew
Sih&lt;br/&gt;Thomas M. McCarthy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic similarity may
play an important role in both mate choice and reproductive success, but few
studies integrate these inter-related fields. Physid snails are simultaneous
hermaphrodites that can both self-fertilize and outcross, and are thus an
excellent system for addressing questions about the role of genetic similarity
in mating behavior, mate choice and reproductive fitness. This study includes a
series of experiments that integrates these issues. It will also consider
additional factors that may affect the interplay between genetic similarity,
behavior and fitness.&lt;br/&gt;The study will be comprised of three
experimental sections. The first section tests for any effects of genetic
similarity on mating behavior in paired snails, and for effects of genetic
similarity on reproductive output and offspring hatching rate. These
reproductive consequences will also be examined for self-fertilizing
individuals. The second section of the study tests whether the genetic
similarity of potential mates affects mate-choice decisions in groups of three
individuals. The behaviors and reproductive consequences observed in the first
section of the study will be used to make a priori predictions about mating
frequencies during these interactions. The third section tests whether
additional factors (predation risk, food availability, temperature regime and
reproductive status) affect mating interactions and measures of reproductive
fitness within pairs of snails with varying levels of genetic
similarity.&lt;br/&gt;
