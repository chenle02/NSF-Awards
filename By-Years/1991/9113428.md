This award is to support a group of four professors at the University of
California, Santa Cruz in two areas: (1) particle accelerator research and
Cherenkov ring imaging detector development, using the linear e plus e minus
collider at SLAC; and (2) a particle astrophysics experiment at Los Alamos using
the CYGNUS detector array. The experiment at SLAC focusses upon measurements of
properties of the weak neutral boson - the Z zero - and makes use of a
spectrometer built from state-of-the-art particle detection devices which this
group has helped to develop and fabricate. The astrophysics experiments are
concerned with observation of cosmic ray showers, particularly those due to
neutral particles emanating from cosmic point sources. The investigators bring a
good deal of expertise in particle physics methodology to the astrophysics
enterprises and plan, for example, to make significant improvements to the
angular resolution of CYGNUS to aid in identification of the sources. A number
of other contributions to both performance of CYGNUS and analysis of the data
from it are also expected.
