9733707 Goldman This CAREER project bridges atoms to devices striving to link
basic materials science with technology. Direct correlations between atomic
scale processes occurring during epitaxial growth and electronic properties will
be investigated using a combination of epitaxial growth, in-situ and ex-situ
measurements. The P.I. will develop a series of laboratory modules in electronic
materials which parallel these basic investigations, and incorporate them into
undergraduate courses. Initial systems for study include InAs-based films and
heterostructures whose high electron mobility and surface accumulation make them
promising as magnetic field sensors for automotive applications. This project
will investigate how details of atom attachment on a surface affect the electron
mobility of a thin film, and its resulting performance as a magnetic field
sensor. Graduate students will be exposed to research spanning fundamental
materials science to applied aspects. Undergraduate students will actively
participate in the design, construction, and utilization of electronic and
magnetic measurement systems, which will serve as prototypes for undergraduate
laboratory modules to develop studentsO experimental and analytical skills, and
to enhance learning through discovery. %%% The project addresses fundamental
research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials and advanced
devices. An important feature of the program is the emphasis on education, and
on the integration of research and education through the training of students in
a fundamentally and technologically significant research area. ***
