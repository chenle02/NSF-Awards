A consortium of seven community colleges in Texas, lead by the College of the
Mainland, along with their local high schools and industries are planning to
address the development of a workforce with skills and knowledge in e-business.
The necessary skills and competencies for jobs in e-business are assessed using
the DACUM process and curricula are developed to provide a common technical core
with four exit options - technical support, programming, graphic arts and
security. The planning establishes a statewide industry/education partnership
that possesses a broad grasp of the Internet economy. A partnership memorandum
of understanding assures that each derives benefit. Presentations are made to
strengthen public awareness and gain support.
