Abstract In many nations economic development has been associated with lower
rates of fertility. Educational and occupational opportunities attendant to
development are known to lower fertility, but the way familial changes mediate
between economic development and fertility is less well understood. Varying
studies have hypothesized that familial changes could impact upon fertility via
inheritance, production patterns, gender roles, or marriage rules; but a lack of
systematic data has made it difficult to isolate specific effects. The
investigators will examine two Tamang villages in Nepal, chosen because they
represent markedly different levels of economic development. Through extensive
fieldwork and sample surveys they will relate fertility to household and family
patterns, and relate the latter to variations in the larger social organization
of the villages. Data will be collected from multiple cohorts to permit the
investigators to infer how changes have been occuring.
