The enzyme, carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyses the reversable hydration of
CO2 to form bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, can potentially play an
important role in a number of varied physiological and biochemical processes
which involve the molecular and ionic species CO2 : CO2 transport and excretion,
CO2 fixation for post-exercise gluconeogenesis, and HCO3- incorporation into
carbamoyl phosphate for urea synthesis. Putative multiple function of CA have
been studied only sketchily in mammalian/vertebrate systems and not at all among
the invertebrates. The purpose of this proposed research is to investigate the
role of branchial membrane-associated CA in CO2 excretion in crustaceans under
conditions of respiratory stress (e.g., exercise and the transition from water-
to air-breathing). Mitochondrial CA will also be investigated with respect to
its potential role in supplying HCO3- to the metabolic pathways responsible for
gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis. A combination of biochemical, physiological
and pharmacological techniques will be used to study CA distribution and
function in primitive systems. The major objectives will be to determine whether
or not CA is central to a number of different biological processes in a wide
variety of primitive organisms. This work should provide new and useful
information on the origins and evolution of CA function and on the pattern of
organization of cellular metabolic pathways in primitive systems.
