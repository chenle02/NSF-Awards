The researchers aim to construct a high resolution sea level curve for the
western Mediterranean Basin as part of an effort to better understand global sea
level variations. The island of Mallorca contains coastal caves that capture
present and past sea level through the deposition of unique carbonate
encrustations that form precisely at the sea level
position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coastal caves of Mallorca were chosen for
this study because of their demonstrated ability to obtain a high resolution
sea-level history and the importance of the locality for addressing the issue of
eustatic sea level change due to its unique tectonic and isostatic
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will be of broad interest
to a wide range of scientists interested in sea level variability and the
vulnerability of ice sheets under a range of boundary conditions. The project
will also foster strong collaborations among American and Spanish scientists and
will support graduate and undergraduate students.
