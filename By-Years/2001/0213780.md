This Major Research Instrumentation award to Sea Education Association in Woods
Hole, Massachusetts provides funds for acquisition of oceanographic research
instrumentation for use on the SEA vessel SSV Corwith Cramer. Instruments
supported here will be used in the SEA Semester and related seagoing programs,
involving undergraduates, K-12 students and teachers in hands-on marine research
and seamanship. Specific instruments supported here include an acoustic current
profiler, sonars for sounding and sub-bottom profiling, sensors for analysis of
physical, chemical and biological properties of surface and subsurface waters, a
computer network for data acquisition and analysis, and other instruments for
research and training. The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF. Sea Education Association will provide cost-share support from
non-federal funds for a portion of total project costs.
