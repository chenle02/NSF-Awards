Computer networks are an important technology that contributes to collaborative
work among engineers, which is one type of `knowledge networking'. This
exploratory study investigates an important assumption frequently made by both
technical developers of software tools, and by researchers interested in the
conditions and consequences of using computer-based systems: that knowledge
networking in design and other fields will reduce the need for co-location. This
research aims to develop a framework that will provide insight into how co-
location requirements_and hence requirements for information technology
mediation---vary across design tasks. The results of his project will help us to
better understand the information-technology-related and task oriented factors
that underlay co-location requirements. This will help researchers and
practitioners to target large technology investments where they will do the most
good, and will help to avoid encouraging the use of ineffective and even
productivity-decreasing organizational information technology structures where
co-location is essential. The research will be based on intensive interviews
with mechanical and electrical engineering designers and software developers in
five to ten firms.
