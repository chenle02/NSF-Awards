This research focuses on the development of decomposition techniques which can
be used in the design of efficient algorithms for graph packing, covering, and
recognition problems. The specific graph theoretic problems to be investigated
have important practical applications related to computational complexity issues
and computer architecture design. In particular, the research has applications
to the synchronization of parallel processes and to optimization in computer
storage. Polynomial time algorithms for packing and covering problems on general
perfect graphs are developed.
