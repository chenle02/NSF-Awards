X-ray diffractometry is a standard method for identifying and characterizing
mineral phases in geological research. This proposal requests 50% of the cost of
acquiring a modern x-ray diffractometer system to be installed in the Department
of Geology of the University of Missouri in Columbia. The unit will replace a 25
year old instrument which is no longer functional for research purposes. Major
current research projects in the department requiring x-ray diffractometry
include the study of low-temperature chemical alterations altering the reservoir
properties of Tertiary sandstone oil reservoir rocks, the effects of homoionic
clay interactions on laboratory pyrolysis of kerogen (a petroleum precursor),
and surface properties of mixed-layer illite-smectite clays from Gulf Coast
sediments. Much of this research focuses on basic problems of the origin,
migration and recovery of oil. In addition to its use by researchers in the
Department of Geology, the diffractometer will be used by members of the Nuclear
Research Center, Dalton Research Center, and the departments of physics,
chemistry, and mechanical &amp; aerospace engineering at Missouri. The
university will contribute the remaining 50% of the cost of purchasing the
equipment.
