Stephanie Ho is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry
out a program of research and education at New Mexico State University. Ho will
conduct observations and simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of
nearby galaxies to study how gas flows in and out of galaxies. Results from this
project will elucidate how gas accretes onto galaxies, fuels star formation, and
grows galactic disks. Ho will also conduct outreach activities to increase
awareness among underrepresented youth about astronomy as a possible career
path. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will examine the interplay
between the cool CGM, the warm-hot CGM, and the galactic disk. Ho will
incorporate galaxy disk orientation into physical models of circumgalatic gas
flow to explain the origin of the cool and warm-hot CGM. Ho will also analyze
mock absorption spectra generated using cosmological simulations to understand
the observed kinematic misalignment between the cool and warm-hot phases of the
CGM. Finally, she will combine spectroscopic observations of emission lines and
circumgalactic absorption lines toward nearby galaxies to analyze gas flow and
understand the role of accretion in disk growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
