The focus of this research is the use of enzymes in key steps of the synthesis
of complex molecules. The proposed substrates for the enzymes are meso compounds
readily available from the oxidation of simple cyclic hydrocarbons such as
cyclopentadiene, benzene, cycloheptatriene, cycloheptene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene.
The enzymatic reactions will serve to unveil multiple chiral centers. The
resulting building blocks will be exposed to a number of synthetic
protocols,including the use of transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, to
give various classes of molecules of biological interest. %%% With this
Accomplishment Based Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Carl R. Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne
State University. Professor Johnson will focus his work on the application of
enzymes as catalysts in key steps of the synthesis of complex organic molecules.
