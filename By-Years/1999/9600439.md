96004339 Snyder The program will consist of nine scientific platform sessions,
one keynote address, one Methods and Technologies workshop and two poster
sessions. The scientific sessions will cover nuclear architecture, DNA
replication (origins and biochemistry), cell cycle control, telomeres and
position effects, centromeres and their interacting proteins, components of the
mitotic spindle apparatus, microtubule motors and meiotic chromosome
segregation. Six or seven speakers will present talks in each session for a
total of 65 talks. The workshop will cover recent technologies in yeast
chromosome and genome research (e.g. use and analysis of GFP fusions, creating
mutations and epitope tagging yeast genes by PCR, fine structure electron
microscopic analysis of the mitotic spindle apparatus, accessing yeast genome
information). The poster sessions will cover all areas of yeast chromosome
research. Finally, ample time will be available in the afternoons and after the
evening sessions to allow extensive discussion among researchers. ***
