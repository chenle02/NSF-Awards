9526796 Rial This research is to investigate the cause of the anomalously high
ground shaking in Tarzana caused by the January 17, 1994, Northridge,
California, earthquake. This work will test the hypothesis that the anomalous
motion is in part caused by the effects of an old landslide on which Tarzana is
proposed to be situated. Detailed modeling of accelerograms using realistic
velocity structures will be performed with software developed by the Principal
Investigator. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. *** ??
