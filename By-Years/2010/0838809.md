Imagine two people on a park bench looking at a swan in the pond. Both people
are aware that in some way, they are attending to the swan together. This
conference explores the nature of the 'jointness' of such episodes of attention.
The conference features presentations by developmental and comparative
psychologists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers of the mind.
&lt;br/&gt;The capacity for joint attention develops towards the end of the
first year of life in humans and is present in non-human primates as well. Joint
attention and its development is thought to play a crucial role with regard to a
variety of issues, such as concept acquisition, empathy, social interaction, and
the concept of self. Understanding joint attention and its development is also
of relevance for the study of autism.
