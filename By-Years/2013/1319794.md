Efficient computation of expressive nonmonotonic first-order reasoning is
important for realizing robust intelligence. Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a
successful nonmonotonic declarative programming paradigm, but is limited in
handling first-order reasoning involving functions due to its propositional
setting. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is a successful approach to
solving some specialized first-order reasoning, but is limited in handling
nonmonotonic reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at correcting
these deficiencies by tightly integrating ASP and SMT in the framework of
"Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories" (ASPMT). ASPMT will enjoy the
expressiveness of the ASP modeling language while leveraging efficient
constraint / theory solving methods available in SMT and other related computing
paradigms. It will provide a viable approach to solving problems that requires
both discrete high level reasoning and continuous low level reasoning, and will
provide an effective way to handle heterogeneous knowledge and/or computation
sources in a uniform framework. The project will also deliver an online
computation model of the framework and its
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the project will produce a
general method of efficient computation of expressive reasoning by intelligently
combining different formalisms and their implementations, and will promote
cross-fertilization among the involved communities. The success of this project
will have a significant impact on a wide range of domains that can benefit from
a powerful declarative programming paradigm. It will provide a practically
usable knowledge representation programming language and tools, which can be
easily used by non-KR experts while hiding the details of various computational
methods.
