This award supports the astronomical research, technological development, and
student training carried out at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory
(FCRAO). The research program includes studies of external galaxies, star
formation, the dense interstellar medium, astrochemistry, the late stages of
stellar evolution, and planetary science. The Observatory also plays a major
role in education, with 45 graduate and undergraduate students from 13
universities having carried out research projects at the facility during the
past three year period. FCRAO has recently brought into operation a focal plane
array of receivers for use at a wavelength of 3 millimeters; the first of its
kind on any telescope. Over the next three years this group will expand the
spectroscopic capability of the array through construction of an autocorrelation
spectrometer. As an initial step toward construction of larger focal plane
arrays, development work on high electron mobility transister amplifiers will be
carried out. Among the scientific programs to be carried out are maps of a large
number of transitions of molecules to examine the coupled physics, chemistry and
kinematics of the dense interstellar medium in our Galaxy; large scale, good
angular resolution maps of molecular clouds to study the relationship of star
formation to angular momentum content and structure on a heirarchy of scales;
fully sampled maps of the molecular distribution in many spiral galaxies in
order to study the process of star formation in these systems; and participation
in VLBI experiments to probe the inner structure of quasars and active galactic
nuclei.
