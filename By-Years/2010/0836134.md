SES-0836134&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
will hold a conference, jointly organized and funded between the US National
Science Foundation and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research
Foundation) (DFG. This conference explores research frontiers between recent
developments in behavioral economics and economic sociology. The conference
includes 80 scholars,(40 each from the US and Germany) whose research informs
these boundaries. Scholars include senior and junior researchers representing a
broad range of universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments
in economics and sociology point to the need to broaden the range of concepts
and variables taken into consideration when economic behavior is studied. They
point to the need to contextualize economic action and to rethink economic
behavior itself, by broadening our understanding of its internal processes and
engagements as well as its biological foundations. The objective is to explore
the advances in several research communities with regard to such questions, and
to bring these communities together across disciplinary
boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference format is designed to enhance
cross-disciplinary exchange and explore agreements and disagreements between the
research communities. Sessions are focused on a single topic, and consist of up
to four presentations and one discussant who are selected to represent different
research communities. Junior scholars are expected to attend and participate in
the full conference, and a poster session provides a venue for presentations on
original research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the development
of cross-disciplinary research initiatives, dissemination of graduate student
and post-doc research, and enhancement of US/Germany collaborative research
possibilities.
