This project will be a synthesis of 20 years of research on the ecology and
evolution of Long-tailed Manakins. These Neotropical birds have a lek mating
system, in which clustered males court females. Their leks are unique in the
animal kingdom because pairs of unrelated males (alphas and betas) cooperate for
coordinated song and dance displays. If a mating occurs, it is always by the
alpha. Because the cooperation involves neither kin selection nor reciprocity,
an evolutionary puzzle arises. Why should betas help alphas? The PI will
synthesize his results in two major ways: 1) by using models borrowed from
sociology to explore the complex social relationships among males; 2) with
analyses of male interactions, using 18 years of records of individually marked
birds. He will generate: 1) a book summarizing and synthesizing his research on
this species, 2) an edited book, in which researchers describe the many ways
manakins serve as models for understanding tropical biodiversity.

Understanding empirical conditions that promote cooperation among unrelated
individuals could stimulate insights into conditions that foster alternatives to
violence in humans. Increasingly, human societies are aggregations of unrelated
individuals plagued by violent interactions. Sociologists and psychologists have
often used insights from non-human animals to model processes in humans. The
simpler social system of the manakins should be useful in suggesting conditions
that promote cooperation in unexpected contexts, such as the apparent paradox
that males that should compete intensely for mates, instead act cooperatively.
