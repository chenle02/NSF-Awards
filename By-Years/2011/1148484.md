The SciDaaS project will develop and operate a suite of innovative research data
management services for the NSF community. These services, to be accessible at
www.globusonline.org, will allow research laboratories to outsource a range of
time-consuming research data management functions, including storage and
movement, publication, and metadata management. SciDaaS research will
investigate what services are most needed by NSF researchers; how best to
present these services to integrate with diverse research laboratory
environments; and how these services are used in practice across different
research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciDaaS will greatly reduce the cost
to the individual researcher of acquiring and operating sophisticated scientific
data management capabilities. In so doing, it has the potential to dramatically
expand use of advanced information technology in NSF research and thus
accelerate discovery across many fields of science and engineering. By providing
a platform for researchers to publicly share data at an incremental cost,
SciDaaS will also reduce barriers to free exchange among researchers and
contribute to the democratization of science.
