9222752 Greenaway The purchase of a multi-institutional, multi-user EPR
spectrometer to be housed in the Department of Chemistry at Clark University
will complement the Worcester Consortium Center for Magnetic Resonance, located
in the same building, to provide facilities for biological and chemical research
for institutions throughout Central New England. A total of ten educational
institutions throughout New England are represented. Five specific research
projects of biomedical emphasis and three of physico-chemical emphasis are
proposed, as well as a number of secondary projects. The major users propose
studies of: the structure and mechanism of action of lysyl oxidase and related
copper-containing amine oxidases; the structures and mechanisms regulating
selection and transfer of fragments of antigenic proteins into the antigen-
binding sites of major histocompatibility complex molecules; the improvement of
EPR dosimetric techniques with emphasis on the use of bone marrow and bone
fragments as in situ dosimeters; the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase-mediated
mechanisms of toxicity of chlorocarbons; the effects of metal-binding in the
neurochemically- important protein calmodulin on conformation and interactions
with intracellular target enzymes and inhibitor proteins; the low-temperature
magnetic properties of transparent bimetallic layered ferrimagnetic systems; the
nature of the radical sulfur species present in aqueous solutions and at
electrode surfaces; quantum effects n linear antiferromagnetic chains.
