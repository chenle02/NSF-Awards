The research objective of this award is to create fundamental knowledge and
methods for engineering design that enable engineers to better create products
that satisfy the needs of persons with disabilities. Specifically, this research
will create product design methodologies focused on what is common and what is
different between typical and inclusive products. The proposed work creates
quantitative knowledge that links the function of a product to the limitations
of a user. Additionally, this research will create a modular multiplatform
product family design method specifically constructed to support inclusive
design. Thus, the products designed will offer usability, functionality, and
value to the user while simultaneously offering profitability to the producer.
The proposed research extends the functional lexicon of engineering design and
World Health Organizations International Classification of Functioning,
Disability, and Health (ICF) to formally relate product function and user
functional limitation thus integrating engineering and health communities in the
context of product design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research
will transform engineering design practice by creating knowledge and methods
that will fundamentally shift the philosophical context of inclusive design.
Rather than attempt to design an entire product for a typical, fully able user,
a user with a disability, or both, it will intelligently identify the base
platform that satisfies all users? needed functionality and the differentiating
modules that address specific needs. Core integrated research activities include
working directly with persons with disabilities to design new products. These
activities include undergraduate students as well, thus these students will gain
exposure to the ?human quality of life improvement? aspect of engineering often
not emphasized in the typical undergraduate curriculum.
