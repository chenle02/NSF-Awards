Construction management is a relatively new undergraduate discipline with roots
in Civil Engineering. The emphasis is in teaching skills necessary to organize,
direct and control the construction process. With construction automation
becoming increasingly important in the industry, it is equally important that
undergraduates be given training in computer applications to construction. The
two areas emphasized in this project, construction cost estimating and project
scheduling and controls, are ideal for computer automation. The project expands
the laboratory to provide twenty workstations equipped with microcomputers and
software for estimating and scheduling. In addition, the laboratory has two
plotters for printing schedule "networks" and five digitizers for doing
earthwork, roadway, and underground quantity take- offs. The assignments
emphasize a "hands-on" approach with students using actual construction
blueprints from major jobs to do cost estimating and scheduling of real-life
projects. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
