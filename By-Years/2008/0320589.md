0320589&lt;br/&gt;Carlson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grants provide support for
acquisition of a state-of-the-art thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) to
be used for isotopic research in the earth and planetary sciences at Carnegie's
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM). The new instrument will supercede an
18-yr old VG-354 that is still functioning but lacks the capability for the
highest precision measurement of a number of radiogenic isotopes of interest for
geochemical research (e.g. Os, Nd, Sr). The new TIMS will complement two multi-
collector ICP-MS instruments at DTM that are employed in a multitude of
geochemical research projects requiring high precision trace element and
isotopic data. The new TIMS will be used for isotopic research on the early
evolution of the solid earth, timing of core formation, studies in mantle
chemical dynamics and igneous petrogenesis. The instrument will also serve to
train the next generation of instrument-savvy isotope geochemists through the
CIW-DTM postdoc program.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
