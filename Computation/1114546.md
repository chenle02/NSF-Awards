The proposer proposes to develop efficient numerical methods for several
problems in quantum dynamics. Specifically, the following three topics are
selected: Semiclassical methods for quantumscattering, surface hopping, and
Bloch-decomposition based computational methods for quantum dynamics in periodic
lattice. These are challenging computational issues that involve high frequency
waves and quantum-classical coupling. Mathematical and computational methods can
play important roles to enhance our understanding as well as our ability to
simulate these problems.

These problems arise in solid state physics, semiconductor device modeling,
Bose-Eistein Condensations (BEC), solar energy, and functional materials such as
graphane, thus the developed computational methods will have a wide range of
applications, some of which of significant national interests. Some of the
research results will provide excellent additions for future graduate courses in
applied mathematics and scientific computing, thus will help to improve the
graduate curriculum in applied mathematics in order to better train future
graduate students in modern applied mathematics.
