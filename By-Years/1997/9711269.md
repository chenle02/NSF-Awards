This project focuses on the design and implementation of a compiler architecture
for dynamically optimizing stand-alone programs. Dynamic optimization uses run-
time values and invariants to improve code as it executes, yielding performance
superior to that of statically optimal code. Dynamic optimization incurs run-
time overhead: time spent optimizing and compiling code at run time detracts
from any resulting improvement. This overhead will be reduced using a staged
compilation model, which permits static compilation to be suspended after
reaching a high-level, mid-level, or low-level intermediate representation. This
technique supports lightweight optimizations, which are fast but typically yield
minor improvements, as well as heavyweight optimizations, which are time
consuming but often provide substantial performance benefits. The proposed
system will incorporate automatic program analyses and profiling tools to
uncover opportunities for dynamic optimization in ordinary code, and a rich set
of optimization directives will give the programmer fine- grained control over
dynamic optimization when necessary.
