This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the correlation between bound-water dielectric relaxation observed by broadband
permittivity measurement and the degree of hydration in Portland cement, and
apply the results to the refinement of a concrete cure monitoring system under
development at the company. Complex permittivity over the frequency range 10 kHz
to 10 GHz in curing cement shows signal components due to 1) free-water behavior
near 10 GHz which decreases during cure and follows percent hydration, and 2)
bound-water behavior between 1-1000 MHz which increases during early hours of
cure and decreases and broadens thereafter. The bound-water relaxation does not
appear in the initial cement paste but does appear after several hours of cure,
mirroring the formation of hydration products to which it is attaching. This
behavior will be elucidated by varying initial chemistry and determining effects
on signal, quantifying changes in relaxation frequency and amplitude with cure
time and fitting to appropriate models.

The commercial potential of this project is in the construction industry.
