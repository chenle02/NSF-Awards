9417862 Romanowicz This research is to conduct two studies which address
geophysically important questions pertaining to the very deep structure of the
earth, the core-mantle boundary and inner core, using diffracted S waves on the
core-mantle boundary on the one hand, and a combination of body-wave data and
free-oscillation data sensitive to inner core structure, on the other. The first
is a systematic study of diffracted SV deep into the seismic shadow of the
earth's core, especially at epicentral distances in excess of 107 degrees. This
analysis should provide a substantial and new contribution to the study of
lateral heterogeneity at the core-mantle boundary, so important to the
understanding of core and mantle geodynamics. The second study addresses the
important question of inner core anisotropy, and, more specifically the issue of
reconciling PKP travel time and normal mode splitting data, both in terms of
depth dependence of anisotropy and its proposed cylindrical symmetry around the
earth's rotation axis. This study is relevant to the question of the
compositional and physical nature of the inner core, its dynamics as well as its
relation with processes in the outer core. *** ??
