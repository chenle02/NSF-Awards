This proposal involves a three-part investigation of the behavior of platinum
group elements (PGE's) in magmatic and hydrothermal environments: (1) the
distribution of selected elements will be measured between sulfide globules and
coexisting glass (=quenched liquid) in submarine basalts to evaluate mineral-
melt partitioning effects; (2) Os isotopic data will be used to evaluate the
extent of open-system behavior following emplacement of two PGE-bearing
ultramafic intrusions - this study will assess the importance of hydrothermal
processes in redistributing PGE's; (3) Detailed petrographic and mineralogic
studies will be carried out on one PGE-bearing body to determine why PGE
mineralogy varies systematically within this body.
