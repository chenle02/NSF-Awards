Assembly of biomolecules on a targeted surface in aqueous environment is
critically important in many applications, such as targeted drug delivery,
biosensing and nanofabrication. The whole process is governed by events
occurring in multiple length and time scales, and is dictated by a wide range of
variables such as electric field, pH value, heat and fluid flow, as well as the
molecular scale entropy changes due to structural rearrangements and charge
group redistributions. Limited knowledge about the communications among
different scales represents the bottleneck in successful design of many
applications. The objective of this award is to develop an integrated multiscale
model for the process of biomolecular assembly on a targeted surface. The model
will account for the molecular scale details through free energy calculations
and the effects from the continuum scale variables through hydrodynamics and
electrokinetic calculations. The model will allow the PI to investigate and
delineate the effects from a broad range of experimentally controllable
parameters across different scales. Predictions from the model will guide active
design and optimization of many biomedical and engineering processes.

Biomolecular assembly on a targeted surface has broad impacts on a variety of
disciplines related to bio/nanotechnology, such as surface science, biomedicine,
targeted drug delivery, biomolecular reorganization, contrast-based imaging,
nanofabrication and environmental sciences. The results from this research will
contribute by improving our fundamental understanding of the process from a
multiscale perspective. The predictions from the multiscale model will lead
directly to accurate and efficient strategies for procedures involving
biomolecular assembly. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this
research will have opportunities to receive a unique interdisciplinary training
across the mechanical engineering and bioengineering, learn the cutting-edge
multiscale numerical modeling techniques, which enable them to become leaders in
this field.
