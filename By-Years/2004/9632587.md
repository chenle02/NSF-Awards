** 9632587 Erten This STTR Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a
novel architecture integrating light sensing and image processing functions on
the same chip. Specific image patterns can be learned by the proposed circuits
within microseconds. This information is stored in the synaptic connections on-
chip and can be recalled at later processing steps - even from incomplete or
noisy data. The proposed system will be a co-processor by design. The intent is
to assure not only compatibility but also high performance within a conventional
computer architecture framework. Commercially-available microprocessors and
digital signal processors can thus be used to add on symbolic data manipulation
capability for comprehensive systems. The work involves investigation of a
locally connected neural architecture pioneered at the research institution and
experimentation with prototype chips with on-chip CMOS light sensing diodes.
This broad scope of investigations will allow for a better understanding of the
issues involved towards a successful Phase II prototype. ***
