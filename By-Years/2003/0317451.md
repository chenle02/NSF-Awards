This project will develop a new fabrication method for non-neutral plasma traps,
and use the traps to study trap geometries that are compatible with neutral atom
traps. The new traps will be used to study the physics of high order multipole
fields and other issues associated with combined neutral and charged particle
traps, and also studies the physics of fast magnetic perturbations. The results
of this research will be of great interest to the anti-matter community and the
designs developed here may be incorporated into the next generation of anti-
hydrogen traps.
