0106557 &lt;br/&gt;Yoshinobu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rates of processes control a
wide variety of geologic phenomena. With the development of more precise and
refined radiometric age dating techniques, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that processes in magmatic arcs such as magma generation and ascent may occur at
relatively fast rates and over a wide range of durations. In contrast, existing
data sets for regional deformation suggest that rates of various processes such
as faulting, shearing, and folding are several orders of magnitude slower than
rates of magma generation, migration, and emplacement. This research is
utilizing field, microstructural, and experimental rock deformation data sets to
address the following questions: (1) What micro- and macro-scale deformation
mechanisms accommodate deformation in contact aureoles? (2) What are the
magnitudes of stress in the host rocks during plastic deformation associated
with chamber construction? (3) What are the host rock strain rates during
plastic deformation associated with chamber construction? And (4) What are
"typical" viscosities in contact aureoles? Detailed mapping and microstructural
analysis conducted on two pluton-host rock systems, exposed in the Clark
Mountains of eastern California, as well as application of experimentally-
derived flow laws and paleo-piezometers (paleo-stress gauges) to deformed
contact aureole rocks are currently being carried out to evaluate these
questions and provide constraints on contact aureole stresses, strain rates and
viscosities.&lt;br/&gt;
