The PI proposes to study the use of a magnetically stabilized fluidized bed
(MSFB) to alleviate problems associated with the separation and purification of
biochemicals obtained from fermentation broths and similar feed streams. To
develop this continuous separation process, the PI plans to focus on two major
objectives: - To gain an understanding of the behavior of a mixture of magnetic
and nonmagnetic support materials in a liquid fluidized bed under an applied
magnetic field. - To develop a new mode of using these liquid MSFBs as a
counter-current contractor for protein purification. By using two materials in a
MSFB, one can possibly eliminate the need to develop a new magnetic support
material for each new biochemical separation to be performed. This proposal was
considered by the Review Panel to be highly innovative and recommended funding
for one year in accordance with the first year budget submitted with the
proposal. The PI is considered to be well qualified to carry out the proposed
research and I recommend funding in accordance with the Panel recommendation.
