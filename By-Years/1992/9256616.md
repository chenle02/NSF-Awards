This award to a group of 21 faculty from the Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology will fund
positions for 5 graduate students in a training program that emphasizes the
related areas of conservation biology, organismic and molecular systematics and
evolution, ecology and evolution of functional diversity, and population
dynamics and community ecology. Besides existing activities, the training
program will include a new lecture course in Conservation Biology and a new
graduate seminar in Biodiversity. The faculty's strength lies in areas of
tropical biology with emphasis on plants and arthropods. Training of some
students will include a new program of internships at the Costa Rican National
Biodiversity Institute (INBio). The award includes some funds to be used for
student recruiting, seminars, and research expenses of NSF-supported trainees.
