&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (CUAS) will
investigate and develop new algorithms, architectures, and operational
procedures for unmanned aircraft systems. Brigham Young University (BYU) and the
University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) are collaborating to establish the
proposed center, with BYU as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since
the development of UAS is critical to national security CUAS aims to be the
focal point for storing and disseminating information about UAS of all sizes,
from micro to large. The proposed Center has identified some of the challenges
to overcome in order to establish UAS dominance in the US. The research led by
the Center will lead to new concepts, technologies, insights, and tools for UAS.
BYU and UCB plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with
prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center?s
organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest
relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the Center include
curriculum design, community outreach and training the next generation of UAS
researchers. BYU and UCB will work with industry and government sponsors to
provide opportunities to students to work on high-impact, cutting-edge research.
The Center also plans to attract women and under-represented minority groups as
students in the Center.
