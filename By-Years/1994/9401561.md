9401561 Andrei Technical abstract: Electrons on a helium substrate form a two
dimensional electron system. This system will be investigated in a region of the
phase diagram where correlations between electrons determine the in-plane and
out-of-plane dynamics. The experiments focus on (a) the phase boundary of the
electron crystal and how it is affected by screening; (b) the interplay between
the electron crystal and Landau quantization in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field; (c) the effects of crystal correlations on tunneling; (d) the
effect of the Landau quantization on magneto-tunneling rates. Non-technical
abstract: Electrons captured on a thin layer of helium at very low temperatures
form a two dimensional system which can serve as a prototype system for the
study of electron states in more conventional states of condensed matter. The
key task required for realizing a case in which very many electrons are
clustered on the helium film is to reduce significantly the impurities and
roughness of the underlying solid on which the helium film is deposited. This
project will focus on utilizing ultra clean and ultra smooth solid substrates in
order to achieve such a high density of electrons which has not been previously
achieved. This high electron density will allow search of as yet undiscovered
effects which will be important to the electron on helium problem in particular,
but also to other two dimensional electron systems in general. ***
