Recently, planets and brown dwarfs (objects intermediate in size between planets
and stars) have been discovered around very old stars that have ejected most of
their material, leaving a small hot star known as a "subdwarf B" (sdB). Prior to
ejecting material, the sdB stars were large red giant stars. Thus, their planets
and brown dwarfs must have been engulfed as the red giant star expanded. The PI
plans to use small telescopes to search for more of these sdB stars and
determine whether they have companion planets or brown dwarfs. He will determine
the masses of the stars and their companions, and compare the new data set with
theories for how stars change near the end of their lifetimes. He will establish
an integrated research and education program that will, first, teach university
students to observe with robotic telescopes. The students will then teach high
school teachers and students to use the telescopes to discover and analyze sdB
stars. This will strengthen the students' interest and active participation in
STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the companion masses in a large
number of post-common envelope sdB binaries will provide the first robust tests
of models involving red giant-engulfed companion interactions. The lower mass
limits resulting from this work will help constrain model parameters relating to
tidal effects and angular momentum conservation. Determination of orbital
periods, eccentricities, and component masses will provide constraints on hot
subdwarf formation models and improve understanding of this stage of stellar
evolution. The PI, through collaborations with other astronomers, has access to
Evryscope data, SKYNET, and the SOAR/Goodman
telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
