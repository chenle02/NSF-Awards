This award supports a planning visit by Dr. Ahmed ElHefnawy, of the Department
of Systems and Biomedical Engineering at the Cairo University in Egypt, to visit
Case Western Reserve University to meet with Dr. Gerald Saidel, of the
Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Dr. Henri Brunengraber, Department of
Nutrition. The purpose of the visit is to develop a collaborative research
activity to use modeling and experiments with stable isotopes to analyze
cellular metabolic processes. The research is in the emerging field of metabolic
engineering, and the results of the proposed collaborative research project are
expected to yield quantitative information about key metabolic pathways.
