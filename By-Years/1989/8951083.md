The development of a new technology, Global Positioning Systems, has begun
considerable change in the surveying industry. GPS changes the nature of both
field surveying and the surveyor's data. The addition of Global Positioning
Receivers and the related computer software to the laboratory instrumentation
available allows undergraduate students to understand and use this new
technology. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match
for the NSF award.
