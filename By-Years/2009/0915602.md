Scientific communities continually struggle to overcoming the challenges arising
from interdisciplinary interaction. At this time, interdisciplinarity is at an
important juncture: scientists and funding agencies are recognizing and
promoting more interdisciplinary collaboration; technologies are enabling far
greater and dispersed interdisciplinary interactions; and many are convinced
that interdisciplinarity is a key to scientific breakthroughs in a number of
arenas. This workshop will provide a forum for discussion of interdisciplinary
research in the context of team science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning from
what is known from research on teams of all sorts, the workshop will lay the
foundation for exploring the team-based processes required for innovative
solutions to highly complex scientific problems that cross disciplinary
boundaries. The outcomes will include an assessment of the current state of the
art for team science and assessments about what are the most promising and
important directions for social scientists to pursue in order to advance the
state of the art. Further, the products of the workshop will be useful to those
who currently seek to mine social science knowledge in order to practice
evidence-based management of team science. &lt;br/&gt;
