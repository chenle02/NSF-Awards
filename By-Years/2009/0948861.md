This award will support the travel expenses of an American delegation to attend
the XVI Mechanics of Composite Materials (MCM) Conference in Riga, Latvia on May
24-28, 2010. The MCM conference, organized by several organizations in Latvia,
is the premier international conference series on structural composites held in
the eastern European region. The goal of this travel support is to enable the
participation of a diverse group US delegates who will present papers and
interact with a group of composites researchers not often seen at conferences
outside the eastern European region, thereby facilitating the communication of
new ideas and opportunities in both directions.
