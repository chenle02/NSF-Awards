This project provides a laboratory to accompany a two semester course in
Electromagnetics. This course, in general, is highly mathematical and abstract.
Students are required to mathematically generate and analyze electromagnetic
fields. The laboratory will allow the students to use dedicated experimental
setups and instrumentation to analyze electromagnetic fields and related
phenomena and compare with mathematical models. Undergraduate students will
experience the complete cycle of design, fabrication, and measurement of
microwave instruments through computer aided data acquisition. The development
and improvement project utilizes state-of-the- art microwave measurement and
signal generation equipment for the observation and analysis of various aspects
and applications of electromagnetic fields. The goal is to give the seniors a
hands-on experience with different concepts of microwaves and electromagnetic
fields and the project corrects a serious deficiency in the laboratory hardware.
