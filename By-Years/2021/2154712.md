Ergodic theory studies long-term behavior in dynamical systems from a
statistical point of view. It is a large and rapidly developing area of
mathematics, which has a profound impact on the development of additive
combinatorics, number theory, and Fourier analysis, among other fields. The
primary focus of this project is on understanding phenomena of norm and
pointwise convergence for multiple polynomial ergodic averages that naturally
arise at the interface of analysis and ergodic theory. A broad class of
questions in additive combinatorics will also be investigated. Throughout the
duration of the research program, the project will contribute to the training of
undergraduate and graduate students and of postdoctoral fellows. The PI will
also promote mathematics to the broader community and encourage the
participation of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major
open problems in pointwise ergodic theory is the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman
conjecture, which asserts that the multiple polynomial ergodic averages converge
pointwise almost everywhere. The PI will develop tools in Fourier analysis and
additive combinatorics allowing to study pointwise convergence for multiple
polynomial ergodic averages corresponding to polynomials with distinct degrees.
In addition, the PI will investigate polynomial Szemeredi's type theorems in
topological fields and multidimensional integer grids. At the heart of these
investigations are the so-called inverse theorems from higher order Fourier
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
