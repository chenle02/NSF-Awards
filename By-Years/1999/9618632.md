The objective of this work is to develop a real-time leaf thickness sensor and
test it in the field. The sensor will be based on strain gauges and will be
small enough to rest on a leaf. The sensor will be constructed from strain
gauges attached to a strip of material that is flexed via attachments to a leaf.
Materials (crystal, glass, or metal) for the sensor will be tested in the
laboratory for sensitivity and thermal effects. Field experiments will be done
to document the sensor's ability to measure leaf thickness in response to
diurnal variation in hydration state. The significance of the research will be
the development of a leaf thickness sensor for use under field conditions. This
will be a new sensor that will yield new knowledge. It will find use as an
indicator of plant water status. In addition it will be a sensor to document
leaf development dynamics and the effect of stressors on leaf status. It will
find application in agriculture as a sensor for automated control of growth
conditions. Finally, it will find general use where variation in the thickness
of thin sheets needs to be measured continuously.
