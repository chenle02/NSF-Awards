While quantum mechanics was originally developed to describe the realm of the
very small, it has become increasingly clear over the past decades that quantum
theory is at bottom a theory of information. This realization opens the door for
a more complete understanding of both quantum theory and information theory.
Asking how to best store, transmit, and process information allows the
identification of key features of quantum theory and enables the identification
of the fundamental limits applying to all information
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to identify, quantify, and
ultimately understand the fundamental resources in quantum information theory.
It studies optimal interconversion rates of noisy resources, such as quantum
communication links and noisy quantum states. Understanding how such noisy
resources can be combined to generate quantum synergies is a key challenge to be
tackled, as is identifying potential application of such synergies. Just as
crucially, determining when such synergies (aka non-additivities) are ruled out
is a key challenge to be tackled: This project seeks to determine which
resources are additive, and how they can be quantified. Finally, the project
seeks to use techniques developed to address additivity and non-additivity to
build bridges between quantum information theory and computational complexity
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by the PI together
with a graduate student, who will learn methods and ideas from physics,
information theory, theoretical computer science, and mathematics.
