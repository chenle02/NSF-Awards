Proposal #DMS-9704548 Studies in Efficient Design of Experiments Ching-Shui
Cheng University of California ABSTRACT This research involves several problems
in experimental design. Optimal blocking of fractional factorial designs is
studied. Blocking is an effective method for improving the efficiency of an
experiment by grouping the experimental units into more homogeneous blocks. How
to choose a fractional factorial design and a blocking scheme simultaneously in
an optimal way is of interest to both theoreticians and practitioners. A new
criterion for choosing good blocking schemes by examining the alias patterns of
the interactions is formulated. Methods of constructing optimal and efficient
designs under this criterion are investigated. Some unsolved problems in the
unblocked case are also studied. Another area of research is the projection
properties of orthogonal arrays. In factor screening, often only a few factors
among a large pool of potential factors are active. Under such assumption of
effect sparsity, it is important to consider projections onto small subsets of
factors. An extensive study of the projection properties of orthogonal arrays is
carried out. Connections with search designs are also explored. In addition to
factorial designs, optimal and efficient regression designs under random block-
effects models are studied by adopting the approach of approximate theory.
Experimental design is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and
industrial investigations. In industrial experiments, often a large number of
factors have to be studied, but the experiments are expensive to conduct. In
this case, the so called fractional factorial designs in which only a small
fraction of all the possible combinations are observed are particularly useful.
In recent years, factorial designs have received considerable attention, mainly
due to the Japanese success in applying them to improve quality and productivity
in industrial manufa cturing. One objective of this research is to study the
construction of efficient designs to extract more information, especially when
systematic sources of variation (such as heterogeneity of experimental material
or day-to-day environmental variations) need to be eliminated to improve the
precision. Since often only a few of the many potential factors are actually
important, this research also looks into the properties of some commonly used
designs when only a small number of factors are active. Another research
involves a problem arising from a recent optometry experiment, which also has
industrial applications.
