This project involves experimental studies of possible mechanisms for the
geochemical origin of RNA precursors. Derivatives of hydrogen cyanide form the
bases of RNA, whose origin is extrapolated to -4.3 billion years. Several
investigations have shown pathways for purine and pyrimidine synthesis, which
are viable, but only at relatively high reactant concentration in aqueous
solution. A crucial problem in applying these results to prebiotic molecular
evolution concerns the selective concentration of the reactants from the dilute
solution in which they probably existed. High concentrations must have been
consistly maintained in order to permit reactions leading to cyanide oligomers
and to the ordered heteropolymers that would have served as forerunners for RNA.
Current experiments indicate that common transition element minerals under
appropriate environmental modeling conditions are capable of photosynthesis of
carboxylates, sorption of cyanide against large concentration gradients, and
immobilization of the polymeric reaction products. The proposed studies involve
concentration of cyanide from extreme dilution by sorption and intercalation in
surface active transition element minerals, followed by spontaneous or
photochemically induced oligomerization and condensation reactions to form
potential mineral-organic hybrid precursors of the genome.
