Abstract 9713857 J. Hoyt A flow tracer suitable for turbulent flow visualization
has been developed and tested by the P.I. for two-dimensional flows. The tracer,
composed of shear-thickening and high extensional viscosity fluids, does not
diffuse when the flow becomes turbulent like the previously used tracers do. The
extension of the visualization method to three-dimensional flows, with
application to coherent structures in turbulent boundary layer, is proposed. The
new approach provides simultaneous viewing the flow three directions (called
3-D+), that allows for easier identification of the flow structures as projected
on three different planes (side, top, and frontal to the flow direction). The
preliminary results on "horseshoe" vortices and large organized structures are
very promising. The experimental work will be performed in collaboration with
Prof. R.H.J. Sellin of the University of Bristol, where experimental facilities
are prepared. The method is expected to provide new insights into understanding
and modeling of the spatial turbulent structures, including shear flows and wake
flows. The application of the technique to other complex flow, such as
dispersion flows, sediment transport, turbomachinery, and for educational
purposes also is envisaged. ***
