The research is intended to provide new connections between two areas of
mathematics, probability and functional analysis. One of the main objects of
investigation is a random matrix, a large rectangular array of random data. The
PI strives to understand the properties of such arrays which hold with high
probability and the dependence of those properties on the nature of random
entries and the structure of the matrix. This study will have potential
applications beyond the realm of pure mathematics, as random matrices are used
in statistics, computer algorithms, and wireless communication. Another
direction of the proposed research is the study of high dimensional convex sets
with the emphasis on their complexity and approximation. This research will also
have computer science applications including rate estimates for various high-
dimensional algorithms.

One of the main directions of this research is the non-asymptotic theory of
random matrices, a new and rapidly developing area of research analyzing
spectral characteristics of a random matrix of a large but fixed size and
striving to obtain bounds valid with high probability. The PI intends to study
singular values, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of different ensembles of random
matrices of a large size. The results obtained in this direction would have
important applications within the random matrix theory in proving limit laws for
the spectral characteristics of random matrices. Another group of problems comes
from geometric functional analysis, an area of mathematics concerned with the
study of high-dimensional convex bodies and normed spaces. A progress in this
direction would lead to better understanding of the structure of sections and
projections of such bodies, as well as possibility of approximation of a general
convex body by a body with certain nice properties. Both directions have a
significant component related to the theoretical computer science.
