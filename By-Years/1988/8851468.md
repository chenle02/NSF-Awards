This project involves the establishment of a simulated factory as a laboratory
for automation and robotics. This automated factory simulation would involve
industrial robots in an actual manufacturing production environment wherein the
complex interrelationships between pieces of automated equipment on a factory
floor could be taught. The equipment required includes industrial robots and
robot trainers to be used as lab equipment on the production floor of the
factory. This equipment will be integrated with existing robotic equipment to
produce a unique laboratory for undergraduate students. As a result of this lab,
students will learn not only the discrete and specialized tasks of different
types of automation systems, but also how those different systems fit together
in a computer-integrated manufacturing environment.
