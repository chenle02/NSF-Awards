In traditional theoretical computer science (TCS), computational agents are
typically assumed either to be obedient, i.e., to follow the prescribed
algorithm, or to be adversaries who ``play against'' each other. On the other
hand, the strategic agents in game theory are neither obedient nor adversarial.
Although one cannot assume that they will follow the prescribed algorithm, one
can assume that they will respond to incentives. Thus, the economics literature
traditionally stressed incentives and downplayed computational complexity, and
the TCS literature traditionally did the opposite. The emergence of the Internet
as a standard platform for distributed computation has radically changed this
state of affairs: Ownership, operation, and use by many self-interested,
independent parties give the Internet the&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of an
economy as well as those of a computer.&lt;br/&gt;The emerging discipline of
Distributed Algorithmic Mechanism Design (DAMD)lies in the intersection of TCS,
economics, and networking. This project addresses the economic and computational
foundations of DAMD. Fundamental problems addressed include but are not limited
to notions of inherent tractability or intractability of DAMD problems, methods
of approximation for DAMD problems found to be inherently intractable, and the
extent to which agent privacy can be maintained in distributed algorithmic
mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;
