9454406 Rosenstein LEADERSHIP PROGRAM IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS -- PHASE III
Rutgers University, in cooperation with school district partners, develops a
leadership cadre of teachers who are knowledgeable about concepts of discrete
mathematics, who incorporate discrete mathematics into their classrooms and
curricula, and who share their expertise and experiences with colleagues. The
five-year, principally regional (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA) project
builds on a solid base of earlier NSF-supported projects and targets directly
660 teachers of mathematics in grades K-8. Each participant attends a two-week
summer institute, four follow-up sessions during the subsequent school year, and
a one-week institute during the following summer. Institutes are in both
residential and commuter formats. Participants at all grade levels in the
program are introduced to the same topics in discrete mathematics and learn how
these topics can be utilized at all grade levels. In addition to their
participation in all sessions of the summer institutes and academic-year follow-
up sessions, program participants are expected to use institute materials and
activities in their classrooms, provide workshops on these materials and
activities for their colleagues, and work to change their school's and
district's curriculum to include the materials and activities. Project
evaluation includes assessment of progress in achieving project goals,
objectives, strategies, and timelines; evidence of continued refinement of
curricular/instructional materials for teachers and of curricular sequencing for
students; and evidence of effective integration of discrete mathematics topics
into actual classroom use by teachers in all grade levels of K-8. Cost-sharing
from DIMACS/Rutgers University and from partner school districts represents 39%
of the NSF award amount.
