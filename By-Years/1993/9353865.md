9353865 Pallrand Rutgers University seeks to provide a four-week, summer
commuter, Young Scholrs program with follow-up activities during the academic
year for 24 students entering grade 11. Students will participitate in hands-on
laboratory activities, field trips, and classroom discussions and lectures in
the biological sciences. An important feature of the program is the opportunity
afforded to students to work in the Waksman Institute with university scientists
on a basic research project that is intellectually challenging and one that is
not ordinarily a part of the school curriculum. By working directly with
scientists, students will idtntify their efforts with those of the community of
scientists.
