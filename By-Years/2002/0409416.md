OISE-0409416&lt;br/&gt; Kusky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop proposal
to provide funds for Dr. Timothy Kusky, Saint Louis University and six other
U.S. scientists to participate in a planning meeting and field sampling to the
North China Craton. This activity will also provide opportunities for the U.S.
scientists to prepare a proposal to study 3.8 billion years of lithospheric
evolution. The workshop will be co-hosted with Beijing University. This project
is jointly supported by the NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of
China.&lt;br/&gt;
