In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Levis of the Chemistry
Department at Temple University seeks to understand the processes that occur
when polyatomic molecules are subjected to laser fields on the order of the
fields binding electrons to nuclei. In this laser intensity regime, the molecule
can be reprogrammed to drive desired physical and chemical processes including
coherent rotational and vibrational motion, chemical reaction and non-resonant
vaporization. This research seeks to understand strong field control mechanisms
through experimental and theoretical investigations. Students and postdoctoral
associates are trained in experiment (lasers and ultrafast optics) and theory
and as such, represent an important national resource for high technology
science and innovation.

This research is leading to advances for biomedical diagnostics and
therapeutics, macromolecule synthesis, nanomaterials synthesis, molecular
electronics, and chemical/biological sensors. The findings of strong field
chemical research have been leveraged to develop new chemical agent detection
systems using adaptive strong field mass spectrometry, to develop new sensing
paradigms, and to develop highly sensitive molecular monitors for stand off
detection using laser filament-based methods.
