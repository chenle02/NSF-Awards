This award will provide funds to a group of six scientists who direct
microchemical facilities that serve large numbers of investigators at their own
and other institutions. The funds will be used to obtain and distribute a
synthetic peptide useful for measuring the sensitivity and accuracy of protein
sequencing procedures at these and many similar facilities, and to increase
cooperation and contact between such facilities. The overall aim of the project
is to increase the quality of service provided by the facilities. The use of
microchemical techniques for the sequencing and synthesis of protein and DNA now
occupies an important role in modern biology. Because of the substantial
investment in equipment and personnel required, such work is most often
performed in central facilities that serve a large group of investigators. There
are now nearly a hundred such facilities in the U.S. This award will help insure
that the service provided by each is of a uniform high quality and is consistent
with the state of the art in protein sequencing.
