9618125 Wolfe This project will compare seismic structure at two major hotspots
located in contrasting environments; Iceland, a mid-ocean ridge hotspot located
on young, thin lithosphere and Hawaii, an intraplate hotspot located on old
lithosphere. Regional and teleseismic earthquake data will be used to
investigate the effects of hotspot upwellings on lithospheric structure and
asthenospheric flow.
