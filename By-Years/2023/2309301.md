This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it
addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. The
2015 Nobel prize-winning observation of gravitational waves from a binary black
hole merger by the LIGO detectors unveiled an entirely new window to the
universe. This was followed up by the groundbreaking observations of binary
neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers. One of the key goals of
gravitational wave astronomy is to test Einsteinâ€™s general relativity under the
extreme conditions of these mergers, where new physics like quantum gravity
effects can become important. The main objective of this project is to develop
novel numerical simulations and data-driven models that are critical for
conducting these tests and help maximize the scientific impact of gravitational
wave observations. This project includes support for students as well as
outreach components at local schools and observatories, thereby contributing
directly to mentorship, recruitment, and retention in an emerging STEM area. The
computational skills gained by the students are applicable in broader areas like
data science and machine learning, preparing them for a wide range of successful
careers in academia and industry.

This award is about the development of numerical simulations and models that
predict the gravitational wave signals from black hole-neutron star and binary
neutron star mergers, both in general relativity and alternative theories. As
our gravitational wave detectors continue to improve, there is a need to improve
our gravitational wave models that are used to compare against the observed data
and to test general relativity in the strong field regime. This research
addresses this pressing need by conducting novel numerical simulations of black
hole-neutron star and binary neutron star mergers in general relativity as well
as alternative theories like scalar-tensor gravity. This is followed by the
construction of data-driven surrogate models that accurately reproduce the
gravitational wave signal from the simulations. Such simulations and models are
critical for reliably extracting the astrophysical source properties and testing
general relativity using these observations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
