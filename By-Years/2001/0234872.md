With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University will upgrade a X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detection and low temperature capabilities for small
molecule diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: a) understanding coordination polymers,
particularly for bimetallic systems; b) the ring-juncture geometry in
stereoselective cyclizations of nitrile anions; and c) characterization of
intermediates in the oxygen-atom transfer reaction catalyzed by molybdenum
enzymes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including materials
chemistry and the preparation of more efficient catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;
