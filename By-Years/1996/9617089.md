Proposal Number: ECS-9617089 Principal Investigator: Christopher Clayton Title:
Beam-Plasma Experiments with Picosecond Relativistic Electron Bunches This
research will utilize very recent advances in photoinjector electron source
development to study ultrafast relativistic electron bunch/ plasma interactions
in previously inaccessible regimes. A laser-driven photocathode in combination
with a high-gradient, radio frequency (RF) accelerator is used to produce an
ultrashort (4 picoseconds), high current (Ipeak > 1 kAmp), relativistic (g > 20
which g is the relativistic Lorentz factor) intense electron bunch, which then
interacts with a pre-formed discharge plasma. Previous experiments have been
limited to electron beam bunches of tens of nanoseconds and energies of less
than 1 MeV. The research will focus on two applications: (1) focusing of a
relativistic electron beam by an underdense plasma lens and (2) excitation of
plasma wakefields for particle acceleration. Graduate and undergraduate student
involvement is explicitly planned and will provide valuable training for
students in fast optics, high power optics, plasma physics and beam physics.
