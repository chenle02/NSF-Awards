The research is directed toward understanding the effects of electron
correlation on photoionization, photodetachment and electron scattering. A
variety of approaches are used, close-coupling, R-matrix theory and the random
phase approximation. Part of the research is dedicated to understanding these
processes when atoms are confined such as atoms trapped in fullerenes.
