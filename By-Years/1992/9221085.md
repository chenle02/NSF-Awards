This work focuses on the protein/protein and DNA protein interactions that are
required for regulation of colanic acid polysaccharide capsule expression in
Escherichia coli. These interactions are incorporated into a model that will be
tested. The first two sections of this work examine the protein/protein
interactions of three of the capsule synthesis regulators: Rcs, RcsB, and RcsC.
These interactions will be examined by genetic and biochemical analyses. The
third section is designed to elucidate the protein/DNA interactions that are
required at the promoter of the capsule genes. Molecular genetic methods will be
used for these studies. %%% Polysaccharide capsules are often expressed only
under certain adverse conditions which allows the bacteria producing them to
survive better in a natural environment. Because the synthesis levels of
capsules vary with the environment, it is important to understand how their
regulatory networks control capsule production. The regulatory network for
colanic acid is a model for the control of synthesis of several other capsule
regulatory networks will lead to a greater understanding of how the environment
affects the production of these survival factors.
