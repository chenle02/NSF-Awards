9315778 Kodama Recent paleomagnetic studies have indicated that sediment
compaction may result in inclination shallowing. As paleomagnetic inclination is
used to determine paleolatitude, unrecognized compaction-caused inclination
shallowing would result in under estimation of paleolatitude. This study will
involve rock magnetic, paleomagnetic and experimental compaction work to
determine a method of recognizing and correcting for compaction- caused
inclination shallowing in sediments and sedimentary rocks. Results will be
applicable to platetectonic reconstructions in which paleomagnetic inclinations
from sediments are used.
