This award supports the Moab Topology Conference, which will be held May 1-3,
2023 at Utah State University's Regional Campus in Moab, Utah. The goal of the
conference is to integrate research and education between students and
established researchers in the field of topology. Topology is a fundamental
field in mathematics with well-forged connections to many scientific fields,
including physics, engineering, and data science. The organizers will achieve
this goal by planning a mix of expository, research, and student talks together
with informal discussion sessions and a career development panel. Speakers and
participants will represent a diverse range of institutions, geographic regions,
and career stages.

The conference will focus on recent developments in various subfields of
geometric and quantum topology and their related representation theory. The
plenary speakers are Thang Le (Georgia Institute of Technology, quantum groups
in low dimensional topology), Ina Petkova (Dartmouth College, Heegaard Floer
homology), and Lisa Piccirillo (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, topology
of 3- and 4-manifolds). Each plenary speaker will deliver one introductory
lecture and one research lecture. The remaining talks will be delivered by
early-career mathematicians, including graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows. The conference website is https://www.usu.edu/math/geer/conference2023/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
