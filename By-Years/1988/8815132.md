The California Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) consists
of the first large telescope designed specifically for submillimeter wavelength
astronomy. It is the only U.S. supported submillimeter-wave telescope. With
excellent sensitivity for both continuum and spectroscopic observations and with
angular resolutions between 30 and 8 seconds of arc, innovative projects can be
undertaken to provide critical new information in many fields of astronomy,
including studies of the Solar System, our Galaxy, and extragalactic phenomena.
This grant will support a multifaceted scientific research and technology
development program focussed on the 10.4 meter diameter telescope of the CSO.
The telescope is sited at an altitude of 4100 meters on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, where
the atmosphere is very dry and ideal for observations at wavelengths as short as
320 microns. During the grant period, receivers should become available for
observations over the wavelength range of 1 mm to 350 microns. One half of the
observing time is available for use by the national astronomy community.
