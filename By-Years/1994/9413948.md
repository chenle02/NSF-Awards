9413948 Hollebeek This award is to a consortium group from The University of
Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, and the University of Illinois at
Chicago. The consortium is proposing to develop a scalable, wide area high
performance meta-computer for problems which require numerically intensive
analysis of large amounts of geographically distributed data. The experimental
facilities will include a high-speed network linking existing parallel computers
and high-performance clusters of workstations at the three institutions. In
addition each institution in the consortium will acquire or upgrade a parallel
machine. Software will be developed to implement the meta-computer concept
whereby an individual using a node at any site will have access to all other
nodes and distributed data as needed, regardless of the location of these
entities. The meta-computer design will be scalable in that additional
distributed nodes can be added at any time. High speed access to the Internet
will link the geographically-distant components, and technologies such as ATM
will provide the local connections. Research and application areas to be
addressed using these facilities include particle physics and condensed matter
physics, imaging and virtual reality, and digital libraries. ***
