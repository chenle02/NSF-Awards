This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project is to develop a
mechanically durable, conformal, super-hydrophobic coating that is applied
through an innovative dry coating process. The nanocomposite coating will be
optimized to improve its mechanical durability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
development of this coating technology could lead to protection of consumer
electronic devices from immersion in fluids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).
