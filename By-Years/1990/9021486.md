Pulling on objects in the world (e.g., opening a door) is a common activity of
daily living that requires people to use their arms effectively, often while
maintaining a standing posture. Such actions, which are readily performed by
adults are deceptively simple. Pulls made while standing actually require a
complex and precise coordination of many muscles and body segment motions for
the person to achieve the focal goal of pulling, and still maintain balance.
Research has shown that postural adjustments (body motions and muscle activity)
accompany pulling movements made by free-standing individuals. However, neither
the precise function of these postural movements nor the neural processes by
which they are coordinated with arm movements are very well understood. This
research program will shed light on how postural adjustments are coordinated
with arm movements. The studies will systematically vary the amount of physical
support and expectancy factors. The effect of these factors on body motion and
balance, on pulling forces, and on muscle activity in the arms and legs will
yield new insights into the functional and neural processes which coordinate
postural adjustments with voluntary pulling movements. This resezrch will
contribute significantly to fundamental knowledge about the control of posture
and movement.
