This workshop is an NSF-initiated planning workshop to determine research
problems in the area of virtual reality that deserve future funding. "Virtual
Reality" is thought by many to be a poor and inaccurate description of an
enormously popular field. It's various descriptions include a set of
capabilities to deliver a tightly coupled, highly interactive, principally 3D
visual experience in which the user has the feeling of being immersed in a 3D
computer-generated environment. Other descriptions describe a mixture of
simulated objects with customary objects, such as images, from real
environments. Even other descriptions include warping of the perceived visual
space and time or emphasize direct manipulation of objects in the virtual
reality or the coordinated experience of two or more persons in a shared
simulation scenario. The main goals of the workshop are to identify the most
important areas of basic research in virtual reality, to determine the
relationship of NSF-funded basic research to other programs, and to produce a
set of recommendations on the infrastructure required for sustained basic
research. The invitational workshop participants represent a balance of
researchers in the area of virtual reality including researchers with NSF grants
and researchers in government and industrial laboratories. The workshop focused
on four research areas: perception, human-machine interaction, hardware, and
applications
