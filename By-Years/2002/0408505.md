Subducted mid-oceanic ridge basalt exists in the Earth's mantle as eclogite, a
rock consisting mostly of the minerals garnet and clinopyroxene. Although both
of these minerals are nominally anhydrous, a small amount of water or hydroxide
has been identified in many eclogites brought to the Earth's surface by volcanic
or tectonic processes. Water has major effects on the physical properties of
minerals. Insight into the mechanisms of its occurrence will improve our
understanding of the transport of water in the Earth's mantle, and cast light on
the kinetics of mantle convection and the 'recycling' of the continental crust.
This project will quantify the mechanisms for water substitution through an
experimental program focused on excess SiO2 and OH contents, especially studying
their correlation with cation vacancy concentrations in clinopyroxene at
pressures of 4-12 GPa and temperatures of 900-1200oC. This work will extend and
refine previous thermobarometric interpretations of eclogites and determine the
upper limit of water solubility. The broader impacts of this work include
education of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced analytical
techniques.
