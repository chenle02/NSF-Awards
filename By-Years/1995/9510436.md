ABSTRACT By interagency agreement the U.S. Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center will
provide the management structure and coordination necessary to establish and
maintain a network of drifting meteorological buoys in the Arctic. The buoys
will be emplaced at a sufficient spatial resolution and longevity to define
surface synoptic scale atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and sea ice
fields. The data will be made available in real time for operational weather
forecasting and will be used by researchers for studying global change in the
climatically-sensitive Arctic. ??
