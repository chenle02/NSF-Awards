(Public Law 111-5).

Dr Chakrabarty and his team will use the Murchison Widefield Array, an
innovative low-frequency radio telescope currently under construction in Western
Australia, to search for transient radio sources. These would include the
coronal (outer) layers of nearby stars; radio-bright jets which develop as
material falls onto neutron stars or black holes; stars exploding at the end of
their lives; and potentially, radio waves from planets orbiting nearby stars.
Initially the team will complete software development for the transient
observing system. Then, areas such as the Galactic Center, regions of the
Galactic plane, and young star clusters will be surveyed. Once the system is
able to capture the radio-transient data, the team will involve astronomers
working at other wavelengths in follow-up observations to understand the nature
of the transient sources.

Work on this project will build capabilities that are needed for the planned
Square Kilometer Array radio telescope project. All those involved will have the
opportunity to participate in programs with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Kavli Institute's Education and Public Outreach office, which
develops after-school science programs.
