The undergraduate chemistry program is being strengthened by the integration of
the use of voltammetry and coulometry in the curriculum. Seven courses (Organic
Chemistry, Qualitative Organic Analysis, Physical Chemistry Lab, Biochemistry,
Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental Analysis and Independent Research) are being
revised to provide students with the opportunity to put electrochemical
principles into practice through "hands-on" experience, both in lab projects and
in independent research. The use of voltammetry and coulometry is complementing
the current chemistry program in which students are using ultraviolet-visible
and infrared spectrophotometers, NMR spectrometers, gas and liquid
chromatography. Thus, integration of electrochemistry in the curriculum is
assuring that students receive a more complete preparation in instrumental
practice. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
