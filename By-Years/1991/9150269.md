Graphing calculators are being introduced in an Intermediate Algebra course
which presents algebra in the integrated context of graphs and functions. A
central component of the course is the use of the calculator in exploratory
laboratory projects. The course will be designed in such a way as to attempt to
increase the number of women and minorities who choose to study precalculus and
calculus.
