The analysis, design, and development of CMOS-based pulse-width modulation (PWM)
integrated circuits (ICs) for power management applications is proposed. This
activity represents a new paradigm for the hardware controllers used in a broad
range of power management applications that include off-line power supplies,
industrial and telecommunication dc-dc converters, and dc-dc converters applied
in desktop and portable computing equipment, and in cellular telephone handsets.
Over a period encompassing the last three decades, analog PWM controllers have
dominated these applications. With the advent of digital CMOS technologies, and
associated design tools, it is now very feasible to supplant the analog
controllers with digital IC controllers that match the former's performance in
all aspects - resolution, speed of response, die size, cost - and offer further
advantages. Advantages will be realized in supporting very low power modes for
battery-powered portable equipment, in efficiency enhancing strategies realized
by on-line tuning of adjustable parameters, and cost savings realized by
reduction of discrete component count. Specifically, compensation components
traditionally used in analog solutions are made obsolete with digital control
technology, and through use of embedded computational power to implement state
and parameter estimation methodologies, the need for hardware sensing components
is also reduced. The project encompasses the study of methodologies for
achieving the goals stated here. Namely, the system and control architectures
needed to achieve these objectives are to be addressed, in conjunction with
design considerations at the silicon hardware level. The research will focus on
examples, taken from a number of representative applications.
