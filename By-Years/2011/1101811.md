The objective of this program is to develop photon-based quantum information
technology for transmitting and processing information in ways not possible
using classical-physics-based techniques. This project is developing a new
technique for quantum frequency translation?a noiseless form of wavelength
conversion operating at the single- or few-photon level, which is important for
several reasons: 1) for interfacing between quantum memory operating at visible
wavelengths and infrared photons for long-distance fiber transmission, 2) for
interfacing between different quantum memories operating at distinct but nearby
wavelengths, and 3) for shifting telecom-band photons into the visible where
higher-efficiency single-photon detectors are available. &lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is in developing four-wave mixing in highly nonlinear optical
fibers as a means to implement dynamic Bragg scattering. Using this new
capability there is a wide range of important processes to pursue
experimentally, including: 1) entanglement swapping in the spectral-temporal
domain; 2) two-color, two-photon interference, 3) spectral-temporal
transformation of single-photon states, 4) spectral-temporal transformation
(including frequency translation) of states other than single-photon states, 5)
spectral-temporal mode filtering and multiplexing of single-photon
states.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in quantum information technology and
developing the technical workforce, as well as educating the general university
student population in communications science. Nonlinear optics offers excellent
opportunities to integrate research with science education, by connecting the
research materials and personnel with course teaching. The PI helped start a new
Science Literacy Program at the University of Oregon, and developed a course
called The Physics Behind the Internet.
