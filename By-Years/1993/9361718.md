9361718 Waters Understanding the behavior on n- and p-type doped cubic boron
nitride (cBN) thin films is important to ability to make electronic devices to
take advantage of the thermal as well as electronic properties of cBN. n- and
p-type doped cN will be grown using atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) in a molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) vacuum chamber. Previously we have been able to achieve BN
films which are highly cubic in nature through the use of an atomic nitrogen
source developed at Ionwerks and an electron beam evaporator for the boron. A
dopant study using mass spectroscopy of recoiled ions (MSRI) technique developed
at Ionwerks and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to understand the various
levels of doping will be performed on the doped cBN samples grown. The various
concentration levels of the corresponding dopants (Be and Mg for p-type; Si and
S for n-type) will be analyzed so that we have a sufficient level to obtain a
p-n function. ***
