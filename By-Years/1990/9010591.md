The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze enterprise level data-sets
in Bulgaria. The data sets will be collected in collaboration with a team of
Bulgarian scientists. One data set will be used to analyze the effect of
different forms of ownership structure on productivity, labor demand, and
investment decisions. In particular, divers hypotheses will be tested on the
broad area of the economic effects of alternative organizational structures,
especially provisions for worker participation in decision-making and in
ownership. The second data set is on the entry of new firms and will be used to
analyze the formation and entry of new enterprises. This research is important
because a detailed analysis of the transition processes in Bulgaria will not
only provide useful information to facilitate reform in that country, but it
will also have broader applicability to the reform efforts in other Eastern
European countries.
