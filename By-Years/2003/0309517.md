Mark Gordon, Ricky Kendall, and Mike Schmidt of Iowa State University and Piotr
Piecuch of Michigan State University are supported by the Chemistry Division
through the Information Technology Research Program to parallelize ab initio
electronic structure methods, specifically coupled cluster theory and
improvements upon it. Coupled cluster theory is a computationally expensive
methodology but it is regarded as the most accurate means for solving the many-
electron Schroedinger equation. Therefore, developing a highly scalable code for
implementation on massively parallel architectures will have broad impact. The
accurate predictions of energetics and chemical properties from this level of
theory are used in all areas of chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical
methods developed here will find general applicability in modeling a wide range
of phenomena, including organic, biological, and materials chemistry, as well as
many areas of physics and engineering. In addition, new paradigms will be
developed as templates for parallelizing other complex codes in the physical
sciences. The resulting computational tools will be freely distributed to
researchers worldwide in academia, government labs, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;
