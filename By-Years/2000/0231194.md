The Paradigms in Physics Project is an ongoing complete revision of the upper-
division physics curriculum. By tying the junior-year content to case-studies of
paradigmatic physical situations, the curriculum is more modern and flexible
enough to meet students' diverse career needs. By utilizing more student
centered pedagogies including integrated laboratories, small-group problem-
solving, computer simulations, and project-based courses, the project is
improving students' analytical and problem-solving abilities, as well as their
integration of mathematics and physics. By spiraling to revisit topics and
concepts at a higher level in the senior year, the project is enhancing student
learning. This phase involves national dissemination of this successful project.
However dissemination of a project of this scale has never been attempted by a
single department. Thus the present project focuses on two of the new Paradigms
courses. Beyond the student materials that have already been developed, faculty
will need additional support as they adopt these courses, including written
Instructor's Guides to both the content and the activities, and Faculty
Development Workshops. Successful implementation and evaluation of this project
will provide the experience necessary to outline a more ambitious dissemination
plan for the Paradigms project.
