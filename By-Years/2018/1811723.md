Interacting particle systems form a mathematical framework for systems with
interacting components that arise in a variety of fields in science and
engineering. Examples include, among many others, financial institutions
interacting with each other via borrowing and lending, synchronization of
neurons in the brain via electrical signals, and physical particles interacting
through the (e.g. electromagnetic) potential they themselves generate. In many
situations, the systems involved are large, e.g. the number of neurons in a
given part of the human brain is on the order of a million. The goal of the
project is to advance the quantitative understanding of such large interacting
particle systems, relying on stochastic and deterministic partial differential
equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will tackle equations describing
the large scale behavior of interacting particle systems and the blowups arising
thereby. More specifically, blowups in Stefan problems for parabolic partial
differential equations governing the limiting particle density in particle
systems interacting through the hitting times will be investigated by a
combination of probabilistic and analytic techniques. In particular, the exact
timing of blowups will be determined, and the existence and uniqueness of a
suitable solution will be established beyond the time of the first blowup. In
addition, Gaussian approximations for the hitting times in interacting particle
systems will be derived using the limiting stochastic partial differential
equations. Finally, solutions to the latter arising from interacting particle
systems will be shown to coincide with the entropy solutions arising naturally
in the analysis of partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
