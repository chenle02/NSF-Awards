Lazarsfeld Professor Lazarsfeld will investigate geometric and algebraic
properties of linear series on higher dimensional varieties. In particular he
hopes to prove the higher dimensional analogue of Fujita's conjecture. He also
hopes to work on syzygies of smooth surfaces and Sheshadri constants on higher
dimensional varieties. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter- century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics. ***
