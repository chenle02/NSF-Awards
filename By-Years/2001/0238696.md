This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to
develop, test, market and produce low-power wireless headstage systems for the
neural prosthetic market. The wireless neural headstage devices will be able to
transmit and to receive sixteen electrodes sourced from a patient. The analog
signals will be encoded and transmitted wirelessly to a remote receiver where
they will appear on a 16-channel connector. The wireless headstage technology
will replace the tethered connections and create a more natural and productive
laboratory environment for patient data acquisition. Ultimately, wireless
technology will improve the quality of life for anyone using a commercial neural
prosthetic device by offering extended freedom of motion, improved product
safety and reliability, and less visual distractions.

The primary commercial application of this project is in the wireless neural
prosthetic market. Additional applications are expected in the biomonitoring
business markets, such as for electrophysiological patient testing and
monitoring.
