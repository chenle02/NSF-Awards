Research will be done on the fundamental mathematical structure and development
of efficient algorithms. Matroid theory, a branch of mathematics which is
fundamental to the theory of combinatorial optimization, provides a framework
for understanding many efficiently solvable problems. Structural properties of
matroids will be studied using techniques from connectivity theory. Polyhedral
theory within combinatorial optimization deals with giving alternative
descriptions of polyhedra. Research into finding linear descriptions for the
polyhedra associated with variants of certain combinatorial optimization
problems so that linear programming techniques can be utilized will also be
studied.
