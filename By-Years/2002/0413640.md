OISE-0413640 Robinson

This award will support a U.S. graduate student to conduct research in East
Asia. The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute program are to expose
students to East Asia science and engineering in the context of a research
laboratory, and to initiate personal relationships that will foster research
collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future. This project will
provide the student with first hand research experience, an introduction to
science and science policy infrastructure, and orientation to culture and
language in East Asia.
