The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is home to leading research
centers in a number of areas, including astrophysics, genomics, earth and
planetary science, and particle physics. Being aggressive adopters of
computational components in their research programs, these centers all have
current and growing requirements for high-performance networking. These research
activities involve the transfer of big data across the network, and are
currently limited by UCSC's connectivity to regional, national, and
international research networks. The motivation for this project is to re-
architect UCSC's research network so that it is optimized for these high
performance scientific applications.

To better support these big data research activities UCSC adds a Science DMZ
component to the UCSC network that is optimized for high-performance
applications. The Science DMZ is a portion of the campus network that segregates
these big science data flows from production network traffic. UCSC is
provisioning 100 Gb/s external connectivity from the Science DMZ to regional,
national, and international research networks, and 10 Gb/s to the computational
infrastructure supporting these projects. UCSC is deploying enhanced measurement
and monitoring capabilities to ensure optimal use of the new infrastructure, and
the experimental OpenFlow technology to enable experiments in enhanced services
for these users. To ensure researchers are able to make optimal use of the new
services UCSC dedicates network engineering personnel to act as a bridge between
the researchers and central campus IT staff to ensure researchers make maximal
use of the new infrastructure.
