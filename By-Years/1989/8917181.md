Although it is widely recognized the many sedimentary units were remagnetized
by chemical processes, the specific mechanisms are still poorly understood. The
migration of basinal/orogenic fluids is one likely cause of chemical
remagnetization, but in situ mechanisms may be needed to explain chemical
remagnetization in units that were impermeable to fluids. This project will 1)
test for a relationship between basinal fluids and remagnetization, and 2) test
several models for in situ chemical remagnetization. Although this project
emphasizes the paleomagnetic aspects of the research, the expected results
should have important implications for the timing and origin of MVT
mineralization, and the nature of rock/fluid interactions and fluid flow in, and
through carbonate units.
