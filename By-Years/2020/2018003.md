Speech timing between conversation partners is highly complex; nonetheless,
native speakers of a given language have a strong sense of proper timing when
they speak and converse. For example, a 'delay' during a conversation over Skype
or Zoom can disrupt the flow of conversation considerably, even if no words are
actually lost during the connection. This project investigates how speakers know
when to plan their utterances during conversation, and how communicative timing
varies across different languages and cultures. The research also examines how
individuals time gestures of the hands and head along with their speech. The
project's potential impacts include improving the naturalness of human-machine
interactions, boosting the effectiveness in foreign language training, and
therapeutic interventions for those with speech and language
disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research suggests that conversational
timing patterns vary systematically across speakers of different languages. This
project seeks to develop an explanatory model for such findings by investigating
interactional timing patterns among populations of varying linguistic and
sociolinguistic backgrounds. Using audio and video recordings, speech timing
will be examined at the individual level in terms of how speakers align their
speech to a metronome, and how they time their own co-speech gestures. The
project will also investigate conversational timing between pairs of speakers,
exploring relative timing of speech and gestural landmarks between conversation
partners. Project findings will be of interest to linguists and speech
scientists as they will inform a cross-linguistic and cross-cultural model of
speech and co-speech gestural timing. Findings will also be of interest to
scientists studying the role of language and related abilities (such as music
and rhythmic entrainment) in the broader context of human
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
