The unifying theme of the Gone Fishing workshops is Poisson Geometry, a field
which lies at the intersection of Mathematical Physics and Geometry. It
originates in the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the
semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Poisson structures can be traced back
to the 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi and Lie. Poisson
Geometry as an independent field started around 1980 with the foundational works
of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. The field developed rapidly, stimulated by the
connections with a large number of areas in mathematics and mathematical
physics, including differential geometry and Lie theory, quantization,
noncommutative geometry, representation theory and quantum groups, geometric
mechanics and integrable systems. A number of major developments took place in
the last 15 years; some of the highlights are Kontsevich's formality theorem,
the study of Poisson-sigma models and the relationship to the integrability
problem for Lie algebroids, the relation with the moduli space of flat
connections and various moment map theories, singular reduction, (generalized)
complex geometry, cluster algebras, etc.

The Gone Fishing workshops aim to promote interaction between mathematicians,
physicists and groups working on areas related to Poisson geometry from
different points of view. They bring together leading experts and young
researchers in these subjects to encourage more interaction and cross
fertilization between different fields. This is becoming more and more urgent as
these fields progress deeper. The workshops also provide an excellent
opportunity for US based scientists to exchange ideas and promote possible
collaborations. One important theme of each workshop is to address important
questions and future directions of the subject. The next meetings of the Gone
Fishing workshops are: Temple University, Philadelphia, (Sept. 28-29, 2013); and
the University of California at Berkeley, (Sept./Oct 2014).
