The PI's (S. Ruden) principal research interests lie in the physics of the
formation of stars and planets, particularly, in the formation of the solar
system. During the five-year tenure of his PYI award, the PI will concentrate on
the theoretical dynamics and evolution of accretion disks around contracting
proto-stars. He will also investigate the dynamics and chemistry of powerful
winds that flow from these young stars and which are thought to modify the
protostellar environment considerably. The overall goal of this program is to
increase the understanding of the physical conditions and evolutionary timesales
required for the formation of planets around sun-like stars.
