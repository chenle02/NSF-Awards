The City College of the City University of New York will initiate an eight-week,
commuter Young Scholars project in Chemistry and the Life Sciences (biology,
biochemistry, chemistry and biophysics) for 20 students entering grade 12. Each
student will participate in a summer research experience, as part of a modern
research team, with his/her own problem integrated into the larger disciplinary
focus of the group. The research activity will be in tandem with a strong
program of discussions and seminars whose purpose is to ease the student's
transition to college and to encourage the participants to pursue a science
major and a career in science. Following the summer experience the students will
be invited to continue their work at City College during the academic year.
