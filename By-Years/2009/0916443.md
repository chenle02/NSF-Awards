Networks are everywhere. Discovering the underlying principles of the networks
has great impact on our understanding of complex systems in many scientific,
engineering, and social research areas. Nowadays, the availability of network
data, such as online social networks from facebook.com or protein-protein
interaction data, give researchers unprecedented opportunities to quantitatively
study these complex systems. In this project, the PI brings together problems,
ideas and techniques from different areas including machine learning,
statistics, biology and social sciences, to develop novel computational tools
and statistical models for common problems in network inference and learning.
The research activities include i) designing nonparametric Bayesian models to
discover latent classes from relational data, ii) developing relational Bayesian
models, coupled with efficient deterministic approximate inference methods, to
predict missing links and node labels, and iii) examining network dynamics at
different substructure levels.

The developed models, algorithms, and tools for analyzing network data are
available to the public via publication and web distribution, disseminating to
other machine learning researchers and helping computational biologists and
socials scientists analyze massive network data that are being generated with an
unprecedented fast speed. The PI incorporates the research results into the
graduate-level interdisciplinary courses he teaches and recruits graduate and
undergraduate students to conduct research for this project.
