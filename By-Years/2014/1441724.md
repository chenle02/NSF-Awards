Operating systems (OS) form the core of the trusted computing base on most
computer platforms. The security of a platform therefore crucially relies on the
correct and secure operation of its OS. Unfortunately, malicious software such
as rootkits infect the OS by compromising the integrity of its code and data,
thereby jeopardizing the security of the entire
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to push the
boundaries of hardware-assisted methods to ensure OS integrity. The methods
explored include (1) formal verification of a hybrid hardware/software scheme
that uses local memory to monitor OS integirty, (2) hardware support for kernel
memory safety, and (3) a hardware-based scheme that leverages methods such as
the ARM TrustZone to monitor the security of end-user devices. Throughout, the
focus of this project is on developing hardware-based solutions to monitor OS
integrity and to verify the security guarantees advertised by these
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods being developed can have broad
impact by advancing the state of the art in personal, mobile and embedded device
security. The proposed designs are close variants of currently-available
hardware designs and are therefore likely to appeal to hardware manufacturers.
The project also includes curriculum enhancements at the graduate and
undergraduate level, and outreach programs aimed at high-school students as well
as industry professionals.
