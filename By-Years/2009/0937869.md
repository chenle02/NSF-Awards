The objective of this research is to develop techniques that utilize solid-state
memory technologies from device, circuit, architecture, and system perspectives
across I/O hierarchy in order to exploit their true potential for improving I/O
stack performance in high-performance computing systems. The PIs plan to develop
I/O friendly memory system architectures to enable hybrid processor-memory 3D
integrations with largely reduced off-chip I/O traffic. In addition, adaptive
cache management and hotspot prediction methods are being developed to address
the low random write performance of solid-state drives, and data processing
techniques will be developed to enable run-time configurable trade-offs among
solid-state drive performance characteristics. A comprehensive full-system
simulation infrastructure is capable to evaluate and demonstrate the research
under diverse high-performance computing workloads. The research facilitates the
high-performance computing systems to utilize existing/emerging memory and
processing technologies to tackle the grand I/O stack design challenge. It can
greatly contribute to enabling high-performance computing systems to stay on
track of their historic scaling, and hence benefit numerous real-life
applications such as biology, chemistry, earth science, health care, etc. This
project contributse to the society through engaging under-represented groups,
research infrastructure dissemination for education and training, and outreach
to high school students.
