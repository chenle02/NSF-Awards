This project concerns equations whose evolution may be modelled on the
interaction of coherent analytic structures which range from vortices to multi-
phase or multi-similarity wave packets to cavitating and collapsing filaments to
monopoles. The detailed structure of these objects, which can be determined from
asymptotics or geometry or by using the analytical properties of integrable
systems, provides a precise description of the mechanisms which give rise to
complicated and often chaotic dynamics. In current and future work, as more
modern geometric and analytical techniques are integrated into the program the
studies will be extended to systems modelled on non-classical geometric
structures, statistical ensembles of classical structures, spatially extended
defect patterns, and topologically complicated states such as knotted filaments
in fluid dynamics or monopoles in non-abelian gauge theories. The mathematics
involved in these studies covers a broad spectrum, from the theory of integrable
and almost integrable systems and rigorous analysis in pde's to the more
intuitive ideas best understood in a geometrical setting. In many cases,
specifically in the investigations in convective patterns and optics, real
experiments are used as a guide to develop and check the validity of models. In
all cases, each theoretical investigation is accompanied by extensive numerical
experiments.
