This project involves graduate students in the ethnographic research of faculty
at the Anthropology department of the University of Kentucky. In order to be
assured of a cohort of well-trained future social scientists, the National
Science Foundation is supporting the specialized training of graduate students
relatively early in their graduate education, before they are fixed upon their
dissertation topics. This training will increase their ability to carry out
sophisticated dissertation research.
