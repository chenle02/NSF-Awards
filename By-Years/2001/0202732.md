The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a seven month research fellowship by Dr. Arek J. Goetz
to work with Dr. Pierre Arnoux at the University of Marseille in France.

Dr. Goetz will join a group of active researchers at the University of Marseille
II, Institut de Luminy, and the Center of Theoretical Physics, in research
pertaining to the dynamics of transformations with low symbolic complexity. In
particular, he will explore the relationship between the symbolic dynamics
induced by invertible piecewise rotations, the geometry and fractal structure of
the coding partition. The last month of the fellowship will be spent at the
University of Exeter in the UK where he will join a team of researchers in
dynamical systems led by Dr. Peter Ashwin and apply results from the theory of
piecewise isometries to electrical engineering, in particular to the theory of
digital filters. Digital filters are computer algorithms used currently in
electronic devices such as cell phone and voice and image recognition devices.
