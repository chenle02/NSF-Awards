As the speed and memory size of supercomputers increase, the need for file
storage space also grows. Simple scaling of current strategies can lead to
solutions where the next generation machines require a greater expenditure for
primary disks than for the machine itself. The proposed effort will adapt
automatic file caching strategies, developed in a workstation environment, for
use in systems of high performance computers.
