Correlated electron systems is a rapidly developing subject, driven both by
high-resolution and novel measurement techniques and remarkable recent
theoretical developments. The 2014 Gordon Research Conference on Correlated
Electron Systems: Textures, Topology, and Strong Interactions, June 22-27, 2014
at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA consists of a broad swath of emerging
ideas such as novel spatial textures, such as nematic textures in the iron-based
superconductors, magnetic skyrmions in metallic magnets, the control of non-
equilibrium behavior in correlated superconductors and topological insulators,
the exploration of the limits of electric transport in correlated systems, the
role of spin-orbit interactions in such systems, and the ever increasing impact
of topological protection. It is very likely that new technologies will emerge
from these ideas that will lay the foundation for the next generation of
electronic devices. This award will support student and postdoc participation at
this Gordon Research Conference. Supported participants will have the
opportunity to participate in the associated Gordon Research Seminar Correlated
Electrons In Extremo: Frustration, Topology, and Ultrafast Dynamics, June 21-22,
2014 at the same location.
