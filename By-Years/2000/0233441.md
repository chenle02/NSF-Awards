0233441&lt;br/&gt;Nowak&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI, postdoctoral and
graduate students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a
collaboration with Joern Wilms of the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics
at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. Together, the US and German groups will
compare models for the x-ray spectra and timing behavior of galactic black holes
with observational data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Black holes
provide one of the most extreme environments for high-energy astrophysical
processes. Observational data are now showing evidence of broadband spectra and
rapid high-energy variability, but interpretation in terms of underlying
physical mechanisms remains difficult. The current collaboration will combine
the expertise of the PI's group and that of the German group to provide an
important link between theory and observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
also has an educational objective. The project will allow the graduate and
postdoctoral students involved to benefit from performing research in another
country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them
while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
