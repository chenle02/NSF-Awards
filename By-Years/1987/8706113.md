Modern injection molding machines are much more sophisticated than previous
designs and include microprocessors for control of key parameters in order to
enhance throughput and quality of molded parts. However, they are susceptible to
changes in operating conditions, which can reduce performance, and which are not
adequately controlled by current single-loop PID controllers. This research is
directed toward development of more advanced multi- variate control methods
which can adapt to changes in the machine characteristics and provide more
effective control of key parameters, such as melt temperature, than current
designs. The Phase I research has demonstrated feasibility by using a combined
system identification and model predictive control methodology, using data taken
from an operating machine at Cincinnati Milacron, Inc. Phase II will continue
development of the identification and control algorithms. Particular emphasis
will be placed on adequacy of the identification algorithm for model order
selection and handling of dead time in the machine impulse response functions.
The control algorithm will be designed for maximum robustness in the face of
variations in operating conditions. Algorithms for on-line estimation of
unmeasured machine parameters, such as melt temperature, will be developed. A
performance monitoring algorithm will be employed to detect the need for
reidentification of the system, utilizing statistical tests on the measured
machine parameters.
