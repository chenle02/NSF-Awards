Following advances in information and communication technologies and the rapid
evolution of E-Commerce and financial engineering during the past few years,
optimization has begun to play a crucial role in sharpening the competitive edge
of conventional business and organization operations. Because of the expected
growth in many information related areas and what is perceived as a critical
demand for focused research attention on future directions and applications of
large scale simulation optimization, a workshop will be organized at Harvard
University on June 23 and 24, 2001. This workshop will bring together leading
government, industrial, and academic researchers and practitioners of systems
simulation modeling and optimization for the purpose of identifying research
issues, targets of opportunity, application areas and other unforeseen points
relevant to this promising research area.
