This project is designed to assess the association between two forms of
psychosocial stress, chronic and acute anxiety, and human ovarian function as
indexed by profiles of salivary progesterone and estradiol. Variation in each
form of stress will be assessed at two levels, between women and within
individual women. Chronic and acute anxiety will be assessed by standard
psychological tests and by patterns of salivary cortisol. The project will be
composed of two separate studies. In the first study, 120 subjects will be
screened for levels of chronic anxiety. Twenty women at both the high and low
end of the distribution will be asked to collect daily saliva samples for
hormonal analysis and assessment of ovarian function. In the second study, 20
subjects subject to a common acute stressor (the Medical College Admissions
Test), will be matched with subjects not subject to the stress. Salivary hormone
levels and ovarian function will be assessed in both groups in the month of the
test and again three moths later. This project incorporates several distinct
advantages over previous research on the effects of psychosocial stress on
reproductive physiology. It is prospective in design and double-blind in
execution, eliminating ambiguities in the interpretation of dependent and
independent variables. It incorporates sensitive measures of ovarian function
which have been found to be responsive to other environmental and situational
stresses. It involves two different explicit measures of the independent
variables, one of which directly reflects physiological stress responses. It
distinguishes the effects of chronic and acute anxiety, and variation between
and within women. The results of this project will provide a much clearer
assessment of the impact of anxiety on human ovarian function than has been
possible previously, and should contribute to our understanding of broader
issues in neuroendocrinology.
