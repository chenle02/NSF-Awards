Enhancements to the theory of network-based planning techniques invented in the
late 1950's, along with improved hardware and software environments, have
resulted in elegant and powerful tools or planning today's construction
projects. However, there are several limitations to these traditional project
planning techniques. A fundamental limitation is that they are able to
manipulate only the data generated by the planning process, not the knowledge
used in generating the project plan. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
provide new means to generate plans of actions, and to reason with, and provide
explanations from, stored knowledge. However, the potential value of AI-planning
systems in the construction domain has been demonstrated only at two ends of a
spectrum of generality. Planning systems that can provide useful decision
support for a wide range of executive and work package level tasks have yet to
be developed. The overall objective of this research is to develop an AI-
leveraged planning system for construction projects, by adapting and extending
AI techniques for automated planning and knowledge-based expert systems. The
resulting system for detailed activity planning and high level project planning
will exploit the capability of AI techniques for storing and manipulating
knowledge. This AI-based planning research has the potential to extend present
knowledge of, and to enhance available technology for construction project
planning. Since projects -- which need planning -- are common to most
technology-based industries, the result of this research will be of interest to
practitioners and researchers in many disciplines.
