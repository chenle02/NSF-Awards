String theory is a model that represents elementary particles by vibrating
strings with the aim of unifying the four fundamental forces of nature. While
string theory is one of the main paradigms in physics today, it has yet to make
experimentally testable predictions. However, it has generated many mathematical
predictions that have led to fundamental developments in algebraic geometry and
symplectic topology, especially in relation to holomorphic curves. This
project's two directions will further test string theory mathematically in the
so-called real and open sectors, which have long lagged behind the standard
closed sector, and develop the associated mathematical framework and connections
between different fields of mathematics, including enumerative algebraic
geometry, knot theory, and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will build on work that established the mathematical foundations behind
the real sector of string theory, to advance the mathematical understanding of
the predictions arising from this sector and to establish the mathematical
foundations of the closely related open sector of string theory. The project
will also utilize older work that established the BCOV mirror symmetry
prediction for counts of genus one curves in a quintic threefold and it will
continue the recent work of a current doctoral student that introduced a
powerful topological technique for lifting homology relations from Deligne-
Mumford moduli spaces of stable curves to moduli spaces of stable (pseudo-)
holomorphic maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
