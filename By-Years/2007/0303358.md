0303358&lt;br/&gt;Bash&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Rhode Island
provides funds to acquire a replacement for an aged and unrepairable liquid
scintillation counter. The instrument is essential for conduct of research
projects at sea that involve radioisotopes. This acquisition provides an
important shared-use capability to marine scientists using R/V Endeavor in their
research in 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
