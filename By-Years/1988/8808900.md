New switch-level approaches for fast and efficient simulation of MOS IC's are to
be formulated in order to estimate "infant" (i.e., early) failures and to
estimate field yield in large chips. The simulation scheme is also expected to
identify the critical sub-section of circuits that cause early failures and
should help in redesigning for greater robustness.
