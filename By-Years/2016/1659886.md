This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will offer an
intellectually and socially stimulating research experience, on a vibrant and
diverse set of research topics, focusing on digital communication. Increasing
use of Internet in our daily lives requires research to support emerging trends
in communication and information science, and education to prepare young people
for rewarding careers in the decades to come. Students involved in the program
will receive extensive training in research, and valuable information about
research careers, working with top faculty on exciting problems. Each student
will work with one mentor, but there will be many joint activities to create a
cohort experience, and to support communication across parallel research
projects, thereby enhancing scientific progress as well as student learning.
This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four themes, each led by one
research mentor, under the common thrust of digital connectivity: (1) The
communication theme focuses on hardware and infrastructure to support
communication, tackling unsolved problems of limited bandwidth and constrained
protocol design in novel ways, proposing optical routers, in-network computation
and extensible protocol design. (2) The cybersecurity theme focuses on securing
communication from cyberattacks and damaging activities such as cyberbullying
and cyberpredation, seeking solutions for several open problems, including safe
malware analysis, large denial-of-service attacks, weak passwords, and the lack
of privacy-safe sources of network data. (3) The information retrieval theme
focuses on mining useful information from online sources, to achieve natural-
language understanding and generation, using powerful new constructs, such as
Abstract Meaning Representation, universal language translation, and the
structure of poetry. (4) The information flow theme focuses on understanding
structure and communication dynamics of social systems with a novel focus on
cognitive factors and their impact on communication that has already uncovered
phenomena that can change the way social networks present information to users,
and the way people leverage crowdsourcing.
