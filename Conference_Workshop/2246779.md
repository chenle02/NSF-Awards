This award will provide funding for the conference ?Recent advances in
applications of Harmonic Analysis to Convex Geometry?, to be held at North
Dakota State University (Fargo, ND) on April 22-23, 2023. Several long-standing
open problems in the area of convex geometry have recently been successfully
solved using techniques from harmonic analysis. The objective of the conference
is to bring together four experts in the field, who will each give a mini-course
to an audience of mostly U.S. based graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
This will provide them with training in state-of-the-art methods and will open
opportunities to start collaborations with more senior researchers. The majority
of the funding will be used to support the participation of graduate students
and early-career researchers, with priority given to women and members of other
underrepresented groups. The following website will provide information about
the conference: https://sites.google.com/ndsu.edu/recent-advances/home

The methods of Harmonic Analysis and Convex Geometry have a long history of
successful interaction and have led to solutions of many long-standing problems
by some of the proposed main speakers, such as the Busemann-Petty problem and,
very recently, Ulam?s floating body problem, which was unsolved since the 1940s.
The techniques used in these recent breakthroughs are now understood to be
potentially useful to solve additional open problems, in which the four proposed
speakers have an extensive record of successful research. The present conference
aims to provide training in these very active areas of research for U.S. early
career mathematicians. There will be a poster session for graduate students to
showcase their work, and a special panel on open questions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
