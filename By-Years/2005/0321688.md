This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to continue
the scale up of luminescent Si nanocrystal production using the continuous flow
reactor developed during the Phase I period where the main objective of the
Phase I proposal of converting a cumbersome batch process into an efficient
continuous one was accomplished. This new continuous flow reactor will serve as
an enabling technology because the system will be applicable to the high
temperature synthesis of numerous nanoscale colloidal materials.

This technology could raise the average efficiency of conventional lighting from
under 15% to more than 50%, potentially reducing the electricity consumed for
illumination by a factor of 3X. The process can create particles that have many
favorable attributes that lend themselves to other applications as well, many of
which will be pursued for licensing. These include multi-level floating gate
memory, optical interconnects, optical integrated circuits, electro-chemical
products, fuel cells, bio-molecular recognition, battery electrodes, and
displays.
