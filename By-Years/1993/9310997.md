ABSTRACT -- CTS-9310997 PI -- Costas P. Grigoropoulos The Department of
Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley will purchase
an In-situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometer equipment which will be dedicated to
support research in engineering. Ellipsometric measurements yield the optical
properties of bulk and thin film materials, over a wide spectral range and up to
high temperatures. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: (1) "Thermal Phenomena in Thin Films," Research on the
investigation of radiative and thermal transport in thin film structures. (2)
"Heat Transfer in Excimer Laser Materials Processing and Micro-machining,"
Research on the investigation of pulsed laser techniques for thin film
fabrication and micro-machining. (3) "Pulsed Laser Removal of Small Particles
from Solid Surfaces," Research on the investigation of rapid phase change
transformations at the nanosecond time scale.
