This award provides funding for developing automatic construction of accurate
models for physical systems. Specific information about the target system will
be provided through measurements made directly on a physical device, or a user's
observations described to the program in varying degrees of precision, and
hypotheses suggested by a user. In addition to construction of such models, a
secondary objective is to understand what matters in a model, what qualitative
and quantitative are affected by the requirements of the situation and knowledge
of the user. Such understanding is of practical importance in science and
engineering in validating existing models and designs.
