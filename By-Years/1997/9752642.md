The project is producing a set of bioinformatics and genetics teaching materials
suitable for advanced undergraduates in the life sciences and in information
sciences. Distribution platforms for course materials include interactive World
Wide Web pages capable of collecting user data. Collected data and experience
with courses serve as tools to recursively improve the materials until suitable
for commercial distribution either through electronic interactive distance
learning courses or as combined text/computer exercise materials. The materials
produced for the bioinformatics course component of this project are based upon
materials developed for a course (Bioinformatics) at the University of Kentucky
(http://www/uky.edu/Classes/BIO520/). A text and accompanying online materials
are being generated for this course. The other component of the project is
development of appropriate modules from genomic and bioinformatic analyses for a
junior level general genetics course
(http://www.uky.edu/Classes/BIO404G/syllabus97.html). The genetics material
explores WHY as well as HOW to sequence a given segment of DNA.
