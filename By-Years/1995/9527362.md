9527362 Hennage Joint ACS/OSA sponsorship will provide an interdisciplinary
forum for the presentation and discussion of new and previously unpublished
results on advanced organic thin film materials with potential applications for
photonics. Materials synthesis, fabrication, and processing will be covered in
depth and related to chemical, physical, and optical properties. Theoretical and
experimental studies regarding these properties will be described. Materials
exhibiting electroluminescence, second-order, third- order, and photorefractive
nonlinear optical properties will be given particular emphasis. Both active and
passive photonic device applications will be discussed with a focus on the
relationship between device performance and materials properties. ***
