Science Research Laboratory (SRL) is developing new, compact linear induction
accelerator (LIA) technology which offers many advantages for bulk sterilization
of medical products. These accelerators are reliable and significantly less
expensive than electrostatic or rf accelerators. In addition, SRL induction
accelerator are scalable to average electron beam powers of more than 800 kW at
beam energies ranging from 5-10 MeV, providing an average of 100 kW of
repetitively pulsed, high dose rate x-ray flux. An experimental research program
and concurrent design study will be carried out for Phase I. An experiment to
demonstrate efficient sterilization of medical product using high dose rate
radiation from an existing LIA is planned. In addition, a study will explore
electron beam transport and x- ray target designs for production of a uniform
x-ray radiation field for a definitive sterilization experiment to be performed
in Phase II.
