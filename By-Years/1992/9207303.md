Many fundamental aspects of leaf development and pattern formation in plants
are poorly understood. This research will use a species of aquatic plants to
study the development of two specific tissue types - stomata and lateral veins
(i.e. vascular tissue) - in leaves. This plant possesses unique advantages for
this research because the two tissue types are normally absent on submerged
plant leaves, but they can be induced to differentiate on plants exposed to the
plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA). Thus, this system presents an
opportunity to study alternative modes of development against a uniform genetic
background. The proposed research will examine the relationship between
microtubule orientation and ABA-induced stomatal development using a combination
of immunofluorescence microscopy and microtubule- disrupting drugs. ABA-induced
vascular development will be studied through a combination of experiments.
Finally, a fundamental study will be a made of the relationship of ABA to cell
division rates in developing Hippuris leaves. Results obtained from this
research will increase understanding of stomatal and vascular development both
in Hippuris vulgaris specifically and in plants in general. Z^//
