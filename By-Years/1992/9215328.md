The objectives of this research are to: (1) develop tutorial, case study and
game-style teaching modules with associated software to illustrate the
methodologies for integrated manufacturing and distribution system design and
operation for quick response component suppliers; and (2) distribute these
teaching modules to other engineering and business schools and initiate joint
development of enhancements to these materials. This research will investigate
an integrated strategy for demand forecasting, production scheduling, and
finished goods inventory stocking that simultaneously achieves high customer
service, high finished goods turnover, and high capacity utilization. It is the
purpose of the research to demonstrate that such a strategy is possible and can
be explained simply.
