The region from 65 km to 95 km altitude is known as the mesosphere and the
ionization produced in it by absorption of solar ultraviolet is known as the D
region. The ions and electrons initially produced are more likely to associate
with molecules than is the case at higher altitudes, on account of the higher
ambient air densitites and smaller fractions of molecules broken down to atomic
form at those altitudes, as compared to the most dense region of the ionosphere
at say 200 km. The chemical reactions occurring are complex and not as well
understood as at higher altitudes. The electron densitites are lower than at
higher altitudes, and very low at night, so that one does not get a strong
return with radar. Nevertheless, the region is important as an absorbing medium
for transmission of radio waves, and its ion chemistry and temperature and
turbulence structure can be studied at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and comparisons
made with complex models of the chemistry. This award is to perform such
measurements and to analyze more fully the results of previous measurements.
