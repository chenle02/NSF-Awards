The goal of this project is to examine how people develop, construct,
interpret, and represent concepts of central tendency, or average. From this
understanding, more effective directions for the teaching and learning of
statistics at the elementary and middle school levels will be derived. Given the
major educational thrust toward statistical literacy for all, and given the
clear lack of research on what children understand about statistics, this study
represents an important step in linking research to emerging mathematics
teaching practices. During the first year of the project, fourth, sixth, and
eighth graders as well as teachers of these grades will be interviewed to
determine how they find and interpret average. Participants will use a variety
of materials to solve and represent problems involving engaging, familiar
quantitative data. Analysis of these interviews will identify the concepts,
approaches, misconceptions, representations, and rules exhibited by individuals
at these ages. A theoretical model of conceptions of average will be constructed
from the first year's analysis. Based on this model, a series of teaching
interviews, using concrete and software-based representations, will be devised.
The second year's research will focus on investigating how inadequate cognitive
models of average can become more complete and flexible.
