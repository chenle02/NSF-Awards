Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is rapidly becoming an invaluable research tool
with applications in fields as diverse as molecular biology, medicine and
forensics. We feel that the introduction of PCR technology into our
undergraduate curriculum is essential to maintain our practice of teaching
current research techniques in molecular biophyscis and biochemistry. Especially
those that are in widespread use and are likely to be encountered by our
students in their future careers. We are requesting funding to purchase the
temperature cycler needed for the repetitive denaturation and renaturation steps
that form the basis of this technique.We are also requesting funds to purchase a
spectrophotometer to be used to teach a variety of topics including introductory
and advanced enzyme kinetics and investigations into the optical properties of
nucleic acids, e.g. thermal denaturationEach of these pieces of equipment will
be used in undergraduate teaching labs at Yale University both semesters of the
academic year by majors and non-majors alike.
