This research is directed towards improving the damping of automotive structural
and mechanical components. This is accomplished by exploiting the stress
coupling of anisotropic composite material structural subsystems for use in
laminated constructions. The subsystem is a sandwich component with elastic
faces and viscoelastic core. A structural design is proposed which will increase
the level of stressing and thus energy dissipation in the viscoelastic layers.
Such a design would have widespread use as a tool for noise and vibration
control. The success of the design will lead to a number of commercial
applications both within and out of the automotive industry. A complete study to
determine the potential of the damped sandwich subcomponents, to identify
commercial applications, and to create appropriate design guidelines and
analytical tools would require an extensive experimental and analytical program.
An appropriate structural theory for the damped laminate analysis will be
formulated. The solution of a specific practical problem will be found.
Parametric studies will be performed and the merit of the proposed subcomponent
will be established.
