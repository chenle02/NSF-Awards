Presently, there is no single solid state device which generates moderate
amounts of low noise power, and can be used in receivers as a local oscillator
source over the 200-300 GHz range. However, we propose a novel Transferred
Electron Device (TED) termed the Modulated Impurity Concentration Transferred
Electron Device (MICTED) that is expected to generate milliwatts of power up to
300 GHz. The MICTED differs from conventional TEDs by incorporating a modulated
doping profile which substantially increases the harmonic content in the current
waveform. The increased harmonic content of the MICTED leads to second and third
harmonic Transferred Electron Oscillators (TEOs) which deliver more power than
TEOs using conventional TEDs. This study will assess the merits of the MICTED as
a solid state oscillator source between 100 and 300 GHz, and involve device
theory and design, device fabrication and testing, and device simulation. The
MICTED is expected to have a significant impact on millimeter wave research
where low noise and moderate power local oscillator sources are in great need.
Par one of the proposed research is a fundamental feasibility study of the
MICTED. This section propose Monte Carlo and Drift/Diffusion device simulations
that include harmonic balance calculations. Also, a 94 GHz prototype GaAs MICTED
will be designed, fabricated, and tested. In Part two, we will theoretically and
experimentally investigate optimized InP MICTEDs for operation up to 300 GHz.
