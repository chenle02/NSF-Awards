The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for
fatigue failure in shape memory alloys (SMAs), with a focus on deformation and
phase transformation at the microstructural length scale. Low cycle fatigue,
where the SMA undergoes a relatively low number of cycles at high stress
amplitudes, and very high cycle fatigue, where the SMA undergoes a very high
number of cycles at low stress amplitudes, will be studied. The solid-to-solid
phase transformation that enables the unique properties of SMAs will be
quantitatively characterized at the grain level, and linked to the mesoscopic
response and macroscopic stress-strain behavior of these alloys. The resulting
unique, quantitative information on phase transformations will be used to
improve the accuracy of lifetime and performance predictions, as well as the
optimal design, of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the
links between microstructure and macroscopic behavior is a fundamental challenge
in the design and use of materials. SMA components - for example, in military,
aerospace, biomedical, and automotive applications - are being increasingly used
under fatigue conditions, and a quantitative understanding of the effect of
microstructure on their fatigue behavior is critically necessary. This project
incorporates a number of educational efforts that are closely tied to the
proposed research, including undergraduate summer internships, graduate student
enrichment involving a collaborative effort with the Department of Mathematics
at the University of Bristol, incorporation of research results into coursework,
and dissemination of research findings through a public seminar series and
television show.
