The goal of this project is to continue research aimed at improving and
expanding the technology of immunomagnetic cell separation. This technique can
be used to separate stem cells, cancer cells and fetal cells from other
components of whole blood as well as pathogens from food. The specific goals of
this research are to: (1) measure the degree to which cells are
immunomagnetically labeled using Cell Tracking Velocimetry, (2) explore the
fundamental relationships and parameters that govern magnetophoretic mobility,
and (3) continue experimental studies on a variety of cell and immunomagnetic
labeling systems.
