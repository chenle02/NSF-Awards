The Department of Agricultural Chemistry and the Environmental Health Sciences
Center at Oregon State University request funds from the National Science
Foundation to purchase an electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer.
Research projects which will depend on this equipment are in the areas of
biochemistry and biotechnology. More specifically the instrument will be used in
the research goals of ten projects described in this application to: (a) provide
molecular weights of proteins, (b) sequence N-terminally blocked or modified
proteins, (c) determine the sites and structures of carbohydrates on
glycoproteins, (d) determine the sites of alkylation reactions on protein, (e)
locate the receptor sites in the enzyme of a substrate-enzyme complex (f)
determine the sites of linkage of protein-DNA covalent units (g) determine the
disulfide linkages of several proteins, and (h) determine the structures of
elecitors in aphid resistant hop plants. These projects cannot be efficiently or
even successfully completed without the instrument for which funds are being
requested. The present mass spectrometers available for these projects, which
includes a Krotos MS 50TC-RF instrument, lack the sensitivity, mass range and
tandem mass spectrometry capability to do the necessary sequencing and structure
analyses. The increasing emphasis of biochemical and biotechnology research and
the recent addition of new faculty in these areas on the Oregon State University
campus, has created a growing need for this equipment.
