The goal of this project is to develop the ability to predict the
folding/unfolding behavior of proteins based upon structural information. The
physical basis of two fundamental properties of proteins will be addressed, the
stability of the native conformation and the cooperativity of the
folding/unfolding transition. At the present time, the structure of over five
hundred proteins has been determined; also, the thermodynamics of the
folding/unfolding behavior of a significant number of proteins has been studied
in great detail by high sensitivity calorimetric techniques. Unfortunately, the
relationships between protein structure and protein folding behavior are not yet
understood at a quantitative level. %%% Understanding the forces and mechanisms
that control how proteins fold into their functional structures will
significantly advance our knowledge of biological organization at the molecular
level. From a practical point of view, the success of this research program will
provide a quantitative conceptual framework to improve strategies for the
rational design of proteins with specific stability and cooperative properties.
