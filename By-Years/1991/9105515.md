This research is an extension from current results by this group of
determination of P-wave velocities in the earth's mantle. New emphasis will be
on determination of resolution of the P-wave results and the incorporation of
S-wave data. For further refinements, the ISC earthquake catalog will be
relocated and special attention will be paid to subduction zones which are
critical to the inversion. The 3-D map of velocities are a key indicator of
mantle convection which is the primary driving force of plate tectonics and
earthquake occurrence. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
