9414610 Komanduri A study will be made of the tribological interactions between
fine polishing abrasives and the surface of advanced ceramic materials (alumina
and silicon nitride). The chemical and mechanical causes of material removal
will be determined in detail to the extent possible by the use of a number of in
situ measurement techniques, including tribological testing inside an
environmental scanning electron microscope. The results will be used to validate
models developed on the basis of fracture mechanics and thermodynamics. ***
