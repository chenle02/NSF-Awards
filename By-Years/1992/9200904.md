The Leguminosae (legume or bean family) is the third largest family of
flowering plants, and includes many species of economic and scientific
importance (beans, pea, soybean, etc). Study of the systematics, ecology, and
other aspects of biology in this family has been enhanced and facilitated by the
existence of an international group of multidisciplinary workers, who have
shared their diverse interests and expertise in a series of international
conferences. The Third International Legume Conference (LC-3), "Evolution of the
Leguminosae", is to be held at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, from
July 12-17, 1992. This project requests funding to assist speakers, poster
presenters, and other participants in ILC-3 from the United States to attend the
Conference. Priority in funding is to be given to younger researchers who might
otherwise be unable to attend this valuable meeting.
