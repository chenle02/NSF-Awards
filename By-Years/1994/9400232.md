9400232 Preparata Recent research on parallel computation has focused primarily
on algorithmic design, and, more specifically, on the elucidation of the
inherent parallelism of a wide variety of problems. This approach has frequently
de-emphasized the communication aspect of parallel computation, and has placed
no bound on the number of deployed processors (granularity). As parallel
computing systems appear on the market, a more global view than the
identification of parallelism is called for. To contribute to this emerging
outlook, the following research topics are addressed in this project: (1) Since
it appears that the more plausible parallel systems of the near future are
coarse-grained, (i.e., interconnections of moderate number of large, powerful
microprocessors), algorithms for this model must be systematically developed to
gain insight into general paradigms (routing), and general communication
primitives are to be studied, for incorporation into the run-time system; (2) As
devices become smaller and faster, physical limitations become increasingly
relevant. In a limiting technology, mesh-like architecture's are the only
scalable ones. On such networks, it is important to devise practicable shared-
memory emulation schemes (the P-RAM assumes an increasing role as a programming
model) to evaluate the effect of memory granularity and hierarchy, and to
investigate the structure and functionality of the most suitable most modules.
(3) Locality has been long recognized as an important source of efficiency in
parallel computing. An intriguing relation between locality and area-time
theories of VLSI deserves careful scrutiny, since exploitation of locality and
emulation (of an architecture by another) appear to be the key to program
portability. ***
