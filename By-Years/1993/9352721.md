Over the past six years, the Biology Department at the College of Charleston has
strengthened the quality of instruction in the area of Cellular and Molecular
Biology. This initiative has included the procurement of modern equipment, the
hiring of new faculty, and an expansion of course offerings. Consistent with
this ongoing effort to modernize our Cell and Molecular Biology curriculum, this
proposal focuses on a request for microscopic and tissue culture equipment which
would be used to enhance the quality of laboratory instruction at the whole cell
level. This equipment will be used in several new or restructured courses
including Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Plant
Physiology. The incubators and sterile transfer hoods requested in this
proposal, make possible the culture of a wide variety of plant and animal cells
and tissues. The light microscopic, video, and image analysis equipment will be
used to investigate cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, as well as to
perform chromosomal analysis, and tumor induction studies on cultured cells and
tissues. The laboratories incorporating these techniques are research-oriented,
and are designed to help students develop critical thinking and data analysis
skills, as well as to give students hands on experience with research quality
equipment.
