This grant examined high temperature rheology of continuous fiber-reinforced
ceramic matrix composites (CMC) materials. It uses an analytical model to
predict the creep response of a bulk composite specimen. The model is then
compared with the experimental results from the creep experiments. The research
emphasizes (1) investigation of different constitutive models for the
interface/interphase, (2) post-deformation microstructural and microchemical
analyses of deformed composite specimens, (3) characterization of time-dependent
responses, and (4) extension of the approaches to other composite systems.
Initial system is a SiC (NICALON) fiber and calcium aluminosilicate glass-
ceramic (Corning-CAS-III) matrix composite. %%%% This study combines
experimental and analytical approaches to study high temperature rheology of
continuous ceramic matrix composites. Both approaches are used for comparison
and serve to correct and support each other. This kind of study can have
possible applicability beyond the material system under investigation. It can
provide a solid scientific basis to understand high temperature rheological
properties of CMC. Improvements in the performance of CMC can be expected from
this study.
