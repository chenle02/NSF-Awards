This project will interface a mass selective detector and data station with a
donated gas chromatograph, so that undergraduate chemistry students at CUNY-York
College can utilize the powerful modern analytical technique of gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Students who major in chemistry or in
other disciplines of science will use GC/MS in instrumental analysis, in an
integrated physical-inorganic laboratory course, and in undergraduate research
projects. The students will be introduced to gas chromatography and mass
spectrometry first as stand- alone techniques, and later as powerful combination
techniques for separating and identifying the components of complex mixtures.
Particular laboratory projects will be chosen for their relevance to students'
interests and major disciplines. Acquiring GC/MS capability will enable CUNY-
York College to continue its significant contribution to chemistry education of
minority students.
