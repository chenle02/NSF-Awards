Persistent programming languages provide a simple mechanism to make data
persistent without the impedance mismatch that occurs when storing data in a
database. As a result, persistent programming languages greatly facilitate the
development of software that uses persistent data. A serious problem exists when
maintaining programs written in persistent programming languages. The storage
format for persistent data is derived from the structural representation of the
data's type as defined in the program. When the representation is changed, the
software is no longer able to access existing persistent data. This research
addresses the problems of type evolution . It is developing algorithms to
recognize complex type changes, to assist the software engineer in assuring that
persistent data conform to modified semantics of the software, and to assist in
identifying and updating code affected by structural changes to a type. The
approach relies on persistent types defined as abstract data types. Type changes
are identified by comparing the interfaces to the types, the structural
representations of the types, and constraints attached to the types. The
algorithms are being incorporated into a tool that provides computer-aided type
evolution support. The primary goal of the tool is to manage the complexity of
type evolution and provide assurance that evolution issues are addressed by the
software engineer while not restricting the ways in which the software engineer
modifies type definitions. A secondary goal is to automate data evolution for a
collection of well-understood type changes. The combination of flexibility,
automation, and concern with semantic issues is expected to provide advances
over existing type evolution support systems. Experimentation is using histories
collected from the development of real systems to evaluate the effectiveness of
the algorithms.
