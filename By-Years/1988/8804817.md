The PI's plan to study Rb-Sr isotopic systematics of gangue and ore minerals
and their fluid inclusions from two Mississippi Valley-type ore deposits
(Viburnum Trend and Tri-State districts). They have developed techniques for
analyzing small samples, which now makes such a study feasible. Thus Sr isotopes
will be studied along with Pb and S isotopes in Sulfides, trace metal and C and
O isotopes in associated dolomite vug-fills related to mineralization, and
chemical analyses of fluid inclusions in both ore and gangue minerals to enhance
understanding of (1) these ore deposits and (2) the nature and transport history
of the fluids from which they formed.
