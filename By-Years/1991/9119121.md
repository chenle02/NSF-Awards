Dr. Hobbs will continue his observational study of the origin and the evolution
of the element lithium in our Galaxy over essentially the full history of the
Galaxy. The objective of the work is to answer as directly as possible three
closely related questions: (1) What lithium abundance was produced in
nucleosynthesis at the Big Bang? (2) After the birth of our Galaxy, how has the
Galactic lithium abundance evolved with time, and owing to what physical
processes? (3) During the main sequence lifetimes of stars with masses of about
one Solar mass, what mechanisms progressively destroy the lithium in these
stars' atmospheres which was initially present? The method to be used consists
of measurements of a lithium spectral line in an unprecedented large number of
extremely old, metal-poor halo dwarf stars; in main sequence, proper motion
members of the old open cluster NGC 2420, which has an age near 4 billion years;
and in a comprehensive survey of the G and early K type main-sequence members of
the Hyades cluster of stars.
