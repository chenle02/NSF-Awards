The project is intended to improve the teaching and understanding of human
movement in undergraduate exercise science and physical education courses and
the quality of independent and advanced studies. The project provides funds to
assist in purchasing a Force Platform System. The Force Platform System provides
for qualitative and quantitative kinetic analysis of human movement and for
graphical data to be superimposed on video images of human performance. Course
instruction is enhanced by the system since mechanical principles are presented
graphically in relation to skill acquisition, injury mechanisms, and abnormal
movement patterns. Future teachers, exercise specialists, and health care
professionals can benefit from course enhancement. The Force Platform System
complements an updated Video Analysis System (Peak Performance) currently housed
in the Human Performance Laboratory. Students are able to conduct independent
projects quantifying both kinematic (movement patterns) and kinetic (forces
affecting movement) components of human performance. The principal investigator
has been actively involved in using and upgrading her expertise in both regular
duties and special sabbatical leave projects. The university's location and
local community involvement provide for numerous outreach opportunities.
