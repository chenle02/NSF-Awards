The ability to understand other people's goals and intentions is critical for
social competence. A key component of this is interpreting the reasons for
others' actions. Infants appear to be able to determine others' goals based on
observing others' actions early in life, and this sensitivity to others' goals
is associated with developments in infants' own ability to perform goal-based
actions. The purpose of this project is to investigate the neural and cognitive
systems that support infants' emerging sensitivity to goal-based actions in
themselves and others. This work will shed new light on how neurocognitive
development supports early social cognition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
studies will record electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique for recording the
brain's electrical activity, while 8- to 10-month-old infants perform actions on
objects, when they perform joint actions with others, and when they observe
others' actions. A first goal of the research is to characterize the neural
processes that are involved when infants learn to engage in new actions and
social collaborations. A second goal is to test the prediction that these neural
processes also support infants' understanding of others' goal-directed actions.
To address these issues, the research will evaluate networks of neural activity
as infants act and observe others' actions, and will assess whether these
patterns of neural activity predict when infants are able to respond
appropriately to others' goal-directed actions. Beyond addressing the focal
research questions, the proposed studies will generate new approaches to
analyzing infant neural and cognitive development, and the findings of these
studies with typically-developing infants may help to shed light on
developmental disorders that affect social cognition and social behavior. The
project will provide unique multidisciplinary training opportunities for
students and postdoctoral researchers.
