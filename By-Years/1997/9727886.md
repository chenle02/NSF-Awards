9727886 Peirce This is an award to support the exploratory phase of a research
project to determine the impact that land application of sludge has on ozone
pollution in the lower levels of the troposphere. The investigator will conduct
laboratory experiments to determine the flux of reactive nitrogen oxide from
agricultural soils in the absence of nitrogen amendments, in soils that have
been amended with sludge and soils fertilized chemically. Soils to be
investigated will be obtained from agricultural land comparable to that
currently being used for land application of sludge. Sludge will be obtained
from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina wastewater treatment plant. Results of
laboratory experiments will be compared with those from field studies to
determine the scope of additional research needed to relate existing knowledge
of the flux of reactive nitrogen oxide from natural and chemically fertilized
soils to soils that are used for sludge management. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted under Special Guidelines for Small Grants for Exploratory
Research (SGER) in NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide. Conditions relating to
production, transport and emission of nitrogen oxide from natural and chemically
fertilized soils are currently well defined. Recent emphasis on aggressive use
of land for sludge management suggests determining whether this knowledge is
sufficient to establish nitrogen oxide emission characteristics from these soils
and their role in contributing to emission and formation of atmospheric ozone.
Results of this project are expected to be used in determining the need further
research to guide engineering design of land application systems for management
of sludges and conditions under which air pollution from this source can be
minimized or eliminated. ***
