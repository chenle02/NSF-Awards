Professor Robinson will conduct research in the area of multi-dimensional
symbolic dynamical systems associated with tilings of the plane and higher
dimensional Euclidean spaces. These dynamical systems are continuous actions of
n-dimensional Euclidean space on compact metric spaces. They are related to
Ambrose-Kakutani-Rudolph representation theory. In addition, Professor Robinson
will continue his work on how various ergodic properties lift to extensions. In
particular he will concentrate on how joinings lift to extensions. In the early
1980's experimental physicists were surprised to see five-fold rotational
symmetry in what they thought to be a periodic crystal. This is however a
mathematical impossibility and it was later observed that the substance was not
periodic but rather "quasiperiodic". The research of Professor Robinson will
attempt to apply techniques from ergodic theory and dynamical systems to
understand this situation.
