The Earth's core plays an important role in the formation and chemical
differentiation of our planet, in global earth dynamics and earth rotation, and
in the generation of the magnetic field. This project focuses on three related
objectives, concerning the seismic imaging of the structure and rotation of the
inner core and the heterogeneity of the the lowermost mantle. (1) To constrain
the inner core rotation using fixed earthquake-station paths, which reduces
biases from unmodeled mantle heterogeneities and source mislocation. The project
will search for time-dependence of PKP(BC)-PKP(DF) differential times and
PKP(CD)-PKP(DF) differential times. Considerable effort will also be made to
address uncertainties in determining inner core rotation, in particular errors
from potential systematic event mislocation. (2) To model and invert for 3D
anisotropic inner core structure using PKP waveforms and differential times. The
project will test the recent proposal of a distinct innermost inner core and
examine the sharpness and lateral variation of the inner core transition zone
from the relatively isotropic upper inner core to strong anisotropy in the lower
inner core. (3) To map the heterogeneity of the lowermost mantle from the PKP
data collected, in particular, the Central Pacific core-mantle boundary anomaly
using abundant PKP samples from the earthquakes and stations in South America
and east Asia.
