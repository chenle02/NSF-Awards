9504840 Kompala This project is on research to characterize the dependence of
foreign gene expression on cell cycle phase of recombinant mammalian cells, and
to exploit this dependency for maximizing the production of heterologous
glycoproteins in high cell density perfusion bioreactors. The three major
objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to investigate the hypothesized key
role of promoters in determining the cell cycle phase in which the foreign
proteins are expressed in recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by using
the two-parameter flow cytometic analysis, and to identify and characterize a
strong G1 phase-specific promoter for maximizing foreign protein expression at
low growth rates; (2) to investigate whether the two opposing trends in the
relationship between the specific production rate and the cell growth in
continuous suspension cultures of recombinant CHO cultures are caused by G1- and
S-phase specific expression from the upstream promoters, and to exploit a strong
G1 phase specific promoter to maximize the production of a secreted foreign
protein in perfusion bioreactors with attached inclined settlers; and (3) to
investigate whether the smaller dying apoptotic cells can be removed before
their intracellular glycosidases and proteases are released into the medium. ***
