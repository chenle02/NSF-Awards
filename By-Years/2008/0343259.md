The College of Engineering (CoE) of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez
(UPRM) will to study the feasibility for establishing a new program track in
Bioengineering under the proposed project 'Bioengineering Research and Education
(BReEd) Experiences.' The BReEd program track has two main purposes 1) to
prepare students for job opportunities in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical,
medical devices and computer information industry; and 2) to prepare engineering
and biotechnology students and for graduate education programs in Bioengineering
or related fields (e.g., medical school, biology, clinical sciences.) The
certificate in bioengineering will provide minority students an opportunity to
get an introduction to a rapidly developing field of study and to receive
recognition for their endeavors. Students in the program must fulfill all the
requirements for an Engineering undergraduate degree and also meet the
additional requirements of the Certificate program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
BReEd project should provide broad bioengineering research and education
experiences to undergraduate engineering students. After completing the track
requirements students will obtain a Certificate of Enhancement in
Bioengineering. Through the BReEd program students should obtain new career
experiences through an enhanced curriculum, research experiences and industry
internships. The new track should support the goals of ABET EC2000 and apply
advances in the science of learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
