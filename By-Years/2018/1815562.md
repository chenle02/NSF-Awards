This award supports research in the mathematical underpinnings of cryptography.
Since the late 1970s, widely-used cryptosystems have been developed based on the
perceived difficulty of certain mathematical problems. New applications, as well
as improvements in attacks on existing cryptosystems, call for a better
understanding of these underlying mathematical problems. In particular, the
potential to develop quantum computers (and new techniques they would be able to
execute) puts many existing cryptosystems, such as the well known Rivest-Shamir-
Adleman (RSA) system and Elliptic Curve Cryptography, at possible long-term
risk. For this reason, it is important to study post-quantum alternatives, such
as lattice-based cryptology (which is the focus of this project). Lattices also
offer other potential benefits, including new types of functionalities such as
the ability to perform some operations on encrypted data (which would strengthen
cloud security).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project centers on the cryptographic
strength of special types of lattices (such as ideal lattices or integer
lattices) that are used in numerous recent proposed cryptographic schemes. The
investigator and collaborators intend to study the distribution of these special
lattices amongst larger natural families, to see whether or not they are
distinguished by presently-unknown geometric features that might make attacks
possible. They plan to use techniques from automorphic forms and algebraic
number theory. Tail bounds (such as Banaszczyk's tail bound for Gaussian mass)
will be studied for more general regions and functions appropriate to these
lattices. From a different, computational perspective, the project will explore
lattice-reduction algorithms tailored for these special types of lattices, and
analyze how challenging bases of these lattices can be
generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
