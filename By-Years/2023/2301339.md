The Thirty-Second Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and
Computing, will be held at the Middle Tennessee State University from May 13 to
14, 2023. The conference is part of an annual series that brings together
internationally known researchers, industrial mathematicians and computer
scientists, as well as post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students,
to discuss the latest advances in combinatorics, graph theory and computer
science.

The 2023 edition of the conference features four plenary speakers, Dr. Tomas
Kaiser (University of West Bohemia), Dr. Luke Postle (University of Waterloo),
Dr. Jinyoung Park (Stanford University), and Dr. Yufei Zhao (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology), who are leading researchers in combinatorics, graph
theory and theoretical computer sciences. There will also be 40 to 60
contributed talks. The conference website is
