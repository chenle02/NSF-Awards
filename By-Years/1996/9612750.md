This starter grant award to Stanford University supports the research of
Professor Thomas J. Wandless. The research focuses on two elements of the
cytoskeleton of cells: gamma-tubulin, a protein implicated in microtubule
nucleation, and FtsZ, a bacterial protein essential for bacterial cell division.
The research undertakes the expression and purification of gamma-tubulin, the
investigation of gamma-tubulin as a biologically-relevant receptor for the
antimitotic anticancer drugs, the determination of whether gamma-tubulin is able
to nucleate microtuble formation in vitro, and the analysis of FtsZ as a
possible receptor for antimitotic drugs as well as a structural model for the
tubulin family. The research will advance the fundamental understanding of
eukaryotic cytoskeletal structure and function and may point to new strategies
for the treatment of human disease.
