When a model of a one-dimensional (1-D) system is known precisely, many
properties of interest, e.g. stability, can be investigated through the analysis
of a set of polynomials in one independent variable. A difficulty in such an
analysis is that the set of polynomials may be infinite and the question arises
of how to reduce the study of this infinite set to the study of a finite set of
low order. Furthermore, the coefficients appearing in the set of polynomials are
generally not known precisely and only bounds on the coefficients can be given.
This brings up the question of the robustness of the properties of interest to
parameter variations. For 1-D systems, these two questions have been reasonably
well resolved. The goal of this research is to generalize certain results
regarding the above questions for 1-D systems to two- or three-dimensional
systems. Such systems are important in a number of engineering applications such
as optical image processing and robotics. In particular, the two general
research tasks are property invariance of n-dimensional polynomials under
coefficient perturbations, and polynomial irreducibility and a type of spectral
factorization.
