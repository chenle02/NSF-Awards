The creation of error-free software of any sort is a notoriously difficult
activity. For real-time software systems, which must interact with the world in
a timely fashion, the difficulties are even greater. Since these systems are
often used in safety-critical applications, it is especially important that they
be correct. The objective of this project is to create tools for the automated
verification of various correctness properties of real-time programs. The goal
is to guarantee rather than to test these properties probabilistically.
Therefore, the development of formal models and analysis techniques is a major
part of this research. This project defines techniques for controlling the state
space explosion problem in reachability-based real-time analysis. Several
techniques of this kind have been defined for (untimed) concurrency analysis.
These techniques have yielded excellent experimental results, for instance, in
the case of Petri-net-based deadlock detection in Ada programs. This project
extends existing techniques for concurrency analysis to real-time analysis and
defines new techniques for reducing state space size for real-time programs. The
product is a set of software tools for the verification of real-time programs
These tools would answer timing and other queries about programs written in a
high level language, using the program source code and information about the
timing properties of the underlying hardware.
