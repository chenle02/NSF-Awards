9603171 Stanley This award will support a research workshop on the geology of
Sonora, Mexico organized by Dr. George Stanley of the University of Montana and
Dr. Carlos Gonzalez-Leon of the Instituto de Geologia of the National University
of Mexico. The workshop will target topics that have important scientific
significance to the resolution of stratigraphic and tectonic problems in the
United States and Mexico by bringing together a group of Mexican and U.S.
researchers who share common interests in the geology of western Sonora.
Geologic units of principal focus for this workshop are the Triassic Antimonio
Formation, the Permian Monos Formation and the Triassic Barranca Group. Subjects
of interest directly related to these units include stratigraphic and regional
correlations, sedimentology, tectonic and magmatic evolution (including adjacent
tectono-stratigraphic terranes), paleogeographic settings and relationships
(including paleontologic and paleomagnetic research). During six days of
discussions and field trips, specialists will help unravel some complex problems
of Sonoran geology. Interactions between Mexican and U.S. participants are
expected to be a catalyst for future cooperative endeavors. ***
