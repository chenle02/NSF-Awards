A new interdisciplinary course will be developed that teaches quantitative
skills, along with elements of logic, in order to help students become capable
of true quantitative reasoning for students not intending to major in science
and technical fields. The course stresses the cross-disciplinary importance of
mathematics, science, and technology in a wide variety of academic and career
fields, as well as their importance to the citizenry of a modern democratic
society. An especially large fraction of the student audience includes women and
underrepresented minorities. The project will develop a textbook and a package
of computer courseware for use by the students, and manuals for the instructors.
