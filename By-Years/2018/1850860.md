Trends are found everywhere in socio-economic discourse about economic growth,
inequality, welfare, and economic disparities across regions and nations. They
play an important role in much economic theory and other areas of scientific
research. Methods of trend determination have been intensively studied in
economics for a long time, yet economists have little guidance on the source and
nature of trend behavior and therefore rely on a limited class of models to use
in applications. This research program will explore a new approach to studying
trends that involves modern machine learning methods. The goal is to model
trends when there is little practical or theoretical guidance about the nature
of the trending behavior. Methods will be developed to learn about trends in a
general function space environment that will enable wide application to study
socio-economic phenomena. These methods will be useful in other scientific
fields, such as climate change, where trends figure prominently.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and analyze an easy-to-implement
machine learning procedure that enhances the properties of existing methods of
smoothing and filtering data. The central idea is to iterate such filters in a
controlled manner to make them a smarter smoothing device for trend
determination. This approach involves methods of machine learning based on
boosting and the project will develop the necessary theory to justify their
application to non-stationary data that manifest trend behavior. In particular,
the project will develop a large sample limit theory for boosted filters that
will reveal its enhanced capabilities, focusing on the complex task of analyzing
properties of the boosting methodology in the context of non-stationary data
characterized by deterministic and stochastic trends allowing also for possible
structural breaks. The resulting theory will be applicable to a wide class of
underlying processes, thereby facilitating informed use of such machine learning
devices in practical work in economics and other disciplines where trend
determination is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
