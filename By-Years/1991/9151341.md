This project will improve the quality of the organic chemistry course. A Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometerand a 60 MHz proton NMR spectrometer will
allow curricular changes. The organic chemistry course will be expanded to four
hours lecture per week from the current three, enrollment in Independent Study
by students planning a chemistry major will be encouraged, and a second
introductory chemistry course that will use instrumentation will be developed.
Expanding the organic lecture by thirty two hours per year will increase the
topics covered, including structure elucidation by spectroscopic means. The
grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
