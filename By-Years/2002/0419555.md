This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIlR) Phase I project will develop a
portable device for oxygenating streams and other surface water bodies using a
combination of aeration and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF), a process often used
in settling tanks.

The commercial application of this project will be to improve surface water
quality in a variety of water bodies and to help restore habitats. The proposed
product is expected to find a place in three specific market segments of the
U.S. environmental industry, the ecosystem restoration market, the
bioremediation market and the wastewater treatment market.
