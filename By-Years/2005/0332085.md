0332085 Hozalski The main goal of the proposed research is to determine the
abiotic degradation pathways and kinetics for regulated (i.e. THMs and HAAs) and
unregulated or iremergingle DBPs (e.g., haloacetonitriles, halonitromethanes,
and haloketones) upon their reaction with iron metal, synthetic iron oxides, and
pipe corrosion products obtained from full-scale distribution systems. The
specific objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;1) determine the kinetics and pathways of
the degradation of DBPs in the presence of Fe(0) and Fe(0) corrosion
products,&lt;br/&gt;2) evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen and chlorine on
DBP degradation&lt;br/&gt;rates in the presence of Fe(0) and Fe(0) corrosion
products, and 3) determine the kinetics and pathways of the degradation of DBPs
in the presence of pipe solids and in pipe sections collected from full-scale
water distribution systems.&lt;br/&gt;
