This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project submitted by
Teragram Corporation will design and prototype critical theoretical and
algorithmic elements of a linguistic indexing and search software using finite-
state technology. Prototyping the architecture of a search engine will enable
searching and indexing syntactically and semantically related concepts. This
research project embodies linguistic and finite-state techniques for the purpose
of search and indexing of textual data. This prototype could lead to a new
generation of search and indexing technologies, which will enable better search
by accessing linguistically related concepts, while being flexible, fast and
scalable to huge amounts of textual information. The company's linguistic
technology is based on formal and algorithmic properties of finite-state
automata and finite-state transducers and enables linguistic processing at very
high speeds while achieving very high data compression rates. Finite-state
technologies have tremendous potentials in linguistic processing for indexing
purposes. If the proposed research meets its goals, the resulting software will
have numerous commercial applications such as file system indexing, document
indexing, and document retrieval and Internet search engines.
