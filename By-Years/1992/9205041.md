This proposed research is a continuation of the previous investigations on
excitation cross section measurement of molecular oxygen by electron impact for
Pseudo-continuum region (4 - 7 eV energy loss) and an extensive data analysis of
Schumann-Runge region ( 7 - 10 eV energy -loss). This experimental and
theoretical joint research program will determine absolute electron impact cross
sections for all the important electronic transitions of molecular oxygen in the
4 - 10 eV energy loss region. Differential cross sections of identifiabled
electronic states and vibrational excitations of electronic states will be
measured by a crossed-beam method over angles ranging from 12 to 160o with
impact energies ranging from near threshold to 200 eV. From the observed
electron impact process, the dissociation products will be identified by a
detailed analysis of the combined photoabsorption and electron energy-loss data
for the dissociation of O2 into ground and excited stated atomic fragments (
O(1D), O(1S)). These results will be analyzed by an extensive configuration
interaction calculation, performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in order to
obtain potential energy curves and dipole electronic transition moments from the
ground state to the excited states.
