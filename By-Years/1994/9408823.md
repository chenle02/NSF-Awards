9408823 Howell ABSTRACT Introduction to Computer Integrated Manufacturing into
Freshman Engineering Curriculum Northern Arizona University (NAU) will acquire
CNC desktop milling machines to use in its freshman engineering curriculum with
Autodesk providing software for the machines. NAU is a minority institution,
located near several large Indian reservations, whose undergraduates include
larege numbers of American Indian and Hispanic students. The NAU will use this
project as one way to create student interest in manufacturing and increase the
retention rate of engineering students by providing an opportunity to use a
modern CNC system. The milling machines and associated hardware and software
will also be used in advanced design courses. ***
