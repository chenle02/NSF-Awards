SES-0452973&lt;br/&gt;Jeff Manza&lt;br/&gt;Ernest Brooks&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will complete a large-scale
comparative analysis of the impact of public opinion on welfare state spending
and specific social programs in 17 OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation
and Development) democracies since the mid-1980's. The PIs will examine both the
sources of cross-national variation in welfare effort, and the dynamic responses
of nations (and their citizens) to the globalization pressures that have emerged
over the past 20 years. To carry out this investigation, the PI will develop and
analyze an original dataset, called the Public Opinion and Welfare States
Datafile. This dataset will combine and extend existing information about
welfare state spending in OECD democracies with cross-national public opinion
data available through the International Social Survey Project (ISSP). The file
will be constructed to provide cross-nationally comparable information. It will
ultimately include country-level information such as per-capita gross domestic
product, partisan control over government, mass policy preferences, and possibly
also union density. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The newly created dataset will be
made available for researchers interested in issues of policy responsiveness
within democracies. Thus, the project will provide not only resources that can
contribute to current debates, but also the platform for future research as
questions about the sustainability of different welfare state regimes becomes
increasingly important. Given the importance of welfare states to social
problems associated with poverty and inequality, the research addresses issues
that are of considerable interest to policymakers and the general public.
