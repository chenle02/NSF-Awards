Laboratory Courses in Nonlinear-Dynamics and Computational Neuroscience.
Mathematical and numerical models play a very important role in our
understanding of complex processes in a wide variety of scientific disciplines.
With the advent of highspeed graphics workstations and new mathematical and
numerical methods for describing complex dynamical systems, many difficult
problems can now be addressed. Coupled with the explosion in experimental data
in the form of large-scale data bases, digital timesefies, graphical images, and
video, these new developments have opened up exciting new interdisciplinary
frontiers in scientific computing and numerical modelling. The purpose of this
proposal is to request support for the development of two new undergraduate
courses in Nonlinear Dynamics and in Computational Neuroscience that will
utilize the state of the art facilities of the newly funded Laboratory for
Computational Neuroscience (DUE-9551414) at Wesleyan University. Hands on
laboratory experience in computer modelling and graphical data analysis has
usually been restricted to graduate and post-doctoral students. However, because
of the new computer technologies (high-speed graphics workstations) and new
theoretical ideas (nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory) and numerical methods
(high level programs for graphical and numerical analysis, like MATHEMATICA and
IDL) for describing complex systems, these exciting interdisciplinary fields
should be both accessible and appealing to undergraduate students. In
particular, the proposed laboratory courses should inspire and provide a testing
ground for additional undergraduate courses in Earth and Environmental Studies,
Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, and even Art and Architecture.
