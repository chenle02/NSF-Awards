This Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) grant requests support for
Experimental Physics research by Assistant Professor Ganezer and his students at
the California State University at Dominguez Hills. He plans to extend the
analysis of existing data from the Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) underground
water-cerenkov detector. He plans to search for evidence of solar neutrino
interactions in the IMB data. He further will characterize the response of such
water cerenkov detectors to low-level signals for future long- baseline neutrino
oscillation studies.
