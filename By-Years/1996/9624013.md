9624013 John-Alder Inbreeding can cause developmental problems, increase
susceptibility to parasites and promote the frequency of genetic disorders,
limiting the capacity of individuals to make use of different environments and
survive sudden environmental changes. Because of the potentially negative
effects of inbreeding, it is thought to be instinctively avoided by many
wildlife species. The research funded by this award will test whether inbreeding
is differentially avoided in four mammalian species having different social
structures and dispersal patterns. Disruption of normal dispersal patterns
through habitat fragmentation creates small, isolated populations in which
animals are unable to leave their natal ranges. Findings from this research will
address whether habitat fragmentation increases the frequency of inbreeding for
mammalian species with particular dispersal modes or kin avoidance behaviors.
These results can be used to inform reserve managers and wildlife biologists on
species-specific behavioral attributes that exacerbate the negative effects of
habitat destruction and fragmentation.
