The past forty years have brought an ever-increasing appreciation that the
interactions of quantum particles are controlled by fundamentally geometric and
algebraic structures. This has on one hand made algebra and geometry extremely
valuable in particle physics; and on the other hand has allowed powerful
physical intuition to be used in the development of pure mathematics. Continuing
in this tradition, the research goals of this project fit into a broader effort
to incorporate modern mathematical ideas and methodology in quantum field theory
and vice versa. In educational components of the project, the PI will host a
summer school on this theme for graduate students in theoretical physics and
mathematics and he will develop a series of lectures for undergraduate and
graduate students, freely available online, that delineate various connections
between modern algebra/geometry and quantum field theory.

In more detail, the PI will combine physical and mathematical approaches to
uncover new structures in supersymmetric gauge theory and geometric
representation theory. The PI and his collaborators have established the
beginnings of a deep relation between mirror symmetry in 3d supersymmetric gauge
theories and symplectic duality. Symplectic duality is an equivalence of
geometric categories associated to pairs of algebraic-symplectic varieties that
was conjectured by Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster, and that generalizes
many classic results in geometric representation theory (such as the Koszul
duality of Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel relating categories of modules for
simple Lie algebras). In this project, the PI and his collaborators will use new
techniques in gauge theory to establish a systematic construction of objects in
the categories relevant for symplectic duality, and an explicit duality map
between them. He will also define and investigate yet another category, of
Fukaya-Seidel type, that gauge theory predicts to be equivalent to the usual
categories in Symplectic Duality, but which seems to make many subtle aspects of
the duality manifest. Finally, he will extend the methods developed to study 3d
gauge theories to 4d supersymmetric gauge theories, where they lead to a
construction of the categories of line operators -- with far-reaching
implications for categorification of wall-crossing fomulas and of cluster
algebras.
