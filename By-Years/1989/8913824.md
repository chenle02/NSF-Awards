The goal of this project is to develop the methods and applications of
cylindrical algebraic decomposition (c.a.d.). The project includes the invention
of improved algorithms for various subprocesses, the implementation of both such
new algorithms and algorithms already devised but not yet implemented, and the
replacement of the current c.a.d. implementation with a new implementation
having improved structure and a more convenient, perspicuous and responsive
interface. The project will also explore the employment of parallel computation,
and the study and analysis of the behavior of the c.a.d. algorithm when applied
to numerous examples of various kinds.
