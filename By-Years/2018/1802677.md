While many studies examine people that move to cities from rural communities and
how they support family members left behind, this study looks at household life
in a community left behind by family members who have moved to cities to become
urban workers. As in many such communities, this community has become
increasingly integrated into the market economy because of tourism, cash crop
production, and improved basic infrastructure. This study examines how economic
changes have influenced economic ties between rural family members and urban
workers. It also investigates effects on the families left behind, including
changes in labor demands and gender relations. Results will be broadly
applicable to locations experiencing large scale rural-to-urban migration under
similar conditions of economic change. They will be useful to, among others,
external analysts trying to make sense of places undergoing economic
transformation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This study uses ethnographic fieldwork,
oral-history and key-informant interviews, and archival research to address the
following research questions: 1) How do the economic changes influence resource
transfers between rural family members and urban workers? 2) What are the labor
demands on family members who remain in the village, especially on women who
engage in subsistence agriculture, commercialized cash crop production, birthing
and raising children, and other types of care work? 3) How are gender relations
in the households affected? Findings will illuminate changes to community that
can result from economic change and will be useful to policy makers trying to
influence change or mitigate its consequences, forecasters seeking to anticipate
consequences of economic change, and communities trying to make sense of changes
that are occurring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
