Mathematical Science (21) The Departments of Mathematical Sciences at the United
States Military Academy (USMA) and at the United States Air Force Academy
(USAFA) are building on a history of annual teacher faculty development
workshops that are focused on pedagogical issues and at the same time
emphasizing learning by doing. This project is improving student learning in
mathematics courses by raising the standard of teaching excellence in
undergraduate mathematics programs nationwide. This is being done through the
following:

1) Increasing the number of mathematics faculty who have studied and practiced
sound,proven teaching methods and can share these ideas in faculty development
sessions,

2) Contributing to promoting and helping lead a nationwide network of
mathematics educators and administrators who are committed to promoting better
teaching and improved teacher education, and

3) Organizing a one-week workshop for two consecutive years that provides 20
mathematics educators each year with an opportunity to make substantive
improvements in the effectiveness of their teaching and in their ability to lead
faculty development programs at their institutions. These educators must express
an interest in initiating similar programs at their schools.

The content of the one week workshops can be incorporated into any school
program, either as a full continuous week or at various times throughout the
year. Classes and sample materials are provided to participants to utilize in
their own faculty development programs. The materials that are created for the
workshop, specifically the workshop schedule, lesson plans, readings from
applicable literature, and all available handouts, are available to the
participants of the workshop and will be broadly disseminated and made available
to educators in mathematics, who are interested in faculty development, through
publications, presentations and panel discussions at professional meetings, and
the internet.
