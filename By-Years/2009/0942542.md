Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nearly every major topic in an
elementary science course, student assignments include many practice problems.
Repeated practice helps students hone their skills. The project explores if
software can simulate authentic interaction giving students a more effective
experience than traditional rote drill-and-practice. Investigators are
developing courseware, called Syrus, to help computer science students develop
their skills with predicate logic and proof argument. Syrus allows student
interactions that are more flexible than can be achieved with practice problems
from a textbook. Students are not given a selection of answers to choose from
and are not simply told if their answers are right or wrong. Instead, open-ended
responses to practice problems are checked by sophisticated mathematical
software in real-time. The system generates an almost endless supply of problems
meeting instructor-specified criteria. Syrus is a web application available to
anyone, anywhere, using a standard web browser.
