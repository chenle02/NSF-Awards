This two-year award will support dissertation research on the effects of
rapidly rising CO2 concentrations on terrestrial ecosystems by Cathlyn Stylinski
at San Diego State University in cooperation with Dr. Franco Miglietta at the
CNR Institute of Agrometeorology and Environmental Analysis for Agriculture in
Florence, Italy. The main objective of the research is to investigate the long-
term effects of elevated CO2 on gas exchange, water relations, and distribution
patterns of evergreen and winter-deciduous oak species. The dissertation project
will take place in an enriched mixed oak forest community in Tuscany, Italy,
where a natural CO2 spring has enriched CO2 concentrations for centuries or
longer. CO2 springs provide an opportunity to compare effects from naturally
enriched communities to those from previous short-term manipulations using
seedlings and saplings in controlled environments and to observe changes over
different times scales and spatial scales. The research will benefit from the
work of the Italian institute on Italian CO2 springs and from the Principal
Investigator's work on the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on
Mediterranean-type ecosystems in such areas as California, South Africa,
Australia, Chile, and the Mediterranean Basin.
