Heterologous proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology are frequently
isolated in unfolded and inactive forms. These proteins must be refolded before
a useful product is obtained. In this proposal, a novel quasi-electric light
scattering (QELS) technique is proposed for use in studying protein refolding
and aggregation. Processing conditions that facilitate protein refolding and
environmental effects on the functional properties of the folded proteins will
be evaluated using beta-galactosidase as a model protein.
