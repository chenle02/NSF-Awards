This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
assess the feasibility of developing a nonintrusive diode laser sensor for
oxygen contamination in drug product bottles. In this project, designs for
overcoming problems associated with ambient oxygen signals and optical
interferences due to etalons will be examined. In addition, the sensitivity and
accuracy of the proposed technique will be demonstrated. Lastly, a preliminary
examination of the possibility of performing measurements on the production line
will be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this technology will be
extendable to nonintrusive measurements in a variety of packaged and bottled
food and drug products.
