9510569 Wooley The University of Michigan has for some time had a program of
3-year appointments for new doctorates designed to enhance their professional
development as mathematicians and educators. It's research programs are
conducted by a collabopative effort involving senior faculty, new doctorates,
graduate students and undergraduates. The Number Theory Group at Michigan is a
very strong group of researchers with quite diverse interests, and with a long
tradition of working with young faculty and students. The current program has a
heavy teaching component, and to achieve a greater balance between teaching and
research this award will enable them to reduce the teaching obligations of two
young Number Theorists.
