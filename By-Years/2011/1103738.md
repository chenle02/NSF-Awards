This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Luisa Cacheaux is "Characterizing changes in calcium channel
protein synthesis and its effects on neuronal excitability." The host
institution for this research is University of Texas at Austin and the
sponsoring scientist is Dr. Kimberly Raab-Graham.

A fundamental property of neurons thought to underlie learning and memory is
their ability to alter the strength of their connections with one another. One
way by which these connections are strengthened or weakened is by altering the
synthesis of new proteins at synapses, the junctions between neurons. There are
several proteins that serve as regulators of this process including a protein
kinase that is known as the mammalian target of rapamycin and is symbolized as
mTOR. This protein plays an important role in the control of cell growth and
proliferation. The functioning of mTOR is not fully understood and the goal of
the proposed research plan is to identify targets of mTOR and determine the
general mechanism by which it alters protein synthesis. There is preliminary
data indicating that a calcium channel protein is a likely target. Calcium
channels play an important role in determining neuronal excitability and
therefore characterizing interacting proteins at the synapse advances
understanding of how local protein synthesis changes neuronal excitability and
ultimately learning and memory processes.

Training objectives include the acquisition of new laboratory techniques in
molecular biology including advanced microscopy techniques and calcium imaging.
Career development activities include improving writing and public speaking
skills. Broader impacts of this project include a plan to mentor undergraduate
and graduate students from underrepresented groups as well as scientific
outreach to the community.
