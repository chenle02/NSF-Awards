Many of the really exciting advances in sciences are now being made in highly
interdisciplinary environments; and many of the important aspects revolve around
statistical issues. This conference will provide a forum in which to examine
three broad directions of expansion of multivariate analysis. These include new
directions in graphics, robust estimation, multiple time series, bootstrapping
and meta analysis. The impact of multivariate environmental statistics on
environmental research, policy and management is a second focus of the
conference which will also address contemporary statistical issues relating to
the environment, to ecology and to environmental health. Technical sessions are
planned on multidimensional signal processing with participation of specialists
in this area with expertise in statistics and probability and from engineering.
