This project will develop a new course - along with class notes and related
computer exercises - designed to strengthen freshmen programs in engineering.
The course called Introduction to Engineering Analysis will provide an
integrated treatment of vector mechanics, primarily statics, and linear algebra,
with a concurrent emphasis on the use of computer- based methods for solving
problems. Students will learn key principles of mechanics and linear algebra in
one integrated course. Students will be presented with a more coherent and
realistic picture of the relevance of linear algebra and computational methods
in the solution of engineering problems. The project will result in the
development of all instructional materials and a trial offering of the course,
followed by evaluations and revisions, and ending with a finished course and
associated notes and exercises, including computer exercises, which can be
disseminated to other institutions interested in this new approach.
