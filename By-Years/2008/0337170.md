Water-rich fluids are common in the deep crust and upper mantle. Because mineral
solubilities are high in these environments, liberation and migration of such
fluids causes significant mass transfer. Fluids generated by subducting
lithosphere transfer solutes from the slab and therefore play a fundamental role
in mediating chemical cycling in the Earth. Xenolith suites show that
significant regions of the upper mantle may be modified by passage of
H2O-CO2-NaCl fluids. During crustal metamorphism, solute-rich fluids may play a
crucial role in the redistributing matter. Quantitative understanding of the
processes by which fluids transport material requires accurate knowledge of
mineral solubility. At high pressures (>5 kbar), experimental challenges have
previously limited the availability of key data; however, new techniques now
make it possible to carry out studies on important model systems.

This project involves three sets of experimental studies of aimed at better
understanding high-pressure mineral-fluid equilibria: (1) studies of silica-
polymer formation over a broad range of pressure and temperature; (2)
experiments on the changes in solute chemistry associated with the second
critical end-point in the system albite-water; and (3) characterization of the
solubility of the volatile-bearing phases calcite and anhydrite.

The intellectual merit of the proposed investigation will be quantitative
constraints on the chemistry of aqueous species at high pressure, where existing
data are limited. Such data are critical for understanding how fluids
participate in the material cycling in the Earth. Broader impacts will include
student training and mentoring. The proposed experiments on albite- paragonite-
quartz are a component of Ph.D. studies of A. Antingano. The PI has also
included undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in petrologic research at UCLA,
resulting in published abstracts at professional meetings.
