This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of fluorescence digital imaging
hardware that will be interfaced to an existing video-enhanced DIC microscopy
system. The requested instrumentation will allow real-time fluorescence ratio
imaging, rapid sequential DIC and fluorescence imaging, and rapid sequential
imaging, of FITC and texas red fluorophores. Proposed investigations which will
utilized fluorescence imaging techniques address fundamental cell physiological
problems such as the mechanisms and control of vasopressin-induced apical
membrane water channel insertion and retrieval in "tight" epithelial cells, the
role of Ca2+ in regulating renal glomerular mesangial cell contractile behavior
and in controlling epithelial cell volume maintenance pathways and transcellular
cross-talk mechanisms, receptor-hormone complex cycling in mesangial cells, and
the role of capillary endothelial cells and intercellular communication in
regulating mesangial cell contractile properties. Fluorescence imaging
techniques provide an important new experimental tool for ongoing funded
investigations in the laboratories of the P.I. and co-investigators.
