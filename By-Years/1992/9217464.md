9217464 Kirtman This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the
collaboration of Bernard Kirtman of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Celso de Melo of the Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil. The
project aims to investigate the nonlinear optical properties of conjugated
polymers. The researchers will formulate theoretical methods that permit an
accurate, comprehensive description of these properties, which include
distortion due to coupling of vibrations with electronic polarization induced by
the oscillatory incident field(s); electron correlation; and non-resonant
frequency dispersion. Ab initio quantum chemistry calculations of all three
effects will be done for the prototype pi-conjugated polymer, trans-
polyacetylene using the finite oligomer approach. A transfer matrix method for
circumventing the extrapolations required with this procedure will also be
investigated. Both the U.S. and Brazilian sides will gain an understanding of
the interaction between high intensity optical radiation and conjugated
polymers, which could potentially improve the design of polymeric materials for
practical purposes. Students and postdocs on both sides will benefit from
training in non-conventional polymer methodologies. ***
