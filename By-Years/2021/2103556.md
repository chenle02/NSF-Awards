This RAPID award supports the real-time study of the impacts of COVID-19 on
housing insecurity and off-site residential modular construction design in rural
Alaska. Preliminary research conducted by the PI team demonstrates that COVID-19
has already changed how builders and architects work with rural Alaska
communities to design, construct and install off-site modular construction
projects. The PIs propose to document and analyze how new models of virtual
consultation and collaboration are being deployed, what roles resilience and
innovation play in the development of new building practices, and how new
building solutions affect family and community structure. This award lays the
foundation for subsequent research on how transformations in housing
construction intersect with broader concerns over limited rural infrastructure
in Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI team will conduct remote interviews and
participatory workshops with stakeholders to document the effects of the
pandemic on off-site residential modular construction practices. The proposed
work draws upon five months of preliminary research and existing partnerships
with builders, architects and engineers working on cold climate housing. RAPID
funding will enable the PIs to observe the initial stages of project design and
development, tracking logistical strategies and solutions employed by builders
working with remote rural communities. Initial focus will be on two off-site
modular building projects: elder pods in Unalakleet and a womenâ€™s shelter in
Allakaket. Broader impacts include greater responsiveness of builders to
expressed needs of rural and Indigenous residents in cold climates and support
for the development of more culturally appropriate and sustainable housing in
Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
