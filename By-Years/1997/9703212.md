The goal of this research program is to fundamentally change the activity of
tuning parallel and distributed applications, from a manual, user intensive
process, to an automatic one. The project will investigate four specific steps
towards this goal. First, it will seek ways to not only identify the place where
a bottleneck occurs, but also the cause of the bottleneck. Second, it will
develop techniques to permit programmers to evaluate different tuning
alternatives by predicting the impact specific tuning options will have on a
program's execution time. Third, it will expand parallel measurement tools
beyond computation and communication to include parallel I/O systems. Fourth, it
will investigate ways to close the performance measurement and tuning loop to
create self tuning applications that can automatically adapt to their
computational environment.
