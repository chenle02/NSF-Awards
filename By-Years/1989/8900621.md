A REU Site is established which will expose eight undergraduate students to
laser and optics research. This research area has been identified as one of the
key technical growth areas of the future. Inspiration for the students, mostly
women and minorities, to pursue graduates studies and research careers will
result from participating in research projects within the interdisciplinary
Center for Laser Studies. Examples of research projects are: (1) growth and
characterization of compound semiconductor lasers, (2) growth and
characterization of nonlinear hetero-barriers, (3) characterization of
nonlinear, multiple quantum-well hetero materials, (4) semiconductor lasers in
external cavities, (5) ultraviolet transmitting fibers, (6) multilayer thin
films for bistable devices, (7) solid state lasers at 3um, (8) fiber optic
systems for power by light, and (9) study of thermal transport in thin films.
