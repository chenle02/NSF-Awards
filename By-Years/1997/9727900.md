This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Brandeis University
supports the research of Professor Wenbin Lin. The theme of the research is
nanocrystal-functionalized materials for optical applications. Nanocrystallites
are intrinsically unstable due to high surface tension and need to be
incorporated into other matrices to enhance stability. This research examines
two new approaches to stabilizing nanocrystals by forming nanocrystal-
functionalized polymers and self-assembled multilayers. A surface modification
approach is used to prepare nanocrystals terminated with trialkoxysilanes or
negatively charged alkylsulfonate groups. These nanocrystal-functionalized
precursors are used to form self-assembled multilayers of nanocrystals via
siloxane linkages or by alternate adsorption of polymeric cations and
alkylsulfonate-derivatized nanocrystals. The research will lead to better
understanding of the fundamental properties of nanocrystals and to production of
interesting nanocrystal-functionalized materials. Such materials hold the
promise for applications as nonlinear optical materials, photo-catalysts, and
light-emitting diodes.
