Dr. Dahv A.V. Kliner has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kliner's doctoral degree was from Stanford University under the
supervision of Professor Richard Zare. Dr. Kliner intends to continue research
at the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara.
Dr. Kliner's area of postdoctoral research will be ultrafast spectroscopic
investigations of liquid-phase phenomena. Longer term, he plans to study the
liquid-liquid interface by optical second harmonic generation and sum-frequency
generation. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as
an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
