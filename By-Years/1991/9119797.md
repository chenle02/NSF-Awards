This research is directed at learning more about how coordination problems are
solved. The analysis is motivated in part by a desire to understand the
striking, persistent patterns of discrimination among Nash equilibria observed
in some recent coordination experiments; these patterns varied systematically
with the number of players and the payoff function, in ways that cannot be
explained by traditional equilibrium refinements. The basic premise of the
research is that, because players in coordination games are normally uncertain
about how other players will respond to their multiplicity of equilibria,
learning from experience in repeated play is likely to play a decisive role in
determining outcomes. The first step is to develop a realistic but tractable
model of the learning process that shows how the dispersion of players' beliefs
interacts with learning, using its implications for the probability distribution
of the limiting outcome (normally one of the equilibria of the underlying
coordination game) to explain the observed patterns of discrimination. The
ultimate goal is to understand more generally how the number of players, the
ways in which they interact, how their payoffs are determined, and their
opportunities to communicate influence coordination outcomes.
