Fine-scale physical measurements will be conducted on both sides of the air-sea
interface in the warm pool region of the Western Tropical Pacific. The goals of
the study are to improve our understanding of the physical processes that
control exchanges between the atmosphere and ocean during westerly wind bursts.
These measurements will take place during the intensive Observation Period of
TOGA COARE between November 1, 1992 and March 1, 1993. This work is a
collaboration between a Russian scientist (Soloviev, Shirshov Institute) and
scientists from the U.S., France and the U.K.
