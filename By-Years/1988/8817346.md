Data on principal stress orientation from shallow wells indicate a low
magnitude shear stress on the San Andreas Fault, California. These data are
consistent with heat-flow measure- ments and predictions, but are inconsistent
with estimated strength of rocks. This project will attempt to test the hypo-
thesis that the shallow well data are representative of the state of stress at
mid-crustal depths by determining the orien- tation of the principal stresses
that existed during activity on the San Gabriel fault, now deeply exhumed.
Paleostress orien- tations and mechanisms of slip will be determined by
petrofabric analysis of structures in the fault zone. Results will be compared
to laboratory data and applied to the problem of the apparently weak fault
strength.
