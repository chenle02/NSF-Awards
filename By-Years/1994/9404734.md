Greenberg 9404734 This proposal is for an investigation in the emerging area of
applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for solving large multidisciplinary
numerical problems. Artificial neural network (ANN) paradigms will be explored
to generate intelligent solution strategies using adaptive and parallel
multilevel solvers for large systems involving general 3-D models, where the
lack of regular structure makes it hard to use existing multilevel techniques.
We propose to study fast and massively parallel artificial neural network
algorithms for seeking solutions of multivariate non-convex optimization
problems and investigate AI-guided multilevel solvers.
