Mauldin plans to investigate the random generation of homeomorphisms of the
circle and other objects. Computer studies are useful here. He plans to develop
further methods of calculating and estimating Hausdorff dimension and measure,
particularly within the context of dynamical systems and random geometric
instructions. This includes an analysis of the Weierstrass nowhere
differentiable functions. He plans to characterize those continua which have
sigma-finite linear measure in some metric. He plans to develop further
techniques in descriptive set theory with applications to orthogonal transition
kernels (positive operators) and 1-1 selections in mind.
