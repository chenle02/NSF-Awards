This research will examine two aspects of reproductive control by the
environmental day-night cycle. First, Stetson plans to examine the mechanisms by
which two species of hamsters measure day length. The primary focus will be the
functional relationship between the environmental light cycle, the animal's
brain and its pineal gland. This gland has been shown by many investigators,
ourselves included, to translate neural signals designating day length into
hormonal (melatonin) output. The primary interest is an understanding of the
means by which melatonin output is read by the hamster as a long day
(stimulating reproduction) or a short day (inhibiting reproduction). Second,
Stetson plans to continue his examination of the means by which pregnant
hamsters transmit daylength information to their fetuses. This information is
used by the young, after birth, to regulate their response to daylengths of
intermediate duration. Again, the maternal pineal gland and its hormone
melatonin is involved in this process. He plans to examine possible mechanisms
that coordinate and regulated this information transfer process.
