This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for research by Dr. Joseph L. Templeton of the Chemistry
Department, University of North Carolina, on the reactions of coordinated
4-electron donor ligands. Templeton will synthesize chiral metal alkyne
complexes of niobium (III) and tungsten (II) containing new alkyne, alcohol and
eneyne ligands. Enantioselective reactions with resolved metal complexes will be
used to build intermediate size rings, to promote 1,4-conjugate addition across
the olefin tail of coordinated eneynes, and to cleave the alkyne to generate
organic products. Diastereoselective nucleophilic additions will be promoted by
aldehyde and ketone complexes. Platinum (IV) alkyne complexes will be studied,
and nitrogen activation will also be explored using analogous reactions with
isoelectronic dinitrogen. %%% Organic molecules will be tranformed while they
are attached to a metal. The reactions are of a special type in which the
"handedness" or chirality of the product is controlled. Development of powerful
and versatile reagents which can be selective in this way is the important goal
of this research. The results have implications for many industrial processes
which are catalyzed by transition metals and for the synthesis of pure organic
compounds for use in drug manufacture.
