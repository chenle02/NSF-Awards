This program recruits computer science and mathematics students who have
successfully completed a college-level calculus course, paying particular
attention to under-represented populations. Each CSEMS scholar is supported for
up to four years, through completion of the bachelor's degree. CSEMS scholars
benefit from the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation, peer
supplemental instruction programs and other services in the Center for Student
Learning, and the strong support for minorities provided by Intercultural
Programs. Each CSEMS scholar participates in an industry internship, an
undergraduate research experience, or supplemental instructional leadership.
