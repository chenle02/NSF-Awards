This project addresses the seismic performance of glass elements commonly used
in curtain wall window systems for building construction. Using a comprehensive
analytical and experimental approach, the project investigates the
serviceability (under simulated moderate earthquake conditions) and the ultimate
limit state performance (under simulated severe earthquake conditions) of
commonly used curtain wall glass elements. Project results will include
analytical data, experimental data, standard test methods, design guidelines,
and practical design modifications that will advance the seismic design process
and product offerings for architectural glass used in curtain wall systems. The
project will have a positive impact nationwide on earthquake hazard mitigation
and the reduction of economic losses resulting from seismic events.
