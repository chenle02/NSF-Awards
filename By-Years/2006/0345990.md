We know very little about the magnitude of genetic variation underlying parasite
resistance, or about the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of this
variation. This lack of information limits our ability to predict the evolution
of both host resistance and parasite virulence. This research seeks to
understand the source of genetic variation underlying resistance against
parasitism, and hence the evolutionary potential of this key ecological trait.
Experiments will test whether genetic resistance is associated with fitness
costs to the host in the absence of parasitism. The animal system to be employed
is the Sonoran Desert endemic Drosophila-Macrocheles mite association. The
approach will consist of generating behaviorally resistant genetic lines of the
host by artificial selection in the laboratory, followed by contrasting
resistant versus susceptible lines in terms of a broad spectrum of juvenile and
adult fitness traits under variable levels of environmental stress.

The results will contribute basic knowledge toward implementing sustainable
biological control of pest species, and hence they will be of significant
practical, societal and economic value. The work addresses how environmental
change, often seen on a global scale, affects levels of parasitism by
ectoparasitic arthropods, many of which are known vectors of transmissible
parasitic disease. The research will thus inform wildlife epidemiology,
conservation biology, and medical and veterinary research into the causes of
emerging animal epidemics.
