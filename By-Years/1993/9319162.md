9319162 Watkins This award provides expert help and staff support to further the
development and coordination of interagency activities related to U.S. research
in oceanography, global change activities, and related research and technology.
This includes support for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP),
especially with respect to the preparation of documents for interagency use and
the dissemination of information on the USGCRP to the U.S. scientific community,
federal planners, and other interested parties, including the international
community. Additional efforts include support for efforts to enhance cooperation
between NASA, NSF and the academic community relating to use of satellite remote
sensing in ocean science research plus scientific assistance and coordination of
research vessel clearances for research projects in the exclusive economic zones
of other countries. Financial support for the various activities is being
provided by NSF, NASA, ONR, Oceanographer of the Navy, and by interagency USGCRP
funds administered by NSF.
