An introductory course is being developed that provides contact between freshmen
and Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty and demonstrates the
relationship between science and mathematics fundamentals and their application
in a rigorous program of study. A primary goal of the project is to reduce
attrition between fifteen and twenty-five percent. The major objectives of the
proposed course are development of problem solving skills, a better
understanding of how calculus and physics relate to engineering, and an
understanding of the use of computers in problem solving. A textbook is being
prepared for the course. A comprehensive study of student retention is being
performed along with an evaluation of the resources necessary for full-scale
implementation. During the summer of 1993, a one-week workshop is planned with
participants from Texas universities, community colleges and high schools.
Results of the workshop will be widely disseminated and an advisory committee
will be formed in consultation with the National Science Foundation and workshop
participants.
