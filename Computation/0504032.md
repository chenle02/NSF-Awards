Traditional calculus is a central scientific tool for understanding phenomena
varying smoothly in time and space. Variational analysis extends the reach of
calculus beyond smooth scenarios to optimization problems in a wide range of
modern disciplines, including management science, control engineering, and
economics. This project bridges the gulf between an existing, well-developed
theory on the one hand, and much less-developed concrete applications on the
other. Nonsmooth geometry is challenging: unlike in calculus, the shapes and
structures of interest have corners and sharp ridges, frustrating traditional
mathematical and computational analysis. This project will relate the difficulty
of solving a nonsmooth optimization problem to a crucial theoretical notion of
its "regularity". In the longer term, the project will pursue effective
computational solution algorithms for nonsmooth optimization. A fertile
interplay between innovative theory, high-impact engineering applications, and
reliable solution methods is central to the project's success. Graduate
students, international dissemination, and interdisciplinary collaborations with
institutes of computing, control engineering, and industrial sciences, will all
play important roles in the project's development.
