AST- 9731106 Abstract Funds will be used to expand the pulsar system now in
Green Bank to provide the full arsenal of data acquisition that has been
demonstrated by the Berkeley and CalTech groups. The wider bandwidth incoherent
system will improve the sensitivity of high frequency polarimetry by a factor of
2.5, will allow sensitive searches for new pulsars, and provide new capability
for single pulse studies. The voltage recording system brings a unique
capability to Green Bank for precision timing, searches at very large dispersion
measure and very high time resolution studies of individual pulses. A 1-GHz
Acousto-Optical Spectrometer will be developed for pulsar studies. This can be
used to study diffractive scintillation and real-time steering of other
recordings to scintillation maxima.
