P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometry,
Combinatorics, and Algebraic Groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal concerns
a three-day conference, "Geometry, Combinatorics and Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Groups"
on the occasion of the sixtieth birthday of Robert MacPherson to be held
during&lt;br/&gt;the period of June 3, 4 and 5, 2004 at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, New&lt;br/&gt;Jersey. The organizing committee
consists of Robert Langlands, Pierre Deligne and
Mark&lt;br/&gt;Goresky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed
conference are (1) to bring together scholars from a&lt;br/&gt;variety of
disciplines with a common interest in geometric techniques and (2) to
describe&lt;br/&gt;some of the recent achievements of younger mathematicians in
MacPherson's school. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected that the audience will consist of
mathematicians from many different fields, and&lt;br/&gt;the speakers have been
requested to deliver survey talks designed to be accessible to such&lt;br/&gt;a
wide and varied audience. A substantial portion of the funding for this
confernce will be directed&lt;br/&gt;towards the support of graduate students
and postdoctoral mathematicians. The lectures&lt;br/&gt;are expected to be
accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.
The&lt;br/&gt;participation of women, underrepresented minorities and persons
with disabilities will be&lt;br/&gt;encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;
