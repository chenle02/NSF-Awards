9522758 Tranquillo This project is on research to provide a foundation for the
fabrication and evaluation of magnetically-oriented tissue- equivalents. The
investigator has previously developed an anisotropic biphasic theory of tissue-
equivalents which will be used to optimize the fabrication parameters for the
construction of a magnetically-oriented arterial media- equivalent. Also, a
magnetically-oriented collagen tube for guided nerve regeneration will be
developed. This research involves the use of a continuum mechanical model of
tissue equivalents describing the interplay between cell traction, network
deformation, and fibril and cell orientation to optimize the research design.
