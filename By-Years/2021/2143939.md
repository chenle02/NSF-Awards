This project expands the realm of experimental- theoretical simulations of the
processes occurring in Earth’s molten iron core that generate the geomagnetic
field. It provides fundamental laboratory data characterizing convective
turbulence. The outputs of this project will help to benchmark and validate
advanced theories of the Earth's core flow and to build predictive models of
planetary dynamo generation. This work will be useful to models of Earth's core
and other planetary dynamos, fluid turbulence, solar and stellar convection
zones, as well as oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. This project also will
provide training in laboratory experimentation, numerical and theoretical
modeling to three graduate students, at least two undergraduates and one
postdoctoral researcher. The project disseminating information on a set of do-
it-yourself experimental tools that can be used with students of all ages and
backgrounds (https://diynamics.github.io/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
comprised of three main tasks. In Task 1, the researchers will carry out
rotating convection experiments in water and silicone oils that are elucidating
principles about turbulent core convective flows. For Task 2, the project will
continue a series of liquid metal convection experiments, enhanced by closely-
coupled numerical simulations. These experiments will focus on making the first
ultrasonic Doppler measurements of velocity fields in turbulent magnetostrophic
convection, to quantify and diagnose the complex dynamics occurring in a
simulated polar parcel of Earth’s core fluid. Task 3 will carry out coupled
laboratory-numerical simulations of rotating convection occurring at low
latitudes in Earth’s core via the development of a new parabolic free surface
convection device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
