The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) was
established to facilitate the collection, organization, and dissemination of
information related to earthquake engineering to various user groups including
researchers, practicing engineers, educators, public officials, and the general
public. There are presently two branches of NISEE; one located at Caltech and
one located at U.C. Berkeley. In addition to its national role, the Caltech
Branch is a resource for the large and active community of earthquake
engineering and seismic safety related specialists in the Southern California
region. The Branch has undertaken an initiative in the area of strong-motion
studies. A special Strong-Motion Center has been established to meet the growing
needs of individuals involved in strong-motion data acquisition and analysis and
those in such fields as risk assessment, seismic hazard determination,
structural performance analysis, and code development. The Caltech Branch also
has a library collection and resources that are useful to those in the areas of
public policy and earthquake preparedness.
