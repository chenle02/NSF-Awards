This three-year grant will support a faculty member and two graduate students to
continue and complete a high precision measurement of charge symmetry breaking
in neutron-proton inelastic scattering at TRIUMF, byEmeasuring the small ( 1 per
mil) forward-backward asymmetry in the produced deuteron center-of-mass
distribution. It will also enable participation in an experiment at the LEGS
facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory to carry out sum rule measurements of
the spin-dependent Compton amplitude through measurements of the
photodisintegration of the proton and neutron from pion threshold to 470 MeV, as
well as related experiments in kaon electroproduction with the CLAS detector
facility at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Partial support
will be provided by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) as part
of an enabling initiative in instrumentation development; this will help enable
the CLAS effort. Ohio University is also providing support for equipment and
partial support of a post-doctoral fellow to enable this work.
