This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the source of
compounds containing tin in the aquatic environment and their transformations
and fate when subjected to environmental forces. The use of compounds containing
tin in formulations of anti-fouling paints is increasing rapidly. The objective
of this research is to study the accumulation and decomposition of tin compounds
by bacteria that are resistant to its toxic effects and to determine effects of
processes that involve tin compounds on algae, pore water/sediments and
shellfish. This proposal has objectives consistent with those of the
Environmental Engineering Program. The investigator's qualifications are
consistent with the nature of this work to be conducted. This is a renewal of
research previously conducted under NSF Grant No. CEE-8116960 under which the
investigator developed analytical techniques and model systems for the topic on
which he now proposes to concentrate his effort, viz. on the environmental
"compartments" through which tin can move. Award is recommended as a 36-month
continuing Grant, the initial increment of which is in the amount of $72,224 for
12 months starting on December 15, 1986.
