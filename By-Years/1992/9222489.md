The proposal focuses on the subject of electron correlations in simple two
electron systems. Computations of energy and angular distributions produced by
charged particle and photon impact are undertaken in the region where three
coulomb particles are free. This problem still remains as one of the most
difficult challenges of modern atomic physics, especially at low impact
energies.
