Sketches are compact data structures maintained in network switches that store
the summary of network data flows and permit answering queries with estimated
results. This project aims to develop new virtual sketching methods that reduce
big network data to measurement summaries orders-of-magnitude smaller than what
the traditional sketches can do. The new methods hold the promise of allowing
routers to perform measurement on large network traffic at line speed, allowing
enterprise systems to keep their network data records for much longer time, and
allowing users with ordinary computing resources to work on big network
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major research thrust in sketches is to reduce
their memory footprint. Virtual sketches permit different flows to share a
common pool of memory.&lt;br/&gt;Space sharing can drastically reduce the memory
requirement, but this sharing introduces noise. Fortunately, we find that for
randomized sharing schemes, the noise can be statistically measured and removed.
This project will investigate (1) a theoretical study on new methods of space
sharing, (2) common procedures for highly efficient online operations on virtual
sketches with low overhead, (3) spatial virtual sketches for joint measurement
of network data at different routers, (4) temporal virtual sketches for joint
measurement of network data across different time periods, and (5) virtual
composite sketches for sophisticated network data measurement.
