As the amount of test data required to test new generations of complex system-
on-chip (SOC) designs continues to grow rapidly, conventional external testing
approaches where all test data is stored on the tester and transferred to/from
the chip is becoming increasingly difficult. Testers have limited speed, memory,
and I/O channels. The limited test data bandwidth between the tester and the
chip is becoming a major bottleneck that is projected to become much worse. This
project involves developing hybrid schemes that combine external testing and
self-testing approaches in novel ways to ease the burden on the external tester.
Such techniques can provide the best of both worlds. The overhead and fault
coverage limitations of self-test approaches can be overcome by intelligently
making use of deterministic data from the tester to guide the self-test
hardware, while the test data bandwidth and storage requirements for the
external tester can be reduced by orders of magnitude. Some of the questions to
be answered in this research include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the most
efficient ways to use deterministic data from the tester to guide test pattern
generation hardware on the chip.&lt;br/&gt;2. How to minimize the hardware under
a constraint on test data bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;from the tester.&lt;br/&gt;3. For
a system-on-chip (SOC) with multiple cores, what is the best way
to&lt;br/&gt;configure the hybrid test hardware for each core.&lt;br/&gt;4. How
can deterministic data from the tester be used to reduce
power&lt;br/&gt;dissipation during self-test.&lt;br/&gt;5. How can delay fault
coverage be improved with a hybrid scheme.&lt;br/&gt;
