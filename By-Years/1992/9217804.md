A combined experimental and modeling approach will be utilized in an
investigation of sediment transport and flow characteristics over
topographically uniform and nonuniform bed forms. Three areas will be addressed:
bedform mechanics, bedload transport, and suspended load transport. The
theoretical aspects involve development of a model which includes the coupling
of flow and erosion of the sediment bed. A novel feature is the utilization of a
moving belt to hold a migrating dune in place for experimental observations.
Predictions of sediment transport by ocean currents and in rivers is still
unreliable and based on empiricism from limited data; this investigation will
adavance understanding and predictive capabilities.
