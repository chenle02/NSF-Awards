This award supports research on the structure of certain classes of finite rank
indecomposable Butler groups, co-purely-indecomposable modules over a discrete
valuation ring, and finitely generated indecomposable modules over pullback
rings. Included are projects for classification by invariants. Particular
attention will be devoed to determining finite, tame, or wild representation
type for each class considered. Infinite dimensional Z-representations will be
used to investigate problems revolving around realizations of (nonabelian)
groups as automorphism groups of fields. This project is in the general area of
abelian group theory. It is concerned with the classification of abelian groups
and the application of this knowledge to other areas. Although the
classification of finite abelian groups has been well understood for a century,
the classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive. This research
involves this old problem of classification of the infinite abelian groups
approached by new tools from logic and topology.
