9509800 Cheung The research addresses Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation for (1)
buried dielectric (oxide) formation (SIMOX), (2) ion-beam mixing with
simultaneous deposition and implantation to form GeSi and GeSiC systems and (3)
plasma modeling with 2D effects of plasma lateral nonuniformity and ion-beaming
mixing. This research emphasizes subsurface material synthesis where the
implantation is not constrained by thermal equilibrium and implanted
concentrations greater than solid-solubility can be performed. In addition to
buried dielectrics there are variations on the technique to realize buried
oxynitride (SMON) and buried semiconductor heterojunctions (Si/SiC/Si). The
intent in the plasma modeling area is to relate plasma parameters to electronic
device characteristics. ***
