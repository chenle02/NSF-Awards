The study of heavy metal tolerance has provided one of the most sources of data
for understanding the processes of adaptation and natural selection. Jonathan
Shaw was one of the primary players in the indepth exploration of this
phenomenon among the mosses. The proposed research is a continuation of his
interest in this group of organisms and this phenomenon, and it will extend that
work to the study of patterns of evolution in the entire subfamily. The proposal
will incorporate undergraduate students into the full scope of the research and
provide them with valuable experience in planning and conducting a detailed and
complete inquiry. Among the questions to be considered is the degree of genetic
diversification among widely scattered populations of copper-mosses that are
morphologically very similar.
