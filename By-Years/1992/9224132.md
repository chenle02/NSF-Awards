This award is for support of a two year project to extend a strain network,
established by a European group, 30 km downstream from the GISP2 drilling site
in order to provide additional data needed for modeling of the ice flow at the
GISP2 site. The ice flow modeling is needed to provide information on the depth-
age relationship of the deepest ice where annual layers are lost. This
information is critical for dating the deep ice of the GISP2 core.
