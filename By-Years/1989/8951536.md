A micro-computer instrumentation laboratory is being developed to augment
traditional laboratory courses through the introduction of the PC as a powerful
tool for data acquisition, real time computation, and digital control of
electro-mechanical systems. The undergraduate laboratory supported by this
facility consists of courses in measurements, automatic control theory, heat
transfer, engineering modelling, analysis and control. These courses include a
series of experiments to provide students with an opportunity for experimental
verification and reinforcement of the fundamentals of a digital oscilloscope, DC
motor speed control, signal processing and filtering, free vibration response,
Fourier analysis, model identification of a beam, temperature control systems,
and DC servo mechanisms. This project is being matched by an amount equal to the
award.
