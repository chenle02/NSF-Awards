9400877 Killeen The objective of this research is to continue and extend a
series of theoretical studies of the Earth's upper atmosphere, involving
applying various post processor computer programs to study the physically
significant processes that cause change in the various fields calculated by the
model. The focus of this work will be on two areas: (1) existing post processors
will be maintained and modified to match the continuing development of the
Thermosphere/Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model to provide
improved diagnostics of thermospheric processes and aid in CEDAR experimental
investigations; and (2) a series of scientific studies are proposed: a
thermodynamic term analysis of wave modes, a study of momentum dissipation's
role on particle transport, causes of the distribution of minor species, ion-
neutral and neutral-ion coupling, and so forth. Finally, this project will be
collaborative with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ***
