This award funds research in game theory. The PIs study strategic situations
using mathematical models, with an emphasis on certain types of auctions. They
establish that the equilibria of such auction-like games converge, as the number
of players grows, to the outcomes of some inventive-compatible and individually
rational single-agent mechanisms. This enables the use of tools developed for
mechanism design to approximate and study the equilibria of auction-like games
with a large number of players. The research team uses this idea to study
contests, uniform price auctions, and double auctions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many kinds of contests with large numbers of
participants. University admissions, promotions in large corporations, and
prizes for outstanding accomplishments are all examples. This project will give
us new tools to determine how differences in contest rules affect the outcomes
of the contest.
