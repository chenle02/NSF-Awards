This research will examine flows which involve two immiscible fluids. For such
flows, there are a number of theoretical possibilities for the shape of the
boundary which separates the two fluids. However, experimental results indicate
that some boundary shapes are preferred over others. This work will investigate
the selection mechanisms for boundary shapes. Physical modeling, analytical, and
computational techniques will be used to study the stability of various stable
arrangements and the appearance of new arrangements from unstable
configurations. This work could lead to a better understanding of practical
applications including the formation of bicomponent fibers, transport of oil in
pipelines, ink-jet printing, and lubrication with two fluids.
