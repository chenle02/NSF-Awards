Abstract:

The primary goal of the work described in this proposal is to understand some
nonlinear elliptic equations which arise from problems in geometry and analysis.
The research will be focused on geometric problems in four areas: Plateau-type
problems for hypersurfaces in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, complete
conformal metrics determined by functions of Ricci tensor on Riemannian
manifolds with boundary, problems in isometric embedding of 2-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds of positive or negative curvature, and complex Monge-Ampre
equations. These problems involve solving some fully nonlinear partial
differential equations. Because of their origin in geometry, these equations are
closely related and therefore share many common technical issues. Progress in
this project may lead to solutions to others problems in the theory of nonlinear
partial differential equations on manifolds and geometric analysis.

The theory and methods of geometric analysis and fully nonlinear equations play
important roles in understanding difficult problems in pure and applied
mathematics, such as the Poincare conjecture, the positive mass theorem and
Penrose inequality in general relativity, and applications in image processing,
optical reflector designs, optimal mass transport, mathematical biology and
physics. The proposal concerns some very typical problems in differential
geometry and highly nonlinear partial differential equations. The research will
advance the understanding of these problems and develop techniques that will be
useful in studying fully nonlinear equations which arise from other problems in
mathematics and physical sciences.
