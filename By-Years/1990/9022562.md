This award is for the acquisition of a distributed memory MIMD computer to
support research across several disciplines. These areas include: load balancing
by task partitioning on MIMD computers, development of distributed algorithms
for Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms applied to thermodynamic problems, finite
element methods for modeling nuclear waste repositories, groundwater quality
modeling, and adaptive algorithms for modeling sub-particle interactions. The
development of parallel computers is lowering the cost of super computer
performance machines. Many universities can now do scientific computing in a
number of application areas that required super computers in the past. Western
Michigan University has developed expertise in the use of Multiple Instruction
Multiple Data computers. The acquisition of this computer will benefit
scientific research in computer science, physics, ecology, and numerical
analysis.
