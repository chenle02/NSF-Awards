This project addresses atomic level details of chemical reactions, transport
phenomena, and epitaxial crystal growth underlying metalorganic vapor phase
epitaxy(MOVPE) of advanced III-V compound semiconductor structures. Major
emphasis is placed on basic studies of doping and contaminant processes for
improved understanding and controllability. A systematic experimental and
computer simulation approach is being taken to address these issues. Fundamental
details of carbon and zinc doping of gallium arsenide during MOVPE as a function
of primary epitaxy growth variables as well as mapping of doping uniformity will
be carried out. MOVPE has become a premier technique for the growth of compound
semiconductors, but the limited uniformity and the control of electrical
properties of such material restricts the general applicability of the method
and has limited its utilization for advanced electronic and optoelectronic
device and circuit development. The basic studies being pursued on this project
will provide additional fundamental information at the atomic level critical to
the understanding and utilization of MOVPE, and thus, will have important
technological benefits to the field of microelectronics as well as to our basic
scientific knowledge base.
