Hopa Mountain, a Bozeman, MT based nonprofit organization, in collaboration with
the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College, is
scaling up their Track 2 Native Science Fellows program to engage up to 20
Native American college students annually in community-based geosciences field
experiences and careers. Working together, these organizations provide role
models and work experience for Native American tribal college and university
students interested in the geosciences; develop an annual Fellows gathering with
peer networks of Native college students that are interested in pursuing
geosciences careers; and strengthen the network of colleges, organizations and
science professionals who are committed to the success of Native students,
providing students with on-going support for personal, academic and professional
success. Additionally, the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center is organizing a
week-long Native Science Summer Institute for 25 secondary students. These
career-ladder fellowship programs are designed to expand the number of Native
American students in the Northern Rockies that are pursuing geosciences degrees
and careers.
