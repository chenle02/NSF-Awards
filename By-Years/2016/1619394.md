Narrative texts and personal conversations typically revolve around situations
that people find themselves in. Current natural language systems extract only
the literal meaning of events, failing to recognize how people are impacted by
them. For example, if a man says that he has been laid off or diagnosed with
cancer, then a system should understand that he is in a negative situation. If a
woman says that she just graduated from college or has been promoted at work,
then a system should understand that she is in a positive situation. This
project develops technology to automatically identify situations that positively
or negatively impact people. Affective knowledge is essential for applications
such as sentiment and social media analysis, for example to recognize at-risk
individuals experiencing adverse situations that may make them a danger to
themselves or others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops natural
language processing technology to recognize implicit affective states associated
with events. Events and states are represented as situation frames and
automatically harvested from large text corpora. Implicating situations are
learned from blogs using semi-supervised label propagation with context graphs
to propagate positive/negative evidence based on topic clustering, event-event
co-occurrence, and discourse relations. Implicating situations are learned from
tweets using bootstrapping methods applied to affective and sarcastic tweets.
Each affective situation is automatically assigned a polarity and connotative
strength. This research advances human language technology toward fundamentally
deeper language understanding about affective states, motivations, and goals for
narrative text and conversational dialogue.
