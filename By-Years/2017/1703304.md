Software developers create and maintain software of all kinds, from consumer
applications, enterprise business software, and government websites, to safety-
critical systems that manage infrastructure for airplanes, traffic, and water.
Implicitly, software developers use programming strategies to read, write, test,
and repair software. This project will systematically investigate these
strategies, developing new ways to describe, disseminate, and effectively teach
programming strategies. The project will also explore the effect of programming
strategies on productivity, investigating if and how they mediate the
effectiveness of software development tools and techniques such as programming
languages, software development methodologies, and developer
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach will encompass a comprehensive set of
studies of two kinds. The first kind will be systematic analyses of recordings
of software developers at work, made possible by the recent availability of
hundreds of thousands of hours of work live-streamed by developers on popular
websites. The project will extract strategies from these diverse videos,
curating these strategies in a repository of abstract strategy descriptions. The
second kind of study will be a series of laboratory and field studies
investigating how programming strategies vary in effectiveness as well as how
strategies mediate the effectiveness of developer tools and techniques.
Together, these studies will create a scientific foundation for the study of
programming strategies as well as a practical new resource offering a repository
of strategy descriptions to both researchers and educators.
