9320717 McCoy The research to be performed under this SGER grant will further
develop, and make known to the research community, a new mathematical framework
for accommodating the wide range of length scales for observing material
heterogeneity. The PI will carry out research employing the newly developed
Theory of Multiresolution Decomposition, which is based on the use of discrete
orthogonal wavelets. This approach will be applied at the interface of mechanics
and of materials science through the "Theory of Phase- Space Substructuring"
that allows for the rigorous investigation of the physics of across-scale
coupling... an issue which is central to the application of mechanics to
materials science. By application of this new methodology, a class of problems
which, hitherto, was inaccessible (namely, that category of phenomena in which
different stochastic processes are operative on different length scales) now
becomes amenable to rigorous analysis. This type of problem is typically
encountered in investigations which have as their goal an understanding of how
the macro properties of materials depend on their microstructure. ***
