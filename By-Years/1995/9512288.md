9512288 Mora This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of an isotope ratio gas source mass spectrometer system to be
installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Tennessee-Knoxville. The University of Tennessee is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The equipment will
be used primarily in the research and teaching activities of the principal
investigator and colleagues who require its analytical capabilities in graduate
training and in research projects including isotopic studies of soil carbonates
and clays to interpret paleoclimatic changes, biochemical studies of the Arctic
marine environment and groundwater research. ***
