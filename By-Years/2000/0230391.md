The proposed research seeks to identify the causes for increased discharge from
Russian rivers to the Arctic Ocean over the past 65 years. The research will
then attempt to place these trends into a longer-term (century to millennial
time scale) context. The first objective will be approached through quantitative
analyses of daily discharge records from major Russian rivers over the past
century, starting with a "data rescue" of paper-format records. Securing the
second objective will require modeling of paleo-discharge using publicly
available tree ring data from well-distributed sites across Arctic Russia. The
research will result in a substantially improved understanding of spatial and
temporate runoff patterns across the world's largest Arctic landmass, and a
historical context by which to evaluate contemporary trends. This understanding
will help to answer questions about recent discharge increases, namely, "are
they unprecedented?", "where is the water coming from?", and "what physical
processes drive them?".
