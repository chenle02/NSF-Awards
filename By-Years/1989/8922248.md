The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will acquire a modern flow cytometer
for marine biology and oceanographic investigations. Flow cytometers have proven
to be effective tools for ocean science research. Within a cytometer, a stream
of bacteria, phytoplankton cells, or other microscopic particles is passed
through a laser light beam. Different cells and particles can be automatically
enumerated and classified according to how they fluoresce or react in response
to the laser light. Analysis of the fluoresced signal can yield important
information on cell size, cellular constituents, and metabolic condition. The
new cytometer will be portable so it can be used at sea with fresh samples. It
will also be available for use by guest investigators.
