Through this grant, the university is integrating a benchtop Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system into sophomore organic lecture
courses and laboratories, the junior level organic laboratory sequence,
analytical and inorganic laboratories, and the advanced
physical/instrumental/analytical laboratory, aided by the existing campuswide
Novell computer network. The project is introducing new experiments to the
curriculum and dramatically improving existing experiments. In these
laboratories, GC/MS enables students to identify unknowns from their molecular
ions, distinguish isomers from fragmentation patterns, conduct EPA-approved
analyses, and identify and quantify complex product mixtures. The GC/MS system
is also used in undergraduate research projects, where it substantially
increases the sophistication and the rate at which product analysis is
performed. This broad exposure provides a seamless transition between
introductory skills and advanced research training. Approximately 300 chemistry,
biochemistry, and biology students use the instrument per year.
