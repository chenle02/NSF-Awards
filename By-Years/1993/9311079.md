9311079 Mulkey The purpose of this Dissertation Improvement grant is to examine
relative growth rates, root-shoot ratios, net assimilation, and relative species
dominance as determinants of productivity and community composition under
constraints of light, mycorrhizal infection, and hyphal transfer. A series of
experiments will examine these factors at the individual, intraspecific, and
interspecific levels in the laboratory and in the field. Field experiments using
labeled phosphorus and carbon will be used to monitor transfer of nutrients from
mycorrhizal fungi to plants and vice versa. Studies will be conducted at the
Smithsonian Tropical Forest Research Institute to address the role of fungi in
the restoration of degraded tropical forest ecosystems. %%% This study will
obtain the first tropical data on the complex interactions of light, infection,
and translocation, and will demonstrate the extent to which these affect
individual plant production in a community, as well as local community dynamics.
These data are critical for a better understanding of the belowground ecosystem
and how it affects natural succession and reforestation in the tropics. ***
