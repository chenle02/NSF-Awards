Abstract

DMS-0102940 Haller

The mathematics of turbulence, the "last unsolved problem of classical
physics," has traditionally been statistical in nature. This approach leads to
long-term predictions of the bulk properties of generic fluid flows. In
contrast, many technological and geophysical mixing problems, such as mixing of
fuel and air in a combustor, or the spread of an oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico, call for detailed finite-time predictions on turbulent mixing.

This project is concerned with further development and novel applications of the
recent theory of finite-time mixing. This new nonlinear theory enables one to
analyze concrete numerical or experimental velocity fields and isolate global
structures in the flow that is responsible for mixing or lack thereof. The
project will involve applications of these new techniques and their extensions
to global circulation models, vortex breakdown and merger, ocean drifter data
analysis, mixing enhancement in combustors, and continuous steel casting.
