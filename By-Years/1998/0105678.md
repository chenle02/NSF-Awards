Title: Algorithms for approximation and graph problems PI: Richard Cole
CCR-0105678

This research concerns the finding of approximate solutions. It is often the
case that finding exact solutions is vastly too expensive in terms of the time
required, to the point of being infeasible. Yet fairly accurate solutions which
are "good enough" may be obtainable in a much shorter time, and consequently be
more practical. The specific problem domains on which this research focuses
range from pattern matching (for example, devising algorithms to find similar
and/or repeating patterns in DNA sequences) to intrinsically intractable
problems such as the travelling salesman problem (which amounts to finding a
shortest route connecting a collection of cities).

The research on string matching is considering new notions of approximation so
as to devise efficient algorithms for a broader class of approximate matches
than is feasible presently; both searches between pairs of strings and against a
database of strings are being studied. The second part of our research focuses
on NP-hard problems. We are looking at multicost shortest path problems (e.g.
with a cost comprising both time and price) in which one seeks all non-dominated
solutions, at improving the quality of approximations for the Travelling
Salesman Problem in the plane, and also at improving the approximations
obtainable for generalized Steiner Tree problems.
