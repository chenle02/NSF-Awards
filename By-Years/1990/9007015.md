The East African Rift Valley Lakes are remarkable for the large number of
unique cichlid fish species which they contain. Lake Malawi, with over 250
species of endemic cichlids, has more species of fish than any other lake in the
world. To better understand the evolutionary mechanisms which produced these
many species, portions of the mitochondrial DNA of these fish will be sequenced.
The sequences will then be used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships
among the cichlid fish in Lakes Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria. These studies
will have an important impact on ecological and evolutionary studies of these
fish. A clear phylogenetic hypothesis for the taxa will allow inference of the
morphological, ecological and behavioral characteristics of ancestral species,
which is important to our understanding of how these species flocks arose.
