This award supports one trip per year, over three years, to Australia by Dr.
Pratsinis. At the University of Queensland, Department of Chemical Engineering,
he will work with Dr. James D. Litster, bringing together two scientists from
different perspectives: The U.S. PI works with ultrafine particles in gases, the
Australian with fine particles in liquids and gases. The former has recently
developed new approaches to accurate solutions of the population balance
equation, which the latter is applying to develop control schemes for the
particulate industry. The project should result in new modelling techniques to
be applied to industrially important processes, such as granulation of
fertilizers and alumina precipitation. The models can used to test and optimize
processes and control schemes, resulting in greater productivity and better
product quality.
