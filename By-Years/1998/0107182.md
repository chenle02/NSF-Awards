This project will organize and hold the third International Workshop on
Structural Health Monitoring at Stanford University, September 12-14, 2001.
Structural health monitoring is an emerging technology, which combines advanced
sensing technology with a knowledge of material/structural damage
characteristics to monitor the condition of structures in real time while in
service. Building on the prior to workshops focused on this topic, the
objectives of the workshop are to review the progress of the current rapid
technological development in the field, to identify key and emerging issues in
research and development, and to promote exchanges and cross-fertilization among
many disciplines and these applications, such as rotorcraft and aircraft
structures, civil infrastructures, vehicle and marine structures, and hazard
mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key and distinguished individuals from
industry, academe, and government will be invited to give keynote lectures and
presentations in the workshop. Product and technology demonstrations will also
be conducted. The workshop will conclude with panel discussions on key issues
and concerns to be identified during the workshop. The workshop will result in
proceedings containing the presentations of the workshop. Appropriate guidelines
and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural
health monitoring development will be developed&lt;br/&gt;
