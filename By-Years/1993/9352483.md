9352483 Pesterfield An FT-NMR multi-element broadband frequency
synthesizer/controller, a F-l9/H-l dual oscillator, a magnetic susceptibility
balance, two vacuum manifold rack systems, and the necessary vacuum manifold
accessories are being used alongside our existing FT-NMR, FT-IR, and UV-VIS
instrumentation as the basis for a new synthesis/physical methods inorganic
laboratory/lecture course. The course experiments are focusing on the synthesis
and manipulation of inorganic compounds, and their characterization by physical
methods. Further, the equipment is being utilized in our physical chemistry and
advanced organic chemistry laboratory courses, and in an advanced physics
course. ***
