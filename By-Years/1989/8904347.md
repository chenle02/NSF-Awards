Paleokarst horizons along the topes of 2 Proterozoic carbonate units will be
mapped, sampled, and isotopically investigated in order to obtain quantitative
climatic temperatures and to further investigate the possibility of biological
activity on the Precambrian land surface. The paleokarst horizons occur along
unconformities and represent weathering that occurred well inland and long after
the original deposition, silicification, and dolomitization of early, metastable
carbonate phases. New generations of chert and carbonate precipitated during the
weathering, solution, and alteration of the carbonate; a major goal is to
clearly distinguish and separate these secondary phases which formed under
terrestrial conditions from the earlier phases which formed under marine or
coastal conditions. The secondary cherts that formed from meteoric waters should
be strongly depleted in 18O and D relative to the earlier phases and should
define an isotopic array parallel to the meteoric water line that contrasts
strongly with data for the earlier cherts. This relationship, which has already
been approximately established for one locality, will allow greatly refined
surface temperatures to be established for one key time interval in the
Proterozoic. Previous carbon isotope analyses of weathered carbonates of this
age have suggested that the land surface already was populated by
photosynthesizing organisms. Carbon isotope evidence for organic activity on the
Precambrian land surface will be further evaluated at a new and better locality
which appears to have even larger and more convincing carbon isotopic
variations.
