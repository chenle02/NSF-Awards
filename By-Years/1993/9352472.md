9352472 Lawrence This project has established an instrumentation laboratory to
enhance undergraduate geographic information systems (GIS) instruction. The
project also provides students with tools that permit them to solve real-world
problems, especially within a team framework. The team approach will be
especially beneficial to students because GIS applications frequently require
teams of workers. A team strategy also broadens the view of students as to the
need for cooperation and to the contributions that specialists in diverse fields
can add to GIS applications. The combination of a team oriented, problem solving
approach and quality hardware and software should also profit students when they
embark upon their careers in GIS. ***
