This project will explore several synthetic methods that rely on copper as the
metal that effects catalysis. A number of the transformations are on copper
hydride chemistry, which includes new uses of nonracemically ligated CuH for
syntheses. The potential to realize unprecedented ligand-accelerated catalysis
with CuH in pure water at room temperature will be pursued, along with the
potential to deliver water-sensitive carbon-based residues via conjugate
addition chemistry, with both approaches based on micellar catalysis in water.
Heterogeneous processes that take advantage of both readily accessed valence
states of copper [Cu(I) and Cu(II)] impregnated into the pores of inexpensive
charcoal matrices will also be developed. A high substrate-to-ligand ratio and
tandem processes that can be carried out in a single reaction vessel will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is
supporting the research of Professor Bruce H. Lipshutz of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Professor Lipshutz's
research efforts revolve around the development of organocopper-based asymmetric
catalysis leading to new methods for the formation of C-C and C-H bonds. Such
chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical
synthesis as most of these new technologies will be developed in the absence of
organic solvents, where water serves as the macroscopic medium. Successful
applications of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the
pharmaceutical, fine chemical, and agricultural industries.
