9415275 Ulsoy This research project deals with the design and development of
repetitive controllers where it is desired for the control system to track
periodic reference signals and minimize the effects of periodic disturbances
inputs for a clan of nonlinear systems: A first level of adaptation is used to
minimize or eliminate the effects of deterministic, possibly unknown and/or
time-varying disturbance inputs. Subsequently, a parameterizing mapping is
adjusted online. At a second level, adaptation is used to minimize the effects
of plant model uncertainties on the tracking performance of the control system.
The results of this research are applied to machine tool and robot arm control
for high accuracy machining and path tracking respectively. ***
