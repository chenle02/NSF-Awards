Boston College will conduct a three-year project to enhance mathematics
teachers of grades 7 through 12 in basic knowledge of discrete mathematics
topics, in implementing discrete mathematics in their classroom and in sharing
instructional experiences with their students and teacher colleagues. Discrete
mathematics content areas to be addressed are social choice, graph theory,
recursion, counting and matrices. Two possible ways to fuse discrete mathematics
into the secondary curriculum will be considered: a separate course in discrete
mathematics for upper secondary students, and an infusion of discrete
mathematics topics into all existing secondary mathematics classes, beginning at
the middle school level. Emphasis will be placed on mathematical problem
solving, reasoning, communication and connections. Project activities include an
initial three-week summer leadership workshop for 22 teachers with experience in
teaching discrete mathematics. These leader-teachers will be trained to become
members of leadership teams who, together with Presidential Award Winners who
are members of the project's senior staff, will conduct three-week summer
workshops in six regions of the country in years two and three of the project.
Three hundred sixty second-wave teachers will participate in these workshops
which will include a follow-up session to bond teachers at the local level into
a support network for implementing discrete mathematics. In turn, these teachers
are expected to conduct inservice activities within their school district,
reaching approximately 4000 of their colleagues in third-wave enhancement, for a
total of 4382 teachers so enhanced. This proposal addresses the enhancement of
teachers in an important area of mathematics, new to the secondary curriculum.
And the teachers-teaching-teachers pyramid model lends itself to wide
dissemination. Boston University, University of North Carolina, Illinois State
University, S.W. Texas University, Portland State University, and California
State Polytechnic cost-sharing accounts for 3% of the NSF budget.
