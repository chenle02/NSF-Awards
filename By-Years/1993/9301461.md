This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the travel of ten US and
two Colombian mathematicians to participate in the Fifth Latin American Congress
of Probability and Mathematical Statistics (V CLAPEM), to be held in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, June 28-July 3, 1993. The symposium is jointly sponsored by the
Bernoulli Society, International Mathematical Union, American Statistical
Association, and Brazilian Statistical Association. It will feature invited
conferences, mini-courses, and short communications on recent research on
probability and statistics. NSF's award will support airfare and per diem for
seven senior and three junior U.S. mathematicians, as well as airfare for two
young Colombian mathematicians. All sides will benefit from this opportunity to
strengthen expertise in probability and statistics within Latin America, and to
develop research collaboration between North American and Latin American
mathematicians.
