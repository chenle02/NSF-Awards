This proposal examines the fatigue process in metal single crystals using
transmission electron microscopy to observe dislocation dynamics. The
investigator plans in-situ reverse deformation experiments in a high voltage
transmission electron microscope (HVEM). A unique loading instrument has been
devised to avoid buckling of the specimens under stress reversal, a problem
normally encountered with this type of test. The fatigue process and associated
dislocations are imaged during strain reversals in relatively thick foils to
provide insights into the fundamental nature of fatigue and related Bauschinger
effects. %%% This research offers new capabilities for observing the fatigue
process in metal alloys. The technique should allow observation of the motion of
dislocations over a significant range and should provide new insights to the
fatigue process.
