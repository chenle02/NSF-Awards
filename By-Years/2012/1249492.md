The project, led by investigators from Rutgers University, will engage in
reviewing and synthesizing the research literature on Computer Supported
Collaborative Learning (CSCL) conducted between 2005 and 2012. The project team
will identify major themes in the research results, analyze effects on learning
outcomes in CSCL research, identify moderating factors and trends, synthesize
major lessons learned, and identify important gaps that still exist in our
knowledge. Automated data mining and text analysis will be used to validate
results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project should result in a framework for
studying CSCL as well as an empirically-grounded set of design principles for
how CSCL should be used in different educational settings, whether in or out of
the classroom. Given the fast pace of development in the use of technology to
support STEM learning, this synthesis should help give a broader historical
context in which to understand them as well as encourage more directed and
targeted research and development in the future.
