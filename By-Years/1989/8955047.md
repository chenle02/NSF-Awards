This project belongs to the special Teacher Enhancement program, "Projects to
Promote the Effective Use of Technology in the Teaching of Science and
Mathematics". The Ohio State University will conduct a five-year program to
establish a network of eighteen regional sites for implementing new and emerging
technology enhanced mathematics programs in middle and secondary schools. Each
site will be staffed by a team that will train middle and secondary mathematics
teachers in the region as technology specialists. In turn, the technology
specialists will provide in-service and support for local mathematics teachers.
The project will produce thirty-six technology specialists and six modules to
serve as a base of examples for the in-service work. The technology focus will
be on advanced graphing and symbol manipulating calculators. This focus
represents the technology area of highest priority within the mathematical
community at this time. Ohio State University and participating school districts
will contribute an amount equal to 41% of the National Science Foundation award.
