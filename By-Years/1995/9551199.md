Molecular modeling has evolved from a narrow research interest to a broad-based
tool useful to the bench chemist. Its use has become routine in industrial
settings, such as the pharmaceutical industry, where modeling a system prior to
conventional laboratory studies can save thousands of dollars in research and
development costs. Computer modeling is a tool that many students will use
throughout their professional careers, and colleges must prepare them for what
lies ahead. This project integrates computer modeling into its curriculum
through the establishment of a Molecular Modeling Laboratory. The university
collects, develops, introduces, and disseminates experiments demonstrating the
capabilities of computational chemistry at various levels of sophistication.
Freshmen use this technique to demonstrate structural and spectral features of
molecules. In organic chemistry, students predict reactivity by calculating
charge densities. Biochemistry students determine interaction energies for
inhibitors of HIV protease, a target enzyme in AIDS therapy. In physical
chemistry, students demonstrate the principle of mutual exclusion in vibrational
spectroscopy by combining molecular modeling with IR and Raman spectroscopy.
Finally, students apply their experiences to research problems in their senior
years.
