9530659 Chu This project will explore heterogeneous reactions of bromine which
are potentially important to polar ozone depletion and ozone loss in the
tropospheric Arctic boundary layer. The role of HBr (hydrogen bromide)
conversion into photochemically active bromine on ice surfaces will be explored.
The results of this study will lead to a better mechanistic understanding of
uptake and heterogeneous reactions involved in ozone depletion. The initial
focus will be on uptake of HBr and the formation mechanism of HBr hydrates on
ice film surfaces. The phase diagram of HBr-ice along with other thermodynamic
properties will be determined from this study. The uptake of the hydrogen
halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI on ice surfaces will be compared and the trends
interpreted in terms of acidity and the interactions of the hydrogen halides
with the ice surfaces. The reaction probabilities and mechanism of gaseous HOCl
and HOBr with HBr on ice surfaces will be determined under simulated atmospheric
conditions. %%% This project will use a glass flow reactor, together with pulsed
molecular beam sampling, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and phase sensitive
detection methods. Formation processes for HBr hydrates will be examined using
specular reflection-absorbance IR spectroscopy. The effect of the ice film
surface morphology on HBr uptake will be investigated by using scanning electron
microscopic and BET isotherm adsorption methods. Models will be developed to
interpret the results. ***
