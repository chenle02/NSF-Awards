The heart of teaching and learning chemistry is the ability of the teacher to
provide experiences that share a conceptually abstract mathematically-rich
subject with novice learners. This includes not only chemistry concepts, but
also knowledge about how to learn chemistry. Students' expectations for learning
chemistry in the university classroom impact their success in doing
so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physics education research has explored the idea of
student expectations with regard to learning physics, resulting in the
development of MPEX (the Maryland Physics Expectation survey). We are adapting
MPEX to develop a chemistry survey regarding student expectations for learning
chemistry: CHEMX. In particular, CHEMX explores the role of laboratory in
learning chemistry as shaped by Johnstone's work with the macroscopic,
particulate, and symbolic representations of matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data
collection from university chemistry faculty, undergraduates and graduate
students in chemistry programs approved by the ACS Committee on Professional
Training allows examination of differences in expectations across the
disciplines of chemistry. Data collection from high school chemistry teachers
examines the environment in which entering undergraduates develop their
expectations. Collaborations with the POGIL Project (Process Oriented Guided
Inquiry Learning, NSF Award 0231120) and the MORE Project (Model-Observe-
Reflect-Explain, NSF Award 0208029) focus upon explicit efforts to shift student
expectations and explore correlations with student achievement.
