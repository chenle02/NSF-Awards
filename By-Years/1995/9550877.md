The department is purchasing a Finnigan MAT Magnum Gas Chromatograph/Mass
Spectrometer (GC/MS) plus data handling system. This purchase includes a 62,000
compound database that allows students to do computer matching of mass spectral
data of unknowns separated by the GC. Several new experiments are being used to
take advantage of the capabilities of the equipment. The experiments involve
flavor chemistry, cosmetic additives, plasticizers in polymer samples, and
separation and isolation problems. These experiments are being used in upper-
level Advanced Laboratory courses taken by junior and senior Chemistry majors.
The equipment is also available for use by students enrolled in the
Undergraduate Research program. This equipment allows upper-level Chemistry
majors to experience the GC/MS technique as it is used by practicing chemists in
modern laboratories.
