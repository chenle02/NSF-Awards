This project exposes undergraduate students to a laboratory environment where
the design, fabrication, and testing of circuits and systems for RF and
microwave applications are linked together. Students using the laboratory
incorporate laboratory experiences into their design process, they gain a
realistic view of the value and limitations of analytic models and the methods
used to develop the models, they become familiar with industry practices and
standards, and they experience the limitations of instruments and measurement
techniques. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
