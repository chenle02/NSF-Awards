9603029 Gilbert This award supports the participation of American scientists in
a U.S.-Japan seminar on Tansmutations, Reproducing Kernels and Methods of Modern
Complex Analysis to be held in Newark, Delaware from June 3-8, 1997. The co-
organizers are Professors Robert P. Gilbert of the University of Delaware and
Takafumi Murai of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. This seminar will
bring together leading researchers to discuss a number of topics related to
reproducing kernels, fundamental singularities, other function theoretic
methods, and related numerical and symbolic computations. %%% The field of
complex analysis offers practical applications in the solution of various
engineering problems, such as moving boundary problems and inverse problems in
acoustics. Participants in this seminar will discuss and integrate the
theoretical and practical aspects of the research. The exchange of ideas and
data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to
advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative
projects. ***
