9302187 Lee In this project, PIs will deploy a current meter array, east of
Taiwan, near 24 degrees north in the western Pacific as part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). These instruments will measure the structure and
variability of volume and heat transports of the Kuroshio for a two-year period
from summer, 1994 through the array, providing additional current meter
moorings, Inverted Echo Sounders, tide gauges, and repeated sections, using
shipboard Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) and Acoustic Doppler Current
Profilers (ADCP), to examine spatial variability at several different times
during the period. ***
