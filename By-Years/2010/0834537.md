&lt;br/&gt;CSR # 0834537, ?DMSS: Towards Resource-Efficient Automated Video
Surveillance Systems?, PI: Nabil J. Sarhan&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The security problem has emerged as a
major concern regionally, nationally, and globally. Therefore, the interest in
video surveillance has grown dramatically. Automated video surveillance serves
as an elegant and efficient approach for realtime detection of threats and
monitoring their progress. Unfortunately, the design of an automated, scalable,
and massively distributed surveillance system has been a significant research
problem. Power consumption has also been a primary concern, especially in
battery-powered video sources. This project addresses the scalability-cost and
power consumption problems of large-scale surveillance systems by developing
optimal bandwidth allocation schemes, which control the transfer rates of
various video sources, considering the potential threat level, placement of
video sources, location importance, site map, and rate-accuracy curves of vision
algorithms. It also develops a model for determining the current overall warning
level based on statistical aggregation of the potential threats detected over a
certain period, their levels of sensitivity, the importance of the locations
where they are detected, and their closeness to other important locations.
Additionally, this project investigates other important aspects, including fault
tolerance of the distributed processing architecture, adaptive streaming,
feature extraction, and continuous querying. By addressing the scalability-cost
and power consumption problems and dealing with several design aspects in a
cohesive and integrated manner, this research provides significant contributions
in the design of scalable and cost-effective automated video surveillance
systems. Furthermore, it has significant broader impacts on homeland security,
education, and participation of underrepresented groups.
