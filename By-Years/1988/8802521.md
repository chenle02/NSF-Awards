This proposal on "Ecological Engineering: Theory and Development in the U.S. and
China" between Dr. William Mitsch and Dr. David L. Johnson of the Ohio State
University Research Foundation and Professors Ma Shijun, Yan Jingsong, and Li
Dianmo of the Institute of Zoology of the Academia Sinica, is jointly sponsored
by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This cooperative program will
explore and define the concept of ecological engineering. "Ecological
engineering" and "ecotechnology" are terms used to indicate the design of human
society with its natural environment for the benefit of both. The general
approaches to ecological engineering are somewhat different in the U.S. and in
China, although the overall concepts are the same. Chinese and American
researchers will collaborate to identify underlying concepts and theories
(principles) of ecological engineering, including concepts such as self design,
multi layering, and resiliency and restoration, and maximum power. Using
mathematical models of six research sites in both the U.S. and China, the
investigators will attempt preliminary verification of some of these principles.
