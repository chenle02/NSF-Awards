This project will use a new millimeter-wave spectrometer, Z-Spec, recently
commissioned at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). Z-Spec is a grating
spectrometer that uses 160 bolometers spanning the complete 1 mm atmospheric
window from 195-305 GHz. The scientific goals are to 1) Use multiple CO lines to
measure redshifts of a sample of the luminous dusty galaxies that make up the
far-IR/submillimeter background; and 2) Conduct broad-band line surveys of
nearby galaxies measuring CO isotopes, density tracers, and photo-dissociation
tracers in a single spectrum.

Broader impacts include hands-on training of students and postdocs in
millimeter-wave instrumentation and techniques, and availability of Z-Spec to
the community.
