This supplement will enable the investigators to store and preserve the 50MHz
radar originally constructed and deployed at Poker Flat, Alaska and which ceased
operation December 1986. The total investment in this equipment exceeds two
million dollars and, thus, it is prudent and necessary that it be preserved
until a new location can be identified for its use. I recommend support for this
supplement for one year at the requested budget level.
