Three themes of classical harmonic analysis will be developed in this
mathematical research project. The problems to be investigated center on
discrete decomposition techniques under recent development. The first area will
focus on Littlewood-Paley theory. A generalization of the fundamental ideas of
Fourier series in which functions or distributions are represented as
combinations of simple functions. The map from the source function to the
corresponding sequence of coefficients is called the phi- transform, the Fourier
transform being perhaps the best known example. One application of this study
will be to develop criteria for an extension of the T(1) theorem of David and
Journe which gives precise boundedness conditions for singular linear operators
solely on the basis of their action on constant functions. Other work will
develop the close connection between Littlewood-Paley theory and weighted norm
inequalities, especially to factorization and extrapolation for classes of
weights much larger than the traditional Ap weights. One of the motivations for
such studies comes from efforts to find sharp conditions on weights for the
Fourier transform to be bounded. To study such inequalities, one must localize
on the frequency side and time side simultaneously. Littlewood-Paley theory and
the phi-transform are designed to deal with such problems. Discrete Littlewood-
Paley theory has proved to be very useful in seismic and acoustic analysis,
psycho-physiology, computer vision and image processing as well as in quantum
field theory. Much of the algorithm development for computational work in these
areas requires sampling techniques. This work will seek to develop
characterizations of efficient sampling processes associated with these
algorithms.
