9712391 Marston This young theorist is making a transition from an NYI award to
the regular program. He is proposing work on a variety of aspects of the
strongly correlated electron problem. In theme, the chosen topics involve the
role of quantum coherence in a quantum many body problem. For example, during
the scattering of an atom from a surface, charge transfer takes place by
tunneling, leading to a distribution of charge species in the final product. The
PI has successfully treated the interplay between the loss of coherence and the
strong Coulomb repulsion using a 1/N expansion (N is the degeneracy of electrons
in surface states), finding good agreement with the experiments. He is planning
an extension to higher orders, to improve the understanding of experiments.
Other topics in this project include coherence and enlarged symmetries in
quantum nanostructures, exact solutions of plateau problem in integer quantum
Hall effect and bosonization approaches to the strongly correlated electron
problem in 2 dimensions. %%% This young PI has been supported to work on two
different problems. As an NYI, he has been studying the many body problem of
strongly interacting electrons, including the properties under strong magnetic
fields. In a separate grant, he has been studying the many body aspects of the
production of ions in an atom-surface collision. In this new grant, which
combines his diverse research program in a single grant, he is proposing to
begin study in some new areas such as quantum dots. ***
