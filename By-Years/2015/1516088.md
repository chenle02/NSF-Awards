Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the microscopic theory of the strong
interactions and allows us to understand how hadrons, such as the proton,
neutron and pion, are formed through partons, the building blocks of QCD. High-
energy scattering processes can be used to explore how partons (quarks and
gluons) that come out of a high-energy scattering make a transition into
hadrons. While various aspects of these processes are well understood, many
striking puzzles remain. Transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) represent one
such puzzle. Early QCD calculations predicted basically vanishing effects, but
experiments revealed huge SSAs up to 40%. Despite decades of research, the
detailed understanding of single-spin asymmetries in QCD is still missing. In
this context, this project will explore the role played by the fragmentation of
partons for different single-spin asymmetries. Graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows will be involved in this very active field at the frontier
of current hadronic physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make
possible extensive numerical studies of transverse SSAs for single-hadron
production in proton-proton collisions, where one of the incoming protons is
polarized perpendicular to the reaction plane. These studies will make use of
existing analytical results that were developed previously by the investigator
and one of his graduate students. Not only is this investigation expected to
clarify if parton fragmentation can indeed explain the huge SSAs observed
experimentally, but also whether a simultaneous description of SSAs in hadronic
collisions and in lepton-induced processes can be obtained. This project is
closely related to experiments conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, and other accelerator facilities worldwide.
