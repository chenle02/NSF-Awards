Let G be a group which acts on a contractable space X. One calls Y included in
X a spine if Y is a G-equivariant deformation retract of X, the dimension of Y
is the virtual cohomological dimension of G, and Y has a simplical complex
structure which is compatible with the action of G. Brownstein is interested in
the case where G is SL(2,0) and X is H2 x H2, where 0 is the ring of integers in
a real quadratic number field and also the case where G is Sp(2g,Z) the
symplectic group and X is the Siegel upper half space. He plans to compute the
integral homology of G by constructing appropriate spines. The actual
computation is done via the spectral sequence associated with the Borel
construction.
