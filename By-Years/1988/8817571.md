This proposal is to help support travel and registration expenses for speakers,
chairs, and organizers for the fourth Gordon Research Conference on The
Chemistry of Plant-Herbivore Interactions to be held in southern California,
January 30- February 3, 1989. The five major sessions of the Conference cover
the topics: Theories of plant defensive chemistry; Responses of plants to stress
and the effects on herbivory; Chemical interactions between plant and insect
herbivores; Chemical interactions plants and vertebrate herbivores;
Plant/herbivore/microbe interactions. The program includes 33 speakers and
chairs.
