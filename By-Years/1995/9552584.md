9553584 Hein Under the Small Grants For Exploratory Research guidelines, Dr.
George Hein will carry out basic research in informal learning in a museum
setting. Dr. Hein will examine the literature and provide a summary of 1) what
is known about the motivations of museums visitors, how they learn and how they
react to the intellectual, social, and physical context of museums and 2) what
is known about the theory and methods of visito research in museums. These
results will then be linked to a detailed discussion of constructivist learning
theory and he will explore how that theory can be used to explain visitor
behavior and how it can be used as a guide to research in learning in museums.
Research will be carried out in England and the United States and will include a
thorough review of the relevant literature written in English and extensive
consultations with other professionals working on the theory of informal
learning in museum settings. The research will result in a monograph that will
be broadly disseminated. Although focused particularly on learning in a museum
setting, the monograph will be of interest to all those interested in the
informal learning process which includes museum professionals, formal educators,
executives of community-based programs, and media producers.
