The research is to develop hardware and control software for multi-degree of
freedom (MDOF), Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV). Though the benefits of MDOF
AGVs are well known, in terms of high maneuverability, their utilization is not
universal because they represent a very difficult control problem. This is
because MDOF AGVs are characterized as an overconstrained system from a control
perspective and prototypes that have been developed by industry have been
plagued with control problems described as shaking and slipping. Preliminary
investigation of this problem reveal that the combination of specially designed
drive kinematics and special control algorithms are likely to yield satisfactory
solutions to this problem. This research will include the development of a
prototype to test the system. The successful development of MDOF AGVs will allow
the implementation of this level of automation in existing, older manufacturing
facilities with only minor modifications to plant layout. This will have an
impact on the manufacturing productivity of older industry segments and provide
international leadership to the domestically based AGV industry.
