Research in theoretical physics will include (1) analyses of elementary
particle and other physical systems using the "lattice" approximation, in which
the continuum of space is replaced by a discrete lattice of points, (2) studies
of chaotic behavior, and (3) analyses of physical systems whose descriptive
equations can actually be solved exactly. The lattice approach enables one to
study situations in which, for example, the strong nuclear force is important
and cannot be treated as a small perturbation. Chaotic behavior is widespread in
nature and little understood. Study of systems whose equations can be solved
exactly give one insight into physical systems generally. Thus, all of these
studies are important.
