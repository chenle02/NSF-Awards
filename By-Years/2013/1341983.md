Significant resources have been expended to provide services to intimate partner
violence (IPV) victims and to increase perpetrator accountability through
criminal justice interventions, but less attention has been given to preventing
IPV. The 2-day Workshop to Develop Effective Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary
Interventions to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence will bring together
researchers, practitioners, advocates, and students from various fields (social
sciences, law, public health, medicine, victim services and advocacy) to
critically examine IPV prevention at three levels: programs to stop IPV from
occurring (primary prevention), methods to reduce the consequences of IPV when
it occurs (secondary prevention), and programs to respond to victims and
perpetrators to prevent IPV reoccurrence (tertiary prevention). Participants
will: 1) identify knowledge gaps at all three levels of prevention; 2) examine
findings from current evaluations of promising programs, especially those
designed for underserved groups; 3) develop recommendations for future research;
4) foster interdisciplinary collaboration to develop new research projects; and
5) promote mentoring relationships among researchers, graduate students,
practitioners, and advocates. To achieve these goals, participants will either:
a) prepare a paper evaluating current knowledge and practices for a type of IPV
prevention; b) discuss knowledge or practices gaps in IVP prevention; c) prepare
a paper on evaluation outcomes for a type of prevention; or d) facilitate
discussion of the next generation of prevention research. Workshop activities
will produce knowledge useful to researchers, practitioners, advocates and
students throughout the United States and internationally to develop innovative
prevention programs, especially for underserved communities. The materials
produced (i.e., reports, an edited book, a website) will also be useful to
policy makers and other stakeholders as they work to address the problem of IPV.
