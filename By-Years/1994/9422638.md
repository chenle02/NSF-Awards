The Great Depression was one of the pivotal episodes in American history.
Because its repercussions continue to affect the thinking of both economists and
policy makers, it is important to develop a comprehensive understanding of how
economic policies influenced the crash and the subsequent recovery. The purpose
of this project is to analyze three key aspects of the depression. The first
will examine how the fear of bank panics and currency devaluation during the
early l930s may have led to the hoarding of gold, and how this hoarding could
have resulted in deflation. The second aspect will examine the impact of both
European currency crises and U.S. monetary policy on the latter stages of the
depression. The third will examine the impact of New Deal labor legislation such
as the minimum wage. The common thread tying these three aspects together will
be the use of financial markets. By examining the immediate impact of these
policies on stock, bond, and commodities markets, it will be possible to draw
important inferences regarding the effects on the overall economy. ***
