This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award gives continuing support to
The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the University of Florida,
located on the Atlantic Coast, to provide research training for undergraduates
in cell and neurobiology using marine animals. Eight faculty members will train
students throughout the year in modern, experimental techniques of anatomy,
biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and electrophysiology for which the
facility is exceptionally well equipped. Students are recruited nationwide, and
special efforts are made to attract women and minority students, and students in
humanities departments who may be encouraged to try science as a career. The
students will live on the campus of the laboratory, have access to all
facilities, and will become full partners in the ongoing research efforts of
their faculty advisors. Their independence will be encouraged, and they will
receive full credit for their work in publications. In addition to their
practical research training, the students' intellectual growth will be
stimulated through participation in the Laboratory's regular seminar series, a
special student seminar series, and research discussions provided by each member
of the faculty.
