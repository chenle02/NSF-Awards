The objective of this work is: (1) to identify the most suitable method of
sampling and of sample preparation for collapsible soils found throughout the
Southwest U.S.; and (2) to develop and test a relatively simple procedure
(modified Jennings &amp; Knight odometer test) for determining the extent of
wetting of soils in the field.
