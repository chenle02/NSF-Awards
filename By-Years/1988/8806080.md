Much recent work has focused on the dynamic nature of the abiotic environment,
and on the ways plants respond to these changing conditions. In particular,
emphasis has been placed on the importance of variation in light availability
for two fundamental aspects of plant performance: growth and defense. However,
our understanding of light effects on photosynthesis and synthesis of defensive
secondary metabolites comes primarily from temperate high light environments and
agricultural systems. In humid tropical forests, light availability at the
forest floor is extremely low (&lt;1% full sunlight), with periods of higher
light lasting from seconds to hours, depending on the size of the opening in the
canopy above. Tree saplings and understory plants must therefore be capable of
persisting at extremely low light levels, yet be able to take advantage of short
periods of intense and perhaps damaging light. Little is known about how these
shade-tolerant species adjust to long-and short-term variation in light
availability, despite the fact the majority of the world's species exists under
these conditions. The investigators will collect comparative data on
photosynthetic physiology, secondary metabolites, and leaf anatomy for a range
of shade-tolerant tropical woody species. This will enable them to assess the
physiological mechanisms underlying adjustments to long-and short-term variation
in light availability, and to track how resources are differentially allocated
to growth vs defense.
