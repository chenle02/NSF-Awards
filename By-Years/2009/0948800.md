This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyploidy (whole genome duplication)
is one of the most important genetic phenomena in plants. Immediately after its
formation, a polyploid plant can be identified simply by counting its
chromosomes, because it has twice as many as a diploid. However, after millions
of years a polyploid may have as low a chromosome number as a diploid through a
process called "diploidization." Genomic studies can detect such cryptic
polyploids, and the advent of high-throughput sequencing has made this approach
increasingly feasible. Using this new technology, this project will estimate the
frequency of polyploidy in the phaseoloid legumes, a group that includes
soybean, common bean, cowpea, pigeonpea, and other less familiar crops, by
sequencing thousands of transcribed genes from approximately 25 phylogenetically
diverse species. Polyploid events will be identified by their characteristic
signature, an excess of genes with two copies duplicated at the same time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has broad significance for genetics and
systematics, given the importance of polyploidy as a genetic phenomenon, and
also for agriculture, because polyploidy is so common among crop plants (e.g.,
soybean, wheat, maize, cotton). The large numbers of genes will be a resource
for subsequent studies in this large and important lineage. A talented female
postdoctoral associate will receive training in the generation and analysis of
next-generation sequencing data.
