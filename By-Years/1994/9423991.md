9423991 Abramovich This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
involves the research and development of new seismometers based on principles of
molecular electronics. The progress of seismology has been hampered by the lack
of low cost, high performance, portable, rugged, easy to install, broad
frequency band instruments. This project is aimed at filling this void. In Phase
I, problems encountered by previous researchers, including these investigators,
have been overcome, and conceptual prototypes were built. Field tests showed
very close correlation with STS-s seismometers in recording remote earthquakes.
Phase II theoretical and experimental effort will be focused on the optimization
of all major seismometer characteristics: transfer function, self-noise,
transducer coefficient, temperature stability, as well as manufacturability,
while maintaining the low cost. Every prototype will be subjected to extensive
laboratory and field testing at various locations in the U.S. The ultimate goal
is the implementation of three seismometer versions: Basic (noise 200-400 nm/s,
0.03-5 Hz band); Limited Band Advanced (20-40 nm/s, 0.3-25 Hz); Broad Band
Advanced (less than 75 nm/s, 0.016-5 Hz). Special attention will be devoted to
the development of an expanded temperature range instrument for field
applications. A built-in magnetohydrodynamic calibrator will be developed for
the advanced seismometer versions. An optional PC-based multichannel
programmable Seismic Data Acquisition system will be developed with on-board
real-time keeping and anti-aliasing filtering. In order to facilitate and
expedite the evaluation of newly developed transducers and seismometers, an
inexpensive calibration platform will be built.
