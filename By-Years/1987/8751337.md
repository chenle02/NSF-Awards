The Geography Department at Macalester College will host its third geography
teachers' institute from July 6 to July 24, 1987. The institute will host 30-35
teachers of geography and social studies (grades K-12) in an intensive three-
week workshop. Preference in admission will be given to teams of teachers--one
elementary and one secondary--from the same district. Participants will earn
eight semester-hour graduate-level credits. The teachers will receive
instruction in a wide array of geographical themes and concepts aimed at
enhancing geography education in Minnesota. Instruction will be provided by two
Macalester geographers and augmented by a staff of classroom master teachers and
invited professional geographers and applications specialists. All teachers will
produce six modules of instruction designed for classroom use and including
salient aspects of the materials introduced in the institute. In addition, they
will be required to give two in-service workshops in their home districts on the
new materials during the 1987-88 school year. The first week of the summer
institute will emphasize local geography, map and graphic skills, use of air
photos, and computer application. The second week will deal with the concept of
the region. In the third week, attention is drawn to global patterns and
processes. Both concept and skill development will be emphasized. A number of
local field trips will be taken to introduce teachers to ways of using local
resources in their own areas and to teach effective observational and
questioning techniques. In addition, a number of visits to museums and libraries
are scheduled. The teachers are required to attend four full-day follow-up
sessions scheduled for September, November, February and April of the following
academic year. During these sessions, new materials is reviewed and the teachers
share information about their classroom experiences using the modules developed
as part of the institute.
