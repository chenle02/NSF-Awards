Abstract (Tudorascu, 1400168):

This award provides funding for a workshop on Entropy and Singular Solutions for
Conservation Laws; Pressureless Gas Dynamics and other applications, to be held
Sept. 19-21, 2014 at West Virginia University.

The workshop focuses on the overlap of some research areas in Analysis such as
Pressureless Gas Dynamics, Conservation Laws and Optimal Transport. Selected
specialists with significant contributions in these areas have been invited and
agreed to participate. The PI makes an effort to ensure that the conference
topics will cover a fine spectrum between purely theoretical and applied topics.
The PI plans to get help from university diversity officers in achieving a
diversified participation of the workshop. Ample opportunity for exchanging
ideas between graduate students, postdocs, and senior researchers is provided.
