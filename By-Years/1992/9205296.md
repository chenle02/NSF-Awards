Kupiainen will continue his investigations of the statistical mechanics of
disordered systems. The purpose of this program is to develop exact
renormalization group methods to the study of a wide variety of such systems.
These include classical systems of the Lorentz gas type and lattice versions
thereof as well as diffusion in quantum systems. He will also continue his
research in conformal field theory, centered around the WZW model. Modern
physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth
century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address the
microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a
distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations
for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from
detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known
forces into a single theory.
