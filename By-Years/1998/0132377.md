EAR-0132377&lt;br/&gt;Farquhar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
funding for a UV laser system that will be used in conjunction with two gas-
source isotope ratio mass spectrometers for measurement of O2 and SF6 analyte
gases. This instrument will be one of the primary tools for geochemistry
research in the Stable Isotope laboratory at the University of Maryland
(www.geol.umd.edu/~jfarquha/stable_isotope_lab.htm). The PI, James Farquhar has
used and developed laser fluorination techniques in a previous position as a
post doctoral fellowat the Geophysical Laboratory and UCSD. The PI and his
colleagues (students and post docs) will apply the UV laser to research
involving in-situ analyses of isotope ratios involving the four stable isotopes
of sulfur and the three stable isotopes of oxygen. The focus of this research
will be on understanding the application of these isotope systems to topics that
include atmospheric deposition, isotopic exchange during mineral-mineral and
mineral-fluid interactions, and the characterization of biological signatures in
the rock record. The UV laser system will be coupled to a high vacuum extraction
line and used in a system that is coupled to mass spectrometers capable of both
dual inlet and continuous-flow isotope analyses. Its addition to the facilities
in the Stable Isotope Laboratory provides the capabilities for analysis of
samples several orders of magnitude smaller than by conventional techniques.
These capabilities are important in situations where samples are limited and in
cases where high spatial resolution is required for scientific
interpretations.&lt;br/&gt;
