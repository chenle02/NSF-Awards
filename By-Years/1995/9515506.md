C. Rovelli from the University of Pittsburgh will study the quantization of
gravity using a new set of variables he invented called `loop space` variables.
Gravity, although well understood at large distances such as within our solar
system, is not at all under control conceptually at very small distances within
the atom. Rovelli's work and his variables have set up a convenient framework in
which to study quantum gravity. His methods involve an extension of Dirac's work
on quantization of field theory with constraints.
