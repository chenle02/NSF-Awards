The 39th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 39) will be held on campus at
Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina from Thursday, March 9, 2023,
until Saturday, March 11, 2023. In its long history, SEAM has become a leading
venue for mathematical analysis and its applications. SEAM is held annually at a
university in the Southeastern US and attracts participants and speakers from
throughout the United States and abroad. SEAM encourages the participation and
professional development of early-career members of the analysis research
community and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. Its mission
includes facilitating the development of scientific collaborations and
professional relationships between researchers at all career stages. The meeting
website is hosted at http://www.math.clemson.edu/seam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEAM
is a major conference in analysis emphasizing current trends and significant
developments in operator theory, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and
related fields, including operator algebras, control theory, and partial
differential equations. The meeting provides a forum for experienced
researchers, early-career faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to discuss
recent advances in the field, present their work, and develop new
collaborations. The scientific program consists of plenary talks given by
leading mathematicians at various career stages, and contributed talks open to
all participants. As an annual event with a dedicated focus, SEAM is now a part
of the mathematical research community infrastructure, enhancing research in
mathematics and graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
