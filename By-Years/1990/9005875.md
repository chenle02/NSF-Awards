Predictions of future climate require reliable General Circulation Models. And
the least reliable parameter estimated by current GCMs is net moisture,
precipitation less evaporation. This proposal requests support to address this
problem by developing new methods to reconstruct past moisture (P-E) and to
compare the results to calculated values of moisture from GCM simulations. The
PIs will develop a quantitative method for reconstructing past effective
moisture (P-E) using diatom assemblages and ostracod geochemistry variations in
6-8 lakes which span the moisture gradients of the Great Plains. Detailed
salinity fluctuations will be calibrated to the local meteorological records for
the region to derive a unique transfer function. Then the transfer function will
be used to reconstruct the history of salinity in the Great Plains since the
last glaciation. This research is important because it will provide more
accurate estimates of past precipitation and evaporation in this climatically
sensitive region, and it will provide the best baseline data to compare to GCM
simulations of past climate.
