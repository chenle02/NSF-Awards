Certain suspensions of fine particles in a dielectric liquid will change
rheological behavior in the presence of a strong electric field. These
suspensions are called electrorheological (ER) fluids, and there has been
considerable interest in exploiting their unique behavior for a wide variety of
hydraulic devices such as clutches and valves. The objective of this research is
to experimentally investigate the convective heat transfer characteristics of ER
fluids and to identify parameters specific to ER fluid flow which may be
imporvant to the heat transfer of these fluids. Heat transfer measurements will
be made by radiatively imposing a known heat flux at one surface of a channel
flow and optically measuring local temperatures at the surface. With this
information, local heat transfer coefficients will be determined by estimating
the local bulk fluid temperature in the channel. Such information on thermal
transport will be important for design in many of the applications proposed for
ER fluids.
