Three undergraduate students are to be supported by this supplementary request.
Their resumes are included with this request. The proposed work involves three
undergraduate research projects which are as follows: 1. Experimental Study of
Plasmid Loss The undergraduate student will run continuous fermentations with
bacteria containing plasmids encoded to overproduce a protein. Samples will be
taken and analyzed in order to correlate plasmid loss with cell growth and
protein production rate. Results will be compared with a mathematical model. 2.
Modeling and Control of Invertase Overproduction The undergraduate student will
perform shake flask experiments and scale-up experiments with a 10-15 liter
fermentor in order to test and further develop a mathematical model of the
secretion of overproduced invertase by yeast. 3. Selective Recycle via
Flocculation and Sedimentation The undergraduate student will run a continuous
recycle bioreactor configured to maintain a slower growing flocculent strain in
spite of competition from a faster-growing non- flocculent strain. He or she
will also perform coflocculation studies with mixed cultures and measure the
degree of separation of the two strains that can be achieved by sedimentation in
a inclined settler. Each of the three undergraduate students will be supervised
by and meet at least biweekly with one of the co-PIs on the NSF grant. In
addition, a graduate student supported by the NSF grant will be assigned as a
mentor to each undergraduate student in order to assist the undergraduate with
the day-to-day aspects of carrying out each project.
