Successful completion of the proposed research will result in a greater
understanding of the roles of inbreeding and genetic drift in reducing genetic
variation and fitness in both captive and wild populations of the endangered
nene (Branta sandvicensis). Important information should also be obtained
concerning the relative abilities of two different molecular techniques (DNA
fingerprinting and haploid mitochondrial DNA sequencing) to assess inbreeding,
genetic variation and their possible fitness consequences in these same
populations. Because demographic and historic data are also available for these
populations the genetic data can be used to test models of population genetic
theory. Lastly, the genetic and demographic data should provide valuable input
to the design of future captive breeding programs as well as to management of
individuals reintroduced to the diminishing wild population.
