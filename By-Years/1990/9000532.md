This grant will support Dr. Donald's research into algorithms and systems for
assembly of mechanical parts using compliant motion strategies. This continues a
previous grant in task-level assembly planning, and parallel's Dr. Donald's
Presidential Young Investigator research in kinodynamic approximation and
related areas of robotic theory. His work in compliant motion planning will
emphasize handling of uncertainty and errors in sensing, real-time control, and
the modeling of parts. Algorithms will be tested on an experimental, force-
controlled assembly system using the Cornell robot arm. The ultimate goal is to
permit high-level specification of force-controlled assembly tasks, without
requiring humans to specify the required forces and sensing strategies.
