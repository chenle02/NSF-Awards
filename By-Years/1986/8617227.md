This award is made according to the provision in AD/ENG Bulletin \no. 85-25,
"Expedited Awards for Novel Research." This research program will explore a new
concept which promises to be a major step forward in the engineering assessment
of seismic hazard. This concept concerns a new approach to modelling the
accumulation and release of stress on a fault, that is, to modelling the
generation of seismic waves. Stochastic earthquake recurrence models provide key
information on future seismic events, namely location, magnitude and time of
occurrence. The aim of this research program is to develop more realistic
physically-based engineering recurrence models. The feasibility and utility of
new diffusion (Markov) random field models of stress evolution along a fault in
both time and space will be explored. Specific analysis techniques to be
investigated include generalization of diffusion process results to estimate key
recurrence statistics - event times, sizes, and locations from simple spatial
characteristics such as slip rates and the scales of spatial and temporal
fluctuations in material properties. The principal investigator is
internationally recognized for his research in probabilistic structural
engineering, and he is exceptionally well qualified to undertake this
exploratory research program. In addition to the academic excellence of his
research, he also participates actively in the implementation of this research,
especially with regard to seismic hazard assessment for nuclear power plants.
This one-year investigation, if successful, will provide a new and important
tool for seismic hazard assessment.
