The goal of this project is to guide the building of appropriate technology to
support the work of small groups. The strategy is to interleave empirical work
with theory building, and field work with lab work. The field of research
provides baseline data about how small groups work on specific tasks. Further,
the field data helps suggest the kind of groupware that might assist that kind
of work. Tasks that mimic the key aspects of behavior in the field have been
developed for use in the lab. These are used to explore the value of various
forms of groupware support for both face-to-face and distributed work. Different
forms of audio and video support are also investigated for distributed work. The
empirical work is used to evolve a conceptual framework in which characteristics
of the group, the task, and the technology are related.
