Dr. Roger B. Ruggeri has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Ruggeri's doctoral degree was from the University of California
at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Clayton H. Heathcock. Dr. Ruggeri
intends to continue research at Yale University under the sponsorship of
Professor Samuel Danishefsky. Dr. Ruggeri's area of postdoctoral research will
be the development of new methods of synthesis of oligosaccharide residues for
glycoproteins and glycolipids. Oligosaccharide residues are specificity
transmitters in molecular biology. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
