9628570 Tanahoco This SGER project focuses on the development of next-generation
material handling systems for ultra-flexible factories. This effort will be
carried out in collaboration with representatives from Australia, Europe, and
Japan. This project will spearhead United States (U.S.) involvement in this
area. This project is a small exploratory venture into an emerging research area
characterized by next-generation factory configurations based on operational
control strategies that are metamorphic in nature. It represents an initiative
that will investigate, at an international level, the evolution of concepts
driven by the NSF Intelligent Materials Handling Initiative. United States
(U.S.) participation will concentrate on aspects related to flexible layouts and
tool movements as opposed to part movement.
