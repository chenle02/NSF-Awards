This research addresses combinatorial and algorithmic problems related to
searching and matching of strings and slightly more complicated structures such
as regular expressions, arrays, trees and compounds thereof. These problems
arise in a vast variety of applications, and their impact is widely perceived as
more and more crucial in future information infrastructures, as unprecedented
volumes of information are increasingly amassed, disseminated and shared. A list
would include the design of structures for the efficient management of large
repositories of strings, arrays and special types of graphs, fundamental
primitives such as the various variants of exact and approximate searching,
specific applications such as the identification of periodicities and other
regularities, efficient implementations of ancillary functions such as
compression and encoding of elementary discrete objects, etc. The main objective
of this project is to abstract and clearly identify these problems, develop new
techniques and efficient algorithms to solve them, both by serial and
parallel/distributed computation, and implement the new algorithms. This
research represents a joint effort by two teams having bases at Polytechnic
University and Purdue University, respectively. These teams have marked
commonalities in backgrounds and complementary expertise in highly specialized
subareas of the field.
