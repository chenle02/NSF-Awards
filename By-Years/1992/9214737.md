Anisotropic organic metals manifest unusual magnetic and electronic phenomena
particular to electrons constrained in low-dimensional motion. By now, these
effects are mostly well explained by theory. On a finer scale, however, one
finds additional strange phenomena that also result from the intrinsic low-d
nature of these materials, especially in the (TMTSF)2X compounds, the first
organic superconductors. These "fine structures" will be the subject of this
project.
