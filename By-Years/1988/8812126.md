This proposal concerns an initial attempt to establish a relationship between
climatic variations due to El Nino and growth patterns of one or more long-lived
trees found in the desert along the north Peruvian coast. Preliminary results,
already in hand, indicate that some trees in this region-specifically the Sapote
(Capparis Angulata R. &amp; P.)-live for at least a few hundred years, and
perhaps much longer. Although the task of determining a chronology of tree
growth in the tropical desert is formidable, it appears that at least a crude
chronology is possible by comparing the average growth pattern obtained from a
series of transverse sections and cores from separate Sapotes with radiocarbon
dating of selected Sapote samples. A concomitant study to establish ongoing
growth patterns and their relationship to local climate variations will augment
our current understanding of Sapote, and will add considerable insight into our
research efforts. The establishment of a proxy chronology of El Nino variability
over the past few centuries, particularly in the El Nino sensitive region along
the north Peruvian coast, is of considerable value in our search to understand
this enigmatic but economically critical phenomenon.
