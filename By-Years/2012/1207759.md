This project develops new methods for non-parametric prediction, filtering, and
structure discovery, primarily for spatio-temporal data but also in a range of
other settings with high-dimensional observations, such as networks. There are
two novel aspects to the investigation's approach. First, rather than trying to
predict spatio-temporal data globally, or according to a fixed pattern, it
exploits the dynamics of the system to develop a novel form of local prediction
which still captures long-scale structure. Second, while conventional non-
parametric smoothing is based on the usual geometry of the space of predictor
variables, this is supplemented smoothing together input points which have
similar predictive consequences, in effect discovering a new geometry. This
approach, which draws on earlier work on information theory in nonlinear
dynamics, allows for accurate forecasting of the evolution of large spatio-
temporal systems in a computationally efficient manner. It also allows for the
automatic discovery of complex higher-level structures in such data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific data increasingly comes as complex measurements
spread over space and time. Scientists need ways to forecast how such systems
will evolve, and to automatically separate important (but perhaps subtle)
patterns from inconsequential "background" of the system, since the structures
are often crucial to understanding the dynamics. This project tackles both of
these challenging statistical problems together. It combines idea from
information theory and nonlinear physics with modern tools of flexible
statistical modeling to discover the intrinsic dynamics of the system from the
data itself, and uses these structures for both prediction and filtering. Areas
of potential application include neuroscience, fluid dynamics, and ecology,
where it would help forecast the behavior of complex systems, and help to find
the organized structures which are keys to controlling that behavior.
