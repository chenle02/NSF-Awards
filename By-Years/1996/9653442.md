Students in elementary statistics traditionally see experiments and data merely
as words and numbers in a text. They plug numbers into formulas and make
conclusions about briefly described experiments. They receive little or no
exposure to the important statistical activities of sample selection, data
collection, experimental design, randomization, development of statistical
models, etc. In short, they leave the first course without a firm understanding
of the role of applied statistics and the statistician in scientific
investigations. Using previous support from the NSF, a successful prototype
elementary statistics laboratory course has been established at the University
of South Carolina. The laboratory, which can be taken in lieu of some
traditional lectures or in addition to the traditional course, allows students
to work in teams to design and perform experiments, collect and analyze data,
and make written reports. It is proposed to train a nationwide cadre of
elementary statistics teachers in the techniques of supplementing traditional
elementary statistics lectures with meaningful hands-on laboratory experiences.
Two groups of 24 teachers will be trained. Initial training will involve a five-
day workshop. The workshops will allow the teachers to experience ten of the 17
laboratory sessions. There will also be discussions on effective teaching
strategies in the laboratory setting, the logistics of obtaining supplies and
equipment, and different possible formats for using the labs. Teachers attending
the workshop will be expected to use at least two laboratory experiences in an
elementary statistics course in the following year and encouraged to develop at
least one new elementary statistics laboratory experiment. An electronic
discussion group will be developed to allow for interaction among the teachers
and the project team after the completion of the workshops.
