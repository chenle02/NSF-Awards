9360131 Adler Using a metallurgically-clad composite as a "worksurface" capable
of repeatedly performing the same heating operation with greater efficiencies
than are obtainable with traditional heating methods, SmartHeat technology
provides the benefits of conventional induction heating in a temperature range
heretofore unattainable via conventional induction-heating technology. The
composite consists of a ferro-magnetic alloy boned to a Cu core. Ferro-magnetic
materials used in SmartHeat devices have been limited to FeNi binary alloys. The
effects associated with the Invar phenomenon in these alloys vix., near-zero
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), depressed magnetization, and extreme
compositional sensitivity of the Curie temperature, have prevented full
exploitation of SmartHeat technology. In this research, properties of a new
class of a class of FeNi-base ternary alloys will be predicted using a novel
computer program. Computer-predicted phase boundaries will allow determination
of compositional ranges of interest. Predicted compositional dependencies of
Curie temperature and magnetic moments will be superposed on isothermal sections
facilitating alloy selection with optimal properties . Using existing literature
data, a model for quantitatively predicting CTE in terms of composition and
temperature for binary alloys will, also, be developed. This model will be
incorporated into the computer database for use in future computer-designed
materials projects. ***
