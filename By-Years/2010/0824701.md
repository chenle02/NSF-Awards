The project will support the annual CEDAR workshop for the next three summers.
Each year, approximately 300 scientists and students attend the CEDAR (Coupling,
Energetic, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) workshop, a week-long meeting
which features morning plenary sessions, individual workshops in the afternoons,
and two poster sessions. Typically, about 100 students attend; the majority are
graduate students but a small number of undergraduates (usually around 20) also
participate. The CEDAR meeting begins with a day-long student workshop,
organized by the two student members of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee.
Subsequent days are devoted to the plenary sessions, afternoon workshops, and
poster sessions. The plenary sessions include tutorial lectures and the CEDAR
Prize Lecture which are videotaped for wide distribution. The afternoon
workshops are organized and convened by members of the community: anyone can
request a workshop several months before the meeting. The CEDAR Science Steering
Committee receives the requests and allocates the meeting times and places. The
afternoon workshops are one of the primary mechanisms for the community to
initiate, plan, and undertake collaborative activities. An associated activity
is the maintenance and operation of the CEDAR wiki, which provides access to the
CEDAR database, community information, data services, documents, tools and
models, and a forum. Overall, CEDAR is one of the primary means by which the
aeronomy community educates and involves students, organizes its activities, and
plans for its future.
