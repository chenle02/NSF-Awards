This project will generate a concrete understanding of leadership in virtual
organizations in the service of developing leadership capacity in modern
organizations. The project evaluates an innovative and potentially
transformative theory of leadership as a compilational multilevel process
whereby "leadership" is comprised of the patterned interactions of multiple
individuals collectively carrying out needed system functions. Three experiments
test the core ideas of this leadership model, and develop tools for leadership
assessment and program evaluation. These experiments manipulate configurations
of leadership and observe the effects of doing so on the emergent structure of
the collective, as well as the processes, states, and performance of these
collectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific study of leadership has long
recognized that the behavior of leaders can have extraordinary effects on
collectives including teams, units, and organizations. While much of the
empirical research on leadership focuses on predicting outcomes that reside at
the individual unit of analysis (e.g., job satisfaction, work performance), many
of the situations where leaders are potentially most pivotal require complex
collective interactions (e.g., coordination, information sharing). Disaster
response, vaccine development, and provincial reconstruction are examples of
goals that require action by large-scale collectives, and so require leaders to
orchestrate the effort within those collectives. Not only do we need to
understand how leaders shape collectives, but we need to understand how they
shape loosely coupled virtual collectives or multiteam systems: large
interdependent teams interacting through virtual tools, which are interdependent
with one another in order to achieve at least one common goal. This project will
yield practical insights for better management in these sorts of domains.
