Ecological costs of tri-trophic plant defenses against herbivores

The ecological costs of correlated selection on multiple defenses may have the
potential to constrain plant evolution. The proposed work will use comparative
and experimental methods to address questions about costs of defense through:
(1) Examining how selection for growth has affected the retention and expression
of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, an indirect defense of plants which
attracts the natural enemies of herbivores, and (2) Determining the relationship
among multiple defense traits. There are several examples of herbivore-induced
plant volatile loss in plants, primarily in agricultural crops, which have
undergone selective breeding for increased yield. It is unlikely that herbivore-
induced plant volatiles have undergone direct selection, so their loss suggests
that volatile production is costly and trades off with growth or other traits
under selection. Because of this, agricultural crop variation in herbivore-
induced volatile production is ideal for examining allocation and ecological
costs of defenses.

Plant primary producers are a vital tool against the global threats of disease,
climate change, and food supply insecurity. It is imperative to understand how
selection pressures influence plant traits and the effects of those traits on
important biological interactions. The proposed research examines the ecological
costs of conventional breeding practices on agriculturally important species
interactions. Some applications from this work include informing land managers
and plant breeders about potential strategies to reduce herbivore damage levels
and the need for pesticides. This work will have educational benefits: the PI
will mentor undergraduate and graduate students and will participate in K-12
outreach activities. Increased participation of underrepresented groups in STEM
fields will be accomplished through undergraduate research involvement.
