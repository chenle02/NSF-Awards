In this grant supported under the GOALI initiative in the Experimental Physical
Chemistry program of the Chemistry division, A. Welford Castleman at
Pennsylvania State University, in conjunction with David Thorn of DuPont Central
Research and Development, will study the structure and kinetics of clusters of
transition metal oxides (Ti, Zr, Nb) in fast flow reactors using tandem mass
spectrometers. The effectiveness of these compounds as catalysts will be
determined by examining their effect on several novel gas-phase reactions, such
as the transfer of oxygen atoms to acetone to form methyl acetate. A catalyst is
a material which modifies a chemical reaction, such as increasing its rate or
causing different end products to be produced, while leaving the material itself
chemically unaltered at the end. The impetus behind this joint academic-
industrial research project is to determine the potential of various transition
metal oxide compounds as selective catalysts for chemical reactions involving
the C-C and C-H bonds in various hydrocarbon compounds. DuPont scientists with
experience in solid state chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis will be able to
synthesize materials which were identified in Pennsylvania State's gas-phase
experiments as being particularly active in catalyzing these reactions.
