1126339&lt;br/&gt;Rivera-Betancourt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant will provide funding for the acquisition of a
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to enhance undergraduate research, education
and training at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico Bayam√≥n Campus
(IAUPRBC). The requested SEM will be used for studies in interdisciplinary areas
of nanoscience, engineering and technology. The acquired instrument will be
shared with several research groups, which provides training, service, and
support to a large group of underrepresented students in Puerto
Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of this sophisticated and powerful
SEM, not only improves the educational and research experiences of the students
involved, but will also serve to develop a set of skills needed to become the
next STEM workforce. Curriculum enhancement will occur in the existing science
and engineering courses, and laboratories. Finally, in order to reach the K-12
educational sector, results of undergraduate projects and research will be used
to create demonstrations and exhibits highlighting new and emerging sciences and
engineering technologies. These activities will encourage K-12 students to
pursue STEM careers.
