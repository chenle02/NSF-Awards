The Hampton University sponsors a four-week Summer Science camp annually for
the same group of forty-eight rising seventh grade minority students. Program
activities include: 1) instruction in geometry, probability, and statistics in
experimental mode with emphasis on scientific research methodology, supplemented
with problem-solving, problem-solving techniques, the graphic calculator and
computer usage; 2) enrichment experiences such as study skills and writing for
success in mathematics; alleviation of mathematics anxiety; guest speakers who
discuss career options in mathematics and local field trips to business and
professional operations. Parents play an active role by providing after school
and weekend help for the student on the basis of their own program orientation
training. Follow-up activities include minds-on, hands-on activities developed
and presented by students using the skills and techniques acquired during the
summer program as well as additional classroom-laboratory activities.
