Students preparation for careers as scientists and teachers will improve
significantly by exposure in their laboratory classes and independent research
to a histology and neural imaging system that enables one to peer into the
workings and structure of the nervous system. Existing psychology courses will
improve, and we are adding an additional upper-level laboratory course on neural
techniques and neuroanatomy. Concurrently, University of Richmond students will
engage in activities with local middle-school science students, involving them
in laboratory experiences both at the university using the new equipment and at
their own school, promoting creative and critical thinking skills regarding the
brain, nervous system and behavior, while fostering an interest in science.
Collaborations will also continue with psychology faculty and students from
neighboring Randolph-Macon Women's College.
