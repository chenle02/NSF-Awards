9525766 Tyson Traveling waves of excitation provide a mechanism for
communication and spatial organization in a variety of biological systems, such
as waves of membrane depolarization in neuromuscular tissue, waves of mitosis in
fruit fly embryos, waves of cyclic AMP during slime mold aggregation, and waves
of infection spreading through susceptible populations. These and other examples
of excitability share many common features that can be expressed in generic
mathematical models of excitable media. The investigator and his colleague study
wave propagation in such models using established theoretical tools and new
computational approaches, focusing primarily on rotating scroll waves in three-
dimensional excitable media. As a scroll waves rotates around its central
"filament," the filament moves slowly through space according to certain laws of
motion that are still poorly understood. The investigators develop efficient and
accurate computational tools, based on a cellular automaton model of excitable
media, in order to simulate the motion of scroll filaments in large domains over
long periods of time. The thick-walled ventricle of the mammalian heart is a
three-dimensional excitable medium that propagates waves of electrochemical
activity. By modulating intracellular calcium levels, these waves control the
beating of the heart. During a normal heartbeat the wave induces the muscle
fibers of the left ventricle to contract synchronously and blood is efficiently
expelled from the chamber. But under pathological conditions (flutter and
fibrillation), the heartbeat degenerates into a rotating scroll wave of the sort
studied in this project. The rotating scroll wave causes the muscle fibers to
contract asynchronously, so that part of the chamber is relaxed when other parts
are contracting. As a result the blood within the chamber is not pumped
efficiently and the heart must be "defibrillated" to save the victim's life. To
understand the fundamental causes of ventricular fibrillation and its effective
treatment, one needs a better understanding of the onset, development and
annihilation of rotating scroll waves in three-dimensional excitable media,
which is the basic goal of this project.
