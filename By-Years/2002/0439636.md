This grant is supporting travel for student authors to the MASS 2004 conference.

Recent research on wireless networks and mobile computing has concentrated on
single-hop networks, where network nodes communicating directly to a fixed
infrastructure such as cellular or satellite systems. In ad-hoc and sensor
networks, multi-hop scenarios where network nodes communicate via other network
nodes are dominant. The increasing importance of this area has led to the
organization of the 1st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and
Sensor Systems (MASS 2004). MASS 2004 will be held from October 25-27, 2004 in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The meeting is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society
Technical Committee on Distributed Processing and Technical Committee on
Simulation.
