Yasbin 9600493 Support is provided for the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic
Biology to be held June 5-9, 1996, in Estes Park, Colorado. This conference is
primarily concerned with the biology of a variety of prokaryotic and lower
eukaryotic systems. It is the major annually occurring international meeting
devoted to this subject area and is often where new "emerging" genetic systems
are first described. The meeting has always been open to all researchers working
in the field of genetic exchange and related areas, including DNA repair,
restriction-modification systems and recombination pathways. A major strength of
the meetings has been the diversity of genetic systems represented; this
diversity has provided a fertile environment for new ideas, and for applying
well-established concepts to newly emerging genetic systems. Historically, a
significant feature of these meetings has been their accessibility to graduate
students and post-doctoral fellows. Support is being provided for those young
researchers who demonstrate need and are presenting work at the meeting.
Research discussed at this meeting is important because of the applications of
research in microbial genetics and physiology to biotechnology. ***
