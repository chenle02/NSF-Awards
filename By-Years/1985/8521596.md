The objectives of this research are to experimentally identify the effects of
pore size on reaction rate in systems where the molecular size of the reacting
species is comparable to that of the pore sizes within the material where the
reaction is taking place. Based on the hypothesis that pore size influences the
intrinsic reaction rate of large molecules within porous materials, a research
program will be estalbished to investigate the effect in model reaction systems
representative of the processing and upgrading of petroleum feedstocks as well
as those of importance in the biotechnology field. The goal of the research is
to address questions such as: Does the effect exist? What differences are
observed between various reaction systems, for example, immobilized enzyme
reactions versus catalytic hydrogenation reactions? What experimental techniques
are needed to study the effect unambiguously? What is the functional dependence
of the rate constants on the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter?
