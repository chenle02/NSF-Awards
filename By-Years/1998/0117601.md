Donohue/URI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a descriptive analysis of the
structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) system and its connection
to adjacent southern hemisphere circulation domains. It will use the Southern
Ocean sections obtained during the Hydrographic Program of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment, as well as historical data sets. The analysis will
follow five themes: a description of the abyssal circulation, including deep and
bottom water pathways to mid-latitudes; a study of the pathways of exchange of
deep water across the ACC; the transformation, by ventilation and mixing, of
warm water along the ACC; exchange between the ACC and subtropical gyres;
secular changes in the structure of the Southern Ocean. This work will help
determine the role played by the Southern Ocean in establishing the density
structure of the world's ocean. It will also provide a baseline for later
evaluations of long-term change in the structure of the Southern
Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;
