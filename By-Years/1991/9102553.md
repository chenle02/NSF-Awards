This project is concerned with parallel algorithms in computational geometry
that will be efficient when applied to large, real, databases. The emphasis is
on implementable algorithms instead of on algorithms with merely good
theoretical asymptotic performance. Two major techniques to be used are uniform
grids and local topological structures. The uniform grid allows efficient, easy,
spatial coincidence determination. Local topological data structures allow the
calculation of mass properties of a (well-defined) polyhedron without having any
global topological information. This research will extend previous work in
visible surface determination and Boolean combinations of polyhedra to higher
level algorithms. These algorithms included determining mass properties of a
constructive solid geometry tree, finding the tool-path volume and volume of
material cut out by a numerically controlled drill, interference detection in
robotics, and the cross-area problem in cartography. What these applications all
have in common is the need to determine spatial coincidences in large databases
and to find mass properties of Boolean combinations.
