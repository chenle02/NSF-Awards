This research explores the role of electric fields in the flame-synthesis of
nanoparticles. Recent theoretical developments indicate that electric fields can
alter the particle size and narrow the distribution of particle sizes. The lack
of data in this area has caused a division in the aerosol community over the
effect of such fields on particle size. Proof of the concepts proposed in this
research may lead to significant improvements in the production of finer, more
uniform nanoparticles. The research could have direct application to the
manufacture of ceramics and semiconductors, and to the production of pigments
and cosmetics. The two-year cooperative study involves a series of student/PI
visits to the University of Karlruhe which is carrying on a similar project and
has a strong record in aerosol research as well as state-of-the-art equipment.
Collaboration with the German group will significantly enhance the chance of
success because of the enlarged group and the enhanced facilities.
