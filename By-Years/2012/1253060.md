An award is made to the University of Illinois at Chicago to develop a new
platform to control dissolved gasses in cellular cultures. Current methods to do
this are imprecise and create limitation in new discoveries of basic cellular
biology. Our oxygen platform leverages rapid diffusion found at the microscale
to expose cells or tissues to various oxygen landscapes as defined by the buried
microfluidic gas networks. There are three key innovations with our platform. 1)
The culture area is large enough to harvest enough cellular material to process
with standard biological assays such as Western blots, PCR analysis, or flow
cytometry. 2) The platform is easily suited for live-cell imaging under hypoxia
in the absence of shear flow which is currently not possible or exceedingly
cumbersome. 3) The platform equilibrates in minutes instead of hours (an order
of magnitude improvement), allows rapid oxygen condition modulation, and allows
new oxygen landscapes to be exposed across samples that would not be possible
with standard methods. Together, these innovations should allow our platform to
replace the current methods for oxygen modulation and facilitate new
investigations currently limited by costly or imprecise equipment. The platform
developed under this proposal will create a suite of tools to probe a previously
difficult to control variable and enhance experimental efficiency. There is a
tremendous need and demand for improved methods of oxygen control in the
biomedical research community. This is based on the initial response we have
received when discussing with potential collaborators and dearth of comparable
methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objectives of this proposal aim
to develop interest for science and engineering through exposure of elementary
students to interactive laboratory activities at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. We will target at risk elementary school students by working with the
Girl Scouts of Chicago to provide positive experiences with science and
engineering in the years before their impressions are set. Program evaluation
will include both formative feedback, which will allow us to adjust our methods
as we learn from the activities, and a summative appraisal of whether the stated
goals have been met. We will have interactive lab activities involved with cell
biology and basic processing with the Arduino platform, both of which are
integrated into the research objectives of this proposal. Specifically, scouts
will spend a day at UIC and work with female graduate students to demonstrate
the excitement, creativity, and innovation found in research.
