The U.S. coatings industry faces concurrent demands for improved quality,
energy conservation, reduced pollution and elimination of unsafe materials, at
the same time it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to foreign competition. The
1,100 companies that produce coatings and their raw material supplies are
responding to these changes in different ways, including increasing research and
development budgets. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is a
possible approach that might provide industry with additional research
addressing industrial needs. This planning grant is studying the feasibility and
viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in coatings. The
project is studying the alternative organization, policies, operations, and
industrial research interests for an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center in Coatings at Eastern Michigan University and North Dakota State
University, as a joint endeavor. The Co-Principal Investigator and the
associated researchers at both universities are national recognized experts in
their fields and have the industrial contact necessary to study the potential
for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Coatings. This project
has been coordinated with Robert M. Wellek, Chemical, Biochemical, and Thermal
Engineering in the Directorate for Engineering. The Program Manager recommends
that Eastern Michigan University (with a subcontract to North Dakota State
University) be awarded a grant of $49,927 for one (1) year of this project.
