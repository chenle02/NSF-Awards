9409119 Verlinde An integrated cloud analysis system, consisting of a numerical
cloud model integrated into a four-dimensional variational data assimilation
system will be developed for the assimilation of radar, lidar, microwave
radiometer, and aircraft measurements. This analysis system will retrieve four-
dimensional fields of wind, temperature, pressure, and microphysical parameters
from Doppler/polimetric radar and other remotely sensed quantities. This
analysis system will be an alternative to currently used dual-Doppler analysis
techniques. I avoids determining the vertical velocity through integration of
the continuity equation, and also eliminates the stationarity assumption of
dual-Doppler analysis techniques. It will be designed to assimilate multi-
parameter radar observation of the hydrometer on the radar observed radial
velocity fields can therefore be included in the analysis without using a
terminal velocity-reflectivity relationship.
