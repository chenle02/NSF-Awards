Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter
in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this
so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics,
and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised
of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments
after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our
galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located
deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.

The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of
low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs
on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad
impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments
will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many
applications in science and technology.

This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of
measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement
in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley
physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school
students from underserved backgrounds.

This award will provide support for the analysis of SuperCDMS Soudan, testing
and characterization of the detectors and hardware of SuperCDMS SNOLAB, and
scientific support during construction, installation and commissioning of the
experiment. Finally, it will support long term R&D into improving the phonon and
ionization sensitivity of cryogenic semiconductor detectors. The high background
rejection and control of contamination that SuperCDMS technology offers provide
significant advantages compared to other technologies, providing world-leading
sensitivity to low-mass dark matter, competitive sensitivity to high-mass WIMPS,
and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment.
