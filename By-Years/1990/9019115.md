Despite the ecological and economic importance of vertebrate suspension
feeders, hypotheses about particle entrapment mechanisms inside their oral
cavities have rarely been tested and the fluid mechanics of filtration by
vertebrates has not been modelled. This project will develop a mathematical
model of flow fields around and particle retention by the gill raker of
blackfish (Cyprinidae), and will apply this model to Pacific herring (Clupeidae)
and northern anchovy (Engraulidae). Using a fiberoptic endoscope and thermistor
flow probe to record the first images and water velocities inside the oral
cavity of a vertebrate suspension feeder, an unexpected filtration mechanism was
documented in blackfish. Gill rakers, assumed to be the site of particle
retention in fishes, act in blackfish as barriers that direct particle-laden
water to the mucus-covered oral roof. A thermistor flow probe will provide
empirical values for the model parameters in herring and anchovy, and a
fiberoptic endoscope will establish whether the model accurately predicts the
pattern of flow at the rakers. The model will indicate the flow velocities and
raker morphologies that are associated with the functioning of rakers as
barriers versus filters, and will be applicable to a diversity of fish species
and other suspension feeders.
