This research proposes to make a major advance in determining the details of
turbulent flows by using digital image processing and tracking techniques to
obtain complete instantaneous measurements (velocity vectors, vorticity, and
strain fields) in space and time for several well-established turbulent flows in
boundary layers and in pipe flows. Detailed vector velocity field data in both
space and time will be obtained by a frame-by-frame tracking of particle flow
markers in stereoscopic films. From these measurements, vorticity and strain
rate fields will be calculated. To accomplish this analysis, massive amounts of
data must be processed in a reasonably automatic way. This research proposes to
establish the type of digital information needed from the visual records and
then develop the software necessary to extract that information in an efficient
manner.
