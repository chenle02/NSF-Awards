Investigators Gary Swenson and Chester Gardner developed a model relationship
for the hydroxyl radical Meinel band airglow, focusing on the intensity or
rotational temperature changes and changes due to atmospheric wave perturbed
density/temperature. Now, they extend validating this model to use data from two
facilities. They are also using the same relationship of intensity to the 5577
angstrom emission from atomic oxygen and the oxygen molecule atmospheric band
airglow. Finally, they are developing spectral models of airglow images to study
MesoD campaign data from Illinois, and will upgrade and field an airglow imager
at Albuquerque, associated with a Starfire follow-on campaign. An added benefit
to this project is its investment to planned investigations with the
Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite
mission.
