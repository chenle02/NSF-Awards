This Major Research Instrumentation project will focus on the development of a
device to automatically collect and extract organic aerosols from the ambient
atmosphere. The system will be compared with conventional samplers in the
laboratory and during field sampling campaigns. Automated low-cost aerosol
sampling devices are needed for chemical characterization of ambient air
pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key features of the instrument will be: (1)
reduction of sampling and decomposition artifacts characteristic of filter-based
and thermal desorption instruments; (2) a combination of a small particle
deposit area with ultra-low solvent volumes, of the order of a microliter, that
allows the device to achieve high time resolution and sensitivity; (3) solvent
extraction that preserves the chemical composition of the sample; (4) the
extraction efficiency is enhanced by using elevated solvent temperature and
pressure; and (5) the flexibility of use, as it can be used for off-line
collection or coupled to an online instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
