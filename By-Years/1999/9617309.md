Instrumentation: Intelligent Assistance for Multiple Robots This award supports
the purchase of equipment to be used in the following research projects:
-Intelligent Assistance of remote Robots using a Tactical Agent-Intelligent
Assistance for Problem Solving for Multiple Robots. Multiple autonomous robots
have a wide variety of applications, including Urban Search and Rescue,
hazardous waste cleanup, and planetary rovers. Full autonomy for these robots is
often unrealistic given the current state of AI and demands of the domain. Two
research projects will investigate aspects of semi-autonomous control for multi-
agents. One project will extend work in the search of physical spaces to address
issues of how to use a tactical robot to intelligently assist in the
coordination and control of remote robots. The tactical robot will interpret the
teleoperator's strategic commands for the inspection robots for the immediate
situation and supplement and/or modify them in order to safely control the
inspection robots. The project will contribute a better understanding of
cooperative heterogenous agents, thereby improving task performance, reducing
cognitive fatigue, and minimizing teleoperator training. The second project will
extend visual interaction methods for problem solving in order to allow a
teleoperator to simultaneously control and diagnose failures in remote robots
without cognitive fatigue. The expected contributions include a new paradigm of
intelligent assistance, not restricted to robotics, based on differences in the
agents' cognitive abilities.
