9303408 Von Damm In this multi-institutional project the PIs will analyze
chimney samples and water samples from Lucky Strike, a newly discovered vent
site along MAR. This site is somewhat unique relative to previously discovered
hydrothermal vent systems in that it is located on the Azores platform and that
the vents are more dispersed. There are other similarities and differences. The
PIs argue that the samples to be analyzed represent an opportunity to study a
shallow hydrothermal system on a slow- spreading ridge. ***
