This project is a one year program to implement a planning process that will
lead to submission of a proposal to provide Teacher Enhancement for science and
mathematics teachers of the Navajo Nation. The program will coordinate the
planning activities of a broad partnership of educational and scientific
organizations to effect systemic change in the quality of mathematics and
science education. Three national laboratories and two major universities will
be active participants in the planning process. The program to be developed will
emphasize dissemination of teacher enhancement activities throughout the service
area, adequate on-going support on-site to teachers implementing improvements,
and development of culturally appropriate curriculum in science at all levels.
