The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance
understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way
for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in
computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible
way. This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with
ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region's graduate
students will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to
contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. This meeting is
well on its way to becoming a regular series for the region, with different
academic and industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation. This
year's meeting is the third in the series: the first meeting was held in 1994 at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, and the second meeting in April 1995 at the
University of Delaware. Both meetings were very successful, and at the business
session conducted at the end of the Delaware meeting it was agreed to meet at
IBM Research in 1996, the first industrial site of our series. The meetings have
had the endorsement (without financial support) of ACM's Special Interest Group
for Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SIGSAM) and of the Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). ***
