This project is a synergistic study of radar and optical measurements for
investigating and characterizing the occurrence of Naturally Enhanced Ion
Acoustic Lines (NEIALs) with coincident auroral fine structures. While it is
known that NEIALs are a manifestation of large-amplitude ion acoustic waves and
potentially Langmuir waves and/or large current densities, their influence and
feedback on the electromagnetic and particle energy transfer within the
magnetosphere-ionosphere system is not well understood. The project will make
use of common-volume observations of the nighttime auroral ionosphere with
ground-based Electron Multiplying Charged Couple Device (EMCCD) imagers and the
Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) to gain an improved understanding of
NEIAL generation mechanisms. A suite of six narrowfield imagers will be used,
each equipped with a different narrow bandpass filter, imaging multiple auroral
emission lines simultaneously in order to derive the spatial distribution of the
precipitating electron energy. The observations will take place during moon down
periods, in both campaign and remote operation modes. The theory and modeling
components will be investigated in partnership with an international
collaborator.
