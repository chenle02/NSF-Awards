This renewal proposal presents work to be carried-out in three different areas:
(1) viscous liquids and glasses, with an emphasis on the nature of the ideal
glass transition; (2) liquids and glass under negative pressure, with an added
emphasis on the glassy state under tension; (3) a computer simulation study of
geochemical liquids, with an emphasis on the liquid silicates.
