The objective of the research is to develop an innovative spin-transfer torque
random access memory (STT-RAM) based memory hierarchy to meet the demands of
modern embedded systems for low-power, fast-speed and high-density on-chip data
storage. &lt;br/&gt;Three integrated components are included in our research to
address the major technical concerns in STT-RAM designs: (1) Application-driven
STT-RAM cell design and optimization to target different embedded system
specifications. (2) Thermal resilient adaptive STT-RAM memory hierarchy to
tolerate the temperature instability of STT-RAM incurred by ambient temperature
and self-heating. (3) Probabilistic STT-RAM design methodology to improve the
run-time stability and/or the performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
provides a comprehensive design package for efficiently integrating STT-RAM into
modern embedded system designs and offers unparalleled performance and power
advantages. The system architects and the circuit designers can be well bridged
and educated by the research innovations. The developed techniques can be
directly transferred to industry applications under the close collaborations
with several industry partners, and directly impact the future embedded systems.
The activities in the collaboration also include the tutorials in the major
conferences on the technical aspects of the projects and new course development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational components of this project will introduce
the students to the implementation and optimization techniques of embedded
systems and train the students? problem solving ability by leveraging challenge
based instruction technique.
