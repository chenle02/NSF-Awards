When a single fertilized cell develops into an intricately patterned organism
with multiple organs (such as the heart and liver), those organs grow to
predetermined sizes; when problems occur that cause injury, growth retardation,
or increased growth, organs still reach and then stop at their predetermined
sizes. This is because of a process called the "organ size checkpoint". Despite
years of study, how the organ size checkpoint works remains an important,
fundamental question in biology. Utilizing the powerful genetic system of the
fruit fly, several research teams discovered that a group of genes called the
Hippo pathway work together as a "foreperson" or "overseer" of the organ size
checkpoint. The Hippo pathway coordinates when cells in an organ grow, divide,
or die by delegating other genes to carry out these tasks by turning these other
genes on or off. The proposed studies will use cultured cells, biochemistry, and
fruit fly genetics to identify these important other genes controlled by the
Hippo pathway. Identifying these genes will advance our understanding of the
fundamental regulation of cell division, cell growth, and cell death during
development and will shed tremendous light on how organs grow to and are
maintained at the appropriate size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
provide high school, undergraduate, and graduate students with experiences
catered to their diverse backgrounds and experience levels: younger students
will learn to work and think independently while collaborating with advanced
students who engage in detailed, hypothesis-driven experiments. Working and
communicating as a team will give younger students a valuable foundation for a
career in science and will help graduate students develop mentoring skills;
therefore, this work will have a broader impact of training young scientists and
instilling leadership skills they need to drive the next generation of
scientific breakthroughs.
