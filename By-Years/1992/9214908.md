This award is for the development of a course on modern processor design that
will focus on instruction level parallel (ILP) processing in single chip
processors and will include techniques for superpipelined and superscalar
processor design, instruction scheduling techniques for ILP type processor, and
instruction-level performance evaluation and characterization. A new processor
design methodology involving experimentation and quantitative analysis of the
performance impact of specific design features will be presented in the course.
Dr. Shen will be writing a textbook as well as a set of lecture notes for
distribution to other institutions. This award is for the development of a
senior-level computer engineering course on modern processor design. The course
will address contemporary processor design techniques relevant to the design of
current and future generation processors that exploit instruction level
parallelisms. Examples include superpipelined, superscalar, supersymmetry and
Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors. A textbook and a set of lecture
notes will be disseminated as part of this project.
