This proposal describes a collaborative effort between Wright State University
faculty and the Trotwood-Madison (T-M) City School District to support the new
textbook-free science curriculum at T-M with a strong science enhancement
program for the 96 elementary classroom teachers in the district. Scientists and
science educators from Wright State University will provide training in hands-on
science in the life (1st year) and physical sciences (2nd year), utilizing
modular materials such as Fast Plants and Gems. The program will include 2
three-week summer sessions (5 days/week, 6-8 hours/day), continuing education
workshops throughout the school-year, end-of-year workshops, follow- up visits
and guest lectures. In addition, Wright State faculty will, on occasion, become
"substitute teachers" to provide no-cost development time for the T-M teachers.
This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement Program because it
contains a strong science enhancement program designed to reach all of the
elementary classroom teachers in the targeted school district. It will provide
teacher participants with opportunities to learn life and physical science
concepts and science processes, and effective teaching methods. Non-NSF cost-
sharing is approximately or 32% of the amount requested from NSF.
