Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is
expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home
institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The
award to North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University has
potential to increase the understanding of the cell membrane. The proposed study
intends to train undergraduate and graduate students in the study of an enzyme
that affects cell membrane function. The PI will actively engage and recruit
underrepresented minority students into the project so that the students may
engage in cutting edge research. This activity will enhance the technical and
critical thinking skills of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
proposal is to study the PKCα-BCATc interaction via biochemical and biophysical
methods. Previously the PI showed that the membrane localization of cytosolic
human Branched-Chain Aminotransferase (BCATc) regulates the autophagosome
synthesis which further regulates Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and the membrane
localization of BCATc is redox regulated by the Protein Kinase C α (PKCα)
mediated phosphorylation. In this proposed work, the PI will identify the PKCα-
mediated phosphorylation site in BCATc, express and purify the PKCα-
phosphorylated BCATc, and solve the crystal structure of the phosphorylated
BCATc to analyze the structural changes of BCATc triggered by the
phosphorylation by PKCα. The work will analyze the structure of PKCα-BCATc
complex via co-crystallization and other biophysical methods, e.g. SPRi to
uncover the protein-protein interaction interface and further understand the
mechanism of the phosphorylation process. The constructed model built from the
project outcomes will enable the PI to understand the mechanism of how the
redox-regulated phosphorylation of BCATc by PKCα regulates its conformational
changes that further regulate its membrane localization. This is the first time
that these interactions will be described at the molecular level, and this would
be a significant contribution to the field and help advance the understanding of
these two inter-related modes of BCATc regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
