In response to the growing importance of neuroscience research in the behavioral
sciences, a neuroscience laboratory has been established for teaching in
psychology. Laboratory experience at all levels of the undergraduate social
science curriculum is offered from freshman seminars to advanced seminars and
independent research projects. The core of this project is a new upper level
course, Laboratory in Physiological Psychology, which provides instruction in
modern neuroanatomical methods. This project requires equipment for preparation
of animals, for histological processing of neural tissue, and for analyzing and
recording the resulting material. Thus, the equipment includes operating
microscopes for surgery, a sliding microtome to cut frozen sections, and
compound microscopes equipped to observe and record fluorescent tracers. This
facility complements the college's molecular neuroscience facility in biology
and makes available comprehensive neuroscience laboratory courses. The award
will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.
