DMS-0403367&lt;br/&gt;Vladimir Voevodsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resources
provided by this grant will be used primarily for research in the motivic
homotopy theory. The motivic homotopy theory is a field of mathematics centered
on a new way of using geometric intuition to deal with algebraic problems. It
originated about ten years ago and became recognized after being used to prove
the Milnor conjecture relating Galois cohomology, Milnor's K-theory and
quadratic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translating the intuition of the motivic
homotopy theory into rigorous mathematical results requires sophisticated
formalism, which, as of today, is only partly developed. During the time period
covered by this grant the principal investigator plans to work on the parts of
this formalism known as is the theory of cohomological operations in the motivic
cohomology and the motivic Spanier-Whitehead duality.&lt;br/&gt;
