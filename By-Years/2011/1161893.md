The research objective of this award is to establish fundamental theory, develop
computational techniques, and prototype real-world implementations for next
generation driver-assist systems that ensure safety and fuel efficiency at
traffic intersections. The research will result in algorithms for smart vehicles
that cooperate with each other at intersections, merges, and stop signs to guide
their drivers toward provably safe (no collisions) and fuel efficient driving
choices. The research approach is to employ hybrid dynamical models (systems
described by differential equations and logic) with imperfect information and
solve a safety control problem for hybrid systems with unknown state. The
industry partner will enable the development of prototypes of cooperative active
safety systems that ensure collision-free and fuel efficient driving.
Deliverables include algorithms and prototypes for cooperative active safety
systems that account for fuel efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
the results of this research will allow the development of cost-effective and
guaranteed driver-assist systems for safety and efficiency. Therefore, it has
the potential of impacting society by lowering American roadway fatalities. The
driver-assist systems for fuel efficiency will contribute in lowering the
economic cost of vehicle driving and reduce emission, with clear benefits to the
environment. This work promotes a synergy of sensing, communication, and control
technologies. This along with the industry collaboration will potentially bring
a substantial technological advancement to the automotive industry in the near
future. Students working on this project will have the unique opportunity to
work on cutting-edge technology at the industrial site collaborating with expert
practitioners. The research results will be disseminated broadly through various
means, including workshops at national and international meetings and more
focused workshops at both the industry site and at MIT.
