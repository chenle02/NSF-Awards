This award supports the participation of US scientists at the 12th Marcel
Grossmann Meeting on recent developments in theoretical and experimental general
relativity, astrophysics and relativistic field theories, to be held in Paris,
France, July 12-18, 2009. The "MG" meetings have been organized regularly since
1975 and approximately 500-1000 researchers worldwide convene at them to present
and discuss their work. This award will enable a strong US presence at this
international venue and will allow US researchers to keep current with the
latest developments in their fields. The travel funds from this award will be
primarily used to help young researchers participate in the meeting since
attendance at this type of conferences can be a formative event in the
preparation of the next generation of US researchers in the field.
