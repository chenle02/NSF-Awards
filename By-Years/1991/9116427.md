Recent calculations indicate that the recycled biogenic flux of trace metals in
surface seawater should overwhelm all other inputs. In order to address the
question of the biological cycling of trace metals in surface seawater, this
project will expand on the principal investigator's research on metal uptake by
phytoplankton to study metal uptake by bacteria and the role of bacteria in the
remineralization of biogenic metal compounds. This research will include studies
of the kinetics of algal and bacterial uptake of Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Cd, and
the identification of metal uptake and metal storage compounds as well as
metalloproteins, and the quantification of the mechanisms responsible for the
release of the metals from these compounds.
