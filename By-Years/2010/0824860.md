OISE-0824860 (Lewis, J.P. - West Virginia University) IRES: Supramolecular
Structure and Materials in Nanoscience at Jilin University. Six teams of
students (one graduate student and one undergraduate student per team) will work
with researchers at the State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and
Materials located at Jilin University (Changchun, P.R. China). In an eight-week
program, students will work in five key research areas: Magnetic Nanostructures,
DNA - Carbon Nanotube Combing during Layer-by-Layer Assembly, Multi-Pore
Nanoparticles, Artificial Enzyme Mimics, and DNA Conformation for Nano-Material
Applications. Students from underrepresented minorities will comprise over half
of the participants as we use this opportunity to retain and recruit these
students. Each year, symposia at both Jilin University and WVU will be run with
participation of faculty and students from each institution. Students
participating in the IRES program will use these symposia as an opportunity to
present their findings; other non-IRES students will also be encouraged to
participate in these symposia.
