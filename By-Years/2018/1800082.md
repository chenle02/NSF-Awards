This project will continue research activity on the development of various
aspects of mathematical analysis which are relevant to some of the most
fundamental problems in the area of harmonic analysis and partial differential
equations and its applications. The project will also continue the training of
graduate students and postdoctoral students to carry out research in these
problems. Many of the topics to be studied have their origin in problems coming
from physics and engineering. It is expected that the research proposed will
have a synergistic effect between these fields and the mathematical fields of
analysis and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of the research will
be the study of soliton resolution for the energy critical wave equation and the
wave map equation, both in the presence and the absence of symmetry, and for
other dispersive and dispersive-geometric models. In another direction, a study
will be made of quantitative unique continuation in local settings and at
infinity, including the cases of periodic and random coefficients, and their
connection with homogenization theory. This is a very ambitious program of
research that will have lasting consequences for the development of these areas.
The principal investigator will ensure the wide dissemination of the results
obtained, including their use in the development of courses, the training of
graduate students and postdocs, and the exploration of the connections with
other fields of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
