This proposal requests matching support to create a dynamic science,
engineering, and technology careers museum exhibit--SET Careers, for
distribution to science museums and technology centers. The exhibit kiosks with
related career graphics surrounds, incorporate multimedia platforms, using
MacIntosh authoring software to dreate information landscapes' computer motion
programs like Quicktime, and Cd-1 or DVI videodisc technology. Yound museum
visitors (teens and Preteens) will be invited to enter into an exciting
interactive exploration of thirty self-narrated video profiles of people in
science and engineering, try our animated/reality video simulations of a work
experience in these fields, and obtain additional information from a database of
over 200 more science and math-based professions. The videodisc profiles,
database, and a personal interests component will also be developed in
alternative media formats (video, audio, print, computer disc) for broad
distribution to community and youth education networks, schools, and libraries.
Specific emphasis in this project is being placed on reaching and attracting
female, minority, and disabled youths.
