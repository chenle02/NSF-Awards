The research objective of this project is to develop sound theoretical
foundations, design computer representations and algorithms, and to implement an
experimental system for integrated material-shape modeling of components with
continuously varying heterogeneous and anisotropic materials. The key technical
challenge is to create physically meaningful models and computationally
effective representations of the material density functions defined over the
boundary and the interior of the solid, given their description and/or variation
on the known portions of the solid model. The proposed approach is based on the
method for transfinite interpolation that parameterizes the interior of any
solid in terms of the approximate distance fields to the specified material
features. A comprehensive approach to the problem of material modeling will
explore three distinct, but related, topic areas: (1) representational issues,
(2) algorithms and systems, and (3) applications in design and manufacturing of
parts with heterogeneous material properties. The results of the research will
be tested in a prototype system based on a commercial solid modeler.

Successful completion of the project should lead to substantial progress in
enabling and integrating modeling, design, and manufacturing of heterogeneous
and anisotropic parts. Such components are becoming increasingly important due
to emerging techniques in design of functionally graded materials and solid
free-form fabrication techniques (such as layered manufacturing) that allow
local material composition control. The anticipated advantages of the new
technology include exactness of representation, independence from interior
discretizations, complete automation, guaranteed analytical properties, and
compatibility with existing standards for geometric modeling and data exchange.
