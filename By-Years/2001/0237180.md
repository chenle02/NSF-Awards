Professor Andrew Ewing of Pennsylvania State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to fabricate unilamellar liposomes to
use as models for biological cells. The idea is to study fusion of the liposomes
using advanced electrochemical methods in order to learn about fusion itself,
and as a model for cell exocytosis. Microelectrode work as well as scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using nanotube tips will be performed.
Parameters to be examined include vesicle size, mode of fusion, membrane
composition, pH and ionic strength and development of an artificial dense core
with hydrogels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exocytosis is a fundamental process
underlying communication between cells, for example between neurons. A better
understanding of exocytosis could lead to improved models of brain function and
treatment. Fusion of vesicles is an important process in drug delivery. There
are applications of this work in microfluidics and possibly for biosensors as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
