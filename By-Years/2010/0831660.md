Users' desires to share high definition audio and video around the home are
driving the need for ever-increasing wireless bandwidth. Wideband radios, whose
bandwidth spans hundreds of MHz to many GHz, can provide the solution. Recent
years have shown significant work on the design and implementation of wideband
radio transceivers that function for a single link. However, this is not enough;
for wideband technologies to become practical, we need a wideband link to
coexist with narrowband technologies with which it shares the spectrum (e.g.,
802.11 a/b/g and WiMax), as well as operate efficiently in the presence of other
wideband links producing successful wideband networks.

This project presents FAWN, a Frequency Adaptive Wideband Network designed for
wideband radios operating in the unlicensed spectrum. FAWN allows wideband
transceivers to coexist with narrowband devices operating in the same
frequencies, while forming a network of their own. FAWN also exploits frequency
diversity, introducing novel autorate algorithms and MAC protocols that are
frequency-aware. We will implement FAWN in wideband radio hardware and evaluate
our design in a testbed of wideband nodes and narrowband interferers.

The intellectual merit of this research involves designing and building the
first system architecture for wideband networks that coexist safely with unknown
narrowband devices. The work also has an important broader impact because it
enables the rich-media wireless home which is of great interest to the wireless
industry, and is closely integrated with an educational plan that involves both
graduate and undergraduate students, with special emphasize on women and
underrepresented groups.
