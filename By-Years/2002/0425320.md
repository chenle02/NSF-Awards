Funds are provided to quantify the dependence of the polar cap index (PC) on
solar wind parameters, and thereby to determine the best functional form for PC,
by calculating response filters based on singular value decomposition theory. At
present, PC values are derived by using a scheme that aims to force agreement,
on average, between PC and the solar wind motional electric field. Preliminary
examination of the derivation scheme has revealed problems in how PC is defined.
These problems may actually degrade the usefulness of the index in research
studies and in an operational sense as a space weather forecasting or nowcasting
tool. In addition, PC will be used to estimate the level of solar wind driving
force that leads to polar cap potential drop saturation and determine the
relative contributions of Hall and field-aligned currents to polar magnetic
field disturbance. An improved and consistent definition of PC, as is sought in
this research, should allow improved nowcasting and short-term forecasting of
space weather events known to interfere with radio communication, radars, and
low-orbiting and geostationary satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
