Impact of Engineering Programs on K-12 Teacher Preparation A group of three
students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute will spend fourteen weeks (seven
weeks at WPI and seven weeks at NSF) working on an interactive qualifying
project as part of the requirements for their programs at WPI. The students will
study a number of NSF engineering projects which have a significant K-12 teacher
preparation focus. They will determine the impact of these projects on the
teacher preparation community and will investigate effective ways in which these
types of engineering/teacher education collaborations can be promoted and
implemented. They will present their findings at the American Society for
Engineering Education's national conference.
