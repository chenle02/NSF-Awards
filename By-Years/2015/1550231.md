The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be on the Real Estate Industry,
specifically targeted at the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them
increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments through Smart Home
Automation. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach
$71B by 2018. The MFH industry will participate through additional charges to
the residents for smart home automation support. However, the bigger increase in
revenue will most likely come from better data and insights on their buildings
which leads to opportunities to monetize that data and sell software targeted at
MFH buildings. In addition to increased revenue, there is potential to save
costs through more efficient use of labor and materials and through better
management of energy. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire
building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their
entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology
has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand
response programs.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable
the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of
mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network
isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at
Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired
are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to
address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family
dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The issue is that all
the devices could easily be paired but to differentiate the nodes so that they
authenticate and provision to the right apartment is the challenge. Developing a
cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key
component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-
Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is that a proof of
concept will be developed that gives directional guidance on the best way to
solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them
appropriately to the correct apartment.
