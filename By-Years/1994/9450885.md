9450885 Al-Saigh Funds are requested for purchasing a state-of-the-art Atomic
Absorption Spectrometer to be used for undergraduate instruction in chemistry at
Columbus College. Several courses will be affected by the proposed equipment.
This instrument is intended to enhance the quality of instruction and to expose
students to both the theoretical background and the (experimental) operation of
modern computer-assisted equipment. The AA will be incorporated in the
curriculum of General Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Quantitative Analysis,
Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, and in undergraduate
research in Chemistry. Students will be able to use a powerful analytical
technique to quantify a variety of elements such as lead in water and waste
water, calcium in solutions, zinc in hair, manganese and iron in pet food,
manganese in steel, and lead in food, blood, serum, and soft drinks. In
addition, students will determine toxic metals such as Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Se, and
Ag in water and wastes. Students will appreciate the utilization and benefits of
interfacing a computer with this instrument and the effect it has on
quantification.
