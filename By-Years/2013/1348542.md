This project will enable the development of personally-tailored motivators for
the use of social technologies, e.g., various incentives to encourage users to
contribute knowledge, provide emotional support or curate information on an
online system. The project includes (1) study of motivator-to-motivation
matching using a series of controlled studies, (2) development of models to
infer users' motivation profiles through analyzing how underlying motivations
predict usages of social technologies, and (3) application and evaluation of
tailored motivators to encourage user-participation in naturalistic settings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will advance scientific
understanding of how a person's motivations influence his or her usage of social
technologies. It will also deepen our understanding of human motivations more
generally by elucidating the intricate relationship between the types of rewards
and how they are moderated by different underlying motivations to affect
behaviors. In addition, the research will also result in models for identifying
users' motivation profiles, and a general design framework for researchers and
designers to tailor motivators, bridging multiple
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed motivation profiles and design
framework may be useful to tackle a variety of everyday challenges of motivation
in social technologies to improve knowledge sharing, social support and
information representation. Through collaborative projects, this research will
also aid health behavior change efforts to encourage blood donation and combat
infant obesity. Finally, through an integrated educational plan, this research
program will also contribute to improving general classroom learning, the
creation of a graduate course and high school summer camp, and the training of
scholars in interdisciplinary research methods.
