The Biology faculty at Kalamazoo College is improving the laboratory portion of
its Molecular Biology course through the introduction of experiments that employ
gel electrophoresis. The biology curriculum includes core courses in Populations
and Ecosystems, General Zoology, General Botany, and Cellular Biology, as well
as a number of advanced electives. One such elective is an upper-level course in
Molecular Biology, which consists of a lecture series based on B. Lewin's
textbook Genes II, a journal club based on readings from the primary literature,
and a laboratory. The purpose of this project is to improve the laboratory
component of this course. A new series of experiments will be introduced based
on the lab text Recombinant DNA Techniques: an Introduction by Rodriquez and
Tait. These experiments will involve gene cloning in Escherichia coli, and
utilize gel electrophoresis at several points. The equipment obtained as part of
this project is being used to monitor cleavage and ligation of DNA molecules, as
well as to construct a restriction endonuclease map of a cloned DNA fragment.
Students completing these experiments are expected to develop a better
understanding of the concepts and methods in molecular biology, and to be
prepared to do further work in this area.
