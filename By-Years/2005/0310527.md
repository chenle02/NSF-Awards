Title: Embedded Software for Domain-Specialized Platforms PI: Ingrid
Verbauwhede, UCLA

This project develops design methods for embedded software in the context of
portable, integrated and secure platforms. An example of such a platform is a
key-chain or a next-generation smart-card with integrated electronics and
embedded fingerprint sensor. The key-chain allows to use biometrics as a
personal key in electronic payments or access control. The software for this
platform is complex and draws from multiple application domains, including
signal processing, cryptography, and protocol transaction processing. Moreover,
this software must integrate encryption and fingerprint signal co-processors.
Thus, the design method for such software must allow for multiple design
paradigms to coexist, and at the same time must also make optimal use of the
constrained, embedded form factor to which it is confined.

The design method is based on two principles. The first principle is the use of
virtual machine specializations. A virtual machine allows for a smooth, write-
once run-everywhere development concept, while the specializations allow native
support of domain-specific co-processors. The second principle is that of
flexible interconnect, which allows to shape the target architecture to the
application at hand. Both of these methods are genuine innovations in embedded
software design context.

On a broader scale, these design techniques are applicable to a wide range of
portable, embedded devices that provide a tighter coupling of secure information
infrastructure with the real world. For example, currently digital identities
are insufficiently coupled to physical identities, resulting in identity theft
becoming a large-scale problem. Software is a key enabler to combat this
problem, and the design techniques from this project will have broad impact by
allowing this software to migrate to the embedded context where it is required.
