&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output feedback
control of nonlinear systems. The design procedure starts with the design of a
state feedback control followed by the design of robust observer to recover
performance achieved with a state feedback. The performance of such observers
are usually hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively
large transient response. The principal investigator has shown that the
undesirable transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback
control to be globally bounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach proved useful
in achieving fundamental progress in semiglobal stabilization, sliding-mode
control, servomechanisms, and adaptive control. While the earlier work has
emphasized robustness, the goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive
theory for the design of high-gain observer-based output feedback controllers
for nonlinear systems that aims at achieving both robustness and good
performance. The new element we bring in this proposal is the use of
nonlinearities as a tool for improving
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research tasks include: improved performance
of the universal integral regulator, performance issues in high-gain observer-
based output feedback controllers, multivariable systems, experimental testbeds,
and a pedagogic of the use of nonlinearities as a tool for improving
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear systems under consideration arise in
many applications such as mechanical systems, aircraft control, and electric
machines. Earlier results have been applied to the control of induction motors
and a mechanical system known as the pendubot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&
