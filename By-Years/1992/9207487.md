The mathematical structure of the collective excitations of model neural
networks will be examined for the relevance which they may have to the essential
aspects of "higher nervous function." An examination of this subject requires
that much be known about the pattern of connections between nerve cells. Since
this cannot be provided directly from neurobiological experiments, we will work
with the case of associative memory, where the nature of the connections is
believed to be due to the structure in the information provided by the external
world. The nature of the collective properties is expected to depend on the
topology of the underlying neural circuits. The fundamental question is whether
the interactions between any collective excitations have useful computational
properties.
