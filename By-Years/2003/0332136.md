0332136 McMahon A broad objective of the proposed work is to determine how
microbialcommunity structure and function is linked to successful EBPR process
performance. To achieve this objective, the key organisms whose presence is
necessary for efficient EBPR operation must be studied. In particular, it is
necessary to investigate how these organisms regulate and control the genes and
gene products involved in EBPR metabolism. Specific goals of this work are
to:&lt;br/&gt;oClone the genes involved in PHA and glycogen cycling directly
from mixed&lt;br/&gt;communities in PAO-enriched sludges;&lt;br/&gt;oElucidate
the mechanisms by which carbon and P cycling occurs in PAOs;&lt;br/&gt;oDevelop
an immunochemical method to detect polyP metabolism in
sludge;&lt;br/&gt;oIntegrate observations and recommend potential control
strategies for full-scale&lt;br/&gt;EPBR systems.&lt;br/&gt;
