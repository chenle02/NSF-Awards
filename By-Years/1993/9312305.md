The Workshop on Approximation Algorithms will be held at Rutgers DIMACS on March
24-26, to bring together researchers working on upper bounds with researchers
working on lower bounds. DIMACS will provide some support for the participants.
This proposal will support travel expenses of some participants who could not
otherwise attend, including graduate students.
