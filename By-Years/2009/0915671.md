This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In programming languages research,
there is a strong trend toward extremely&lt;br/&gt;precise type systems, which
can encode and verify extremely detailed&lt;br/&gt;assertions about the behavior
of programs and the structure of the data they&lt;br/&gt;manipulate. However,
precision is a two-edged sword. Combining precise&lt;br/&gt;types with the other
language features can lead to complex definitions that&lt;br/&gt;are difficult
to explain, implement, and reason about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to tame this complexity using contracts --&lt;br/&gt;executable
partial program specifications that are checked at run-time.
The&lt;br/&gt;project's primary contributions will be (1) to show how an
improved theory&lt;br/&gt;of contracts can be used to design and implement
powerful, yet tractable,&lt;br/&gt;precise type systems, (2) to develop a
particular precise type system&lt;br/&gt;extending regular expression types with
security annotations, and (3) to use&lt;br/&gt;the resulting system to
demonstrate a useful form of ``updatable security&lt;br/&gt;views'' in a multi-
level Wiki allowing groups of users with different&lt;br/&gt;clearance levels to
collaboratively author structured documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
application is motivated by discussions with NSA researchers about
the&lt;br/&gt;need in the intelligence community for such tools. The project's
software&lt;br/&gt;deliverables will be distributed freely under an open-source
license and&lt;br/&gt;integrated with the popular Unison file synchronizer.
