9360055 Sabri This research addresses the human factors aspect of hospital
patient monitoring systems and seeks the means of improvements through the
application of ergonomics to the evaluation of intensive care units (ICU's).
During Phase I, the intensive care patient monitoring system will be reviewed
and analyzed in terms of human tasks and equipment monitoring functions and with
respect to the equipment setup process, calibration and initialization of
monitoring. A functional analysis of the overall patient care monitoring system
will be performed to identify the needed ergonomic design improvements. These
activities will be done in collaboration with hospital doctors and nurses who
operate the equipment regularly. Ergonomic problems that result in human errors
or excessive response time, whether in operating specific equipment or in
management of the hospital patient monitoring systems, will be identified,
classified, and prioritized. Overall recommendations regarding design changes
and providing tools for human factor reviews and improvements will be made.
