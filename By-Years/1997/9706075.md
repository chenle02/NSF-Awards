9706075 Lange This project involves experiments to measure the density, thermal
expansivity and compressibility of H2O-bearing magmatic liquids between 400 and
1300oC and from 1 bar to 2000 MPa. Two approaches will be taken: (1) low
temperature density measurements of hydrous liquids at their glass transition
temperatures, and (2) the sinking and floating of ultra-pure crystalline
graphite and commercially carbon-coated quartz, albite, and anorthite buoyancy
markers in a rapid-quench cold-seal pressure apparatus between 50-200 MPa and a
piston cylinder apparatus between 600-2000 MPa. The results will have
application to problems of melt segregation and migration from source regions
and the dynamics of melt degassing and fragmentation during explosive magmatic
eruptions.
