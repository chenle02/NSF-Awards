9613979 Arakawa This award provides continued support for a research project
devoted to the improving the representation of the physical processes relating
to humidity and cloud fields in numerical models of the global atmosphere. In
large part, the new research represents a continuation of activities and
involves a broad range of topics. Among them are the development of a global
version of a hybrid vertical coordinate model which will be used to simulate
frontal clouds ; assessing the impact of including ice phase processes in a
cloud updraft/downdraft model; improvement, based on cloud ensemble model
results , of the cumulus parameterization; a statistical analysis of
observations with a view to cumulus parameterizability; formulation of the
decaying process for ice clouds; improving the formulation of the planetary
boundary layer moisture budget; and the development of the parameterization of
orographic gravity waves. Dr. Arakawa is acknowledged to be one of the great
leaders in the field of numerical modeling of the atmosphere and continues to be
quite productive. This project is supported jointly by the NSF through this
award and NASA through a separate award. ***
