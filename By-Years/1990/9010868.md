The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can be used to monitor the formation of
coatings at solution-metal interfaces, the adsorption of species from solution
onto polymer supports, and solvation and ion-exchange reactions in polymer thin
films. The choice of polymer coating and film architecture are crucial to the
design of QCM-based sensors for analytical applications. The apparatus will be
constructed and exploratory research will begin. The first objective of the
proposed research is to establish boundary conditions for designing polymer-
coated quartz crystals for QCM-based sensors. The second objective is to
determine the applicability of the QCM for obtaining fundamental insights into
polymer adsorption kinetics and polymer adlayer structure. It will be determined
whether the QCM can be used to measure the microviscosity of polymers at the
polymer-metal interface, whether the QCM can be used to monitor swelling or ion
transport in non-rigid polymer films, and whether the device can be used to
monitor polymer adsorption directly. This is a Career Advancement Award under
the Research Opportunity for Women Program.
