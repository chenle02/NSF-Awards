This grant supports research using a variety of accelerators in the U.S.,
Canada, and Europe to study intermediate and high energy nuclear reactions.
These studies examine both the dynamics of nuclear reactions and the degrees of
freedom required to describe the structure of nuclear states. The work includes
research on true absorption of in- flight pions by nuclei, including multi-
nucleon absorption, as well as analyses of inelastic scattering to quantify the
effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and its use in studying nuclear structure.
New experiments with medium energy protons will focus on -meson and -isobar
production from light elements. Research will also be conducted using
electromagnetic interactions at higher energies focusing on the quark degrees of
freedom of nuclei. More conventional measurements of the structure of nuclei and
studies of reaction dynamics in terms of nucleonic degrees of freedom are also
planned. Design and development efforts will be conducted in preparation for new
projects at CEBAF and PEGASYS.
