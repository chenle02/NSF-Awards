9451989 Sweeney Students develop abilities to think critically, analyze data,
draw conclusions and make decisions concerning the appropriateness of the
methodology as applied to the solution of problems related to separation of
proteins. During group projects utilizing the automated system to
chromatographically purify a series of ricin A proteins (differing structurally
in 1 or a few amino acids), the relationship between the physical/chemical
nature of the molecules and their chromatographic behavior is elucidated. The
students are also introduced to basic chromatographic principles as they are
applied to protein purification. Students who complete Quantitative Biology
during their junior year are qualified to participate in the undergraduate
research restricted elective during summer and/or senior year.
