This research involves the extension of methods recently developed by the
principal investigator in the area of narrowband passive array processing. The
approach involves using real steering vectors rather than traditional complex
steering vectors which will allow the processing of more signals than was
previously possible and/or the processing of signals in the presence of
arbitrary noise amplitude distributions. The first phase of research involves
the extension of these methods to wideband passive array processing; thus,
taking advantage of the entire frequency support of signals which may not
necessarily be narrowband. The second phase will be the development of efficient
methods to implement both the narrowband and the wideband algorithms and,
consequently, making these methods practical from a computational viewpoint.
This phase will rely on methods in numerical nonlinear optimization theory which
have not previously been applied to array processing problems.
