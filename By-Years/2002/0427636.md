This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and registration costs of
students selected to participate in the 21st International Conference on Machine
Learning (ICML), which will be held on July 4-7, 2004, in Banff,
Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the conference, students will present results of
their research in poster sessions as part of the normal conference schedule.
Members of the Program Committee will be required to visit at least five posters
to provide feedback to the students. This provides the students with invaluable
exposure to outside perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their
research, and also enables them to explore their career objectives. This
workshop contributes to the professional development of young scientists who
will lead this growing field in the coming decades.&lt;br/&gt;
