The research is on chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnection problems. General
formulations and efficient solutions to these problems are being explored. The
focus is large chip/system designs with over a million transistors. Algorithms
which minimize the interconnection delay and maximize circuit performance are
being developed. Topics being addressed are: (1) timing driven global routing
with bounded routing costs for both cell-based designs and building-block
designs; (2) high-speed clock routing with minimum skew for cell-based and
building-block designs; and (3) chip-to-chip interconnection problems for
multichip packaging, including multilayer planer subset, multilayer via
minimization, and transmission line problems.
