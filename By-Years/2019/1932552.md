Abstract (Juschenko, 1352173): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of
"amenability" essentially begins in the 1900s with Lebesgue. He asked whether
the properties of his integral are really fundamental and follow from more
familiar integral axioms. The class of amenable groups was introduced and
studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in
dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory
shifted into the field of functional analysis. Currently amenability theory
appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras,
functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core part of the project is based on the
recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans
to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on
Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can
potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange
transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected
impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of
the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of
this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of
several summer schools and workshops. The schools are aimed toward graduate
students and other young researchers, focused on the recent developments in
group theory and operator algebras.
