This award provides travel and meeting cost support for twenty students to
attend the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) Annual Conference to
be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota during October 26-30, 2009. The conference
provides an excellent forum for scientists and representatives from government
and industry to meet, interact, present latest findings and exchange information
and expertise at the cutting edge of aerosol science and technology. The
registrants will be a mixture of established U.S. and international researchers,
industrial scientists, policy makers and young scientists. Attendee research
expertise will span broad areas of aerosol science, with interests including
chemical engineering, material science, environmental science and atmospheric
chemistry. The broader impact of this award includes providing invaluable
opportunities for students to interact with more senior scientists in a number
of highly topical and important areas of interest in environmental atmospheric
science and atmospheric chemistry.
