&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor
Kenneth Leopold and his group at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities will
employ Fourier Transform microwave spectroscopy (FTMW) to investigate the
intermolecular interactions within gas phase clusters containing acids or ionic
compounds and 1 - 3 water molecules. The goal of the research is to understand
how water molecules interact with solutes such as inorganic acids, organic
acids, and ionic compounds in general. A key question is: how do water molecules
promote the separation of negative and positive charges in acids and salts? In
order to study ionic compounds that are difficult to produce in the gas phase,
Professor Leopold's group will also develop a laser ablation system to
facilitate production of gas phase samples of difficult compounds (low
volatility ionic and refractory materials). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
has important consequences not only with regard to the behavior of interacting
molecules and ions, but for chemical processes in our atmosphere. Many
environmentally important processes involve salts or ionic species that are
surrounded (hydrated) by water molecules. In addition to the graduate and
undergraduate students directly involved in the research, Professor Leopold will
invite participation of high school teachers and students, who will benefit from
a research experience that involves rigorous spectroscopic studies and the
broader integrating themes of atmospheric and environmental chemistry.
