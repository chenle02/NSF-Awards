The project kick-starts an international symposium series on the topic of
heuristic search. Currently, work in this area appears scattered across many
conferences in several fields. The intellectual merit of this project stems from
the sharing of new results, ideas, and problems across the many areas in AI and
robotics where heuristic search is used. Broad impact comes not only from this
intermixing but from having a single locus of activity for efforts in heuristic
search, one that we expect to become known in the wider community as the place
to look when one wants a snapshot of the latest developments in the area. The
first symposium will be held as a AAAI workshop in 2008. NSF funding supports
student participation and invited speakers, and there is the expectation that
the symposium series will be self-sustaining by 2010. &lt;br/&gt;
