The New Jersey Institute of Technology proposes to join the existing
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Protection of Information.
The research focus of the proposed Center is information insurance with core
activities in intrusion detection, attack tolerant network systems, and ad hoc
network security. The New Jersey Institute of Technology has available a test
bed facility for hardware/software products transfer to end-users. Specific
simulation will be defined and guided by the industrial members and their needs.
