The overall objective of this project is to study physical systems in
heterogeneous environments. Heterogeneous environments are ubiquitous. Some
examples are ocean flows, atmospheric turbulence, oil-bearing sands, and
biological tissues. Understanding overall properties of such media is relevant
to aspects of virtually every branch of science and engineering; especially
materials science, chemical engineering, geophysics, medical imaging and fluid
dynamics. One of the projects of this research concerns changes in salinity or
chlorofluorocarbon on the surface of the ocean. Oceanic vortices may
dramatically change mixing rates of various chemical compounds. The aim of this
project is to estimate these rates in simpler mathematical models to illuminate
the mechanisms present in the full problem. Another project of this research
concerns light propagation through the atmosphere. The main source of distortion
in these devices comes from atmospheric turbulence. The aim of this project is
to understand the mechanism of this distortion.

This work carries out mathematical studies of particle propagation in cluttered
environments and of convection-diffusion processes in fluids. The first project
concentrates on the effect of long-range correlations. This is a novel direction
in the theory of propagation in random media, and approximate models of
propagation in slowly decorrelating media are not yet developed. The goal is to
explain how long-range correlations lead to time-scale separation of various
phenomena. The second project concentrates on the interaction of the standard
and the fractional diffusion with incompressible flows. The intellectual
challenge of the proposed work is to understand this interaction for
incompressible flows with large amplitude. This is particularly relevant to
understanding diffusion in turbulent flows.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
