This project aims to enhance our understanding of the role
that&lt;br/&gt;international trade and U.S. trade policy has played in American
economic&lt;br/&gt;history. This project focuses specifically on the antebellum
period, from&lt;br/&gt;roughly 1815 to 1860. (My previous research focused on
the late nineteenth&lt;br/&gt;and early twentieth century period, from 1870 to
1913.) The short term&lt;br/&gt;objective of the research is to produce articles
for publication in&lt;br/&gt;scholarly economic journals. The long term
objective is to produce a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive book-length study of the
history of trade and trade policy in&lt;br/&gt;the United States. The research
on the antebellum period focuses, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, on three issues. The
first issue is the extent to which the&lt;br/&gt;United States possessed market
power in terms of its cotton exports. By&lt;br/&gt;estimating the elasticity of
export demand facing the United States, the&lt;br/&gt;research will give us some
indication of the possible economic gains from&lt;br/&gt;imposing an optimal
export tax during this period. The second issue is the&lt;br/&gt;role of import
tariffs in supporting the early growth and development of the&lt;br/&gt;cotton
textile industry. Economists have been divided about whether
the&lt;br/&gt;cotton textile industry depended on tariff protection or not, and
this&lt;br/&gt;research aims to provide greater insight into the role of import
protection&lt;br/&gt;during this period. The third issue is the pre-Civil War
political conflict&lt;br/&gt;between the North and the South over the tariff.
This research will focus&lt;br/&gt;on Congressional votes on the tariff issue in
the antebellum period and&lt;br/&gt;determine whether Midwestern economic
interests played a critical role in&lt;br/&gt;supporting the anti-tariff views
of the South and thereby helped push&lt;br/&gt;tariffs down from 60 percent in
the early 1830s to 25 percent by 1860.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
