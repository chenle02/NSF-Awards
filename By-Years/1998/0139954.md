The NSF proposal enables the PI to continue and expand his research activities
at Jefferson Lab, Newport News, VA, in collaboration with the nuclear physics
group at CUA. The research program concentrates on those experiments that are
expected to have a major impact in our understanding of the spectrum of excited
nucleons and the constituent quark models. Various model calculations show that
the photoproduction of vector mesons and hyperons is most sensitive in the
search for "missing resonances", i.e. excited nucleon states which are predicted
by constituent quark models but haven't been observed experimentally. The
experimental program covers analysis projects as well as the design of new
instrumentations, especially a frozen spin target and highly segmented start
counters, for polarization experiments in Jefferson Lab's Hall B, the only place
where such experiments can be performed.
