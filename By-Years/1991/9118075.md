This proposal plans to produce ceramic matrix composites through the directed
oxidation of alloys, and aims to examine the rate phenomena and the mechanisms
of the composite growth through a systematic investigation of the oxidation
rates of alloys with controlled amounts of dopants. Wetting and composite-alloy
interfacial surface energetics will be examined. Conductivity and Seebeck
voltage measurements will be made. %%%% This proposed research will provide
scientific foundations to the recently developed so-called Lanxide process in
which ceramics are synthesized by the direct oxidation of metals. The growth of
several new ternary and quaternary ceramic matrix composites under controlled
laboratory conditions will be made.
