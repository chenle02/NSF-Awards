The instrument development work described here will greatly expand and enhance
the capabilities of our existing ("prototype") high sensitivity flow cytometer
for the analysis of natural microbial populations. Specifically, we propose to:
. Install an argon-krypton mixed gas laser to provide a wide choice of
excitation wavelengths. . Add the optics and electronics required for dual beam
excitation and 4 channel detection. . Develop a highly flexible data acquisition
system based on off-the-shelf electronics modules. . Interface the flow
cytometer with a real-time neural net-based data analysis system. The instrument
will be used to develop methods of identifying and enumerating specific
microorganisms in natural samples (based on 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide
probes), and of analyzing in situ physiological parameters (using more
traditional cytochemical techniques). The flow cytometer will also be used to
support ongoing studies of cell cycle regulation in bacteria and microalgae.
