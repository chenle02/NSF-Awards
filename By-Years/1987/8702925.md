This project is a special research year to be held at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill in manifolds of negative curvature and differential
systems. In addition to National Science Foundation support, the Department of
Mathematics is contributing the salaries of a senior visitor, a two-year
instructor, and a one-year visitor to this project. The research activity will
concentrate on problems in two areas: (1) manifolds of negative curvature, (2)
differential systems. The former will include the structure of rank 1 manifolds
and the geometric properties of compact nonpositively curved manifolds that can
be expressed by the algebraic properties of the fundamental group. The latter
research activity will be focused on the method of equivalence and exterior
differential systems with applications in areas that include the theory of
nonlinear optimal control
