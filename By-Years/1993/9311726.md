Japanese has long been known for its elaborate system of honorific affixes
which show respect for the person to whom or about whom one is speaking. The
researcher will investigate how honorific use varies in response to situational
features and whether variation in honorific use correlates with variation in
other stylistic markers. Conventional analyses of Western languages have
generally treated style as involving variation along a single dimension of
formality. It has been assumed that co- occurrence rules exist such that speech
which is formal in one dimension (e.g., word order) will be formal in another
(e.g., word choice). While Japanese honorifics are clearly related to formality,
this investigator hypothesizes that honorifics are unrelated to other markers of
formality. Therefore, it is possible that Japanese simultaneously show respect
with one stylistic marker while showing intimacy with another. This importantly
suggests that formality is not a single dimension, but rather involves several
analytically distinct features which influence different levels of the
linguistic system.
