While precursors proteins were thought to be transported into plant chloroplasts
in an unfolded conformation, recent discoveries indicate that this question is
far from settled. The mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts will be
probed and the conformation of precursor proteins will be monitored as they are
being imported. Fluorescent probes that are sensitive to their local environment
will be used to monitor the conformation of substrate proteins as they are
captured in the chloroplast import machinery and to determine the size limits of
the channels through which import occurs. The upper size limit of the
chloroplast import mechanism will be probed using gold particles of fixed sizes.
Broader impacts: A program entitled "Fellowships in Molecular Biology at UC-
Davis" will bring two college-bound students from the River City High School in
West Sacramento to participate in this project for four weeks during each of the
two summers of the funding period. Students will be nominated by their AP
biology teachers and will work on projects that can be completed in four weeks.
Local high school students will be hosted for their Biotechnology class
internship during the spring quarter, and a Young Scholars Program student will
have the opportunity to work on this project during the summers.
