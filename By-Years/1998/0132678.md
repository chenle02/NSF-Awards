With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University,
will study the nature of the intramolecular interactions that control the
structures, energies, spectra and other properties of organic molecules. Through
a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, Professor Wiberg will
examine the intramolecular interactions that control the preferred conformations
of molecules. Electrostatic interactions in organic molecules will also be
studied making use of calculated group dipoles and examining the question of the
effective dielectric constant both experimentally and computationally. Studies
will also be done examining the nature of electronically excited states for
cyclic and open chain alkenes, factors that control optical rotation and, hence,
optical activity, and comparing the permanganate oxidation of alkenes with the
reaction of alkenes with Cr(IV).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Kenneth B.
Wiberg, of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University, with the support of
the Organic Dynamics Program, studies the properties of organic molecules using
the synergistic interaction between experiment and theory to garner a richer
detail of information than would be possible using either approach by itself.
