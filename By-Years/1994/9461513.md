Lumina Decision Systems, Inc. will develop software which obtains expert
judgment on uncertain quantities in the form of probability. Bayesian
probability techniques are increasingly used for a wide variety of decision-
making and risk-analysis. Currently, specially trained analysts are required to
obtain expert probability judgments to avoid cognitive biases. The time now
required of the analyst and expert is burdensome, often rendering the approach
impractical. A reliable and easily used automated tool for the elicitation of
uncertainty could substantially reduce these costs, and render the approach far
more widely usable, as a natural adjunct to decision and risk management
software tools. The software will allow assessors to use qualitative phrases,
such as unlikely or very frequent, and map them into numerical probabilities.
They will develop and evaluate methods to calibrate each user's language to
obtain reliable and stable mappings. A second focus will be to develop
geometric, animated density assessor for the direct assessment of continuous
probability densities. This method will use a flexible family of distributions,
allowing rapid graphical specification of unimodal, bimodal, bounded, and
unbounded distributions. They will compare the time, effort, and reliability of
continuous and discrete probabilities obtained using standard methods with the
results from our prototype assessment tool. They will develop calibration
methods for mappings between verbal phrases and numerical probabilities, and
evaluate their reliability and stability.
