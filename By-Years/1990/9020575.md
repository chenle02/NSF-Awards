The primary purpose of the proposed program is to identify and prepare minority
college students in the sciences and mathematics for careers at the graduate and
professional levels. To this end, a Research Careers for Minority Students
(RCMS) training group with emphasis in cell and molecular biology, organic and
pharmacal chemistry, mathematics, physics and engineering has been established
at Howard University. Details of the research program are shown in the body of
the proposal. The program targets college juniors and seniors and high school
teachers. Interfacing with ongoing pre-college science and mathematics programs
(PEW/Rockefeller) and college programs (MARC/MBRS/Howard Hughes) will allow
early identification and selection of highly competent trainees for the RCMS
program. Based upon academic performance, letters of recommendation, and degree
of motivation program trainees who are selected at the end of their sophomore
year, will be offered a summer internship in laboratories at Howard University
where they will be exposed to an intense research regimen in the field of their
major. The summer internship should provide them guidance and skills needed to
attract them into a high-quality research program during the academic year. Ten
RCMS trainees will be identified in year one, and a total of 20 students will be
carried by this program each succeeding year. During the academic year, RCMS
trainees will enroll in an undergraduate research course (3 cr) where they will
work directly with a faculty mentor on his/her research subspecialty.
