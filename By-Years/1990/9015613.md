In this project, a newly established organization called Coastal Ocean Processes
(CoOP) will convene a workshop in July, 1990, to focus the goals and directions
for interdisciplinary coastal oceanographic research for the next 1-2 decades.
Results of the meeting will be published during the fall of 1990, and will be
used by NSF to develop future coastal research opportunities.
