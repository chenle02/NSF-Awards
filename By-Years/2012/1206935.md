Technical: This project is on nanopattern formation enabled by photo-induced
processes at the surface of polarity patterned ferroelectric materials. The
nanoscale surface properties of the ferroelectric materials are characterized
using photo electron emission microscopy (PEEM) and scanned probe approaches.
The research project combines chemical, photo-enhanced and thermal approaches to
prepare polarity patterned ferroelectric surfaces with controlled screening. In
situ surface processing and deposition of thin oxide films can provide uniformly
terminated surfaces with enhanced electric fields which reflect the nanopatterns
of the ferroelectric domains. Surface states, defects and the polarization bound
charge lead to band bending effects which contribute to the photo-induced
deposition process. A second approach for photo-induced nanopattern formation
combines vanadium dioxide deposited on ferroelectric surfaces to drive an
insulator-metal transition which follows the nanopatterned
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: The project addresses the science
that underpins approaches for nanopattern formation which could impact
electronics or sensor technologies. The interdisciplinary research environment
will enable the graduate and undergraduate students involved with this research
to gain the expertise to consider a career in electronics or sensor technology
development. The project also provides integrated projects that pair graduate
student researchers with candidates of the ASU Professional Science Masters in
Nanoscience. The K-12 education outreach is through the ASU Science is Fun
program and a new demonstration on ferroelectric materials will become part of
program for presentation to Phoenix area K-12 students.
