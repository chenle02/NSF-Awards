Lisa D. Pfefferle and Dragos Ciuparu, Department of Chemical Engineering, Yale
University, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for exploratory research in the zeolite-templated synthesis of
boron nanotubes and nanowhiskers. Their approach is to initiate the nanotube
growth inside the pore of a mesoporous molecular sieve, yielding single walled
tubes of uniform diameter. Boron nanotubes and nanowires are predicted to have
valuable electronic properties that vary depending on the diameter of the
nanotube.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
supports high risk/high impact research in molecular electronics and
nanotechnology. This interdisciplinary project will also provide training
opportunities in these important areas.
