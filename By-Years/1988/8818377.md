This project will allow a student in cultural anthropology to conduct research
leading towards a dissertation. The student will live in a Mayan Indian
community in northern Guatemala, and will explore how a subordinate population
of peasants tries to renegotiate the terms of its situation by studying an
unusually harsh case, that of Mayan Indians who have been occupied by the
Guatemalan army following an unsuccessful guerrilla uprising. By focusing on the
postwar reconstruction in northern Guatemala, studying the land distribution
projects and the rapid growth of evangelical Protestant churches, the project
will contribute to an understanding of how poor peasant communities defend
themselves in the face of external pressure. Methods used will include
participant observation, archival research, and formal interviews with relevant
government and non-government agencies. This research is important because the
harsh recent history of Guatemalan Indians (involvement in local fighting,
occupation by the National army, influence by religious missionaries) is a
common experience in peasant communities, where a large portion of the world's
population lives. Increasing our understanding how these communities react to
such pressures will help us cope with these changes.
