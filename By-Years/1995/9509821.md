9509821 Kohler The microparasite-induced collapse of populations of a dominant
insect competitor in cold water streams in Michigan has provided a unique
natural experiment for examining the organization of entire stream communities.
In work completed to date, the kinds and magnitudes of indirect dynamic
responses observed to the removal of a strong interactor, the caddisfly grazer
Glossosoma nigrior, by the microsporidian Cougourdella sp., clearly indicate
that herbivory, and competition between herbivores, play a major role in
organizing these communities. Strong effects have been observed at all major
trophic levels. The present research will continue and expand this study by
testing a series of mechanistic hypotheses concerning the generality, and
details of the role, of endogenous biotic processes in structuring trout stream
food webs. The major objectives are: 1) to utilize natural experiments generated
by the Glossosoma-Cougourdella system as an ecological probe to examine a series
of explicit mechanistic models of trout stream community dynamics, 2) to
determine whether, in the long-term, the dynamical nature of the Glossosoma-
Cougourdella interaction is cyclic or stable, and 3) to determine the extent to
which observations of communities structured by strong biotic interactions in
the Michigan sites can be generalized to cold water systems of other regions.
This research will allow a more general assessment of the importance of
parasites, and of the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in
affecting the composition and structure of stream communities. In addition,
little information is available for any system concerning the stability, and the
mechanisms promoting the long-term stability, of a given community
configuration. This research will provide valuable information regarding both
issues.
