This is the first year of a three year continuing award. This research addresses
the problems of modeling at the appropriate level of detail for the purpose of
controlling physical or biological systems under time or computation resources
constraints. The research is to develop, implement and test a method of dynamic
selection of models for use in real-time applications. The PI's first develop
and organize multiple simplifications of a detailed (base) model of the domain
by applying combinations of domain-specific simplifying assumptions. They create
an explicit representation of these assumptions and develop methods to reason
dynamically with the assumptions to find the simplest model with valid
assumptions. The PI's test the hypothesis that the simplest model with valid
assumptions is optimal according to a decision-theoretic definition of
optimality. The system is implemented in the domain of human cardiopulmonary
physiology, with the control task of finding settings for a ventilator
(mechanical breathing device). The research will provide improved methods of
applying complex models in time-critical applications, enable the use of
previously intractable models in real-time applications, and merge numeric
simulation and control methodologies with formal decision theory. //
