This project will provide a real-time verification of the input code for
numerical control (NC) machine tools. The program will have several facets:
visualization of the cutting process in wireframe, solid model display of the
part after any desired interactive rendering of part geometry. The key aspect of
this project -- solid modeling of the as-machined part -- is accomplished by a
novel approach termed "extended octrees" (EO). In contrast to other popular
solid model methods, the time per cut (Boolean operation) remains roughly
constant with EO, as the part complexity grows. EO recursively subdivides the
space occupied by the workpiece into cubic regions of variable size that are
empty or filled (classical octrees) as well as face, edge and vertex cells. The
model is fully three-dimensional with each cut input as a boundary
representation of the volume swept out by the tool. Various improvements are
proposed to reduce the time per cut (currently a few seconds per cut on a
386-based PC). The as- machined solid model can be compared with the computer
aided design solid model (via a boolean) for automated verification. The solid
model may also be helpful in assisting heuristic methods to carry out process
planning for multi-axis NC code generation.
