The American Association of Engineering Society (AAES) proposes to convene
anaction-focused summit on diversity in engineering to be held on April 2-3,
2003. The event will be hosted be the NAE in Washington, DC, with lead financial
support from the GE Fund and Intel Corporation. Engineering societies, whether
or not they are members of AAES, are invited to send the appropriate volunteer
and staff person who are leading the organization's diversity programs to
participate in the summit.

Some engineering societies have a long history of involvement in efforts to
increase the participants of women and minorities in engineering, while others
have begun to address these issues more recently. The April meeting is designed
to help engineering societies increase the impact of existing programs and
identify new ways to strengthen the engineering profession through increased
diversity. Participants will be asked to develop specific action plan for their
organizations as well as collaborative activities. Prior to the April meeting,
AAES will collect information from the invited organizations on their current
diversity policies, programs, and activities. A second meeting in the summer of
2003 will finalize plans for follow-up activities.

This award provides $15,000 to AAES to support travel for 19 engineering society
volunteer leaders to participate in the diversity summit.
