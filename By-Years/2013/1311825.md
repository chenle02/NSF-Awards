This collaborative project will produce a survey of hundreds of disks around
young stellar objects (YSOs) in regions of massive star formation (including
Orion) using observations obtained at radio, millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths using the Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescopes. The investigators will use
these telescopes to construct maps of molecular emission to study how massive
star environments affects star and planet formation with a focus on the regions
within 50-200 astronomical units (AU) of the host star.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts training two graduate students using the
relatively new ALMA observatory, producing an audio-visual fly-through of the
Orion star-forming region to share with the public what they learn and working
with high school students to produce other multimedia presentations.
