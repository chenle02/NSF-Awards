Funds are provided to help defray costs for participants and young scientists
to attend an International Conference on Melanotropic Peptides. Melanotropins,
(melanocyte-stimulating hormones, MSH; melanin-concentrating hormone, MCH) were
among the first peptides to be structurally analyzed and to be chemically
synthesized. While their biological effects on pigmentation, especially in
invertebrate species, have been widely appreciated, it is clear that
melanotropins affect the central nervous system and specific peripheral organs.
This conference will address the important advances being made on the
biosynthesis, secretion and molecular mechanisms of action of these peptides. It
covers the full spectrum of topics from the discovery of MSH to most current
knowledge of its role as neuropeptides. The conference's format provides the
atmosphere to foster meaningful interchanges between an interdisciplinary group
of scientists. The final discussion will speculate on how these rapid advances
in basic research may lead to the potential clinical use of melanotropins in the
diagnosis and therapy of melanoma, the treatment of pigment disorders, nerve
damage and dementia.
