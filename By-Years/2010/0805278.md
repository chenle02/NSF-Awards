Significant theoretical progress has been made in recent years on the problem of
three neutral atoms colliding at ultracold temperatures. Much of that progress
has relied on computational physics, and there is now a unique opportunity to
substantially advance the computational solution of the ultracold few-body
problem. This opportunity comes from an unlikely source: computer video gamers.
The computational power that has been built into computer video cards to drive
games is enormous, promising orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude improvement over
computing on typical workstations. Moreover, recent&lt;br/&gt;developments have
made it much easier for the high performance computing&lt;br/&gt;community to
tap into this power, and that is what is proposed here. At the same time,
several improvements are proposed to both the underlying representation of the
problem and the numerical algorithms employed. Taken together, this three-
pronged attack on the problem can be expected to render currently intractable
problems in ultracold few-body physics tractable. In turn, these advances in
computational physics can be expected to further our theoretical understanding
of these problems.
