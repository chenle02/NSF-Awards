This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of educational transitions in the physical sciences and
engineering among women and minorities, following a life course perspective. One
dataset will be an existing longitudinal survey of young people, called High
School and Beyond, which tracks the life histories of 60,000 high school
students interviewed at two year intervals throughout the 1980s. Another dataset
will be assembled by the present investigators from a sample of entering
students in a large school of engineering, and will permit closer examination of
social- psychological factors that shape careers in engineering. This study will
contribute to the sociology of science, gender, minorities, and careers, and it
will also provide important information for deciding public policy concerning
the scientific and engineering workforce. In addition to the scientific gains to
be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
