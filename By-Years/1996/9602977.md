9602977 Vinning-Brown- Status differences significantly influence social
interactions by limiting the opportunities of individuals holding lower status
positions. This proposal seeks to examine the "gender climate" in two top-ranked
undergraduate engineering programs. The project will collect data on educational
process and outcomes, examine factors and relationship affecting climate, test
interventions to reform classroom and department environments; and develop
support systems to attract, retain, and enlarge a pool of professional women in
engineering. It focuses attention on race and gender by examining structural and
individual factors that produce variations in satisfaction among minority and
white women, explores the perceptions and experiences of women in engineering,
and examines the connection between department and classroom climate concerns.
This project will track student's persistence in engineering to determine the
extent to which climate concerns are related to dropping out or switching
fields. It will use both survey and interview techniques. The project will
involve the University of Maryland College Park, the Georgia Institute of
Technology and feeder institutions to those universities. Students, chairs,
deans, and department heads will be interviewed. ***
