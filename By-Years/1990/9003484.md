Mathematical and statistical methods will be developed to analyze and interpret
DNA sequences from different individuals of the same species. The goal of the
research is to use such data to achieve a greater understanding of processes
governing genetic evolution, particularly mutation, recombination, gene
conversion and gene flow. The methods developed will take advantage of the
detailed information provided by within-species DNA sequence data. Particular
attention will be paid to the phylogenetic relationships of genes as indicated
by their sequences. The overall approach of the research will be to combine
simple analytic models of simple problems with computer simulation models of
more complex and realistic problems. The methods developed will be applied to
available data. The plan is to spend one semester in Richard Lewontin's
laboratory and Harvard University learning more about what kinds of data are
available and working with Lewontin and his collaborators on the analysis of
their data. //
