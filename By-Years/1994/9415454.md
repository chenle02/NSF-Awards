9415454 Gamache This project will focus on the development of a theoretical
framework to calculate pressure-broadened halfwidths ( ) and pressure-induced
line shifts ( ) for atmospherically important species. The halfwidth is the
major source of error in remote sensing data and in line-by-line models used to
calculate radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. To address these problems,
data are needed for thousands of rotational-vibrational transitions. Hence a
theoretical model is needed that is computationally efficient and capable of
achieving 5% uncertainty in . The resolvent operator formalism of Baranger,
Kolb, and Greim (BKG) is the basis of the theoretical approach. Calculations
will use realistic molecular dynamics, explicit velocity averaging, and all
relevant terms in the interaction potential. Calculations will be done for
atmospherically important rotor molecules (H2O, O3, SO2, NO2, H2S) perturbed by
N2 or O2 and self-interactions. There are a number of experimental measurements
to compare with and test the theory. Once the theoretical questions are
resolved, a database of and for atmospherically important transitions will be
generated for each species. The vibrational, rotational state, and temperature
dependence of the halfwidths and line-shifts will be investigated. The major
objective of this work is to improve our confidence in remote sensing results
and allow a better determination of the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases.
