This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "Pingree Park Dynamics Workshop?
that will be held at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University from
August 3-8, 2009.

This conference, the subject matter of which falls under the general heading of
topological and measure-theoretic dynamical systems, will focus on two principal
themes: (1) orbit equivalence theory and (2) descriptive set theory as it
relates to dynamical systems. Both represent extremely active areas of current
dynamical sytems research. The format of the workshop is such that young people
will have ample opportunities to speak and otherwise be engaged in the various
conference activities.
