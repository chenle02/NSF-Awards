Enhancement of Science/Mathematics Faculty Through Modeling: A Path Toward
Critical Thinking A coalition of six two-year and one four-year colleges in
southeastern Kansas has designed an eighteen-month multidisciplinary project for
faculty enhancement. In each of two summers there will be several week-long
workshops designed to: (1) enhance content knowledge, (2) enhance critical
thinking skills through the use of modeling, and (3) develop instructional
strategies to promote effective teaching. Content areas include: modeling
theory, molecular modeling, modeling in environmental science, recombinant DNA,
revised college algebra, chromosome mapping, Maple V, chaos and fractal
geometry, and classroom assessment. Participants will develop and adopt
curricular materials and assessment skills appropriate for their institutions.
Academic year activities will provide continuity and participant support.***
