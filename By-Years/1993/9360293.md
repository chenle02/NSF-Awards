9360293 Bruns Adaptive optics systems are essential for high resolution imaging
from ground based telescopes. Partial atmospheric correction systems
substantially improve meter-class telescopes in the visible spectral region.
These systems provide both resolution and minimum detectable magnitude
improvements for many science targets. The feasibility of an inexpensive system
correcting small amounts of tilt, defocus, and astigmatism will be analyzed in
this program. Both wavefront corrector and the wavefront sensor will be designed
with standard components used in novel configurations. The ultimate cost of a
low-volume production system should be only $10,000, affordable to small
observatories. The wavefront corrector will be based on translating thin lenses,
arranged so that each translation corrects mainly one aberration. Voice coil
actuators can move the lenses up to 0.1 mm at over 100 Hz, allowing a low
voltage design with simple alignment and calibration. The wavefront sensor will
be designed around a small, inexpensive CCD sensor in either a Hartmann or image
sharpening configuration. Since four or fewer subapertures can measure the
wavefront aberrations, only a small area of the CCD needs to be digitized.
Standard camera electronics will provide the millisecond-regime time response
required by the wavefront corrector. ***
