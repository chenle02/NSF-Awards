Overview Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes that are the
progenitors of chloroplasts in plants and algae. The objective of this project
is to request financial support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
from US institutions to attend the 11th Cyanobacterial Workshop in St. Louis,
Missouri.

Intellectual Merit Cyanobacteria provide the blueprint of oxygenic
photosynthetic metabolism that supports the rest of the biosphere. Genome
sequences of over 100 cyanobacterial strains, isolated from diverse ecological
niches, have been determined. This has opened up new opportunities for
intellectual interactions between researchers in traditional biological
disciplines with those in physics, chemistry, computational sciences and
engineering. This workshop will provide an informal forum to foster such
interactions.

Broader Impact Cyanobacteria have recently attracted significant interest for
carbon-negative production of bioenergy and biomaterials. This workshop will
help educate non cyanobacteriologists to understand the life styles of these
photosynthetic microbes. This workshop will emphasize the use of synthetic
biology approaches, and will thus also help traditional cyanobacteriologists to
understand emerging engineering approaches to utilize cyanobacterial
biocatalysts. Overall, this workshop will cater to the needs of today's young
scientists who are planning to use these photosynthetic organisms during their
future career.
