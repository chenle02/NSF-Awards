This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funding to establish an
integrated plant propagation facility. The facility will include tissue culture
facilities, growth chambers, and greenhouses. It will be designed so that
sensitive plant materials can be readily transferred between the tissue culture
work area, the growth chambers, and the greenhouses with minimum biological
disturbance and risk of contamination. The core research group includes both
established, extremely well-funded senior individuals and beginning
investigators. The goal of this Center is to become a world class center in the
area of plants, microbes, and their interactions. Ohio State has invested
heavily in personnel and remodeling to generate well-equipped modern molecular
biological research laboratories. Also, major support facilities are already
available. These funds will complement Ohio State's initiative by providing the
greenhouses, headhouses, growth chambers, and tissue culture facilities
essential for developing a world class center.
