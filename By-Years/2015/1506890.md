With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division supports Professor Marcus Weck at New York University to
develop the science of architecturally well-defined 3D supramolecular polymers.
It has been postulated that the next generation of complex, diverse, and highly
functionalized polymers for electro-optical, optical, biological, energy-
related, biomedical, and computer-based applications will be based on self-
assembled three-dimensional architectures. Taking advantage of non-covalent
chemistries, Prof. Weck's research group develops new strategies for the
formation of polymer-based architectures for such applications. This project
pairs cutting edge research with the training of undergraduate and graduate
students. In addition, Prof. Weck and his students actively participate in
educational development programs to enhance the understanding and teaching of
polymer science to K-12 school children. Examples include hosting bimonthly
third and fourth grade inner city school children as well as pre-school children
in the PIs laboratory and introducing them to the excitement of polymer science
through a series of very basic demonstrations.

The research design is based on the fabrication of supramolecular block
copolymers using a plug-and-play strategy with a library of well-defined
telechelic polymer building blocks wherein both directional and non-directional
interactions influence final folded structures. Specifically, Prof. Weck's group
develops synthetic methodology for the fabrication of covalent and noncovalent
triblock copolymers that contain helical, sheet-like, and rod-coil like segments
and studies the folding behavior of these copolymers using directional and non-
directional interactions. His group performs systematic structure-property
relationship studies to elucidate the effect of specific noncovalent
interactions on the self-assembly behavior of the polymeric building blocks.
This use of a 'plug-and-play' strategy allows for the realization of tertiary
and quaternary polymeric structures by design.
