The focus of this project is to describe quantitatively the abundance, biomass
and size-structure of the microplankton (phytoplankton and microzooplankton &lt;
200 um) prey fields as part of the Gulf of Alaska GLOBEC program. A central
objective of the mesoscale studies is to determine how physical forcing affects
the availability and production of zooplankton prey for juvenile pink salmon.
Juvenile salmon prey (copepods, euphausiids, pteropods, amphipods) depend
directly or indirectly on diverse mircroplanktonic prey, including
microzooplankton (flagellates and ciliates) which have recently been recognized
to be a significant dietary component of zooplankton. The size-structure,
taxonomic composition and growth dynamics of the lower trophic food web are
expected to be highly responsive to physical forcing and, in turn, exert strong
influences on zooplankton growth, fecundity, community composition and
nutritional state. Group-specific phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton
grazing rates will also be measured to identify trophic pathways and responses
to changing physical regimes. This study will provide critical mechanistic
insight and validation for coupled biological-physical models of the Gulf of
Alaska shelf ecosystem.
