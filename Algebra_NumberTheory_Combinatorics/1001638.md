The majority of this research is in the area of probabilistic combinatorics,
which is comprised of the study of random combinatorial structures, randomized
algorithms and probabilistic existence proofs for combinatorics (i.e. the
probabilistic method). In recent years, this field has seen the development of a
technique for proving that key statistics of a discrete stochastic process are
likely to remain close to their expected trajectories as the process evolves.
This method is known as the differential equations method for greedy algorithms
and random graph processes. The investigator recently extended this technique to
analyze the triangle-free process, a `controlled' random graph process that
produces an interesting distribution on the space of triangle-free graphs. The
investigator showed that a graph drawn from this distribution is likely to have
independence number within a constant multiplicative factor of the smallest
possible. In other words, the triangle-free process produces a Ramsey R(3,t)
graph. The investigator shall continue the development of this method for the
study of related `controlled' random processes, with an emphasis on processes
that are interesting from the perspective of extremal combinatorics. Related
questions are motivated by computer science. Here the investigator attempts to
develop applications of the differential equations method to prove good
performance of randomized algorithms without an explicit solution, or numerical
approximation of the solution, of the associated differential equation (the need
for such information often significantly complicates application of this
method).



This research project is an investigation of discrete mathematical objects, like
networks or codes, whose evolution over time is determined by a sequence of
random choices. We are particularly interested in processes where there is
dependence between the choices made in different rounds. While such processes
can be good models for the dynamics of real-world phenomenon, like the spread of
a disease in a network or phase transitions in materials, the focus of this
research is on processes that generate interesting mathematical objects.
Randomness has long played an important role in the construction of
sophisticated combinatorial objects, just as randomness plays an a central role
in many algorithms in computer science. This research is expected to have an
impact in multiple domains as the investigator shall develop general tools for
understanding the evolution of these systems over time.
