Helioseismic imaging has begun to yield unique diagnostic information about the
hidden subsurface layers of the Sun. This effort will pioneer the development of
a new approach to seismic imaging of the Sun, in which an adaptable physical
model of the subsurface structure of the solar convection zone plays a
fundamental part. This so-called direct modeling approach will be used to
systematically probe the three-dimensional structure of the turbulent convection
zone. Long sequences of SOHO/MDI full-disk Dopplergrams will be used to detect
turbulent convection as far into the Sun as sensitivity permits. The
investigation will also assess the comparative advantages of the NSF supported
GONG+ network. The focus of this effort will be on supergranular-scale flows (30
Mm), which will be characterized statistically in terms of velocity correlation
functions.
