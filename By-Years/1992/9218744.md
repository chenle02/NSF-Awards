This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Carl Johnson of Vanderbilt University and Takao Kondo of the National Institute
of Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan. Also involved are Professor Susan
Goldin of Texas A&amp;M University and Masahiro Ishiura of NIBB. The goal of the
project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms. Circadian
rhythms are an adaptation of organisms to the regular daily change of their
environment. Although much is known about the formal properties of circadian
rhythms that allow them to synchronize to the daily light/dark cycles, almost
nothing is known about how these rhythms work on the biochemical level. Two
approaches will be utilized. First, the investigators will use the simplest
organism now known to express circadian rhythms -- prokaryotic cynaobacteria.
Second, they will exploit the genetic tools available in this simple cell to
analyze its mechanism. A major effort will be to identify the photoreceptor that
is involved by action spectroscopy. This study will rely on the use of the
Okazaki Large Spectrograph and Dr. Kondo's video camera apparatus to screen
hundreds of colonies for specific manifestations of circadian behavior.
