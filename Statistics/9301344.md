This project will develop computationally efficient, robust, affine-equivariant
estimators of multivariate location and shape for use in multivariate analysis
and for identification of high leverage points in robust regression. This
problem has proved to be computationally quite challenging---reliable solutions
were possible with previous methods only for small samples and low dimension. We
have developed methods that greatly increase the effectiveness of these
procedures and propose to develop these methods further, including the
adaptation to massively parallel architectures. The goal, which seems to be in
reach, is to obtain reliable, estimates in a few seconds, compared to the many
hours of computation time now required. The detection of unusual observations
and clusters of observations is an important part of any effective statistical
analysis. Such observations may be mistakes or may represent important new
phenomena. For data that consists of many simultaneous measurements, this goal
has to date been out of reach of the best statistical methods. We have developed
techniques that make this goal practical, and, under this project, we will
further develop them, together with their computer implementations.
