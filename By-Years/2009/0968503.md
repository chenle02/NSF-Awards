Volunteer Computing (VC) uses the computational resources of volunteers with
Internet-connected PCs to address fundamental problems in science.
Unfortunately, the largely white-male volunteers are not representative of the
general population, and their involvement typically consists of nothing more
than contributing idle computing resources. The demonstrated benefits to
scientific discovery and the opportunity to engage a broad population motivate
this project?s radical transformation of VC systems.

This work will build ExSciTecH, an interactive, easy-to-use VC system to Explore
Science, Technology, and Health. The system will motivate and facilitate diverse
volunteers to donate their intellectual and computational resources to VC
projects. As a result, ExSciTecH will aid scientific discovery even as it
develops a more scientifically informed and engaged citizenry. Supported by
technologies such as the Nintendo Wii Remote controller and casual gaming,
ExSciTecH will help volunteers discover how rewarding and exciting science can
be.

Intellectual Merit: This project aims to increase the interest and participation
of diverse populations in computer science in general and VC projects in
particular, to build inclusive communities of diverse volunteers, and to
increase the science delivered to scientists by Docking@Home, a VC project
targeting the design of new drugs for breast cancer and HIV.

Broader Impact: ExSciTecH will be distributed through an established network of
undergraduate computing programs that are dedicated to diversity in information
technology. The National Center for Women and IT (NCWIT) has experience and
resources for promoting and distributing practices that recruit and retain
diverse populations.
