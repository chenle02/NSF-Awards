Teacher Enhancement Through Experiential Courses is a two-year series as pilot
workshops for K-12 teachers in Colorado. The one credit in-service programs will
combine problem-solving approaches to real-life situations outside of the
traditional classroom. They will incorporate curriculum development, in- school
trials, and the sharing of results in follow-up sessions. They will lead to the
development of "master teachers" and a networking among teachers and various
resource people and facilities in the region.
