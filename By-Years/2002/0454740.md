This project develops and investigates the feasibility of a new methodology for
performance assessment that will enable its use in large-scale tests. This
computer-based approach (a variant on an intelligent tutoring system) focuses on
explicit measurement of inquiry skills using a large-scale format. The project
focuses on the explicit measurement of inquiry skills and processes that connect
content domains for which there are less clear outcomes. Statistical modeling
techniques (based on the work of Mislevy) express how observable variables
depend on the knowledge, skills or abilities of the examinees. The project
measures across the middle school science content areas of physical, earth and
space, and life sciences. Tasks will be developed and piloted with students from
a wide range of backgrounds. This is conceived as Phase I of the project. The PI
will then submit Phase II that will investigate the viability of these products
to perform as expected in middle school classrooms
