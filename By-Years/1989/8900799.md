A long-standing honors program for 30 on-campus undergraduates has been
successfully integrated with the NSF-REU site program. The combined program has
increased the total number of student participants and provided resources for
the recruitment of off- campus participants. Continuation of the REU site
permits the program to serve broadly as a state and regional Center for summer
undergraduate research. The specific goals of this activity are to provide in-
depth research experience, guide talented students towards a research career,
expose participants to a variety of research, topics, and increase the ability
of the students to communicate research plans and results. Research projects
include: (1) supercooled liquid metal films for high resolution scanning,
tunneling microscopy, (2) growth measurements on single cells, (3) bilayer film
characterization of polymer blending systems, and (4) effect of gene
amplification in the rate of biocatalysis.
