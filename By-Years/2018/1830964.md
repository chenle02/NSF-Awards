This proposal will address the problem of distinguishing between normal tissue
and precancer tissue changes, critical for successful treatment of ovarian
cancer. Ovarian cancer has a very poor prognosis unless detected at the earliest
stage, which is extremely difficult. Current clinical imaging techniques lack
sufficient resolution, specificity, and sensitivity for effective
differentiation of normal and diseased cancerous tissue.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need for new insight into
disease etiology and progression. The PI will develop new Second Harmonic
Generation (SHG) imaging tools for this purpose. They will extend current SHG
microscopy to tomography for better characterization of 3D collagen structure.
They will a) develop SHG excitation tomography; b) develope new reconstruction
algorithms; and c) incorporate the 3D data into a respective classification
scheme, and explore the use of deep learning algorithms to refine the
classification analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
