This project expands the undergraduate computer systems curriculum through an
introduction to high-performance computing. Until now, the computing facilities
could not support such courses. Funds are being used to acquire the necessary
hardware and software to teach two new courses, one on parallel processing and
one on experimental computer science. The first course is based on a novel
approach that emphasizes parallel languages as a bridge between parallel
architectures and parallel algorithms. The second course is quite likely an
absolute first. Organized exclusively around experiments, it teaches students
how to evaluate high-performance technology. Together, and in the context
offered by the rest of the undergraduate curriculum, these courses can
strengthen students' ability to deal with cutting-edge technology. By
dissemination through the World Wide Web, this project can support the
development of similar courses in other universities.
