This RAPID supports the aircraft service component of the funded EAGER project
of the same name (J. Welker, lead PI, ARC-1332274). The main objective of the
EAGER project is to characterize the hydrologic cycle over various landscape
types by collecting water vapor isotopes from tower measurements as well as an
aircraft. A fixed-wing aircraft has been modified to support the sensors
necessary for the project. Contracting was expected to take place through NSF's
arctic research support and logistics contractor but will instead be done by the
awardee for approximately the same cost and with increased involvement of the
PI.
