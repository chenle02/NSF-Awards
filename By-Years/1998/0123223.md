This program is designed to encourage talented but economically disadvantaged
students to major in mathematics, computer science, and CIS at Towson University
and to assist them in being successful in its completion. The program pro-
actively solicits applications from districts that have significant populations
of women and ethnic minority students, since those groups have not chosen these
programs in large numbers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towson University coordinates
and supervises the designated cohort groups through three management committees,
provides support services, and provides additional financial support from the
two centers in the College of Science and Mathematics and from existing
corporate partners. Regular academic support services are available to these
scholars, including matriculation and admission assistance, advisement and
counseling, tutoring, career advisement, securing internships or part-time
employment, and assistance with job placement at graduation. In addition to
these services, scholars are expected to participate in a special support
community, have access to specialized tutoring assistance, and be given
financial assistance for joining a student chapter of a national professional
association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though all the regular student support
mechanisms on campus are available for this group, a coalition of educators,
students, and local professionals serve to support them and to provide a
nurturing community of scholars to assure their success.&lt;br/&gt;
