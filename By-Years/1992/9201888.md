This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is in the general
area of electrochemistry in the subfield of inorganic synthesis. Caustic soda is
manufactured in the USA to the extent of about 36,500 tons/day at a market value
of about $25 million/day, almost exclusively by the electrolysis of brine.
Chlorine is produced simultaneously and has suffered a declining market with no
economical routes for its destruction or dumping. Hence, there are real
opportunities for alternative manufacturing processes not involving chlorine.
The Phase I research project successfully demonstrated such a process based on
the electrolysis of an alternative sodium salt. The Phase II research effort
will identify state-of-the-art cell components and cell design and modify these
accordingly to achieve minimum cell voltage, high caustic current efficiency,
and high caustic concentration, of up to 50% by weight. Factors contributing to
the stability and performance of the membranes and electrodes will be studied
carefully, and the process will be evaluated under extended electrolysis
conditions. Statistical design methodology will be followed. The results of
these studies will form the basis of a preliminary engineering design for the
overall process and an economic assessment of capital and operating costs. %%%
This research has the potential for the development of a new way of making
caustic soda without chlorine byproduct. This is an excellent example of an
environmentally benign synthesis which could have a significant societal impact.
