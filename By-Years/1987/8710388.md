The research deals with the use of biotechnology in environmental pollution
control. Micro-organisms are cultivated and contained in a combined
equalization, reaction, and settling vessel. This process is designated as a
batch integrated treatment. The plan is investigate and select one or more
processes, develop a methodology for a lavoratory, bench, pilot and full scale
design of a batch integrated treatment process, and to evaluate the selected
process in other applications and against other processes. A full scale unit is
to be designed, ordered, and installed at an industrial facility.
