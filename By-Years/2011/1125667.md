This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE)
provides funding to enhance recent biological hypotheses regarding the control
of high-speed legged locomotion over uneven terrain for application in robotics.
A simulation model will be used to thoroughly test the hypotheses in ways not
achievable in biological labs, such as lengthening limb segments or
redistributing mass, to make critical enhancements. At high running speeds, legs
utilize passive compliant elements such as tendons and ligaments to store and
return energy during the stance phase of the leg cycle. To achieve robust
locomotion, the effort of these passive elements must be combined with active
feedback response from the muscles to overcome the pervasive uncertainty
inherent to natural terrain. Two hypotheses derived from biological evidence,
independently addressing the passive and active elements of locomotion, will be
combined and tested for robustness, practicality and generality using full 3D
models of biped and quadruped systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legs appear in many
forms, vary widely in function and can easily outperform man-made wheeled and
tracked vehicles on uneven terrain, which makes the replication of leg
functionality and the associated mobility very desirable for robotics systems. A
robot that could achieve animal-like robust and agile movements, combined with
the ability to work in remote and hazardous environments, would be valuable for
time-critical search and rescue, planetary exploration, in vivo drug delivery,
military reconnaissance, prostheses, hazardous waste cleanup, home service, and
a host of other applications. Despite the great potential of legged systems, no
biomorphic legged system is currently operational in a natural environment. This
BRIGE grant provides funding to potentially enable improved robot locomotion
using biological research as the foundation.
