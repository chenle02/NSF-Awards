Pleistocene Impacts on the Evolution of Alpine Plant-Insect
Interactions&lt;br/&gt;DeChaine, EG and AP
Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Communities may be
ephemeral aggregations of species or may be stable, wherein members evolve in
cohort over time. This study will infer the 'openness' of alpine plant-insect
communities and the relative impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the
evolution of interacting species. The history of alpine plant-insect communities
of the Rocky Mountains will be inferred by comparative phylogeography of two
specialized plant-insect associations. Phylogenies for each species will be
constructed from genetic polymorphisms. Phylogenies will be compared within
specialized plant-insect pairs as well as between unassociated organisms to
infer the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors. Preliminary analysis
suggests that specialized plant-insect pairs share a common history and that the
geographic structure of genetic diversity is due to historic fragmentation of
the alpine followed by post-glacial range expansion. This study will reveal the
relative importance of historic abiotic and biotic interactions on the
composition of alpine plant-insect communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
