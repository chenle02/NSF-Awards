The goal of this research is to make parallel computing simple and efficient on
general-purpose, commodity processors and networks. Recent work has focused on
algorithms for the efficient implementation of software distributed shared
memory (DSM) on low-cost, high-performance workstation clusters. This work has
shown that software DSM can achieve performance close to a hardware
implementation of shared memory on a variety of scientific applications that
synchronize with moderate frequency. The objective is to improve this work in
two ways; (1) to achieve the efficient execution of applications that
synchronize with greater frequency and, (2) to support languages ordinarily used
to solve symbolic problems. Specifically, the following approaches are
evaluated: (a) run-time support for programming high-level synchronization
operations, such as task queues, that reduces the amount of communication by the
DSM system, (b) compiler support to reduce the amount and/or hide the latency of
communication by the DSM system, and (c) garbage collection algorithms
integrated with the DSM system to enable the efficient execution of advanced
programming languages.
