This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1992, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under
the direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Division. By design, the
scope of the research projects within the chemistry department extend from basic
scientific research for theoretical advancement to applied research on system
design and technological development. Most importantly, the research
opportunities for the NSF-REU undergraduate participants will encompass all of
the major disciplines of chemistry; Inorganic, Organic, Physical, Analytical and
Biochemistry. The range of projects that would be available to participating
students include a full range of chemical, theoretical, biophysical and
instrumentation approaches to the advancement of polymer science. Our plan is to
place great emphasis on matching the students with mentors who have similar
scientific interests. Several department members are involved in joint research
projects with scientific colleagues at Kodak, Xerox, Bausch and Lomb, IBM, Mobil
Corp. and Fisons Pharmaceuticals. The students will have an opportunity to
benefit from these professional collaborations through on-site seminars, plant
visitations and possibly even future research internships. Our ultimate goal is
to motivate all participants in the summer research program to pursue scientific
excellence.
