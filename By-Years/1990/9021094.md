Charged species moving in viscous media move at varying rates under the
influence of electric fields, dependent on the acceleration due to the field
competing with the drag of the medium. A device which measures the relative
speed of motion of different ions is an ion mobility spectrometer. In this
research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. McMinn will use an ion mobility spectrometer to
identify and quantify trace organic species. The species will be separated from
the medium in which they are initially found by supercritical fluid extraction.
The work will be performed largely by undergraduates. Selectivity for organic
species will be achieved both by varying the properties of the supercritical
fluid used for extraction and by varying the parameters of the ion mobility
spectrometer. This two-dimensional approach will give enhanced selectivity
compared to either method alone. Both supercritical fluid extraction and ion
mobility spectrometry are relatively new techniques. Thus, their combination
will afford types of separations and specific analytical methods heretofore
unexplored.
