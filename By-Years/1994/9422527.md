In collaboration with Robert Clemen of the Decision Science Research Institute,
this PI proposes to develop procedures using the copula approach in order to
assess dependence. The situations in which this approach will be applied are
expert knowledge ones in which the decision maker must consider a set of
interrelated random variables. The research will involve the mathematical
development and analysis of families of copulas and dependence measures, the
design of assessment procedures, laboratory studies to test the ability of
experts to understand the procedures, development of computational procedures,
field studies with real-world knowledge-modeling applications, and the
construction of protocols and general prescriptive recommendations for
dependence assessment Hal R. Arkes Hal R.
