The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to redefine how blood pressure is
monitored and managed. The current standard of care for blood pressure
measurement is to utilize discrete snapshots taken by cuff-based systems to
manage a constantly changing pressure. These snapshots are often inaccurate and
lead to uncontrolled blood pressure, a 45 billion dollar problem for our
healthcare system. The proposed project will develop a non-invasive approach to
continuously measure blood pressure. Accurate granular blood pressure trends
would allow physicians to better manage high blood pressure, a major risk factor
for cardiovascular disease, which affects over 100 million Americans today.
Real-time blood pressure monitoring would also help patients understand the
impact of their daily behaviors on blood pressure and promote healthy lifestyle
choices. A continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitor has multiple market
applications and would pioneer the field of continuous blood pressure analytics.

The proposed project aims to develop a wrist based patch system that utilizes
optical sensors to obtain pulse waveform data and a novel approach to convert it
to blood pressure. The team will be developing a working prototype that acquires
the raw data and converts it to absolute blood pressure. The prototype will also
have the ability to transmit these blood pressures to a smart device for review.
With successful development of the working prototype the team will then generate
a databank to refine the algorithm used to convert differential pulse arrival
time to blood pressure. Accurate outpatient blood pressure trends would take the
guesswork out of blood pressure management and has the potential of identifying
new prognostic markers for cardiovascular disease.
