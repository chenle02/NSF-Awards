9418922 Zeng This research is to do an inverse study for several earthquake
sources using a composite source modeling approach. A suite of composite
subevents is first generated and then a genetic algorithm is used to locate
these subevents on the fault plane that best matches the observed strong motion
waveforms. Also, equivalent earthquake slip and dynamic stress drop models will
be generated from the composite source solutions. The results will help to
better understand the earthquake dynamics and answer questions in regard to the
characteristics of a dynamic source model imposed by the kinematic description
of a composite source solution. Advantages of this approach are that it provides
a broadband description of earthquake source and wave propagation and that it
has all the important phases of seismic waves. It can be used to estimate the
seismic hazard from a specific set of mapped faults. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
