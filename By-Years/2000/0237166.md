A grant has been awarded to Dr. Brett Riddle at the University of Nevada Las
Vegas to investigate detailed biogeographic structure in highly arid adapted
small mammals (pocket mice, cactus mice, antelope ground squirrels, and
Merriam's kangaroo rat) across the Peninsular, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan warm
deserts in southwestern North America. These small mammal groups represent a
total of 20 species that collectively contain in their genomes a signature of
the events (including cycles of geographic isolation and dispersal) that record
a long historical association between earth history and biotic diversification.
These events include geological tectonic activities instrumental in the
origination of regional deserts several millions of years ago, as well as cycles
of climatic transformations within the most recent 2 million years (the
Pleistocene epoch). We will use DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genome
across some 1656 specimens to examine patterns of geographic distribution of
evolutionary lineages embedded within these 20 species, and use comparative
analytical tools to ask to what extent the diversification of this aridlands
mammal biota is attributable to: 1) Neogene vicariant or dispersal events; 2)
events associated with pluvial-interpluvial cycles of the Pleistocene; or 3)
post-Pleistocene filter-barriers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our analysis of small
mammal biogeographic history will provide a general framework for addressing the
evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation biology of the southern regional
deserts of North America and hence be applicable to other biotic groups that
demonstrate similar distributional patterns and long-term adaptation within
these aridlands. Elucidation of these historically derived patterns and
processes of biological diversification will be critical to formulating the
understanding of biodiversity required for conservation management planning in
these increasingly impacted and threatened desert regions.
