9422854 Parkinson In the spectral region 175-205 nm, the penetration of solar
radiation into the atmosphere is controlled by the absorption of the Schumann-
Runge bands of molecular oxygen and some fraction of the transmitted radiation
is available to photodissociate nitric oxide (NO) molecules in bands below 192
nm. In this project, measurements of the NO cross sections will be extended
below 185 nm by using a unique vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) Fourier Transform (FT)
spectrometer in combination with a synchrotron radiation source at the Photon
Factory, in Tsukuba, Japan. The high resolution of the spectrometer is necessary
for the determination of the absolute cross sections of molecular bands
possessing distinct rotational structure. These absorption cross sections are
needed to accurately calculate the NO dissociation rates in the middle
atmosphere.
