This workshop adds two two-day research/evaluation training workshops to the
Society for Education Effectiveness Meeting (SREE) that will take place in
Washington D.C. in October 2011. This SREE meeting has mathematics and science
education research and evaluation as its focus. The first workshop will examine
research design, and will specifically focus on the design of experimental and
quasi-experimental evaluation studies. The second will examine ideas of
multilevel populations and samples, and their implications for multilevel
theories in evaluation research and for the analysis of experiments and quasi-
experiments. SREE is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and having NSF
support a pre-session workshop on quantitative research design is a nice
connection with the U.S. Department of Education. NSF PIs and contractors will
be targeted to participate and the workshops should increase the number of
quantitative research designs submitted by proposers to NSF programs.
