This project will focus on local and asymptotic behavior of nonlinear
degenerate or singular evolution equations. Local regularity, appearance of
singularities, and intrinsic local and global versions of Harnack type of
estimates will be attempted. It is anticipated that questions concerning new
type of weak solutions and intriguing aspects of parabolic equations with
limiting Sobolev exponent will have to be analyzed. The equations to be studied
arise as models of nonlinear phenomena such as fast diffusion in plasma,
transition of phase, and flow of immiscible fluids in a porus medium. Problems
concerning coating of metal surfaces with colloidal fluids and conduction-
convection will be considered.
