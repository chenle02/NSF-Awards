This project, acquiring a computational cluster named Bartik, supports faculty
research employing high-performance computing (HPC) needs and undergraduate
education within the home departments of all investigators and senior personnel,
and creates opportunities for additional faculty, new or existing, to implement
computational aspects into research and/or teaching endeavors in this mainly
undergraduate serving institution. (The cluster is named after Jean Bartik, a
pioneering woman in the field of computer science and programming and a
Northwest alumnus.)

Large datasets continue to become increasingly common in many studies. Web-based
commerce has allowed marketing data to grow exponentially, and breakthroughs in
laboratory technology have enabled collection of vast datasets that were
previously unattainable. These data can no longer be stored, manipulated, or
analyzed on desktop computers, leaving HPC as a main outlet for many studies.
NWMSU interacts with the supercomputing network XSEDE, but relatively few
projects require its exceptional resources. The computational cluster would
support projects outlined in this proposal and allow benchmarking and piloting
of code to be run on XSEDE resources. Bartik would service both the research and
education needs at NWMSU undergraduate and graduate students, as well as some
high school students that are frequently engaged in faculty research. Research
experiences for these students are invaluable and often lead to increased
success and retention rates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
fields. This cluster would also support a new undergraduate program in Data
Sciences that will begin accepting students in the Fall of 2016. Within this
course of study, undergraduate students in Mathematics, Computer Science,
Business, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Biology will be trained to
work with big data using coding, statistical, and visualization approaches.
