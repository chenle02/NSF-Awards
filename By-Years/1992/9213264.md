A major challenge to statistics is the analysis and visualization of high-
dimensional data. Theoretical foundation and software implementation are among
the facets of this challenge to be undertaken as part of this project. In a
separate venue, fundamental problems in experimental design are to be examined
with attention to Bayesian design, design for computer experimentation,
nonparametric analysis and response surfaces. Increasingly, statistics as a
discipline has been moved by the computer: experiments and data structures grow
increasingly ambitious and sophisticated as computers gain in power. This
research links the concepts of effective design and analysis of experiments with
the visualization of complex information and methodologic advances in
computational statistics.
