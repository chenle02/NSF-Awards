This award funds research in economic theory. Information guides decisions and
as such it is a unique policy tool for coordinating and incentivizing economic
behavior. Indeed, it can often be at least as powerful motivator as costly
pecuniary incentives but by contrast information is often free. This project
will advance our understanding of information as a policy instrument by studying
the incentive effects of information disclosures over time. When funds must be
collected toward financing a public project, how frequent and informative should
be periodic disclosures about progress toward the goal? In competition for
public contracts or resources, how and when should feedback be provided to
contestants to maximize the gains from competition? When should policymakers
communicate privately with individual parties and when are public disclosures
more effective? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions are formally addressed
using new methods in the theory of extensive-form games with incomplete
information. Traditionally, game theory has proceeded by taking as given the
structure of information held by the players and applied solution concepts such
as Sequential Equilibrium to make predictions. When instead we want to study how
information can alter the outcomes &lt;br/&gt;of strategic interactions we need
tools for summarizing all solutions obtained as the information structure
varies. Then, the best use of information can be formalized as an optimization
problem over this feasible set. This project develops the tools to carry out
this analysis in two types of environments: specific settings in which the
dynamic structure of interactions is given, and general settings in which that
aspect of the game is part of the design alongside the information
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
