Abstract (Keel, 1503700):

This award provides funding for the Eighteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium in
Analysis and PDE, to be held at the University of Minnesota from April 17 to
April 19, 2015.

The symposium focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, fluid mechanics,
optimal transport, geometry in high dimensions and Banach spaces. The confirmed
speakers are Alessio Figalli, Nader Masmoudi, Vitali Milman and Laure Saint-
Raymond. The award gives young researchers without other funding the opportunity
to participate at the conference. The organizing committee plans to strive to
make this funding opportunity known to the target groups by mailing lists,
posters and advertisements in professional organizations. More information will
be made available at http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/riv_fabes/
