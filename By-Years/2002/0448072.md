Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is awarded a grant to study the folding
pathways of proteins. Using data mining and modeling experiments the project
will develop 5 statistical models to represent the various stages of the path to
a folded protein. The models represent a decision tree in the sequence-structure
space, where each model feeds into the following step: from Initiation, folding
of short motifs; Propagation, local extensions of structured regions;
Condensation, contacts between pairs of local units; Packing, units fold into a
space filling way; to Topology, ordering of loop lengths, etc. to yield the
fully folded structure. Green Fluorescent Protein will be used as a test case,
with strategic point mutations providing a means for experimental verification
of intermediate structures and the overall success of the method. The project
will be integrated in the undergraduate education at RPI and will offer
stimulating experiences for the students to work in a lab.
