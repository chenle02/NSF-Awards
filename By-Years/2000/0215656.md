The Space Studies Board (SSB) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences requests
funding to be used for travel grants for young scientists from developing
countries (India, China, South America and nations of the former Soviet Union)
and from within the United States who are involved in solar-terrestrial research
(e.g., aeronomy, the magnetosphere, the sun, the interplanetary medium, and the
upper atmosphere) to attend the World Space Congress 2002. The World Space
Congress is a joint scientific/technical meeting of the Committee on Space
Research (COSPAR) and the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). The
funding will be directed to the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), which will
administer the grants.
