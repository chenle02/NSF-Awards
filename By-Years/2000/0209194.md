CTS-0209194&lt;br/&gt;Paul Linden&lt;br/&gt;University of California San
Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative research effort between UC
San Diego and UC Santa Barbara to carry out experimental and computational study
of gravity currents and two-layer bores in fluids of large density difference so
that the usual Boussinesq approximation cannot be applied. The non-Boussinesq
cases are found in many industrial flows and some chloride solutions for the
low-density contrast experiments and sodium chloride solutions for the high-
density contrast cases. Gross features of the flow will be recorded by
shadowgraphs, and detailed velocity measurements will be made by particle
tracing technique. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) willb e made for these
cases at UCSB. From the understanding gained by the experimental and
computational studies, models of propagation and the mixing of the currents will
be formulated.
