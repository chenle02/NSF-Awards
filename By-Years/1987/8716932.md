The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (U&HMS) an international non-profit
professional association serving the diving community worldwide, will prepare an
annotated bibliography on the problems of open ocean diving as a first step in
convening a workshop on the subject. The intent of this effort is to provide
academic research vessels that permit diving activities in the deep ocean a more
complete set of guidelines to ensure greater safety. These guidelines may also
be incorporated in the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) Research Vessel Safety Standards. The U&HMS has prepared many
bibliographies on various diving activities and convened several national and
international workshops on medical and scientific problems. The Society also
publishes a newsletter and two highly regard professional journals. The P.I.,
Dr. Leon Greenbaum is the Executive Director of the Society with extensive
experience in medical and diving activities and has directed a number of similar
projects in the past. Because diving standards vary from one institution to the
next, this study and workshop will provide the basis for greater uniformity of
safety standard for open ocean diving from UNOLS research vessels. Participants
for the workshop will be selected when the bibilography has been completed.
