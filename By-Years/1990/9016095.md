The primary objective of this research is the development of efficient
techniques for reliable data transmission and storage. The specific areas
addressed include (1) tighter lower bounds for the minimum distance of cyclic
codes that can be easily computed and applied to Goppa codes and generalized
Goppa codes (2) efficient decoding algorithms that can fully realize the error
correcting capability of these codes,and (3) extension of promising approaches
in decoding cyclic and Goppa Codes to improve the decoding of geometric Goppa
codes. In the determination of tighter minimum distance bounds, investigations
include root pattern characterization and codeword- locator polynomial
approaches, and efficient methods of finding submatrices of the generalized
Cauchy and generalized Vandermonde types for the associated Reed-Solomon codes.
In decoding, the research includes a generalized Peterson procedure that can
determine error locations from nonrecurrent dependence relations among the
syndromes. A polynomial version of a fundamental iterative algorithm will be
developed to provide a better alternative for hardware implementation.
Extensions of the generalized Peterson procedure will be sought to decode the
two subclasses of geometric Goppa codes, the elliptic codes, and the Hermitian
codes, up to the actual minimum distance.
