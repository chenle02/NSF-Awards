0114528 Rao This award supports Vittal Rao of University of Missouri-Rolla and
junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in
workshops on engineering education. The workshops will be held concomitantly
with the International Conference on Engineering Education to be held in Oslo,
Norway, August 6-10, 2001. The workshop topics are internet-based course
development, exchange programs for students and faculty, multidisciplinary
design programs, and industry collaborations and alliances. The selection
process for which participants will be supported will be open, and a special
effort will be made to include junior faculty members. Special attention will be
given to strengthening ties between delegates from the U.S. and those from the
various other countries. A primary goal of the workshops is to catalyze the
development of action plans for long-term international collaborations and
partnerships, and to promote sharing of educational innovations between the
schools of different countries.
