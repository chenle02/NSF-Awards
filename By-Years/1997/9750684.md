Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy is a
powerful, state-of-the-art analytical method used commonly in industrial and
graduate school settings. This project integrates modern FT-NMR concepts more
firmly into the chemistry curriculum. An upgrade of an outdated, continuous-wave
60-MHz instrument to an FT system allows full implementation of the project.
This upgrade dramatically increases the utility of magnets without introducing
the high maintenance and purchasing costs associated with a superconducting NMR
magnet. The upgraded system provides the capability to (1) provide hands-on NMR
experience as early as the sophomore year, (2) introduce 13C NMR spectroscopy,
(3) perform new laboratory experiments (e.g., experiments in kinetics and
characterization of reactive intermediates), (4) investigate advanced NMR topics
(such as FID collection, two-dimensional spectra, relaxation times, and signal-
averaging) and (5) perform a host of other new applications. Specific
improvements in five laboratory-based chemistry courses begin with sophomore-
level organic chemistry and continue through senior-level advanced courses.
Students graduate with extensive first-hand experience on an FT-NMR instrument,
a thorough knowledge of the principles behind NMR, and confidence in spectral
interpretation. A comprehensive evaluation plan has been forged which relies on
assessment of student performance on laboratory reports, course exams, and
nationally standardized NMR-related test questions. *
