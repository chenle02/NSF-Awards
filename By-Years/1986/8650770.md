This project will enhance significantly the chemistry education of undergraduate
students at Pacific Lutheran University by providing hands-on experience with
analytical techniques used in modern chemistry. Acquisition of a computer-
controlled gas chromatograph/mass selective detector will enable students in
organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and
undergraduate research to use the powerful combination technique of gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry for separation and identification of components
of complex mixtures. The gas chromatograph acquired for this project will also
be interfaced with a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer recently
purchased by the Chemistry Department. The availability of GC/MS and GC/FTIR
capability will provide gas chromatographic, mass spectral, and infrared data
for the same sample, and will allow students to investigate more complex
mixtures of compounds and "real world" problems.
