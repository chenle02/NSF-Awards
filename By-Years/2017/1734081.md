This award will support the organization of a two-day workshop on Object
Perception, Attention, and Memory (OPAM) on November 8-9, 2017 that will
showcase graduate and postdoctoral research in visual cognition. The OPAM
workshop will facilitate the exposure of, and networking among, early-career
scientists. OPAM is free and accessible, features talks and poster presentations
by graduate and postdoctoral researchers, and is a vital venue for professional
development.

Current research in visual cognition spans a broad range of research topics
(e.g., object, face, and scene recognition; visual attention; visual memory; eye
movement control and active vision) and uses a wide variety of research tools.
The award allows the OPAM workshop to be expanded to two days in order to allow
more opportunities for presentations and introduces new programming designed to
expand trainee access to mentoring, networking, and research ideas. The
organizers have paid particular attention to the inclusion of women and members
of under-represented groups as speakers, panelists, and panel moderators. The
2017 workshop will take place in Vancouver, Canada, which increases the
opportunity for early-career scientists to establish international
collaborations.
