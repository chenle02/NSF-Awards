9304797 Clement Recent interpretations of paleomagnetic records of polarity
transitions have given rise to a great deal of controversy over transitional
VGPs which tend to fall along two preferred longitudinal bands. While some
workers have interpreted the geographical grouping of transitional VGPs as
evidence that large scale symmetries were present in the transitional fields,
others have suggested that the grouping, if significant,results from an artefact
of the recording process in sediments. It is clear that additional records are
required to resolve this controversy, and for this reason the PI undertook a
project sampling six Pliocene polarity transitions recorded in the Suva Marl in
Fiji. Renewal of the original grant will support fine-scale, detailed sampling
of four identified transitions zones in the Suva Marl. ***
