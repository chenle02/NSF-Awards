The distribution of plant and animal species may change due to both natural
causes, or due to human-assisted introductions to new areas. This research uses
a large global database that documents the occurrence of mammals and their
parasites to determine the kinds of parasites that are gained and lost by
different species as they are introduced to new areas. This study explores how
environmental factors and the traits of parasites (how they are transmitted or
whether they specialize on a host) may explain whether they are retained, lost,
or newly acquired. This study will allow researchers to anticipate new
associations between parasites and host species, which is important to
conservation science, public health, and the food industry. This research
program will train undergraduate and graduate students and school teachers in
the use of existing databases and computational software for addressing pressing
ecological questions.

The goal of this study is to use the Global Mammal Parasite Database and other
data sources to examine the association of mammals and their parasitic hosts
following their introductions into novel geographic areas. Statistical and
modeling approaches to disentangle the role of climatic similarity, phylogenetic
compatibility, and parasite traits (transmission mode, level of specialization
and prevalence) will be developed to explain the loss and gain of parasites by
introduced mammals. This work addresses a fundamental question in community and
disease ecology by exploring the factors that promote the intimate associations
between species pairs. Given the geographic scope of this study and breadth of
introductions examined, the results of this research will provide a global
context for assessing the risk of emerging infectious diseases of animals and
humans due to the redistribution of introduced hosts and their parasites.
