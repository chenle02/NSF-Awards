****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a combination of
experimental observations and theoretical investigations to elucidate the
properties of Brownian vortexes, a newly discovered category of stochastic
machines that use random thermal forces to transduce energy into motion. Whereas
conventional deterministic machines waste energy punching through fluctuations,
stochastic machines instead take advantage of random forces to work through
their thermodynamic cycles. Unlike other stochastic machines, Brownian vortexes
evolve in static force fields that combine conservative traps and non-
conservative driving forces. Analogs of such systems are believed to occur in
biochemical, social and financial networks. Developing a fundamental
understanding of how Brownian vortexes work will provide doctoral dissertations
for two graduate students and honors theses for four undergraduate Physics
majors. This experimental program already has fostered the development of the
first practical tractor beams and the first knotted force fields, both of which
also have immediate real-world applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-
Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Much of our nation's technology is based on
combinations of elementary machines, such as wheels, levers and screws. This
project will elucidate the properties of a new type of elementary machine called
a Brownian vortex that uses random thermal noise to transform energy into
motion. The program's fundamental goals are to develop a deep physical
understanding of how Brownian vortexes work and how to recognize and
characterize them when they arise naturally in complex systems. This program
will provide doctoral disserations for two graduate students and honors theses
for four undergraduate Physics majors. The experiments on which these students
will work take advantage of state-of-the-art techniques of optical
micromanipulation, in which the forces and torques exerted by computer-designed
holograms are used to create and drive microscopic machines both to advance
fundamental knowledge and also for practical applications.
