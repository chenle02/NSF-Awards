This is an award to provide the initial increment of support for this
Presidential Young Investigator who plans to conduct research on improvement of
the analytical capabilities of environmental models to increase the usable
information that can be obtained from their operation. His approach involves
combining analytical tools from a variety of fields to work with simulation
techniques to enhance their usability and power. This entails the development of
decision support systems to aid the user to make the most appropriate decision
based on model simulation. Examples include: Linking geographic information
systems with water quality models to allow for rapid and direct visual analysis
of the model's output, incorporation of Monte Carlo analysis with water quality
models to produce quantitative comparisons of monitoring and sampling
strategies, inclusion of uncertainty analysis with simulation results, and use
of expert system rules and improved parameter estimation techniques to aid the
user in model calibration. The results are expected to improve the engineering
design of systems to minimize environmental pollution.
