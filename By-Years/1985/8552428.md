This research is in three areas: (1) design and control of condensation
polymerization processes, (2) kinetics of phase transfer catalyzed free radical
polymerization, and (3) computer-aided design, analysis, and control of
industrial polymerization processes. Under (1) above, the approach is to develop
detailed mathematical models for the multi-stage polymerization processes and to
carry out extensive experimentation to extract unknown kinetic parameters and to
confirm model predictions of reactor dynamics. Under (2), the goal is to
elucidate the kinetics of phase transfer polymerization (PTC), above, stochastic
state estimation techniques and adaptive control schemes will be applied to
estimate unmeasured parameters such as degree of conversion, copolymer
composition, chain sequence length distribution, etc. Analysis of both steady
state and dynamic behavior will be done because many exothermic polymerization
reactors exhibit peculiarities such as steady state multiplicity, sustained
oscillation, runaway, etc.
