This project investigates facets of the Langlands program -- an area of
Mathematics bridging number theory and geometry that examines in a systematic
way the symmetries inherent in solutions of algebraic equations. By relating
these symmetries to geometry, the program creates a powerful way of obtaining
arithmetic information. The project is particularly concerned with obtaining
such information explicitly. Deep and explicit knowledge of the arithmetic of
numbers is in turn essential for many technological advances over the last
decades that we take for granted today, including encryption and digital
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the project will establish a
uniform and explicit construction of the refined local Langlands correspondence,
for general connected reductive p-adic groups splitting over a tame extension
and all supercuspidal parameters, in residual characteristic prime to the order
of the Weyl group. The project further aims to compare the result of this
construction with other more general but less explicit constructions, such as
the one of Genestier-Lafforgue for local function fields. The role of
disconnected groups will also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
