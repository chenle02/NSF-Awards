This research will examine a new mathematical modeling approach involving
differential-algebraic systems of equations for the computational modeling of
forming processes, such as the deformation of sheet metal or sheets of plastic
material. It is anticipated that this research will enable large scale,
practical metal-forming problems to be understood and address new areas of
forming research characterized by mathematical models which will also yield to
these methods.
