The prime objective of the previous Phase I effort was to establish whether two
new lithium salts, LiN (CF3SO2)2 and LiSbF6, in combination with a suitable
solvent, could outperform state of the art electrolytes in Li/Ti S2 non-hermetic
full cells. It was determined and demonstrated that LiN(CF3SO2)2 had the
desirable characteristics for use in such lithium systems. The Phase II work
will be in three areas: (1) utilizing established techniques of purification and
synthesis to prepare LiN (CF3SO2)2 and two other, new organic onion lithium
salts, (2) determination of the reactions of these salts in both lithium and
solvent at extreme potentials and under full cell cycling conditions, and (3)
doing full cell cycling studies in Li/TiS2 test cells cycled at current
densities relevant to commercial applications. Rechargeable lithium power
sources which provide high energy densities at high rates have many potential
commercial uses as power systems in satellites, in portable communications
equipment and for other load-leveling applications. A key problem in the past
was the poor cycleability of the lithium electrode. Commonly used salts are
deficient with respect to rechargeables owing either to intrinsic instability or
lack of proper purification. The PI will therefore synthesize, purify and test
in a full cell, three salts that are not commercially available and hopes to
ultimately commercialize a very safe rechargeable lithium battery.
