The principal investigators (PI) will conduct research on the transmission of
video signals over fiber optic ATM based networks. The emphasis in on the impact
that video service with its coding, synchronization and error recovery
mechanisms and the ATM network with its multiplexing/switching, scheduling/
prioritization and control schemes will have on each other. The research will
address coding issues, video/ATM networking interfaces and network control. They
will investigate motion compensation for three-dimensional subband coding and
transform coding, as a vehicle for temporal data conversion, error concealment
and compression enhancement. They will also consider non-separable filter banks
used in subband coders. A major portion of the research will be the study of the
interface between the video coder and the network. This will include examining
the relationship between video services, coding schemes, and the statistics of
the output streams of the various variable bit rate codecs. The research will
result in the design and development of a packetizer/ depacketizer to be used in
conjunction with the coding schemes. Network control will include exploring the
effect that mechanisms such as prioritization, scheduling and flow control will
have on video services.
