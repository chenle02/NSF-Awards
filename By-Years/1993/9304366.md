This action provides support for a conference on U.S. implementation of the
recently signed Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. Legislation is
needed as part of the ratification process for the Protocol, and this meeting
will be oriented to exchanging information and perspectives on the key issues
and options that must be considered as Congress works to develop and pass the
required legislation. The meeting will involve participants from all the
organizations interested in the implementation process, including congressional
staff, representatives of agencies with interests in the Antarctic, tour
operators, and environmental organizations.
