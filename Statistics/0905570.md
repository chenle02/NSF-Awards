The investigator will study several stochastic process problems in settings
where the observations have a periodic structure. These problems include 1)
assessing whether or not two periodically stationary time series have the same
dynamics, 2) the development of models for count series in a periodic
environment, and 3) assessing trends in periodic storage processes. To do this,
the investigator will investigate periodic versions of some classical Markov
chain, renewal process, and time series models. Parameter estimation procedures
for the developed models, including issues of parsimony, will be studied.

Most processes observed in everyday life --- tides, temperatures, gasoline
prices --- have a seasonal (periodic) component. This research will develop
rigorous statistical procedures to analyze several types of periodic data. The
applications are aimed at answering several climate change questions including
1) are Atlantic Basin hurricane counts increasing (periodic series of counts)?,
2) are daily snow depth series in the United States showing change (periodic
storage processes)?, and 3) can the climate record from two neighboring towns be
declared the same or are the two localities different in some aspect
(equivalence of periodically stationary time series dynamics)?
