9626147 Taylor In this project the investigator continues her study of
equilibrium and growth problems involving anisotropic surface free energy and
mobility functions. She is developing new theoretical frameworks for considering
such problems as well as creating new algorithms and programs for computing
their solutions. The crystalline approach is to be used: the general idea behind
this approach is that surfaces are composed of segments of planes, with fixed
normal direction and with fixed adjacencies but with variable distance from the
origin, and the motion of these segments is governed by a system of ordinary
differential equations for the distances. This method may be considered as a
variant of finite element method where the normal Gauss map is discretized. It
is expected that this research will advance the understanding of the role of
surface free energy and kinetics in determining the shapes of surfaces and
interfaces in materials as well as provide insight into the underlying
mathematics. This will be accomplished in part by applying crystalline methods
to explain observed microfaceting and other behavior in materials.
