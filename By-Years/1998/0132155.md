&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop a
program that will optimize poly (ethynyl) silazanes (PESZ) synthesis with an
emphasis on improved efficiency and low production costs; will scale-up the
production of PESZ polymers to pilot scale batch sizes; will optimize PESZ
processing for component fabrication; will fabricate "real world" components,
such as thrust deflectors and diesel engine particulate filters; and will obtain
"real world" mechanical and performance testing data. Through the course of
achieving these objectives, commercial opportunities will be pursued. This
approach potentially permits the fabrication of extremely large ceramic matrix
composites (CMCs) structures never before possible in much the same manner as
large polymer matrix aircraft structures and boat hulls are currently
manufactured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application will be the
fabrication of extremely large CMC structures that can be used in the aircraft
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
