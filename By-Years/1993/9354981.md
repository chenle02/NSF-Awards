Increased utilization of natural gas in place of petroleum- based products
would benefit the environment as well as the National economy. However,
technological hurdles currently prevent much greater use of natural gas in
several key applications. The School of Chemical Engineering and Materials
Sciences (CEMS) at the University of Oklahoma is the lead department in a
multidisciplinary, multi-institutional center being formed to develop
environmentally friendly natural gas technologies. Research goals include
technologies for methane conversion to higher value chemicals, high density
natural gas storage at moderate temperature and pressure, technologies for
natural gas vehicles' emissions control, and improved natural gas fuel cells.
The five Graduate Research Traineeships will help build the foundation of the
new center and contribute to its mission. The traineeships will be awarded in
Fall, 1994 to five graduate students entering CEMS. Trainees will be involved in
collaborative research with colleagues in industry, in other disciplines, and at
other universities. Trainees also will have the opportunity to serve as mentors
for undergraduate researchers, a program designed to enhance the research
experience of the trainee and influence the undergraduate to consider graduate
chemical engineering study.
