This is in support of the Seventh International Conference on Dynamical
Processes in Excited States of Solids (DPC'89) to be held at the University of
Georgia on August 30 - September 2, 1989. DPC provides an informal forum in
which to discuss those subjects which are of common interest to physicists and
chemists working on dynamical processes in excited states of a wide range of
inorganic and organic condensed matter systems. The informal discussions, as
well as the more formal presentations, which take place during DPC are an
invaluable assistance to the participants and to the development of the
understanding of the dynamics of the excited states. The proposed funding will
be used to provide financial assistance to a number of researchers throughout
the world who would otherwise find it very difficult or impossible to attend.
