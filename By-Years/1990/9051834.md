The goal of this project is to improve the quality of the undergraduate
curriculum by changing an existing undergraduate core course, signals and
systems laboratory, into a computer- controlled instrument base laboratory
course. This project will enable us to ensure that all of our graduates will
have encountered modern CAD/CAM type equipment before their entry into the
workplace. The contributions of the project are threefold: to provide state-of-
the-art computer controlled instrumentation for each station within the
laboratory: to increase the exposure of the individual student to such
instrumentation by increasing the number of functioning stations, thereby
limiting the number of students per bench (maximum of two); and to create
expanded flexibility and capabilities via PC-based laboratory stations for
utilization of CAD software for analysis and design. Major equipment purchases
include equipping ten complete student stations with personal computers and
compatible programmable instrumentation including digital oscilloscopes,
waveform generators, power supplies, and pen plotters.
