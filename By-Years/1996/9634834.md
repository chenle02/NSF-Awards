ABSTRACT OPP-9634834 McCartney/Dixon/Savelle This proposed research project will
investigate baleen whale bones on precontact and contact Eskimo village sites
between Barrow and Saint Lawrence Island in northern Alaska. Bone elements will
be identified to species and size for purposes of reconstructing the relative
abundance of major species, their ages and sizes at death, and the ways they
were used by humans. The analysis of mortality profiles in zooarchaeological
assemblages is important for understanding the relationships between human
predators and prey species. Further, because the distribution of bowheads and
gray whales is ice and season dependent, whale abundance or scarcity will be
related to long-term climatic reconstructions. Comparisons will be made with
previously analyzed bone assemblages from northern Canada.
