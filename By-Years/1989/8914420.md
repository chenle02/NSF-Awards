This research centers on various asymptotics problems of interest in mechanics
and physics, including the zero dispersion limit for several nonlinear wave
equations, the recovery of the Navier-Stokes equations from the more general
Boltzmann equation, and the incompressible limit of the equations of
compressible fluid dynamics. The study of complicated nonlinear phenomena often
requires the solution of simplified forms of the governing equations. One of the
best ways of achieving this is to use the naturally occurring length and time
scales of the problem to simplify the problem while retaining the essential
physics. The proposed research will advance our knowledge of fluid flow
phenomena by performing this simplification on a number of important problems.
