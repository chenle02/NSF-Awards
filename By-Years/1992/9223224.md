The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign under the
supervision of Professor Peter G. Wolynes on nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics. The work involves studies of (1) the quantum dynamics of complex
systems, and (2) chemical kinetics in biomolecular and solvent environments. The
unifying theme of the work is the exploitation of ideas from random system
physics to study problems in chemical physics. %%% The application of
statistical methods to study the physical behavior of systems containing many
particles at equilibrium is well developed, but similar application to
nonequilibrium systems such as those undergoing chemical reaction is a major
current frontier of physical chemistry. Professor Wolynes is developing
statistical techniques to obtain useful information about such reacting systems,
particularly those undergoing biological transformations or those interacting
with solvents in solution reactions.
