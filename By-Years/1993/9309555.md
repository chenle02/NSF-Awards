9309555 Grober Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that was
isolated from brain in 1971 and has now been shown to exist in at least five
different multiple forms. Further, with the development of sophisticated
antibody technology, the GnRH neuronal network was demonstrated to be a complex,
heterogenous system, comprising three or more distinct neuronal groups and
spanning vastly different regions of the brain. While it is known that GnRH is
involved in the control of reproductive behavior and physiology in all
vertebrates, specific functions for the different GnRH peptides within the
different brain regions have yet to be identified. Dr. Grober will examine a
vertebrate that exhibits exceptional levels of sexual plasticity as his model
system, thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate how social
interactions can trigger profound behavioral and physiological changes via the
endocrine system. He will combine molecular, cellular and field endocrinological
techniques to determine the role of GnRH in sexual plasticity. Dr. Grober will
examine the relationship between GnRH gene expression and changes in physiology
and behavior. He will show where and how much GnRH is formed and under what
conditions. This integrative approach coupled with an unique model system will
provide important insights into the role that GnRH plays in basic mechanisms
underlying reproductive maturation, physiology and behavior. ***
