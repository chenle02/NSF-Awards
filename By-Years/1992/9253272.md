Through this project, Brooklyn Technical High School and its partners provide
summer and follow-up school inservice, mentoring and leadership development
experiences for 72 New York City high school teachers. These teachers, in turn,
become teacher/leaders for many other teachers in hands-on uses of technology in
science and mathematics. Over the three years of the project, the teachers
create appropriate lessons, devise strategies for incorporating them into the
curriculum, and other teachers in these techniques. The participating teachers
learn to develop materials for their own classrooms based on what is currently
used in the junior and senior pre-engineering curriculum at Brooklyn Technical
High School. Science content with mathematics is emphasized using cooperative
problem solving models with hands on learning. Technology and computer are
integral parts of the process.
