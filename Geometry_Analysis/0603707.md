The principal investigator will study a number of classical problems in
Differential and Riemannian geometry that are related to mean curvature
equations or have a strong connection with fully nonlinear elliptic equations
such as Monge-Ampere equations in some novel way. These include the equations of
prescribed mean curvature and more general curvature functions of graphs in
Riemannian manifolds MxR and hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature in
hyperbolic space with prescribed boundary at infinity. We also apply the methods
of fully nonlinear elliptic pde to study the geometric problem of estimating
from below, the total absolute Gauss curvature for convex hypersurfaces in a
Cartan-Hadamard manifold.

We continue to study the geometric aspects of the theory of fully nonlinear
elliptic equations that arise naturally in problems involving curvature. These
equations are the most useful and the most difficult to study and are broadly
applicable in pure and applied mathematics, especially in image processing,
optimal design, computational biology and mathematical physics. For example, the
use of mean curvature flow and other curvature flows in image processing and
problems of brain registration is now quite standard. We similarly expect that
our current research will become a standard tool in the future.
