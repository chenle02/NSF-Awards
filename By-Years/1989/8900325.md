This investigation will explore the evolutionary consequences of variable
recruitment in a colonial hydroid. Work to date has demonstrated that: 1)
recruitment density varies among isolated populations and determines the
intensity of intraspecific competition; 2) colonies display genetically based
variation in colony morphology that determines intraspecific competitive
ability; and 3) the morphologies present in population are correlated with the
observed level of competition. These preliminary data suggest that recruitment
density establishes the selective regime that determines the suite of
morphological characters present in a population. This hypothesis will be tested
by experimentally manipulating recruitment density in four populations and while
following three other populations as controls. This research will contribute to
our knowledge of marine populations by examining the potential for variation in
recruitment density to generate evolutionary change in species with limited gene
flow among populations.
