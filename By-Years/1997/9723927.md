Postawko 9723927 This project continues work begun by Susan Postawko and Mark
Morissey in 1994 with funding from the East Asia and Pacific Program. The simple
goal of the project is to gather rainfall data on the ground from multiple sites
throughout the Pacific island nations and territories. This unique data is made
available to meteorologists and other interested parties over the Worlwide Web
and through standard databases. It has been used in several major studies of
global climate including NASA WETNET's Precipitation Intercomparison Programs I
and II. Nearly all the data is collected by students in all levels of education
across the Pacific. The program started with 25 participating schools and has
grown to 145 schools at the present time representing approximately 30% of the
total number of Pacific Island sites now reporting daily rainfall. Therefore,
this project is much more than a data-gathering exercise. It is a major pan-
Pacific educational endeavor which gives students across the Pacific an
opportunity to participate in scientific research.
