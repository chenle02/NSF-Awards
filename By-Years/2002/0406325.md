Title: SGER: Exploring pervasive security

PI: Zhaoyu Liu

Pervasive applications should be able to select the proper security services
based on the hardware and environments, without concerns about the
implementation and configuration details. However, most existing security
systems, which are not built for the light, thin devices of pervasive computing
environments, cannot provide quality of protection to applications. The proposed
research will explore a capsule-based security system to support flexible
quality of protection in pervasive environments. The PI will develop a model of
security as services that centers on people, instead on devices, for improving
the usability of security. A testbed will be designed and implemented to
evaluate and demonstrate the proposed security system. The proposed research
will generate excellent topics for graduate and undergraduate education,
covering security, robustness, and design of distributed applications and
capsule-based systems. The involved students include under-represented
minorities from HBCU at North Carolina.
