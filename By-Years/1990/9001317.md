This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at Arizona State
University to establish a program to give undergraduates individual mentoring
and a rewarding experience doing research on the physiological bases of
behavior. All participants will integrate their work into a broad perspective
encompassing both mechanisms and evolution of behavior, and all will be
introduced to both laboratory and field studies. During the ten summer weeks of
the program ten undergraduate students will work with six participating faculty
members to design a research project, to implement it, and to report their
results. Faculty and students will meet weekly as a group to discuss research in
progress. Some social and cultural events are planned, in order to strengthen a
feeling of collegiality. Students will be recruited nationally and selected on
the basis of interest and preparation. Special efforts will be made to recruit
women and minorities, the latter particularly from institutions in the
southwest. This Research Experience for Undergraduates award will give 10
students a lively research experience, including opportunities to discuss their
work, as well as providing incentive to enhance on-going efforts of faculty in
the Department of Zoology to involve undergraduates in research.
