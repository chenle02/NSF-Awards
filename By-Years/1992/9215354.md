This award supports cooperation between Chinese scientists at Tsinghua
University and the China Institute of Atomic Energy with scientists from Duke
University in the investigation of two significant issues in low-energy physics.
Through nucleon-nucleon and neutron-deuteron experiments, the research team
hopes to provide high-accuracy information about the nature of the neutron-
nucleus interaction over a wide energy range, and about the nature of the
nucleon- nucleon interaction. Both China and the U.S. will contribute
researchers and accelerator time to the project. The Chinese contribution of
beam times at energies unreachable at the facilities available to the Duke
researchers is a key element in the collaboration. Duke researchers will join
Chinese researchers in work at the experimental facility at the China Institute
of Atomic Energy, and Chinese researchers will participate in experiments and
analysis at Duke.
