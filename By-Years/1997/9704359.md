9704359 Szabo The main theme of this project is the study of simply-connected
smooth closed 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten invariants. The project has
three parts. The first part is related to the classification problem for these
4-manifolds. While the recent failure of the Minimal Conjecture shows that
smooth 4-manifolds tend to defy classification schemes, there are other related
conjectures like the 3/2 Conjecture and the Simple-type Conjecture, and the
investigator will try to disprove these conjectures as well. In the second part,
the investigator will continue his joint work with John Morgan to study how
Seiberg-Witten invariants change along an h-cobordism. This problem is related
to the Simple-type Conjecture and also to the third part of the project, in
which the investigator will study the relation between the combinatorial
presentations (Kirby calculus pictures) and Seiberg-Witten invariants of simply-
connected smooth closed 4-manifolds. A long-term goal in this direction is to
find generalizations of the Seiberg-Witten invariants. The study of smooth
structures of simply-connected 4-dimensional manifolds was initiated in 1984 by
Simon Donaldson. In his ground breaking work, Donaldson applied the Yang-Mills
equation and the corresponding Yang-Mills moduli spaces over the 4-manifolds.
The corresponding Donaldson invariants were used to settle various problems in
4-dimensional topology. The Yang-Mills equation is a partial differential
equation that has special importance in theoretical physics, and its use in the
classification of smooth 4-manifolds revealed a surprising link between topology
and theoretical physics. This link has been underlined by Seiberg and Witten in
1994, when, using ideas coming from theoretical physics, they discovered a pair
of new partial differential equations and the corresponding Seiberg-Witten
invariants of smooth 4-manifolds. ***
