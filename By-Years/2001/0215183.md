This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to improve
delivery of clinically used drugs through formulation of a non-toxic, tissue-
specific drug delivery vehicle. A number of drugs and drug delivery vehicles
cause toxic side effects,thereby limiting the drug dose that can be
administered. This Phase I Project proposes to solve these problems by using a
proprietary mixture of non-phospholipid lipids for drug delivery. Suspensions of
lipid-coated microbubbles (LCM), made with this lipid mixture, have been found
to be highly tumor selective. Paclitaxel, delivered in LCM, has been shown to
reduce tumors in rats more effectively when compared to paclitaxel delivered in
the traditional vehicle, and produced less systemic toxicity. However, there are
no methods currently available to generate LCM on a commercial scale. In the
course of this Phase I Project, lipid nanoparticles from the proprietary lipid
mixture will be developed using a high pressure homogenizer. This will be
followed by the formulation of a number of clinically used drugs in lipid and
trsting of these formulations in cultured tumor cells.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of pharmaceutical
drug delivery.
