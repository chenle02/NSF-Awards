This award provides support for an integrated, multi- disciplinary
investigation of the earth's continental lithosphere where an abrupt boundary
exist between highly extended crust and a tectonically stable block. The main
research objective of this study is to use the "natural experiment" of a large
strain gradient in the uppermost part of the lithosphere to understand how the
Moho and other deep discontinuities respond to extension, thus quantifying how
large horizontal strains of the lithosphere relate to vertical motions
controlled by isostasy. A number of such regions have been identified by
geological mapping in the Basin and Range province. Of these, the western margin
of the Colorado Plateau is the best-suited example for accomplishing the
research objectives. It has the virtues of (1) abruptness; (2) a geologic
setting that indicates a simple pre-extensional crustal structure; and (3) a
well understood large-scale extensional kinematic history. Achieving these
research goals will require both focus and broad expertise. The principal
investigators will integrate geologic, petrologic, paleomagnetic, and
geochronologic studies and continuum modeling to unravel the geometry,
kinematics and dynamics of the lithosphere's response to severe extensional
strain.
