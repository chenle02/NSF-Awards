This Summer Mathematics Institute is a six-week residential research summer
school for about 25 minority undergraduates from the United States and Puerto
Rico. The participants will have completed at least two years of collegiate
mathematics with distinction by Summer 1991. Each student will participate in
two intensive seminars which have been designed to allow the student to explore
a mathematical subject in depth and to experience the excitement of creating
mathematics. A principal common to all seminars is helping students to develop
increased fluency with mathematical language, both written and oral. The overall
goal of the Institute is to help the students make the important transition from
learning mathematics to doing mathematics. The Institute will be held on the
Berkeley campus and continues and builds on successful Institutes held in 1989
and 1990. These Institutes are an integral part of a comprehensive national
strategy aimed at eliminating the under-representation of minorities in
mathematics and mathematics-dependent professions.
