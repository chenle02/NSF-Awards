This two-year project will develop materials to prepare middle and high school
mathematics teachers to teach statistics and will use these materials in a five-
week summer session for 30 teachers from the region around Oxford, Ohio.
Designed as a supplement to standard college-level statistics texts, these
materials will offer, at an adult level, the kinds of experiential approach to
statistics that is currently emphasized in many secondary school texts. The five
modules will cover descriptive statistics and data analysis, elementary
probability, probability distributions, elementary inference, and advanced
inference. Follow-up activities include visits by project staff to the
participants' schools and a miniconference at the end of the academic year.
Evaluation will assess the effectiveness of the materials, as well as the
participants' success in teaching statistics in their schools. The materials
will be disseminated through a series of regional workshops. The university and
the participants' schools will contribute an amount equal to 26% of the NSF
award.
