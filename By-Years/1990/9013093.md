This grant will support an investigation by a faculty member of Trinity College
of the properties of certain excited states of 21Na, 22Na, and 23Na by means of
the (3He,d) reaction on stable neon isotopes. The research will lead toward a
better understanding of the capture of protons by neon and the importance of
such reactions in the synthesis of nuclei heavier than those involved in the
C-N-O cycle in stellar burning. The (3He,d) proton transfer reaction will be
used to determine the single-particle strengths of excited states near the
proton threshold.
