This project is creating a web-based mathematical modeling forum to support the
teaching and learning of mathematical modeling on a national scale. The forum
provides a rich environment in which students and faculty can explore
applications problems in depth, learning mathematics in the context of its
contemporary use. Students are offered a wide variety of modeling problems coded
by level of difficulty and application area. In addition, students may post full
or partial solutions, pose questions, and participate in extended discussions.
Experienced faculty and practitioners from across the country contribute
problems, serve as reviewers of posted solutions, and facilitate and moderate
the online discussions.
