Henry Ford Community College is revising the curriculum of its introductory
Technical Physics course, a class required for students in career education
programs such as electrical /electronics technology, energy technology,
industrial drafting, manufacturing engineering, and robotics. With approximately
200 students enrolled in PHYS 120 each year, the College has a significant
population for its study.The revised course incorporates Workshop Physics,
technological applications, and writing across the curriculum, and in the
process is being aligned with the National Science Education Standards as
articulated in the July '93 Progress Report (NCSESA 1993). Working closely with
a steering committee comprised primarily of industry representatives, the HFCC
project team is determining current technological applications that require
physics that is included in the introductory course. Industry is also
contributing to the design of the writing component of the technical physics
course, providing samples of technical reports appropriate in the industrial
context.
