Abstract&lt;br/&gt;MCB 0315663&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biophysical studies of
membrane protein dimerization, one of the basic steps in folding and signal
transduction, are hindered by the lack of an adequate method to probe
dimerization in a model bilayer environment. In this project, the PI will
develop a new tool for probing membrane protein dimerization in a lipid bilayer.
She will measure the thermodynamics of Glycophorin A dimerization in a lipid
environment, and compare the results to previous studies in detergent systems.
The method to be developed requires the assembly of surface-attached bilayers
containing laterally mobile membrane proteins with identical orientations. The
dimerization of the fluorescently labeled proteins will be measured using
imaging resonance energy transfer. This project will yield thermodynamic
measurements of GpA dimerization in a bilayer environment. In the long term, the
method will be a new useful tool in dissecting the chemistry of interactions
within membrane proteins in hydrophobic environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 20% of all proteins in complex organisms are
membrane-associated. Despite their abundance and key roles in cell life, our
knowledge of the folding and the structure-function relationship for membrane
proteins is limited, and lags far behind that of soluble proteins. In part, this
is due to limited biophysical tools to adequately probe the physical-chemical
principles underlying membrane protein function. For instance, a method to probe
the dimerization of transmembrane helices in the native-like lipid bilayer
environment is still missing. In this project, the PI will develop such a method
by assembling surface grafted lipid bilayers that contain membrane proteins.
Dimerization will be measured using an imaging fluorescence technique. The PI
will train two graduate students and enhance the educational experience of
underrepresented minority students currently conducting research in her
laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
