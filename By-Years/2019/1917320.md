This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2019 Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Communications and Network Security Conference
(CNS 2019) to be held in Washington, DC in June 2019. The IEEE CNS Conference is
a premier venue for communications and network security researchers to present
new research results in this domain. This travel grant will enable career
development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate
students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school
education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have
the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer
security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring
relationships that will serve them well during their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage
participation in the 2019 IEEE Communications and Network Security Conference by
students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection
include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research
output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation
of women and students from other under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
