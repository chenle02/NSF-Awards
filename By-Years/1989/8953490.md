The process of designing hardware in industry is undergoing significant change
as the new technologies of rapid prototyping, based on synthesis CAD,
simulation, and quick turnaround implementation, becomes pervasive. The
undergraduate curriculum has not kept up with the rapid developments in
industry, leaving our students unprepared for the world they will face upon
graduation. This project offers a new approach to undergraduate hardware design
courses bases on rapid prototyping technologies. This involves a new kind of
modular textbook, combined with an innovative distribution of existing CAD
software and hardware platforms for use with these courses. The grantee provides
funds for this project that are about an equal match for the NSF award.
