This award supports an international workshop on applied mathematics to be held
in Washington, DC from July 8-12, 1991. The participants are several U.S.
applied mathe- maticians and six primarily from the Andean countries of South
America. This is a rare opportunity for interaction in an important area for
both U.S. and Latin American scientists. There is substantial potential for
promoting long-term cooperation that will benefit both groups. This fulfills
very well the goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
