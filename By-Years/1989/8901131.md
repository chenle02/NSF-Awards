This is an award to a new NSF principle investigator. The award is for the
study of a comprehensive data set involving incoherent scatter radars and
optical interferometers in order to investigate the changes in global
thermospheric circulation from one solstice (June) to another (December). These
changes have important implications for seasonal changes of temperature and
composition of the thermosphere. The PI has led the analysis of the campaign
activity as a Visiting Scientist at NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric
Research). This award will allow the continuation of his effort at the
University of Lowell. This study has become a show case for a new philosophy in
the iterative process of developing models and geophysical understanding hand-
in-hand. Much of the work has been driven by the TGCM (Thermosphere Global
Circulation Model) modelling effort, both in developing the model and
understanding the features in the data. This continued work will study selected
campaign intervals to verify the NCAR-TCGM model using temperature and density
data, analyze the TCGM simulations to investigate wind, temperature and density
features observed during the selected periods, and simulate the properties of
the thermosphere for a specific period. 7/11/89
