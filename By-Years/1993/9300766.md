\ P C X P# 9300766 Ivie This two year project will document the diversity,
systematics and geographic distribution of the beetles of the Virgin Islands and
will ultimately result in a specimen based electronic database and a taxon based
illustrated manual. Both products will be based on new field collections and an
inventory of existing collections in American and European museums. The
collections will include standard specimen mounts as well DNA material for
future biodiversity studies. The manual will be used by scientists, land
managers, agriculturalists, educators and conservationists. %%% The Virgin
Islands are quickly becoming urbanized, with concomitant loss of a significant
percentage of its biodiversity. This two year project will document the
diversity and geographic distribution of the beetles of the Virgin Islands. The
data will be kept in electronic database and will be published as an illustrated
manual for use by scientists, land managers, agriculturalists, educators and
conservationists. *** ` h p x (# ` h p x (#
