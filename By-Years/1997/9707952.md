Two species of African forest chimpanzees are commonly recognized, the `common`
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the pygmy chimpanzee, or bonobo (Pan paniscus).
Biologists and anthropologists have traditionally regarded Pan troglodytes as
having three distinct subspecies. However, a pilot involving field work in
Nigeria and mitochondrial DNA analysis in the laboratory, has revealed that
there may be four Pan troglodytes subspecies, and that the distribution and
relationships among these subspecies are different than what is usually
portrayed. This proposed research aims to extend the pilot study both by making
much more extensive field collections of hairs from the sleeping nests of West
African chimpanzees, and by analyzing a much wider range of mitochondrial and
nuclear genes in the laboratory. The results of the research will be compared
with information on the distribution and evolutionary relationships of other
African forest primates with the goal of reconstructing a clearer picture of the
evolutionary history of our closest relatives. The results will also be of great
relevance to conservation. Chimpanzees are becoming increasingly endangered, and
in planning for their conservation it is vital that genetically distinct
populations are given proper attention.
