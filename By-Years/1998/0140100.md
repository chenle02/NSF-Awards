This research seeks to construct the initial data for a pair of black holes in
an astrophysically realistic close binary system. This data represents the state
of the binary system at an instant of time, and is the necessary starting point
for determining the evolution of the system. Two new approaches for constructing
the initial data will be explored. Both approaches build into the data the idea
that the systems are nearly in equilibrium. However, the two approaches differ
drastically in how the black holes themselves are treated.

The collision of a pair of orbiting black holes is a dramatic event that we hope
to detect soon in gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO. Simulations,
starting from binary black hole initial data, will provide the theoretical
foundation for interpreting much of the data obtained by LIGO. The detection of
black holes with LIGO will offer the most direct evidence possible for their
existence, and will open up an exciting new window for exploring the universe.
