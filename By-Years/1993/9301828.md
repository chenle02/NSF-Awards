9301828 SWIFT Recent field studies have shown that atmospheric aerosol samples
can stimulate the growth of natural phytoplankton populations, just as iron can,
in locations that are depleted in iron but contain major nutrients at measurable
levels. Computations indicated that atmospheric sources supply a significant
amount of iron to the euphotic zone. Aerosol studies have shown that the
composition of marine aerosols (remote from continents) includes many trace
metals besides iron with biological significance, even though aerosols are not
uniform in their composition. This career advancement for women project will
undertake a pilot study examining laboratory growth of phytoplankton exposed to
aerosol as an iron or trace metal source. Unique features of this project
include: 1. the design of the growth medium and treatment of the sea water so
that it can be chemically modeled for metal speciation, and 2. the use of algal
growth (known cultures of phytoplankton) as a measure or assay of a particular
metal content. The immediate goal is to quantify an aerosol as a source of
biologically significant trace metals, particularly iron, for growth of
phytoplankton. ***
