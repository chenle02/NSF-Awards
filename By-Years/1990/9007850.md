The computational demands of modern chemical research require the proper
computing system that would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by balancing a variety of
computational capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware and
software maintenance, support personnel and training in all areas of
computational chemistry. Many new insights into kinetics of chemical reactions
can be developed through theoretical studies with use of mini- supercomputers
when the experimental data are inaccessible. In addition, the most cost-
effective computers are the mini- supercomputers. This award will allow the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin to acquire a mini-
supercomputer system. The research studies to be performed include the
following: l. Local Polymer Dynamics 2. Cation Radical Chemistry 3. Theoretical
Studies of Molecular Dynamics and Spectroscopy 4. Relaxation, Spectroscopy and
Transport in Condensed Phases 5. Prediction and Interpretation of Molecular
Spectra 6. Reaction Hypersurfaces of Photochemical Reactions
