Troy&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies the dynamical behavior of
systems&lt;br/&gt;of Wilson-Cowan type integro-differential equations that arise
in&lt;br/&gt;modelling cortex. His goal is to understand the
subtle&lt;br/&gt;connections between neurons in two-dimensional neural
sheets,&lt;br/&gt;which are responsible for (i) the formation of stable
rotating&lt;br/&gt;waves, and (ii) the existence of organizing centers that
cause&lt;br/&gt;periodic ring-shaped waves to form and propagate outward
through&lt;br/&gt;the medium. He employs computational techniques, as well
as&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic analysis and reduction methods, which allow the
models&lt;br/&gt;to simplfy to tractable forms. The mathematical and
computational&lt;br/&gt;results predict and verify the existence of stable
rotating&lt;br/&gt;spirals, and periodic ring-shaped waves recently discovered
in&lt;br/&gt;tangential slices of occipital cortex of rat brain.
The&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in this study provide a new direction
for&lt;br/&gt;understanding persistent pattern formation in general
neural&lt;br/&gt;network models.&lt;br/&gt; Neuronal networks in the central
nervous system exhibit a&lt;br/&gt;variety of persistent wave patterns. These
range from oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;waves consisting of synchronized bursts of
spikes to&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional ring-shaped waves and rotating spirals.
The&lt;br/&gt;investigator is interested in understanding how
such&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional waves form and propagate in the brain. He
uses&lt;br/&gt;simulations and mathematical methods to develop models that
aid&lt;br/&gt;in the understanding of wave formation. Cooperative
research&lt;br/&gt;between the investigator and experimental neuroscientists has
led&lt;br/&gt;to the recent discovery of spiral waves in rat cortex. This
is&lt;br/&gt;the first true verification of spiral waves in mamallian
cortex.&lt;br/&gt;Spiral waves are conjectured to be associated with the
occurence&lt;br/&gt;of seizures in the brain. The results of this project are
also&lt;br/&gt;included in the design of new interdisciplinary courses
for&lt;br/&gt;students.&lt;br/&gt;
