Abstract:

The PIs have recently developed a discriminatively trained deformable part based
model for detecting objects in images. This model achieves a two-fold
improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL
person detection challenge. Our entry in the 2007 object detection challenge won
in six classes. Modifications since the 2007 challenge have improved our results
so that we now outperform the best 2007 challenge results in ten of twenty
classes including the person class. These accomplishments rely on a newly
developed approach to discriminative training for latent variable models which
we call a latent SVM (LSVM). We propose to extend this methodology in a variety
of ways. The research will focus on deeper latent information such as
subclassification (mixture models), three dimensional pose, and figure/ground
segmentations. They will also use class hierarchies, visual words, and
hierarchical object models with parts and sub-parts. We also propose a general
methodology for using SVM training to train models, such as geometry-based 3D
models, which are highly nonlinear in model parameters. All aspects of this
research are strongly tied to empirical performance -- no method will be adopted
unless it actually improves the state of the art. The goal has been, and will
continue to be, to improve the state of the art through the use of semantically
deeper models and improved general purpose machine learning methods.
