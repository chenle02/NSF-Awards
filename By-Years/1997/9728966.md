This project is an extension of work begun at the University of Massachusetts
at Boston under the TEAMS-BC Collaborative for ExcelIence in Teacher
Preparation. Courses designed or revised under TEAMS-BC will be further
developed and integrated into the teacher preparation curriculum. New courses in
mathematics, science, and technology for prospective teachers will be developed.
Faculty involved in the project will conduct formative evaluation research on
student learning in newly developed and revised courses. Relationships with two
Professional Development Sites, one elementary school in Boston and one in
Cambridge, will be strengthened by the development of on-site courses for
student teachers and greater cooperation with the school systems.
