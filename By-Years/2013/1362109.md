The objectives of the proposed RAPID project are to deploy an array of five
moored ocean current, salinity, temperature, and two subsurface pressure sensors
across the 200-400 m deep Norske Ore Trough in the summer of 2014 from aboard
the R/V Polarstern, a German research icebreaker. The proposed array will
observe the circulation within this channel system at dynamically relevant time
and space scales. Ultimately, the recovered data will be used to test the
hypothesis that a clock-wise shelf circulation off north-east Greenland between
76N and 82N latitude provides warm Atlantic waters towards one of the last
remaining stable floating ice-shelves in Greenland (Niog-halvfjerdsfjorden
Gletscher called 79N Glacier) via a 20-40 km wide system of
troughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice
Sheets is a major contributor to global sea level rise. One cause of the
accelerating degradation of these ice sheets is believed to be the transport of
heat from the continental slope to the face of tidewater glaciers. Models and
qualitative arguments suggest that this transport is enhanced by cross-shelf
channels that minimize mixing of the transported waters with cold, ambient shelf
waters. This project is an attempt to observe the importance of such transport
mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded activities support a nascent
international collaboration. The resultant data set will add to both public and
scientific debate related to climate change. Public outreach and engagement will
be facilitated via http://IcySeas.org, a research blog established and
maintained by the PI as part of NSF?s ?Science: Becoming the Messenger? program.
