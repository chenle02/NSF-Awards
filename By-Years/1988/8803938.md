In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Adelman will study the dynamics of three elementary
processes, vibrational energy relaxation, photolytic cage escape, and activated
barrier crossing, which occur ubiquitously in liquid state chemistry. The goals
of the proposed research are four-fold: (i) To obtain an improved understanding
of the solute motions which underlie these elementary processes; (ii) To derive
analytical formulas for observables like the vibrational energy relaxation time
and the non-geminate quantum yield which transparently reflect the qualitative
nature of the solute motions; (iii) To develop practical semi-quantitative
prescriptions for choosing molecular solute friction kernels; and (iv) To
develop simplified stochastic dynamics simulation methods for simulating the
solute motions. This work should provide new fundamental understanding of liquid
state reaction dynamics. It also should provide quantitative frameworks for the
interpretation of experimental data. And lastly it should provide computational
tools whose application will lead to further increases in knowledge.
