Free space optical (FSO) communications uses highly directional laser beams
instead of radio frequencies to communicate data. FSO communication, especially
for wireless networks, can be very low cost in nature for the bandwidth
delivered. However, in spite of such obvious advantages, FSO links are rarely
used in mobile wireless networks. This award seeks to investigate the leading
cause of this phenomenon, namely the high beam alignment delay which poses a
major roadblock to the deployment of FSO in mobile networks. Several innovative
solutions will be explored in this project: the use of state of the art
programmable optical elements that can split the beam into arbitrary patterns
and help align the beams quicker, networking protocols that leverage this new
capability in order to send data faster, and a novel low cost hardware platform
that implements these techniques. Results from this work can improve the
performance of the wireless backhaul solutions which is expected to be the basis
of emerging access network architectures. As part of the proposed research,
participation of underrepresented minorities will be encouraged by involving
them in this project. The research outcomes from this project will be rolled
back into curricula through the development of a special topics course for
graduate students on free space optical communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project, programmable and tunable diffractive optical elements are
leveraged to reduce the alignment delay and increase throughput, while new
algorithms reconcile the literature on pointing, acquisition &amp; tracking
techniques with multi-hop RF-domain neighbor discovery algorithms. A novel FSO
frontend for software defined radios, capable of coherent optical communication,
will be developed to take advantage of the above enhancements. A simulator model
will be extracted from the lessons learned during the hardware design phase, and
fed back into the research community.
