The new quantum mechanics, discovered, elaborated and interpreted during the
years 1925-28, radically transformed science and philosophy of the 20th century.
Dr. Beller is continuing her study of the intellectual and psycho-social history
of the quantum revolution. This project covers two periods in the development of
new quantum physics and its philosophy: the formative stage (1925 -28), which
Dr. Beller is describing in terms of a network of dialogues; and the
consolidation stage (after 1928), which she is studying by focusing on the
rhetorical aspect of the articulation of the new quantum philosophy. Dr. Beller
has already studied many of the primary and secondary sources in the history of
quantum physics and has published a series of papers on this topic. Under a
previous grant, she devoted the academic year 1990-91 to this project. Under
this grant, she is continuing her study of the sources pertaining to the
consolidation stage of this research. Her results will be of great interest for
both history and philosophy of science.
