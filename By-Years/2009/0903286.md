The Bowling Green Community College (BGCC) of Western Kentucky University (WKU)
has formed a partnership with state agencies and trade associations to address
an anticipated shortage of Water &amp; Wastewater Operators/Technicians. The
Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI) builds on existing
linkages with the employment sector (water &amp; wastewater utilities
statewide), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations.
The project refines an industry needs-driven curriculum that utilizes on-line
course delivery to provide options for both traditional and nontraditional
students. The partnership revitalizes an existing Associates Degree program
titled "Water Utilities Management" and integrates a 4-year pathway into WKU's
Ogden College of Science and Engineering through a formal articulation
agreement.
