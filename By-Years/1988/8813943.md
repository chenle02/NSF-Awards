This research utilizes three different, but complementary, approaches to extend
the understanding of standardization processes and outcomes: theoretical
modelling, case studies, and cross-sectional data analysis. The theoretical
projects are: (1) An examination of the effect of translator devices or
"gateway" technologies on standardization. This work examines the extent to
which translators can ameliorate inefficiencies in the standardization process,
as well as whether translators might give rise to new problems. (2) An analysis
of the efficiency of the timing of de facto standardization by the "market". (3)
An investigation of conflict resolution and information sharing within voluntary
standards committees. The case studies will focus on the role of dominant firms
in standard setting, the role of committees in conflict resolution versus
coordination, and the timing of adoption. Five case studies are undertaken,
mostly drawn from the information processing industries. The econometric
projects include the measurement of benefits arising from the dramatic
standardization of railroad gauges in the U.S. in 1885, and the measurement of
network externalities for VCR's by collecting data on adoption rates in small
U.S. towns.***
