This research involves a three years study of dislocation structures developed
in the near-surface regions of alpha brass by cyclic straining. This basic
research explores the evolution of high dislocation density arrays and the
relationship of these arrays to persistent slip band formation. The role of
stacking fault energy in this process will be explored by varying the zinc
content. Bauschinger and residual stresses will be studied as a function of
plastic strain. The results of this research will allow development of a better
understanding of fatigue crack initiation.
