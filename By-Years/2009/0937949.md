Emerging high-end computing platforms, such as leadership-class machines at the
petascale, provide new horizons for complex modeling and large-scale
simulations. These machines are used to execute data intensive applications of
national interest such as climate modeling, cosmic microwave background
radiation, and astrophysical thermonuclear flashes. While these systems have
unprecedented levels of peak computational power and storage capacity, a
critical challenge concerns the design and implementation of scalable I/O
(input-output) system software (also called I/O stack) that makes it possible to
harness the power of these systems for scientific discovery and engineering
design. Unfortunately, currently, there are no available mechanisms that
accommodate I/O stack-wide, application-level QoS (quality-of-
service)specification, monitoring, and management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates a revolutionary approach to the QoS-aware management of the
I/O stack using feedback control theory, machine learning, and optimization. The
goal is to maximize I/O performance and thus improve overall performance of
large scale applications of national interest. The project uses (1) machine
learning and optimization to determine the best decomposition of application-
level QoS to sub-QoSs targeting individual resources, and (2) feedback control
theory to allocate shared resources managed by the I/O stack such that the
specified QoSs are satisfied throughout the execution. The project tests the
developed I/O stack enhancements using the workloads at NCAR, LBNL and ANL
systems. It also involves two efforts in broadening participation: CISE Visit in
Engineering Weekends (VIEW) and NASA-Aerospace Education Services Project (NASA-
AESP) at the Center for Science and the Schools (CSATS).&lt;br/&gt;
