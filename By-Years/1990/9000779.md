This REU program will help ten students develop independent, creative research
skills and produce high-quality, publishable research in key areas of chemical
engineering. The REU program will also provide research mentors and role models
who encourage the students to consider the pursuit of advanced degrees and
careers in research. The program is also designed to help develop ties between
regional chemical engineering programs to promote research and graduate school
as career options to undergraduates. The recruiting focus will be on students
who are members of groups underrepresented in engineering attending regional
schools with undergraduate-oriented programs. Students will work closely with
faculty as integral parts of their advisor' research groups on projects that are
uniquely their own. They will give regular oral progress reports to their peers,
make a formal presentation open to the public, and prepare a final report.
Weekly presentations by faculty members will expose students to a range of
career opportunities in research and several free-form brainstorming sessions
will be held to promote creativity.
