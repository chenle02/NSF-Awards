With this grant from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Thomas H. Morton of
the University of California, Riverside, will examine the gas phase chemistry of
organic cations which react via ion-dipole complexes. The neutral products from
the reactions of organic cations generated by 70eV electron impact will be
examined by using an electron bombardment flow reactor. This reactor will
provide stereochemical information about cation rearrangements which will be
critical in order to understand ion molecule reactions. Gaseous cations
generated by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization will also be examined.
Ionizations of specific conformations of molecules will be studied by slowing
down conformational changes through rapid cooling by supersonic jet expansion.
%%% The chemistry of gas phase molecules from which an electron has removed will
be examined. The neutral products from these reactions will be isolated and
identified. Several molecules which can exist in more than one rapidly
interconverting geometry will also be examined. These molecules will be cooled
to stop their interconversions and the chemistry of each geometric form of the
molecule will be examined.
