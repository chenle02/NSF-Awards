The technique of DNA-DNA hybridization can be used to measure genetic
similarity between species; DNA hybridizes more extensively among closely
related species than among distantly related species. This technique has been
used to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of some groups of animals and
plants; for example, DNA-DNA hybridization, along with other molecular
techniques, has shown that humans are very closely related to the chimp. DNA-DNA
hybridization has also been used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
birds. This research will resolve a number of technical and theoretical
questions regarding the application of DNA-DNA hybridization to the measure of
genetic distance between species, its ability to resolve relationships at low
levels in the systematic hierarchy, and the reconstruction of evolutionary
history. These questions will be addressed in context of an analysis of the
evolutionary histories of two families of birds, one containing the herons and
bitterns and the other the swallows and martins. These are both important avian
groups with puzzling evolutionary histories.
