Time is a fundamental concept in both physics and philosophy, and it is
therefore a natural subject for investigation by someone who attempts to bridge
these two disciplines. Professor Shimony, a physicist and philosopher of
science, is investigating three topics about time. The first is to lay down
criteria for the proper measurement of time intervals. This problem has been
extensively studied by the school called "Protophysics," but some of the
doctrines of this school will be criticized -- particularly that measurement
that measurement criteria should precede the formulation of dynamical laws.
Professor Shimony argues that these criteria must be formulated in tandem with
dynamic, as Newton implicitly does in the "Principia." The second investigation
concerns "becoming" or "the transient now." It is commonly maintained by
philosophers of science that the"nowness" of an event or a moment is merely
subjective, and an old argument by McTaggart to this effect is cited. Professor
Shimony will answer this argument by modifying and generalizing the classical
Kantian thesis the "existence" in not a property. The third investigation is
about the many different "arrows of time" that have been distinguished -- that
of the psychological time sense, that of the second law of thermodynamics, that
of the expanding universe, that of outgoing radiation from a source, and others.
Professor Shimony is developing a thesis that the fundamental "arrow" is that of
the actualization of quantum mechanical potentialities (of which a special case
is the outcome of measurement of an indefinite quantity). This thesis requires a
modification of the standard quantum dynamics, probably by adding a stochastic
term to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. In this way irreversibility
will be inserted into the fundamental dynamics of physics, and it will be
accomplished in a way that attributes objectivity to becoming.
