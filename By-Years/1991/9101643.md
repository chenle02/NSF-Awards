Pultrusion, though a well developed processing art, is not well understood
scientifically. Much basic study remains before the process of pultruding
composite materials can be stated to be on a firm scientific basis. Such
fundamental understanding will be required to develop high performance
structural products or products that take advantage of the wide range of
possible thermal conductivities of composite materials. These studies will
provide a first step toward understanding the pultrusion process variables as
they relate to conditions of dynamic loading or to bidirectional thermal
conductivity; and, will result in models to characterize the process and an
improved ability to design/produce a pultruded material for a given end use. By
focusing research on the effects of process variables on the thermal, dynamic,
and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) characteristics of pultruded polymeric
composite products, innovative material systems can be developed which are
important to industry in the United States.
