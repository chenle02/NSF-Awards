The retina of the eye continues to be a part of the nervous system that
provides important advances in our knowledge about information processing
mechanisms, including neuronal microcircuitry and synaptic communication,
computational studies, neural development, and how perceptual psychophysics is
related to sensory biology. This symposium concentrates on recent advances in
understanding these aspects of vision, and provides a unique opportunity for
intensive discussions among a small group. The focus is on events occuring in
the retina directly related to information processing, including information
flows in retinal networks, biophysics of synaptic communication, and
computational and modeling approaches. Participants include those with primary
interests in sensory physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, anatomy and
ultrastructure, engineering, and computational modeling. The discussions in
interdisciplinary group will have substantial impact on the future directions of
visual studies in the retina, with likely added impact on areas of artificial
vision and network analysis for information processing.
