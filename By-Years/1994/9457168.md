9457168 Wilhelm The research addresses the design, manufacture, and metrology of
sculptured surfaces. Bezier splines, introduction of the coordinate measuring
machine, and advances in design tools and maintaining systems have all spurred
the use of surface descriptions in design and manufacturing. Data from many
industries suggests that engineering practice for surface design and manufacture
is inefficient and far from robust. To address these problems, the research
program is focused on specification and control of form variations, high speed
computation of surfaces to be machined, and opportunistic metrology procedures
that use process and design knowledge for improved speed and accuracy. This
research will be incorporated into the principal investigator's teaching
activities in mechanics, precision engineering, computer-aided design, and
computational metrology.
