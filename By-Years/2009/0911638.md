The focus of this project is the laboratory synthesis of the naturally occurring
compound antascomicin B, a complex molecule with potential applications in the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The synthesis will involve novel
variations of the Ireland-Claisen and allylic diazene rearrangements. These
rearrangements enable the transfer of stereochemical information in a
predictable fashion. The ability of the rearrangements in an advanced model
system of antascomicin B has already been demonstrated in the McIntosh
laboratory, who are now in the process of applying the methodologies to the
natural product itself.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Matt McIntosh of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Arkansas. Professor McIntosh's research
efforts involve the synthesis of biomedically important natural products. The
chemistry that is developed during the course of the synthesis will aid in drug
development in the pharmaceutical industry.
