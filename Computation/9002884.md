Numerical analysis is of importance in an increasing number of areas, owing in
part to the ever - expanding role of computation in the mathematical sciences.
Many algorithms in numerical analysis use polynomials orthogonal on (a subset
of) a real interval. These algorithms include schemes for polynomial least
squares approximation, Gaussian quadrature, and the Lanczos and conjugate
gradient methods. It is planned to develop analogous algorithms that use
polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, also known as Szego polynomials.
Szego polynomials are related to approximation by trigonometric polynomials,
similarly as polynomials orthogonal on an interval are related to approximation
by (algebraic) polynomials. Szego polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation with
few terms. This makes them attractive to use in computations. They have already
been applied successfully in algorithms for computing eigenvalues of unitary
matrices, a problem that arises in certain frequency estimation methods in
signal processing.
