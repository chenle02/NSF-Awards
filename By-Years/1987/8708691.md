This research project addresses the vehicle-superstructure interaction problem
which results from a vehicle traversing a highway girder bridge. The project
will yield a better prediction and understanding of the load distribution
characteristic and the dynamic effect of traversing vehicles on girder bridges.
This insight is to be obtained through application of a developed analytical
methodology and extensive comparison to existing field data, resulting in
formulation of design recommendations. This investigation is necessitated by the
uncertainties associated with current design practices which have been shown to
be either overly conservative or unsafe under general traversing vehicular
loading. The analytical methodology considers the vehicle-superstructure
interaction problem based upon either a moving-mass, moving-force, or static
live load formulation. The kinematic coupling, due to the velocity of the
traversing vehicle, is described within and is included in the moving-mass
formulation. The analytical methodology is based upon the finite element method,
and the necessary algorithms for each formulation are derived. The direct
integration solution approach is employed, allowing for future expansion into
nonlinear behavior and inclusion of substructure interaction.
