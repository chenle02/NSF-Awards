The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory's (SREL) REU program provides scientific
training and hands-on experience in research by actively involving
undergraduates, especially those from under-represented groups, in projects with
full time research scientists. Participants examine the influence of nuclear and
fossil fuel energy production and associated technologies on biological
properties of southeastern ecosystems. SREL is located on the US Department of
Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), where a variety of habitats including pine
and hardwood forests, abandoned farmlands, and freshwater streams and wetlands
adjoin industrial facilities and anthropogenically-disturbed areas. The REU
program seeks diversity and actively recruits minority applicants. Students
accepted into the program are paired with faculty members with compatible
interests, and perform independent research projects that interface with ongoing
research at SREL. Faculty research areas are diverse, spanning scales from
molecular to landscape, and involving plants, animals, and microbes as well as
environmental chemistry, statistics and environmental remediation. Students
participate in a series of workshops on research design, ethics, data collection
and processing, and oral and written presentation of results. Students also
participate in brown bag seminar-discussion groups and field trips to
representative field sites. At the conclusion of the program, each student
presents a brief seminar on their project before their peers and SREL faculty
and staff, and prepares a scientific manuscript based on their research. Credit
(3 hrs) for the research experience is available through the University of
Georgia. For more information, students are encouraged to contact jagoe@srel.edu
