AST 0205978&lt;br/&gt;Croft&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stars such as the Sun lie in
galaxies that are collections of billions of stars, separated from other
galaxies by vast distances. These galaxies can take many forms, from flat,
spinning disks like our own Milky Way, to giant nearly spherical galaxies that
lie at the center of galaxy clusters. We would like to know how these shapes
arise, and where the spins came from. We know that galaxies probably formed from
the gravitational collapse of clouds of gas in the early Universe. In principle,
the patterns of galaxy shapes and spins that we see nowadays has preserved
information about what happened at the very beginning. Enormous new surveys of
millions of galaxies that are being carried out today will enable us to measure
these patterns very precisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use
computer models of galaxy formation to explore how the conditions at these very
early times dictated what we see in the Universe around us today. In particular,
it seeks to investigate how galaxies form, how they get their shapes and why
they spin. It will also examine whether these calculations show correlations
between the shapes and spins of neighboring galaxies. The possibility that
galaxy shapes and spins are correlated has important implications for other
projects that try to measure the bending of light by the gravitational fields of
these galaxies (known as gravitational lensing). &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
