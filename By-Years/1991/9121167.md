ABSTRACT The investigators will carry out research on the locality conditions
applying to bound anaphora. The primary, though not the sole, focus of the study
will be on contrasting properties of long-distance and local reflexives across
languages by examining the characteristics of reflexives in a wide variety of
languages. In addition to locality conditions, the study will investigate such
related topics as the putative "subject-orientation" of long-distance bound
anaphora. While the investigators will conduct the study within the framework of
Government and Binding Theory, the major emphasis of the study will be empirical
in nature: the determination of the range of facts related to reflexives
crosslinguistically. The initial hypothesis is that despite appearances,
reflexives obey the same locality conditions in all languages: Apparent long
distance reflexives involve local successive cyclic movements. The investigators
will test the empirical adequacy of this proposal and compare its empirical
consequences with other current proposals such as feature percolation and the
expansion of governing categories.
