The rivers flowing into the Black Sea from the territory of the Soviet Union
were sampled on a very successful expedition in the Summer of 1990. It is
proposed to continue and develop this collaboration with Soviet scientists by
extending this work to the rivers of the East. Our Soviet colleagues have
proposed that the headwaters of the two affluents of the Aral Sea, Amu Darya and
Syr Darya, be sampled in the Spring of 1991, that work on the Upper Lena begin
in the Summer of 1991 and that the Lower Lena and Indigirka be studied in 1992.
These studies will provide valuable information on the weathering yield from the
rivers of the Soviet Union thereby greatly strengthening the data base for
global mass balance studies. The rivers of the East drain a unique unglaciated
sub-Arctic environment. This will allow a comparative study of weathering
processes with the well known Tropical rivers of South America which drain
similar rock types. This project will also provide base line information on the
region most likely to be first impacted by any greenhouse warming.
