Scorpions have appendages on their ventral surfaces, called pectines. Dr.
Brownell has discovered that these serve as detectors of chemicals in or on the
sand over which the animals walk. In particular, they are able to detect
pheromones and therefore to locate prospective mates and to navigate to their
home burrows. In this project Dr. Brownell will undertake what will eventually
become a major study of the structure, function and biochemical properties of
the pectines. He has already found that the nerves from the pectines travel to
the animal's central nervous system with a high degree of spatial organization
and that this differs considerably for the two sexes. He will continue to
analyze the anatomy of this sensory system and to attempt to experimentally
determine its role in the animal's navigation. Dr. Brownell has also discovered
a family of low molecular weight proteins in the pectines. These are in a very
rapid state of turnover and differ among scorpion species. These facts suggest
that they are involved in the pheromone sensing system of the pectines. Dr.
Brownell will continue his studies of proteins in the sensory part of the
pectines in an attempt to obtain further evidence of their functional
properties. Finally, he will attempt to isolate and identify the pheromones of
various scorpion species. This is stpotentially a very important project that
essentially explores a novel chemical sensing system for the first time.
