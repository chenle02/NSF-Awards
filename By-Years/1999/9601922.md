*** 9601922 Zhang This grant will provide partial support for a high-power all
solid-state laser system for research in the Physics Department of Georgia
Southern University. This system will be tunable from the ultraviolet to the
mid-infrared, will have high power (10 GW), and will be ultrafast (200 fsec).
The system will be used in the on-going research programs of the Department,
including a study of the response of atoms to ultrafast laser fields, and a
study of laser induced transparency in a gaseous medium. ***
