There is a National need to develop better-trained and educated physics and
science teachers. The PhysTEC project is an effort of the APS, AIP, and AAPT, to
improve teacher preparation within physics departments at a set of selected
Primary Program Institutions (PPIs). The project PI's will work with six PPIs to
produce a change in the way courses for pre-service teachers are taught at the
university level and, by leveraging the clout and influence of professional
associations, bridges will be built between physics and education departments on
these campuses and eventually across the country. The efforts of this proposal
are an important opportunity to make significant changes in the way teacher are
taught and encouraged to continue with science education. The proposal will
involve both content-people and methods-people in cooperatively attacking
problems encountered in the various institutions and would give attention to
what has often been overlooked in science education. The proposal will deal with
structuring the training of prospective teachers in ways that integrate content
knowledge and pedagogy. Also important are the mechanisms by which science
faculty and school of education faculty can collaborate toward educating,
encouraging and mentoring prospective science teachers for the
future.&lt;br/&gt;
