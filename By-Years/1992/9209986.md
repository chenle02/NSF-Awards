ABSTRACT The impressions we form of other people affect our interactions with
them. Previous research has suggested that people strive to form impressions of
others that are uniform and consistent. It seems that our impressions of others
tend to be black or white, and gray areas make us so uncomfortable that we work
hard to reinterpret or ignore information that is contrary to our monochrome
perception. However, when people rate the decriptiveness of traits for
themselves and other, they make inconsistent trait attributions. The goal of
this research is to understand the paradox that coherent impressions of
personality nonetheless contain inconsistencies. These studies will establish
how the use of different kinds of inconsistent traits is affected by familiarity
and liking for the target, and by the domain of personality being described.
Inconsistencies in self- descriptions will be compared with inconsistencies in
descriptions of others. A series of principles of coherent impression formation
will be tested for how perceivers retain inconsistent beliefs in coherent
impressions of targets' personalities, including their own. The research will
contribute to knowledge about impression formation, test basic theories of how
social concepts are combined and examine differences between personality
descriptions of the self and others. The research will result in a theory of
impression formation that reflects the complex reality of the way we perceive
ourselves and other people. This has implications for the effectiveness of
interactions in the workplace, at school, and at home.
