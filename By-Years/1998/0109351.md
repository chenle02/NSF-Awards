This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
improved wafer contamination analysis in the microelectronics industry. Phase I
will examine a new technique called focused beam total reflection x-ray
fluorescence (TXRF). Based on point-focusing toroidal crystal optics, focused
beam TXRF is expected to improve spatial resolution by a factor more than 100
and provide 30 times better detection sensitivity for local contaminants on
silicon (Si) than the conventional TXRF method. This technique also has
potential for low level aluminum (Al), sodium (Na), and other low atomic-number
(Z) elements that not performed effectively by conventional TXRF and other
techniques. Phase I will demonstrate improved sensitivity and resolution for
transition metal detection. Theoretical calculations will be also carried out to
determine the feasibility for Al and Na detection in wafer contamination
control.

Focused beam TXRF analysis has commercial applications in the microelectronics
industry for wafer contamination control, including localized and homogeneous
contaminants with high resolution. These contaminants include many important
elements, such as transition metals, Al, Na and other low Z elements.
