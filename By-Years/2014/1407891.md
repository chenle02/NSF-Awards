Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is
expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home
institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The
award to Howard University has potential impact in the areas of nanomedicine and
bio-detection. The research has broader societal impacts by generating a new
line of self-assembled drug-delivery vehicles for transporting labile molecules
into cells, and by enhancing the research experience and training of four
undergraduate students for pursuing a career in the sciences or entry into
graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand
the mechanism of nanoshells formation by focusing on how mannobiosylation alters
the polymer physics of the linear polyethylenimine backbone and therefore its
interaction with DNA, and alters the packing interaction between condensed DNA.
The three specific objectives are to 1) determine the effect of mannobiose on
the interaction state of polyethylenimine in three biophysical regimes; 2)
measure the self-adhesive and self-clustering interactions in mannobiose layers;
and 3) measure the interactions between the intermediates of nanoshell assembly.
The study uses an innovative approach that combines polymer phase maps, multi-
parameter pH titrations, dynamic light scattering and atomic force spectroscopy.
Preliminary data demonstrate that the approach is feasible.
