Under a Research Initiation Award, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be
carried out for compressible viscous flows. The accuracy and efficiency of a
pseudospectral method utilizing an adaptive algorithm will be tested with the
one- and two- dimensional Navier Stokes equation. In two dimensions, the flow
will be that over a rearward step with flow separation. The flow will be
supersonic. The research will enhance the computational predictability, and
physical understanding, of very high speed flows with friction over and through
engineering systems.
