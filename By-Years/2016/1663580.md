The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the versatile
nature of the diagnostic device created to be used in many industries ranging
from public health, veterinary medicine, food processing, and water testing. The
hand held diagnostic device can be used as a point-of-care detection system in
the case of an endemic disease outbreak. Ease of usage and visual color change
will help in quick diagnosis as well as prophylactic care. It may also be
possible that this will improve detection, treatment and eradication of the
target molecule such as in the case of a microbe or toxin leading to quicker
patient recovery.

This I-Corps project was based on the concept of using spectrum-shifting ability
of gold nanoparticles as detection molecules on a passive paper flow assay. Wax
printing technology is used to print channels on filter paper in which an area
is treated with lectins, which clump the cellular component of blood and only
let plasma flow. The plasma contains the target molecule for which an anti-
target molecule protein is adhered onto gold nanoparticles coated at the end of
the wax channels. By the concept of a target/anti-target molecule response, the
adhered gold nanoparticles attach onto the target molecules and form complexes.
This aggregation of causes a shift in the light spectrum leading to a visual
color change. Based on the chosen target molecule, gold nanoparticles could be
adhered with different types of protein molecules giving an endless possibility
the device used for the detection of different target molecules in various
industries.
