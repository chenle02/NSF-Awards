Geometry has been viewed by many mathematics educators as a natural context in
which to introduce students to higher-order mathematical thinking. Results of
the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the
technical basis for a new educational software tool, The Geometer's Sketchpad,
that has as its purpose the provision of a visual environment with dynamic
constructions, allowing students to investigate geometric shapes and
relationships in ways that have heretofore not been possible. The research
objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1) development and testing of
prototype classroom materials; (2) development and testing of prototype
software; (3) assessment of attitudes and achievement among various student
populations using The Geometer's Sketchpad; and (5) making The Geometer's
Sketchpad accessible to the broadest range of students. The project will provide
software for applications that include enhanced versions of the software,
versions for other hardware platforms, foreign language versions, and books and
collections of sketches/scripts for secondary, elementary, and university
audiences.
