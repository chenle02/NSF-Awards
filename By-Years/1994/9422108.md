9422108 Shaw Defects on the surface of a number of extruded polymer melts,
thought to be caused by the rheology of the melt as it solidifies, are often
identified by the descriptive term "sharkskin" defects. Empirically, it is known
that this surface defect can be eliminated at lower extrusion rates, because
this reduces the stresses that are assumed to be the cause of sharkskinning.
These investigators propose an analytical and experimental program to identify
and understand the mechanisms to control sharkskin formation. With this
understanding, they should be able to eliminate sharkskin or design a specific
sharkskin surface texture. Along with a number of analytical tests, they will
use a light scattering device in an extrusion die to measure the rheological
properties of the extruded polymer experimentally. This, along with a modeling
and computional program will determine the mechanics of the flow, incorporating
various rheological models, to predict pressure and output fluctuations that can
be correlated with the development of sharkskin. The impact of this research
will be a better understanding of sharkskinning, a phenomenon that today is
unpredictable, and its elimination usually requires lower extrusion speeds and
reduced productivity. ***
