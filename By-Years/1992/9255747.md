This project, sponsored by the American Psychological Association in
cooperation with the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, will hold a
conference which will examine current research in psychology, science education
and mathematics education and discuss how it can be applied to improve learning
and teaching of science and mathematics in grades K-12. The findings and
recommendations of the conference will be disseminated to teachers and
researchers and will help bridge the gap between research and its application in
the classroom.
