During the last few years, the PI has focused his research on the local theory
of operator spaces and the applications of operator spaces to abstract harmonic
analysis and locally compact quantum groups. In this proposal, he plans to
continue his research in these directions and he proposes the following research
projects. (1) Investigate some local properties of operator spaces. (2)
Investigate some problems on locally compact quantum groups. (3) Investigate
some problems related to Kadison-Singer problem and the q-deformation factors
introduced by Bozejko and Speicher.

The theory of operator space theory is a recently developed new research area
in modern analysis. The PI, together with some other mathematicians, has made
significant contributions to this area. The projects proposed in this proposal
contain some important questions in operator spaces, and their applications to
operator algebras, abstract harmonic analysis, and locally compact quantum
groups. The progress on these problems will have significant impact to these
areas. It will also have important impact to some other related areas such as
quantum information theory, noncommutative geometry, and geometric group theory.
Projects in this proposal also provide excellent resources and research problems
for PI's Ph.D students. The PI will continue to organize learning seminars on
recent research progress at the University of Illinois. This will encourage and
attract his students to get involved in these research projects.The PI will also
continue to organize Wabash Seminar and Miniconference, which has provided a
very unique opportunity for his students, postdocs, and visitors to regularly
meet and exchange ideas with some leading experts in the fields.
