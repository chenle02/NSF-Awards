9350730 Choi The project will acquire a modern, microprocessor-controlled oxygen
bomb calorimeter. The new instrument will be used to incorporate experimental
thermochemistry into the undergraduate curriculum for both non-major and
chemistry/biochemistry major courses. A particularly interesting application is
the determination of caloric content of food in the laboratory of a freshman
seminar in food chemistry. Experimental determination of resonance energy in
aromatic compounds and strain energy of three-membered ring compounds will be
added to a junior-level majors' laboratory. The new calorimeter will allow more
comprehensive coverage of thermochemistry in the undergraduate curriculum and
significantly upgrade the materials science capability. ***
