This SBIR Phase I project will substantiate the merits of using specific
organisms to convert microalgae into biofuel. Specifically, it will utilize a
naturally occurring and highly efficient organism, zooplankton, for the
conversion. The project plans to measure the microalgae conversion efficiency of
the organisms and test a bench scale model of an oil recovery system. The goal
is to convert oil contained within the algae biomass with extractable
zooplankton with more than 75% output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be to substantially
improve the biofuel output capability and will provide a very important step
toward energy independence from fossil fuels.&lt;br/&gt;
