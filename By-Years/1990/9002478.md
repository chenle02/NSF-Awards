This proposal is to make helium measurements on the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the central Pacific on longitude 150 west. The
helium data are useful as tracers of the deep ocean circulation, particularly in
regions near the east Pacific rise from which elemental helium is known to
emanate. These measurements, along with hydrographic and other tracer
measurements will form the basis for ocean circulation descriptions and models
which are the principal objectives of WOCE.
