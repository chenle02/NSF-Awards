The warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) is thought to be a reservoir of a large
fraction of the ordinary matter in the universe. Observations of the WHIM in the
far ultraviolet and x-ray bands of the spectrum can reveal highly ionized atoms
using absorption spectroscopy. However, these observations reveal fewer atoms
than are theoretically predicted. The conference "WHIM and Cluster Outskirts:
Lost and Found Baryons in the Local Universe" will bring together theorists and
observers to better understand the discrepancy between observation and theory.
Funds for this project will support travel, lodging, and registration expenses
for 20 graduate students and early-career scientists so that they can attend
this international conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WHIM conference will
bring together 80 researchers from observation, theory, and instrumentation to
better understand current observations and to plan and develop future X-ray and
FUV instruments and missions. The conference will also develop strategies for
taking advantage of multiwavelength observations and improved X-ray spectroscopy
capabilities to perform more complete surveys of highly ionized oxygen. The
project will support the participation of graduate students and early-career
scientists at this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
