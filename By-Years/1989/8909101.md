This project deals with the process of high energy beam welding. The first
objective is to develop a realistic mathematical model which includes all of the
important physics -- keyholing, nonequilibrium vaporization and subsequent vapor
expansion, convection within the liquid region, and conduction within the solid
region. The second objective is to develop a more efficient numerical scheme for
computation. To achieve this objective, a modular approach will be employed.
Different methods best suited for each specific region are to be used. Within
the solid region the boundary element method will be used to solve for the heat
transfer. Boundary layer theory will be applied to model the convection within
the melt region. The nonequilibrium vaporization will be modeled with a Mott-
Smith type solution. The subsequent vapor expansion will be modeled by a one-
dimensional gas dynamic equation. These different regions are to be combined
together by matching boundary conditions along the solid- liquid and liquid-
vapor interfaces. The matching of boundary conditions along the solid-liquid
interface determines its shape, hence the shape of the molten region. The
matching of boundary conditions along the liquid-vapor interface determines the
keyhole shape. It is expected that this technique will be computationally
efficient and will provide more realistic predictions of the weld penetration,
the molten shape, the cooling rate and the heat affected zone. Experiments will
be performed to verify the mathematical model.
