This effort deals with the use of concepts borrowed form recent developments in
modelling of brain function. By issuing circuit elements with specified
characteristics and interconnecting them in a dense manner (many elements - many
interconnections among them) one is able to perform calculations in a parallel
manner; such calculations being distributed throughout the interconnected
elements. The properties of such circuits make them advantageous for such
functions as pattern and motion recognition, generalization, and generally many
calculational efforts which are difficult with conventional computers. Although
the model can best be a primitive and crude representation of the complexities
of biological neural systems, the concepts and approaches which have resulted
from it have stimulated new and different approaches to many engineering
problems.
