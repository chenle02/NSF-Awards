The Engineering Department of Swarthmore College will create a laboratory
facility to introduce workstation and computer graphics as integral parts of the
engineering curriculum. This state-of-the-art graphics environment will support
upper level courses in the fields of Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Computer
Engineering. Apollo workstations will be used with integrated graphics
capability. This experience at the undergraduate level will help the students
understand how engineering is done in practice.
