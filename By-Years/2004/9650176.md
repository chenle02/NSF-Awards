The Astronomy Department offers two undergraduate laboratory courses, optical
and radio astronomy, intended for astronomy majors and prospective astronomy
majors and physics, engineering, and geophysics majors. The curricula are
rigorous, but less structured than traditional lab courses, requiring extra
effort and commitment from the professor and resulting in very close contact
between teacher and student. This environment is stimulating to the students and
encourages more students to pursue a science major. The department is adding a
third laboratory course, in infrared astronomy, and is expanding and improving
its facilities to accommodate more students.
