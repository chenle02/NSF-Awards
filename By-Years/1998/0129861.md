This project studies how labor market institutions affect labor market outcomes
such as the level of unemployment, the duration of unemployment spells and
wages. The divergence of European and American labor market experiences over the
last twenty-five years in the presence of sharply different labor market
institutions has motivated many earlier studies on this topic. This research
finds that previous studies have overlooked a key channel through which labor
market institutions affect labor market outcomes. In particular, this research
finds that the uncertainty inherent in the hiring process is key to
understanding how labor market institutions such as employment protection and
wage compression affect outcomes. This finding also allows us to understand the
differential evolution of European and American labor markets over the last
twenty-five years. As the role of manufacturing began to diminish resources were
shifted into new activities. Job creation in these new activities involved much
more uncertainty than job creation using the established technologies that were
embedded in activity in the manufacturing sector. As a result it is during this
period that the European style labor market institutions started to have a large
effect on the performance of European labor markets relative to the United
States.
