In 2015 and 2016, the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil and the Americas prompted
the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency. Zika virus
is predominantly transmitted by mosquitos, including urban dwelling species
whose range extends far into North America. Understanding why certain areas
within a city have high virus transmission, aka "hot spots", as well as
identifying effective methods to reduce this virus transmission is a high
priority for the security and well being of people of the United States. This
study utilizes highly detailed surveillance data from Mexico and Brazil to
understand how Zika virus hot-spots compare to that of dengue and chikungunya
viruses, two similar mosquito-borne viruses. Results from this project will be
relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in
place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and
widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.

In partnership with Ministries of Health from Mexico and Brazil, this
multidisciplinary research team will leverage geographically linked
epidemiological and entomological datasets to construct and validate a spatially
explicit agent based model. While Zika virus has not yet impacted communities in
Acapulco or Merida, the two model cities in Mexico, current predictions
anticipate its arrival in the summer of 2016. The constructed model will not
only characterize areas of high transmission, but it will be used to compare the
impacts of various spatially targeted intervention strategies on viral
transmission. The project outcomes will provide specific information on the
likelihood of Zika virus establishment, the epidemic size of Zika in these
modeled areas, as well as how each intervention will reduce the transmission
potential of Zika. The proposed work will not only benefit the three model
cities in Mexico and Brazil, but it will provide generalizable information on
risk factors for urban hot spots, and predictive information vector control best
practices for combating Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses.
