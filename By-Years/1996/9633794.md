OCE 96-33794 Melville The project will investigate the initial development of
coherent structures in the surface boundary layer, known as Langmuir Circulation
(LC), through a series of laboratory experiments. Theories suggest that LC is
generated by the interaction of surface wave Stokes drift with sheared flow in
the boundary layer. However, no detailed examination of the LC instability
theory has been made under controlled conditions. At issue is whether the
presently accepted theory can be proven correct in a laboratory setting, and
whether it is relevant to oceanic conditions. Successful completion of this
project would resolve the first issue and frame appropriate questions for
investigation of the second.
