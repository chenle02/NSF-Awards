0131264&lt;br/&gt;Michael P. Matise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the greatest
challenges to modern biology is to understand how complex, multi-cellular
organisms such as humans develop from a single cell, the fertilized egg. This
single egg, the zygote, has virtually unlimited potential to generate all the
millions of different cell types that are found in an adult mammal. However,
during development, the potential of cells becomes increasingly restricted as
cell division and growth differentiate cells from one another in the adult
organism. One important mechanism that appears to distinguish cells from one
another during embryonic development involves secreted signalling molecules that
provide spatial information which is critical for establishing their position
and hence their specific function or fate in the mature organism. One such
signalling molecule is known as Sonic Hedgehog. Sonic Hedgehog activates a
cascade of responses in cells that receive this signal. A family of genes that
have a central role in interpreting Sonic Hedgehog-supplied positional
information are known as Gli genes. Studies in the fruitfly have provided
important insights into the mechanisms by which Gli family proteins transduce
the Sonic Hedgehog signal. In addition, mutations in Sonic Hedgehog and
downstream genes, including Gli, have recently been implicated in
cancers.&lt;br/&gt; This proposal seeks to utilize mouse genetics in order to
explore the function of Gli genes in the development of the central nervous
system. Some of the experiments proposed are designed to test whether aspects of
the model for the role of Gli proteins in Sonic Hedgehog signalling developed in
fruitflies are applicable to mammals. By addressing basic issues relating to the
regulation of this pathway, a greater understanding of the development of the
central nervous system will be gained. These insights will also provide valuable
insights to our understanding of the mechanisms of cancers that involve Sonic
Hedgehog and Gli gene abnormalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
