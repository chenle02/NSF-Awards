The transport properties of the lower mantle, such as the electrical
conductivity, thermal&lt;br/&gt;conductivity and viscosity are important to the
understanding of mantle dynamics and thermal evolution of the mantle. An
international workshop is scheduled to take place in northeastern Japan for 3
days between October 21 and 24. Agenda for the three days have speakers from the
areas of experimental and theoretical mineral physics, observation
electromagnetism, seismology, and mantle viscosity. The organizers are
Kei&lt;br/&gt;Hirose from Titech, Japan David A. Yuen from University of
Minnesota and David Rubie from Bayreuth Geoscience Institut, Germany. They
anticipate attendance of around 50 to 55 scientists from around the world.
Japanese funding for this event is substantial, around $36,000. Funds will cover
the airfare of 5 to 6 junior scientists from American institutions. Findings of
this workshop will be disseminated in a special issue of Physics of the Earth
and Planetary Interior and put the abstracts on a website at the Minnesota
Supercomputer Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
