9308238 Admati Much controversy surrounds the division between ownership and
management of large corporations. Diversified ownership confers benefits from
spreading risk, but it can dull owners' incentives to monitor managers.
Shareholders who control a significant fraction of the shares of a firm have
stronger incentives to monitor and control its managers; indeed, it has been
claimed that the greater concentration of ownership found in Japan and Germany
has resulted in more effective control of managers, lower costs of capital, and
(thus) greater levels of investment and efficiency than in the U.S. The authors
will investigate how ownership patterns and the resulting patterns of monitoring
management are determined as an equilibrium, and how they affect the cost of
capital, investment, and corporate performance. Research will study both mature,
publicly held firms whose shares are traded in well functioning markets, and
privately held firms, where the "large shareholders" are venture capitalists.
The methods employed will be primarily theoretical in nature, based on economic
models of capital markets and self-interested behavior. This research should
lead to better understanding of the efficiency of capital markets and how they
interact with the productive sector, leading to better-informed regulatory
prescriptions. ***
