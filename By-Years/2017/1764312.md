The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be that a
novel clinical schedule optimization technology developed based on a prior NSF
funded research project can be used to reduce staffing costs in health systems.
The technology will also help improve patient safety. Results from prior
analysis suggest that significant joint operational and safety costs savings are
possible using the system. Since staffing costs, specifically clinical workforce
costs, constitute a significant portion of healthcare costs, a large impact on
overall health care costs can result from successful implementation of the
schedule optimization technology. Additional safety benefits will offer
potential further savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project with help
explore the processes used in making staffing and scheduling decisions for the
clinical staff, and how the developed clinical schedule optimization technology
can potentially be leveraged to improve these decisions in real operational
settings. The findings from this exploration will help the investigator team to
understand the market readiness for this technology, and the viability of
potential products and services to help improve hospital systems. This will
inform the technology's further development by determining the target market and
understanding of current staffing products and solutions.
