&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Baum and Ms. Stacey Smith at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison to investigate the role of habitat
transitions and pollination systems in the diversification of flower form and
color in Iochrominae, a group of 27 Andean species in the potato family,
Solanaceae. Specifically, the research will examine the hypothesis that
transitions to high-elevation environments are correlated with shifts to
hummingbird pollination and the evolution of colorful, tubular flowers.
Iochrominae occur at wide range of elevations, and they display a great
diversity of floral morphologies and pollination systems, making them an ideal
group in which to investigate this hypothesis. The study will be divided into
three parts: reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Iochrominae, field
studies of pollination, and biochemical analysis of floral pigmentation.
Together, these components will make it possible to assess the extent to which
elevational transitions are correlated with shifts in pollination systems and
floral evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering that topographical variation
combined with plant-animal coevolution are thought to be responsible for the
immense floristic diversity of the Neotropics, Iochrominae may serve as a case
study of the process of adaptive radiation and diversification that has taken
place in multitudes of neotropical lineages of flowering plants. Furthermore,
this project will foster collaboration between North American and Latin American
botanical institutions in trying to document and understand the floristic
diversity of the Andes and the processes that have given rise to it.&lt;br/&gt;
