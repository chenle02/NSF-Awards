This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to
demonstrate a unique and affordable method to nanotexture the surfaces of metal
platform drug-eluting stents (DES) using ultrafast laser surface modification.
This technology is relatively inexpensive and capable of integrating with laser
micromachining that is widely used for the fabrication of DES, thus have
advantages over the existing techniques such as self-assembly, imprint
lithography, electron beam etc. Laser-nanotextured DES will be evaluated for
biocompatibility, absorption, time release and safety profile by in-vitro tests.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a
cost-effective method to nanotexture DES via laser surface modification, which
may improve the drug delivery, prevent thrombosis and enhance the safety
profile. Although DES has profoundly affected the field of interventional
cardiology by dramatically reducing the problem of in-stent restenosis
associated with bare metal stent, the adverse long term stent thrombosis raises
the question on the safety profile of DES. Laser nanotexturing will add
substantial value to stent manufacturing by preventing thrombosis and helping in
storage and supply of drugs continuously for a long term.
