9634131 Robbins This is a renewal grant from a theorist who was awarded a
Creativity Extension during the last funding period. He was also awarded a
supplement through the Computational Approaches to Real Materials program. This
research will focus on the dissipation in spreading, friction, lubrication and
adhesion. All of these processes are of great technological importance and each
allows basic scientific issues to be addressed on well-defined model systems
that can be experimentally realized. Numerical simulations will be used to
provide detailed microscopic information about the dynamics in each system.
These will be used to develop analytic theories and to explain and motivate
experimental studies. %%% This is a renewal grant from a theorist who was
