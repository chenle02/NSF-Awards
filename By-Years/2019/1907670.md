Group Theory is essentially the theory of symmetry for mathematical and physical
systems, which underpins much of modern pure mathematics, with major connections
to physics, chemistry, and information science. Especially after the completion
of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups (CFSG), important and deep
connections to areas as varied as topology, algebraic geometry, Lie theory,
homological algebra, and mathematical physics, have been discovered and
exploited. Still, the area abounds with basic problems and long-standing
conjectures. Recent breakthroughs hold out the prospect of finally solving some
venerable open problems. In turn, recent results in group- and representation
theory have led to substantial progress in a vast number of applications in Lie
theory, number theory, algebraic geometry,combinatorics and semigroup
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this wealth of new results and directions will
be the main theme of the 2020 six-month program "Groups, Representations and
Applications: New Perspectives", Jan. 6 - June 30, 2020, at the Isaac Newton
Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INI, Cambridge, UK), which features five
one-week workshops. The goal of this program is to bring together the leading
experts in group and representation theory, on the one hand, and from several
key other parts of mathematics on the other, to tackle some of the main problems
and to take the many connections between CFSG and other areas of mathematics to
the next level. Detailed information is given at the program's website
http://www.newton.ac.uk/event/gra. Funding provided by the grant will support
US-based participants of the five one-week workshops within the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
