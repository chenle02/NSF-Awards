The Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations
(SEARCDE) has met annually since 1981. It was initiated by members of the
Department of Mathematics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University and has since then rotated among various research institutions in the
Southeast. This year, the 33rd SEARCDE conference will be held at the University
of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), September 21 and 22, 2013. Continuing SEARCDE's
tradition, the conference is a forum to discuss, exchange recent advances in
both theoretical and applied areas of differential equations. Besides four
invited plenary talks, there will be many contributed talks with a wide range of
topics organized in parallel sessions. Young researchers are encouraged to give
talks, will receive helpful feedback, and can benefit from interactions with a
diverse group of plenary lecturers. The invited plenary lectures will broaden
the participants' knowledge about current researchand techniques in differential
equations and its applications. Many contributed talks and the networking
opportunities will contribute to the exchange of research ideas and the
formation of new collaborations. Information about the conference can be found
at the meeting website. http://www.math.utk.edu/SEARCDE2013.

The principal objective of SEARCDE conference is to promote research and
education in the field of differential equations by bringing together
established and beginning researchers, including advanced undergraduate and
graduates students as well as recent PhD's. The meeting provides a platform to
exchange ideas and to discuss recent developments in the field, both in applied
and theoretical differential equations. SEARCDE particularly encourages the
participation of beginning researchers, for whom the opportunities offered by
regional conferences are important, especially those from traditionally under-
represented groups. Indeed, it is often the case that a researcher in the field
will have presented her research findings for the first time at a meeting like
SEARCDE. NSF funding will ensure that many talented young researchers will have
the opportunity to participate in SEARCDE 2013.
