This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. It will measure radiative fluxes and
complementary meteorological data, ice type, melt pond coverage, ice
concentration, and snow structure. These data would provide a unique data set
that would resolve long standing disputes about the effects of melt pond cover
and other summer season phenomena on radiative fluxes. These studies of the
surface energy budget, atmospheric radiation and sea ice conditions will
contribute to areas of research recognized as high priority within Arctic Ocean-
Atmosphere-ice Interactions component of Arctic System Sciences (ARCSS).
