Polymers composed of molecular segments that can distort when irradiated with
light offer a framework for directly converting light into mechanical work. Such
materials can be used to engineer new classes of mechanical actuators that are
triggered and controlled exclusively with light. One of the more promising
light-responsive polymers being studied can generate significant forces upon
irradiation with light but is plagued by slow actuation speeds. This award will
support fundamental research into the effect of the molecular structure on the
photomechanical properties for liquid crystalline copolymers. The insights that
emerge can spawn a new class of polymers that could be deployed in systems over
a range of length scales where contactless actuation could be enabled such as
"soft machines", integrated optomechanical devices, optically-driven
microfluidics and microrobots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the
hypothesis that in azobenzene-functionalized liquid crystal polymers (ALCP),
controlling the structure of the flexible spacer in mesogenic azobenzene-
functionalized crosslinkers can modulate photomechanical actuation and help
realize step-changes in actuation rates, work densities and photomechanical
stresses. To study this, acrylate-based crosslinking mesogens with azobenzene-
group in the rigid core and flexible spacers of various chain lengths will be
synthesized. Using these, a range of liquid crystal polymer films will be
created, their photomechanical actuation will be measured and their utility in
actuators will be examined. During these studies, the physical underpinnings of
inducing/erasing photomechanical strains as a function of intensity and
polarization of actinic light will be examined. Ultimately, customized nematic
directors will be engineered to enable new actuation modes and set the
foundation for novel photomechanical machine elements.
