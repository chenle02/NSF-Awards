In this project, the PI's will continue analysis and synthesis of data they
obtained, in cooperation with a number of other PI's, during the SYNoptic Ocean
Prediction (SYNOP) experiment in the Gulf Stream system east of Cape Hatteras
from late 1987 to mid- 1990. Principal focus in this study will be on data from
the Central Array near 68|W. Issues to be addressed include Gulf Stream
structure and kinematics, deep cyclogenesis, coherent eddies, and propagation of
fluctuation energy down-stream past Cape Hatteras.
