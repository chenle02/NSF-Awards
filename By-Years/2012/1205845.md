This is an award to support a research and education program in cosmic ray
astrophysics with the goals of furthering our understanding of the origin and
nature of the highest energy particles ever observed; developing a richer
understanding of particle physics at high energies; and pursuing a vigorous
program of outreach to students, colleagues from other disciplines and the
general public.

The experimental program will focus on the Pierre Auger Observatory, an
instrument built in Argentina to investigate the origin and nature of cosmic
rays with energies above about 10^19 eV, so called "Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic
Rays" (UHECRs). Data from the Observatory will help to answer the most
fundamental questions about cosmic ray origins, composition, acceleration
mechanisms, and propagation effects and may shed light on hadronic physics at
center-of-mass energies up to ~ 400 TeV, well beyond the reach of the Large
Hadron Collider. The group plays a prominent role in the collaboration: they
currently lead the offline software program, which constitutes the centerpiece
of Auger analysis and have made significant contributions to physics analysis,
especially in the fields of composition and studies of strong interaction
physics. This award will enable them to continue their lead role in software and
computing and in analyses related to composition and hadronic interactions.

Broader Impact: The software co-developed for the Observatory has proven to be
applicable to other experiments. The PI maintains a vigorous outreach program
including mentoring students, writing regular newspaper and magazine columns,
and making radio and television appearances in several countries conducted in
several languages.
