The conference for which support is requested is on a high priority topic with
respect to scientific and technical research needs. It is on geophysical grain
flows, but grain (particle) flow is also widely encountered in industrial
practice. The list of participants includes the "right" people from both the
civil engineering, mechanics, chemical, and geophysical community. Partial NSF
support for direct conference costs, and participant travel is sought. Other
agency solicitations (ONR, USGS) have resulted in a $6400 contribution from ONR,
with the remaining costs asked from NSF. The Surficial Processes program (Dr.
Massini), Earth Sciences Division, will share equally in the NSF support.
Therefore, it is recommended that the FDH program fund its half of the NSF
request, $3382.
