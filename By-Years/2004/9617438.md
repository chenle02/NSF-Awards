9617438 Watson This planning grant requests funding to enable a new alliance,
the National Alliance of Presidential Awardees Associations (NAPAA) to design
activities, develop a mission, and become an active advocate for excellence in
mathematics and science teaching in the national arena. NAPAA proposes to
conduct four broad categories of activities: 1. Survey to previous awardees. The
purpose of the survey is to determine current address, current position , and
track experiences since the Awardee's selection. 2. Organizational and Planning
Meeting of NAPAA Executive Board. This activity will permit the fledging
organization to develop a mission, adopt procedures, and develop processes for
identifying a Chief Executive Officer. 3. Design an "event" that brings together
current and past Awardees that is directed toward ongoing professional
development. 4. Design an electronic database and Web Page for the NAPAA.
