9418709 Barmish This is a proposal to set up a joint three year research project
under the NSF Program of U.S. Russian Cooperation in the Field of Basic
Scientific Research. The Russian and U.S. research teams will each consist of
mainly junior researchers, postdoctoral associates and graduate students. A
critical component of the project will be research visits to both the U.S. and
Russia. On the U.S. side, the coordination of activities will be carried out by
Professor B. Ross Barmish; on the Russian side, the same function will be
carried out by Professor Boris T. Polyak. The body of this proposal provides all
the details motivating the basis and implementation of this collaboration an
describes a number of promising research directions in the field of robust
control. For the class of parametric uncertainty problems under consideration,
it is argued that these research directions are particularly well-suited to gain
maximal advantage associated with the combination of American and Russian
expertise. ***
