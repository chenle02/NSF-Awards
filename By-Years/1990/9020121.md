The goal of this proposal is to investigate the interaction of a eucaryotic DNA
polymerase with its primer-template. Our approach involves photo-crosslinking of
oligonucleotide primer- templates to active site peptides of the multi-subunit
DNA polymerase. The DNA primase activity of polymerase alpha and the 3' - 5'
exonuclease active site of DNA polymerase epsilon will be investigated using
modifications of this basic procedure. Two different classes of photoactive
nucleotide analogs will be used in this work. In the first, (5-azido- dUTP,
8-azido-dATP and 8-azido-dGTP) the photoactive azido group is attached directly
to the pyrimidine or purine base. The primary amino group of this deprotected
oligonucleotide will then be reacted with a series of photoactive,
heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents to generate oligonucleotide primers
with specifically-positioned, cleavable, photoactive nucleotide analogs. The
ultimate goal of this proposal is to isolate and identify by sequence analysis,
specific active site tryptic peptides crosslinked to oligonucleotide primer-
templates. By mapping the active sites of DNA polymerase first to specific
subunits of the complex, and later to specific tryptic peptides within the
subunit, we hope to begin to understand the structural and functional
organization of this remarkable enzyme complex.
