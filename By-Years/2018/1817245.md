In today's world, private companies, hospitals, governments, and other entities
frequently maintain large databases that would be hugely valuable to researchers
in many fields. However, privacy concerns prevent these databases from being
fully utilized. Differential privacy defines conditions under which information
about these databases can be released while provably protecting the privacy of
the individuals whose data they contain. This project develops differentially
private hypothesis tests. Hypothesis tests are common statistical tools that are
widely used in data analysis for social sciences, medicine, and public policy.
This project aims to give researchers the tools they need to conduct standard
statistical analyses on data that was previously inaccessible due to privacy
concerns. The project makes extensive use of undergraduate researchers, helping
to train a new generation of privacy
experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differentially private hypothesis tests allow
researchers to answer relevant research questions without having direct access
to sensitive data. This project develops private versions of many standard
hypothesis tests like analysis of variance or survival analysis. For each
hypothesis test, there are three goals: (1) to develop a private test statistic,
either by approximating the standard test statistic or by creating an entirely
new test statistic, (2) to develop methods for converting this test statistic to
a final, meaningful value such as a p-value, and (3) to conduct power analyses
evaluating the utility of the hypothesis test. This project also aims to release
a software package implementing these tests and explanatory materials to ease
their adoption by non-specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
