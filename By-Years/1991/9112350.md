The field of computer vision has dealt mostly with monochrome images, leaving
the use of color images largely unexplored. Because of advances in computer
technology and in monochrome image processing and interpretation, it is
reasonable to begin directing more effort toward the incorporation of color
information into computer vision systems. New techniques for color image
enhancement, analysis, and segmentation need to be developed that apply directly
to the vector pixel values, rather than simply applying monochrome techniques to
the red, green, and blue component images. In addition, theoretical models for
color image processing and interpretation need to be developed so that a unified
theory for color computer vision will exist. Planning activities will start with
ascertaining which existing techniques can be readily extended to apply to color
images and which new techniques must be developed. Also, methods for
multispectral image analysis will be reviewed in order to determine which
techniques can be adapted to color images. During the planning period, some
preliminary analysis of various techniques will be performed through software
implementation. This will help determine which methods offer the most promise
and warrant further research. The result of these planning activities will be
the formulation of a research project for the development of specific image
enhancement, analysis, and segmentation procedures for a color computer vision
system.
