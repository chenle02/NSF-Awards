The investigators will provide a better understanding of activity in cool stars
on three essential timescales: activity-cycle (of order years), rotational
(months), and short-term (days). The main effort is to continue the Solar-
Stellar Spectrograph (SSS) project currently underway at Lowell Observatory. The
SSS spectrograph is well suited for this task. It covers several important
chromospheric diagnostic lines, including Ca II H and K and H alpha, as well as
most of the optical spectrum from wavelengths 5000 to 9000 angstroms. It is a
dedicated instrument, associated with Lowell Observatory's 1.1-meter John Hall
telescope, which receives starlight from the telescope focal plane via a fiber-
optic feed, but is also equipped with a solar "telescope" -- a raw fiber that
sees the Sun as an unresolved disk. Sunlight and starlight are therefore
recorded via the same optics and detectors -- a unique advantage. The spectra
thus recorded can be studied in several ways. Time series observations of the
emergent flux in spectral lines responsive to solar and stellar activity reveals
the phase, amplitude, and morphology of activity cycles present. The SSS target
list includes all stars brighter than visual magnitude 7.1 lying near the Sun's
location on the main sequence (roughly spectral types F5 through K7, with
emphasis between F8 and G8), as well as the Sun itself. Examination of seasonal
variability reveals the degree of rotational modulation -- the change in
emission level arising not from the activity cycle, but from the passage of
active regions across the visible hemispheres. This provides insights regarding
the degree of chromospheric activity that accompanies cycles of various
amplitudes and morphologies. The spectrum-to-spectrum variability examined
across a broad ensemble of related spectral lines, reveals changes in solar and
stellar activity on both short and long timescales. This is a new method of
interpreting solar and stellar activity, developed for this project that will be
fully exploited in the proposed grant cycle.
