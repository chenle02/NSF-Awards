This proposal requests funds to upgrade the existing instrumentation and test
equipment in the University of Washington (UW) structural and geotechnical
engineering research laboratory. This upgrade will allow UW and other Pacific
Northwest researchers to work at the forefront of structural and geotechnical
engineering research. Specifically, it will provide three important capabilities
that do not currently exist: (1) the ability to test large full-scale structural
components, (2) the ability to perform pseudo-dynamic tests in which actual
earthquake loading and response of full-scale structures and components is
simulated, and (3) the ability to perform shaking table tests on soils,
particularly liquefiable soils, and structures. These three capabilities are
vital to the advancement of knowledge, the education of future structural and
geotechnical engineers, and public safety.
