This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and
Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site in Physics at the University of
Minnesota - Twin Cities. In order to encourage students to pursue careers in
scientific research, the REU/RET site provides an opportunity for students and
high school teachers to participate first hand in cutting-edge scientific
research in astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, cosmology, high
energy particle physics, nuclear physics, physics education, and space and
planetary physics. The students receive guidance in applying to graduate school,
and preparing for the Graduate Record Examination in Physics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students get experience and coaching on effective
scientific communication, including the writing of a research report, a poster
presentation, and an oral presentation of their research results. Both students
and teachers participate in safety and ethics sessions to prepare them for
physics research. To emphasize the bigger intellectual picture, both populations
are introduced to frontier physics research outside the subject in which they
are doing research. The high school teachers are also introduced to the latest
research on pedagogy and encouraged to integrate their research experiences into
their teaching by the Physics Education Research Group. The teachers benefit
from their interaction with the students in the REU program as do the students
in their interaction with the teachers.
