The broad goal of the research is to improve existing understanding of the
thermal reaction behavior (including stoichiometry and kinetics) of four
industrially important renewable materials: wood and its three major
constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), with emphasis on secondary
reactions of pyrolysis tars from wood. The specific thrusts of this effort are:
systematic studies of the rates and extents of extraparticle secondary reactions
of freshly formed wood pyrolysis liquids including examination of both vapor
phase and vapor-solid reactions, the latter probably focusing on effects of wood
char; and exploratory studies of intra-particle secondary reaction phenomena
including liquid phase reactions, molecular weight growth, and char-forming
processes. These studies are expected to provide key kinetic parameters and
stoichiometric coefficients to further ultimate objectives of better
understanding of the thermal reaction behavior of large dimension biomass
particles and of developing mathematically tractable whole biomass simulation
theories.
