9321893 Hartzell The carbon source requirements of all known methanogens are
limited to simple C1 and C2 compounds such as CO2, methanol, formate, and
acetate despite the fact that methanogenesis from higher molecular weight carbon
sources would be sufficiently exergonic for growth. Current anaerobic digestion
processes for methane production involve three basic steps: solubilization,
acidogenesis, and methanogenesis. These processes are carried out by different
microbial consortia with different pH optima. The goal of this project is to
engineer a microbe capable of methanogenesis from complex substrates. This will
improve the rate and efficiency of anaerobic digestion processes for methane
production. The organism, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, is an extremely thermophilic
(83 degrees C) sulfate-reducing Archaeon that grows on a broad range of carbon
sources including peptone, starch, and gelatin. A. fulgidus has been referred to
as "the evolutionary missing link" between the methanogens and the sulfate
metabolizers as it utilizes all but the final enzymes involved in
methanogenesis. In this exploratory project, both mutation/selection strategies
and gene transfer techniques are being used to create a broad-substrate-range
methanogen from A. fulgidus. %%% Success in genetically engineering
Archaeolglobus should lead to a major improvement in the rate and efficiency of
production of methane, a desirable energy source. ***
