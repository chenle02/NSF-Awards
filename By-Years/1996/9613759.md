9613759 Vigoreaux The PI plans to study the indirect flight muscles of many
small insects (bees, wasps and most bugs). Projectin and flightin are among
these indirect flight muscles that are characterized by their high power output
required to sustain a fast wingbeat frequency necessary for flight. The PI's
laboratory has been studying flightin with the goal of understanding its
function in the insect stretch-activated indirect flight muscle. The PI will use
molecular methods to further characterize this newly discovered protein and
generate a genetic model.
