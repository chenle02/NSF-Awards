This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
requirement of high-density microvias, which are critical in a variety of
microelectronic modules, such as Flat-Panel Displays (FPDs), Multi-Chip Modules
(MCMs), and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). As these modules become ever faster,
more compact, and more capable, their density of interconnects has been
increasing dramatically and new packaging technologies such as Chip-Scale
Packages (CSPs) and Ball-Grid Arrays (BGAs) have been developed to accommodate
all the required input and output (I/Os) connections. Such dense interconnects
are realized by the generation of hundreds of thousands of microvias in the
substrate layers on which the electronic modules are built. These microvias are
also both difficult and expensive to produce because of their small sizes and
large numbers. Current technologies for microvia generation are not optimized
for the varied cost considerations of different manufacturing requirements
direct-write tools address low-volume needs, whereas mask projection systems are
designed for very high via-density products. The system technology described in
this proposal offers several desirable features, including: high-speed microvia
generation for different via densities, full microvia pattern programmability,
capability to drill high-threshold photo-ablation substrates, and full and
efficient utilization of available high-power excimer lasers.

A variety of microelectronic modules, such as flat panel displays, multi-chip
modules, and printed circuit boards play an important role in numerous advanced
technology applications in both commercial and military systems. Results from
this project could result in substantial cost reductions in a wide range of
electronic modules.
