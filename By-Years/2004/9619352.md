9619352 Pachavis Technical abstract: The Symposium T at the Fall96 MRS meeting
will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas on the highly multidisciplinary
topic of"Glasses and Glass Formers". The topics to be discussed are 1) the
liquid-glass transition, 2)the relationship between the structure and the
properties of glass-forming liquids and 3)the relationship between the
properties of supercooled liquids and those of the corresponding low temperature
glasses. NSF support will provide financial assistance to postdoctoral research
associates, junior faculty members and their students. %%% Non-technical
abstract: The Symposium T at the Fall96 MRS meeting will provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas on the highly multidisiciplinary topic of"Glasses and Glass
Formers". The Symposium will bring together the major scientific contributors in
the highly multidisciplinary field of research to discuss the ubiquitous
properties of supercooled liquids and their relationship to the properties of
the corresponding glasses. NSF support will provide financial assistance to
postdoctoral research associates, junior faculty members and their students. ***
