This project investigates sociological questions relating to demographic,
epidemiologic and domestic transition in a sample of Alaskan and Russian Far
Eastern communities. A multi-trait, multi- method design using several types of
data is employed for controlled comparisons of independent socioeconomic,
political, historical and cultural factors. The results will form a basis for
international collaboration in areas of Native health and rapid social change,
the two must urgent concerns of northern indigenous people. Native organizations
in Alaska and the Russian north are advisory to the project.
