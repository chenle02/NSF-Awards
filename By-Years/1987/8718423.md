An overall understanding of the processes controlling the biogeochemistry of
the Amazon River mainstem requires consideration of a series of scales. This
project addresses primarily those processes operating at the fast- to
intermediate dynamic control of the linkages between the mainstem and
floodplain. Based on a series of research cruises the research team will: 1) Use
a rating-curve approach to define material hydrographs at the primary sampling
stations. 2) Predict fluxes for the respective elements. 3) Calculate the
residence time of water on the floodplain, with inundation patterns determined
by Landsat imagery. 4) Use the routing model to provide boundary conditions to a
two- dimensional hydrodynamic model. 5) Use this model to drive a sediment
transport/exchange model, calibrated with data from field sites validated with
field data and with turbidity patterns visible on Landsat MSS images. 6) Use a
series of isotope tracers of organic mater to identify sources responsible for
exchange. 7) Examine potential DOC adsorption mechanisms. 8) Refine the within
river respiration rate estimates. 9) Identify what class of compounds may be the
substrates by measuring changes in biomarkers. 10) Evaluate the overall
potential of these compounds using the hydrodynamic model as a driver. The
research team is an excellent one with a long history of productive
collaboration. Facilities at the grantee institution are excellent, and
accommodations at the Brazilian operations center. Relations with Brazilian
scientific partners are long- standing and excellent.
