Abstract 0928888 Wu Lu Ohio State University

This project aims to develop GaN nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) biosensors
utilizing the excitation of nanoscale beam mechanical resonators modulated by
the mass or surface energy change of specific binging between receptors and
target analytes. The NEMS biosensors will be integrated with an on-chip low
noise amplifier for signal amplification on a microfluidic platform. To improve
the device sensitivity, piezoelectric materials, namely, AlGaN/GaN
heterostructures will be used for freely suspended beam resonators and vertical
beam resonators. The proposed NEMS devices promise to be extremely fast and
ultrahigh sensitive devices for sensor applications such as displacement and
charge detection due to specific analyte binding. The ultra-sensitive NEMS
sensors can find various applications from food safety, homeland security to
disease diagnostics for human health care. Special efforts will be made to
recruit female and underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students
for participation of this interdisciplinary research. Outreach activities
include school visits, summer camp and training of high school senior students.
