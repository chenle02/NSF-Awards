Just as in real estate, in an organism the location of a protein is important.
Knowing the location provides a basis for deciding how to test for
functionality. The proteins a specific cell makes give it a special character.
Similarly, different sub-cellular compartments do different functions in the
cell. We have experimental clues about function for fewer than 40,000 or the
currently known 1.2 million proteins. The tools developed in this project will
enable the predication of the localization of proteins by considering its
structure, especially its surface components which should aid in determining
function. The first task will be to develop methods using neural networks to
predict localization for proteins of know structure. The method will be
generalized to proteins of unknown structure by predicating surface residues,
derivative of a method already in hand. A database of know sequence-motifs
related to location will be developed and integrated into the prediction method.
An atlas of localization will help map knowledge about function over the
lifetime of any protein. Localization is an excellent starting point for
assigning function to proteins. The atlas is also a vehicle for teaching both
molecular biology and informatics. The atlas and tools will be available from
servers as developed.
