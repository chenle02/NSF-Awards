It is proposed to extend the use of few-level models in cavity quantum
electrodynamics to off-resonant and zero-photon atomic processes. In these
situations the usual free space QED assumptions (i.e. broad band vacuum
reservoir) may be invalid. The objective here is to consider alternative
interactions that can probe very short response times. One such fundamental
class of radiative interactions is the Raman class. These are not well modelled
by only two atomic levels and three level models may be necessary unless an
adiabatic approximation can be justified in connection with the intermediate
state. Points to be considered include: (a) significance of the short time scale
implied by the large detuning of the intermediate state, (b) whether adiabatic
elimination can be justified, (c) utility of photon-atom dressed states, (d)
effects of non-classical field states, and (e) effects of correlations on Stokes
and anti-Stokes waves.
