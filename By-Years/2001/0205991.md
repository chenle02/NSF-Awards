AST 0205991&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Lombardi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close
interactions happen frequently in dense stellar systems, such as the cores of
globular star clusters, where the density of stars can be so high that even
physical collisions between stars can occur. They can also happen during the
evolution of close binary stars, where they often lead to&lt;br/&gt;mergers of
the two components. Close stellar interactions play a crucial role in
determining the long-term dynamical evolution and final fate of dense star
clusters. In addition, dynamical interactions in these clusters are thought to
be responsible for the production of large numbers of exotic objects such as
X-ray sources, binary radio pulsars, and blue stragglers. Understanding the
long-term dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems and the formation
mechanisms for the peculiar sources they contain are two long-standing problems
in theoretical astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on a
number of theoretical and computational studies dealing with various aspects of
these hydrodynamic stellar interactions in dense star clusters and in binary
star systems. Large-scale numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic and stellar
evolution processes will be performed on parallel supercomputers, providing
quantitatively accurate theoretical predictions that can be compared directly to
observations. Much of the work will be carried out by undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
