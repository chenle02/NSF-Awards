9353774 Fentiman The proposed project is a one-week workshop for incoming
freshman women who expect to study engineering, and are qualified to enroll in
Engineering Graphics 166, the first engineering course at The Ohio state
University. The goal of the workshop is to improve retention of women in the
engineering program by offering them some skills needed to succeed in their
first engineering course. The workshop is to be be conducted in the summer of
1994. Approximately 30 women are expected to participate. Experiences planned
for the workshop will help students to develop visualization skills, become
familiar with engineering terminology, and exercise problem solving skills.
Meetings will women engineers and more senior engineering students will help
participants prepare for success in engineering. Materials and lesson plans for
the workshop will be developed during the 1993-94 academic year by members of
the Ohio State University Engineering Graphics faculty with the support of the
women in Engineering Program and the College of Engineering. Success of the
workshop will be assessed by measuring the student's performance in their first
engineering graphics course and calculating the retention rate for participants.
