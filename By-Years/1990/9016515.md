Dr. Merritt, a leading expert on the dynamics of elliptical galaxies, proposes
theoretical and numerical studies of the structure and volution of these
interesting objects. An algorithm will be developed to determine estimates of
the mass distribution of hot stellar systems based on line-of-sight velocity
distributions. Models both with and without spherical symmetry will be subjected
to numerical and analytical investigation to study their stability and reaction
to bending perturbations.
