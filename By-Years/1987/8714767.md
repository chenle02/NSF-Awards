Howard University proposes the establishment of a Materials Science Research
Center of Excellence, located in its School of Engineering. This Center will
conduct research on the growth, characterization and processing of electronic
and electro-optic materials, a current research strength of Howard University. A
second objective of the proposal is to provide a variety of activities to
introduce young minority men and women and their teachers in the Middle-Atlantic
region to career opportunities in science and engineering. A third objective is
for the Center to become a recognized center of excellence in research over the
five-year course of the program. This project meets the major goal of the
Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program: to increase the minority
presence in science and engineering by making substantial resources available to
upgrade the research capabilities of strong and productive minority
institutions. The project will at the same time enable this institution to use
research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of related science and
engineering activities for minority groups in its region. In addition, the
project will provide opportunities for minority faculty and students at Howard
and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious research that leads to
publications in refereed journals.
