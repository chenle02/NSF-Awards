This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a cost effective method for the synthesis and purification of
antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that can be used to combat bacterial and viral
diseases in aquaculture systems. The commercial application of this project will
be significant in the area of aquaculture in light of a lack of effective
disease treatments that are currently available. The discovery that fish and
invertebrates themselves produce potent, broad-spectrum, AMPs may allow safer
alternatives to chemical antibiotics for controlling diseases. High efficiency,
low-cost, production of AMPs, coupled with their unique mode of killing action,
may also allow development and application of new classes of natural
antibiotics.
