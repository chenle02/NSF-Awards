The object of this research is to investigate the feasibility of applying
artificial intelligence and advanced adaptive control techniques to building
systems to develop an integrated expert control system for buildings. This
approach will have a hierarchical structure with two distinct features, namely a
foreground/background optimization scheme which handles dynamics of the building
system with time constants of different orders of magnitude; and a hybrid
algorithmic/rule-based decision-making scheme. The background supervisory
controller utilizes the detailed building system models to make decisions
regarding the slow dynamics and disturbances of the order of days, while the
foreground control schemes tune the HVAC equipment and lighting system to
compensate for fast dynamics, such as occupancy variations. The significant
features of this research include: (1) development of a three-level hierarchical
intelligent control scheme, which compensates for system and environmental
uncertainties; (2) formulation of a performance index for global optimization of
a building system with emphasis on energy management, occupant comfort and
operating and maintenance costs; (3) formulation and implementation of HVAC
equipment self-tuning local controllers with set points determined by the second
level controller; (4) formulation and implementation of an on-line diagnostic
scheme which utilizes sensory information to calculate instantaneous statistical
characteristics of the system for real-time failure detection and failed
component isolation; (5) formulation of an algorithmic decision-making scheme
based on the minimum uncertainty (entropy) concept. The resulting techniques
will be simulated and to some extent implemented on small scale subsystem of a
building. Industrial cooperation will be sought to plan implementation of the
results on an actual building after the two-year duration of this study.
