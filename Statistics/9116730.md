Magnetic resonance spectra, used in scientific, engineering and medical
research, depart from pure Lorentzian behavior in the presence of
inhomogeneities such as those commonly encountered in many of these
applications. This research will develop appropriate analytic methods using
statistical theory drawn from semiparametric model analysis. This new
methodology will be derived to remove distortions caused by magnetic field
inhomogeneity and by temporal instability. Also, statistical theory and
methodology will be developed to analyze repeated observations such as those
taken to identify and study metabolic changes at intervals during an extended
period of time.
