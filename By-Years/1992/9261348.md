This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the
objective of producing the design specifications for computer products that
illustrate central concepts in electricity and magnetism, chemistry, optics,
mechanics, and digital and analog circuitry to use to teach physical sciences to
elementary school students. These products would be in the form of a series of
animated educational games that would utilize a variety of formats such as
adventures, problem-solving, and games. The proposed courseware could fill a
critical need in schools and has potential for success in the home
education/entertainment market as well.
