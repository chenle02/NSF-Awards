&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9725228&lt;br/&gt;Konold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigation will study a number of the projects that NSF is funding which
students collect, share, and analyze real-world data in the course of conducting
scientific investigations. IN these projects to date, the data gathering and
sharing activities have gone more smoothly than the data ansalysis, in which
many students and teachers have struggled. Such difficulties pose a serious
barrier to fostering authentic mathematics and science learning and to enabling
shared inquiry among students and scientists. This research will study the
nature of the data analysis problems to provide a specific information that can
help current projects better support data analysis skills, and a research base
that can inform the development of future data analysis projects, materials,
software, and teacher development efforts. The study will focus on issues such
as data authenticity, tractability, and accessibility to students and teachers.
Major products will include (1) analyses of individual projects' data sets,
including and assessment of the extent to which interesting and interpretable
findings can be reached and suggestions on how to make this data more accessible
to students, and (2) a technical report that summarizes major findings, includes
representative case studies that highlight both the problems and possibilities
of students analyzing real world scientific data and makes recommendations about
the design of data sharing and analysis projects, including ancillary materials
and tools.&lt;br/&gt;
