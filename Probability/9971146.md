The principal investigator is carrying out research on topics related to the
mathematical theory of probability. Specific objectives include continuation of
his investigations of optimal-stopping problems (especially stopping under
incomplete information), constructions of random distributions, analysis and
applications of Benford's law, general partitioning inequalities, and
convergence and invariance principles. In new directions he is studying sharp
inequalities for expected extrema and general continuity-representation
theorems. The research has both theoretical and applied components, and involves
collaboration with other researchers both at Georgia Tech and other
universities, as well as with several graduate students. This research involves
the study of random processes, such as evolving financial markets or government
policies, when unpredictable fluctuations are present. Much is known if there is
complete knowledge of the nature of the random fluctuations, but this is usually
not the case in practice. One of the thrusts of this research is to try to
discover good methods for deciding when to stop or change a policy when only
partial information is available about the random fluctuations. Another thrust
of this research is to develop new statistical tools for estimating changes in
random processes. One very new use of these ideas is application to detection of
fraud in financial data. The idea is that fabricated data is usually
qualitatively different from true data, and there are just recently tests based
on these fluctuation theories which are proving useful in distinguishing true
from fabricated data. Applications of the research on random measures includes
new models for the distribution of mass in space, including various settings in
physics and materials science.
