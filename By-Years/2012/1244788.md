This project is establishing a three-semester curriculum, Introduction to
Research I-III, that begins in the freshman year. Students complete two
semester-long projects, begin reading peer-reviewed scientific articles while
learning about faculty research on campus, and choose a faculty advisor to aid
them in writing a research proposal. Experienced juniors and seniors serve as
mentors for the freshman and sophomores. It is based on a successful pilot
project designed to test the feasibility of the design.

Intellectual Merit: Students gain an understanding of how research is conducted
and skills they can use either in their graduate work or as they enter the work
place. Faculty have an opportunity to establish a research program at the
institution that serves as the base for the work of other students.

Broader Impact: This system is designed to serve as a model for other
departments on campus and for other Predominantly Undergraduate Serving
Institutions because of an educational research component designed to study the
effects of undergraduate research on academic success and students' career
choices.
