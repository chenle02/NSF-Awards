This study will investigate organic matter degradation and calcium carbonate
dissolution at the sea floor with emphasis on examining the generality of the
earlier results and improving the accuracy of the rate constant determination.
The proposal consists of three main objectives: a field program, development of
a pCO2 microprofiling device and a laborabory investigation. The field study
will take place in the productive eastern equatorial Pacific. Profiler studies
will be coordinated with benthic flux measurements by Dr. Richard Jahnke of
Skidaway Institution of Oceanography. Development of remote pCO2 measurement
capability is necessary to improve sensitivity in the determination of the
dissolution rate constant. This approach will be to adapt a colorimetric fiber
optic technology developed at the University of Washington and currently being
used for low level ammonia measurements. The laboratory investigation is
designed to test interpretations of the in-situ measurements by measuring the
calcium carbonate dissolution flux while predicting it using microelectrode pH
and pCO2 measurements.
