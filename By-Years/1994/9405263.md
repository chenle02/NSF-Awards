9405263 Kelsey Through stratigraphic study of Holocene deposits in selected
estuaries and low-lying coastal lakes in southern coastal Oregon, PI and
collaborators will assess whether or not subduction zone earthquakes and
associated tsunamis have affected the region. Evidence for seismic shaking
(liquefaction) and tsunamis and tsunami magnitude will be evaluated. Through
this study a paleoseismic history for the last c. 4000 years will be developed.
