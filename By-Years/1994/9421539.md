9421539 Tessier It is proposed that a mechanism by which functional biodiversity
of filter-feeding zooplankton is maintained is by spatial-temporal environmental
variation in phytoplankton-resource abundance. Species can be viewed as
differing in their ability to exploit rich versus poor resource conditions, and
such differences create unique interactions between each species and a
heterogeneous environment. The proposed research would examine the breadth of
species diversity within the Daphnia inhabiting the lakes of midwest U.S., and
use a broad range of natural resource assemblages to test the generality of this
exploitation tradeoff. Using a novel approach to quantify resource richness from
the organisms's perspective, this research would also examine for an association
between assemblage composition, and environmental resource conditions among
lakes and vertical habitats within lakes. Two experimental studies will explore
the consequences of this tradeoff to competitive and food web interactions. This
research will identify key factors regulating the diversity of Daphnia, which
play a pivotal role in the ecology of freshwater lakes. The research provides an
explicit test of a general concept linking consumer traits and diversity of
ecological communities. It also lays the groundwork to explore how biodiversity
within an important group of organisms translates into consequences at the
ecosystem level.
