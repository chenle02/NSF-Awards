The oceanic crust is generally thought to grade downward from an extrusive
layer of pillow lavas to an intruded sheeted dike complex underlain by gabbros
and finally peridotites on the bottom. During Ocean Drilling Program Leg 118,
500 m of gabbro were cored in a single hole, Site 735B, located on a shallow
(700 m) wave-cut summit of the eastern transverse ridge of the Atlantic II
fracture zone in the southwest Indian Ocean. This is the most complete section
of the gabbroic layer yet obtained and provides the opportunity to gain
additional understanding of the magmatic processes responsible for the
generation of the oceanic crust. This project will develop a structural,
metamorphic and igneous stratigraphy, and obtain major, trace and rare-earth
chemical analyses on the samples obtained from Site 735B.
