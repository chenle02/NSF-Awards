This project will study the use of integer programming for register allocation
and for important compiler optimizations that interact with register allocation.
The project will build on the preceding work which shows that integer
programming can produce optimal or near-optimal register allocations in
reasonable time, providing significant reductions in register allocation
overhead. The project's first objective is to achieve order of magnitude speedup
in integer-programming-based register allocation by discovering and implementing
more efficient integer-programming formulations. The project's second objective
is to extend the scope of the integer programming formulation to include other
compiler optimizations that directly interact with register allocation, such as
common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant code motion. The extended
formulation will allow register allmcation and these interacting optimizations
to be done simultaneously, eliminating the traditional phase ordering problem.
It is expected that the extended integer programming formulation will provide
significant code quality improvements, and that the new optimization can be done
in reasonable time.
