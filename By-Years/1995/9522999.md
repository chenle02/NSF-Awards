The University of Southern California (USC) is collaborating with two
institutions in Mexico City (ITAM and CINVESTAV) to advance the methodology of
simulating complex systems, with especial application to neural models at
different levels of analysis. To provide multi-level simulation we integrate our
present neural simulation language NSL with the facilities for object-oriented
management of hierarchical structures called schemas provided by the abstract
schema language ASL. This will be linked to work in databases for the
representation of biological data underway at USC as part of the Human Brain
Project supported by several US agencies. Additionally, the project complements
a second NSF-CONACyt collaboration, between Georgia Tech and ITAM, that studies
the technological issues of `Ecological Robotics: A Schema-Theoretic Approach`.
The methodology will provide simulation tools which will help neuroscientists
gain a better understanding of the dynamical processes associated with
biological phenomena, and a technology with implications far beyond the brain
research community.
