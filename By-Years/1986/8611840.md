Convective heat transfer from small discrete heat sources embedded in a
substrate is the focus of this research. Recently, attention has been directed
to the cooling coolants. Little heat transfer information relevant to this
situation is available in the literature. There is limited fundamental
understanding of conjugate heat transfer effects, three-dimensionality of the
flow and temperature fields, and the augmenting role of mixed convection. The
investigation is aimed at adressing these needs through a combination of
experimental and theoretical research. The experimental effort involves
determination of the heat transfer coefficient for various flow rates, fluids,
and heater and flow channel dimensions. The data will be presented in the form
of standard heat transfer correlations. Flow visualization will determine the
qualitative nature of the flow.
