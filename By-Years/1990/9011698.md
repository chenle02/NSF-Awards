This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to examine the possibility that
Group I introns exist in cyanobacteria. These introns have not been found to
date in bacteria, although they have been demonstrated to exist in bacterial
viruses. If preliminary evidence is confirmed and they are found, a survey of
Group I introns will be done within distinct cyanobacterial groups. This
research will provide data on the evolutionary relationships between
cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher plants.
