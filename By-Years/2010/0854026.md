This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work
by Professor Jongyoon Han at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study
the ion concentration polarization phenomenon near perm-selective membrane using
micro/nanofluidic model system. This phenomenon has much relevance to many
chemical membrane systems, such as battery and fuel cell electrolytes, but the
scientific understanding has been limited due to the lack of controlled
experimental platform. Using micro-nanofluidic systems Professor Han's group
will carefully characterize field, flow, and concentration distribution around
the ion concentration polarization zone, which could lead to better
understanding and optimization of chemical membranes. At the same time, novel
applications of ion concentration polarization, such as desalination and
biomolecule concentration, will be explored. In doing so, Professor Han's group
will engage and involve early undergraduate students, in order to broaden the
participation of undergraduate students in real-world engineering research.
