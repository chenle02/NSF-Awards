0111278&lt;br/&gt;Knight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides 50% of the
costs of acquiring a Maran Ultra NMR core analyzer for the Environmental
Geophysics Laboratory currently being built at Stanford University. The
instrumentation will be used by the PI and graduate students investigating the
use of NMR for environmental applications. In addition, it is likely that others
will use the analyzer for research applications in the petroleum industry. There
is growing interest in the use of NMR for characterizing the near-surface of the
earth. The Maran analyzer is the central piece of equipment that will be used
for laboratory studies of the relationship between measured NMR parameters and
the basic physical and chemical properties of porous geological materials. The
analyzer will be used to investigate the link between the NMR time constants and
both the pore size distribution and tortuosity of materials. A second focus will
be on improving the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that control the
NMR response in geological materials, with an emphasis on determining the role
of paramagnetic species and the sensitivity to sorbed contaminants. This
analyzer will be the first low field instrument of its kind at Stanford
University, providing the capability to obtain laboratory data at the same
frequency as that used in the collection of field and borehole data. The Maran
analyzer will be housed in the Environmental Geophysics Laboratory, planned for
construction in the summer of 2001. &lt;br/&gt;***
