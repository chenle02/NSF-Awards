both in an evolutionary and taxonomic sense. Recently, through developments in
DNA sequencing, the genus Halorubrum has emerged as an excellent model for
testing hypotheses regarding the nature of bacterial speciation. Halorubrum
species provide an innovative platform to compare modifications between
characteristics like cell shape and sugar utilization and DNA sequences to
better understand variation in and between bacterial species. Using these
microbes, we will ask questions like: Is there a correlation between DNA defined
species and physiological traits? Do physiological traits provide predictive
power regarding population structure? Can distinct habitats be predicted for DNA
defined species? Can we define additional species using the same techniques?
Answers to these questions will go a long way towards developing solutions to
the bacterial species problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
international and interdisciplinary in its scope. Researchers from the U.S. and
Europe will train taxonomists and population geneticists to communicate across
disciplinary boundaries. Furthermore, this work has the potential to impact
other disciplines like microbial ecology, which at its most fundamental level
requires a usable and reliable species concept. Ultimately, improvements in our
ability to classify bacteria may help researchers and technicians identify
bacteria harmful to humans and or their agricultural crops and herds.&lt;br/&gt;
