With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Physics at the University of Connecticut will acquire a tunable
ultrafast laser and a femtosecond time-resolved optical spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in the following areas: a) photosynthetic energy
transfer; b) biological photoconversion; and c) high-intensity laser physics.
Faculty and students from Bowdoin College, a primarily undergraduate
institution, will also carry out research studies using this instrumentation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will allow participating students and
postdoctoral associates to obtain experience in the techniques for the study of
ultrafast processes applied to biological materials and strong field physics.
