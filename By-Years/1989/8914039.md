Mathematical research concerned with potential theory and the boundary
properties of harmonic functions will be done. Much of the best work done in
potential theory occurs in the two- dimensional setting where the connections
with complex analysis of holomorphic functions can be exploited. In higher
dimensions, "real variable" techniques have to be developed in conjunction with
advances in partial differential equations. A typical gap in the lore is the
lack of information on the roots of the gradient along the boundary. In two
dimensions, this set has zero measure. Work will be done to clarify the
situation in higher dimensions. A second thrust of this project will focus on
the Oksendal problem for higher dimensions (and related issues). If one accepts
the idea of a density (measure) on the boundary of a domain which produces
harmonic extensions of continuous boundary functions, it has been shown that
this measure is concentrated on a set of dimension 1 (precisely) in the two-
dimensional case. The natural conjecture is that n-dimensional domains support
harmonic measure on sets of dimension n-1, regardless of how complicated the
boundary may be. The preceding effort requires careful analysis of the Green's
function of a domain. Several questions have been raised concerning the geometry
of the level sets of the Greens's function which will be addressed in this
research. At the base of this work is the fundamental question of how Green's
lines deform under continuous deformation of a domain. //
