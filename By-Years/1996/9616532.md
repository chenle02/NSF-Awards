Assessment in Forming and Coaching Learning Groups University of Washington has
been awarded a 3-year grant for $589,701 to develop experimental software tools
and methodologies to support various on-line assessment activities in both the
High School environment and the University environment. Tools will be developed
that combine assessment functions with facilities to translate results of
assessment into meaningful interventions in both physical and virtual
classrooms. The facilities include means of visualizing assessment of
information for individual students and groups, means for organizing groups of
students for particular activities, electronic mail exchanges, and means to help
teachers articulate pedagogical goals and progress within the contexts of these
groups. The project experimentation will focus in the subject area of
probability and statistics with the aim of enhancing the productivity and
effectiveness of teachers in guiding their student groups in mastering the
subject matter using Internet-based group discussion.
