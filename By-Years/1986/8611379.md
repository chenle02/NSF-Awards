Further research is conducted on cross waves and edge waves. The research is
both theoretical and experimental. These waves form crests in a direction
perpendicular to the obstacle which generates them, and they form at
sufficiently large amplitudes and wave steepness. The study will focus on
instability modes, the occurrence of chaotic regimes, and progressing solitary
waves (solitons). Means for suppressing cross waves on wave makers will be
further explored.
