This project, which will begin its tenth year of support from the NSF,
addresses one of the critical questions in developmental biology: how do aa
relatively small number of embryonic cells give rise to the multitude of cell
types that make up the individual? An ideal model system in which this question
can be addressed is the neural crest, which appears very early in the
development in all vertebrate species. Although the neural crest is only
recognizable for a few days during the course of development, it gives rise to a
myriad of important structures in the body. Among the hundreds of neural crest
derivatives is the entire peripheral nervous system, all of the pigment cells in
the skin and the cells that make the dentin in the teeth. How are such an
enormous number of diverse cell types made from a seemingly homogeneous
population of cells in a normal individual? With previous NSF support, this
laboratory devised sophisticated cell sorting techniques for isolating and
studying subpopulations of neural crest cells. Furthermore, they can transplant
neural crest cells and follow the transplanted cells throughout development. The
current studies will specifically examine how individual neuronal cell types
arise from the neural crest by examining the development of two identified
subpopulations following transplantation. The events that direct apparently
homogeneous neural crest cells to become specific neurons will be examined, and
the specific control genes that are associated with these events will be
identified. These studies are at the interface of cellular and molecular
biology, where, for the first time, it is now possible to address one of the
most fundamental questions in developmental neuroscience.
