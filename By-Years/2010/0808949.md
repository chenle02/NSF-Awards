&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop non-
traditional Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection mechanisms and structures,
using novel nanowire crossbar array and nano mechanical switch mechanisms, for
nanoscale integrated circuits (IC). The approach is to investigate new nanowire
switching ESD discharging mechanism, to fabricate and characterize nano crossbar
switch arrays, to explore CMOS-compatible fabrication flow and to develop new
modeling techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: ESD failure is
the most devastating IC reliability problem in sub-100nm regime that causes the
industry billions of dollars annually. On-chip ESD protection is hence required
to protect ICs against ESD damage. ESD failure and protection involves very
complex multi-coupling effects. As IC technologies continue to shrink, ESD-
induced leakage and mis-triggering effect at GHz operation, inherent to its
traditional transistor-type protection mechanism, become intolerable. It is
hence imperative to develop novel ESD protection mechanisms and structures. This
project is to develop completely new nanowire crossbar array and nano mechanical
switch based ESD protection mechanisms and structures, which intends to replace
the decade-long traditional ESD protection mechanism, therefore to eliminate the
ESD-induced leakage and mis-triggering problems. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
Success of this project will deliver the first nanowire crossbar array and nano
mechanical switch ESD protection mechanisms and structures for next generation
IC technologies at nanoscale. The new ESD protection solutions are critical to
finally resolving the grand IC reliability challenge at nano nodes. NSF support
of this research enables the proposed international-academia-industry
collaboration activities that greatly benefit American students, the
semiconductor industry, the academia and the American society.
