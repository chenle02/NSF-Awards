A request is made to provide funds to purchase equipment for the establishment
of a Potential Fields Equipment Pool. It is intended that the Potential Fields
Pool Equipment (PFPE) effort would continue as a long-term service to UNOLS ship
operators. The equipment would include needed spare parts and related
electronics needed to repair broken gyros on behalf of all UNOLS operators
running BGM-3 gravimeters on their ships for academic research, as well as to
purchase a portable magnetometer system that could be used by any UNOLS operator
for marine magnetics surveying. The services and equipment
includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Repairs to BGM-3 gyros &lt;br/&gt;2)
Acquisition of Lockheed-Martin spare BGM-3 electronics boards $ &lt;br/&gt;3)
Acquisition of 1 complete surface towed Marine Magnetics SeaSPY&lt;br/&gt;
magnetometer system &amp; winch (including shipping) &lt;br/&gt;4) Gyro
equipment cabinets, tools, shipping cases &lt;br/&gt;5) Shipping and Telephone
costs (yearly) &lt;br/&gt;6) Recalibration of s/n210 BGM-3 sensor
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present
proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists
to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-
funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate
review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance
and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from
any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
