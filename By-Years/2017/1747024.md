The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the project
addresses one of the most critical and challenging problems in stroke
rehabilitation - shoulder and arm rehabilitation. More than 800,000 people
suffer from a stroke per year in the US and most of them are left with arm and
shoulder impairments. This robotic invention has the potential to deliver
revolutionary benefits to these stroke survivors, including better recovery
outcomes and shorter length of hospital stay. Indirectly, the innovation will
improve vocational skills and prevent consequential safety accidents after a
stroke. The major outcomes of this work has the potential to improve the
rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper
extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. The project will create
a unique opportunity for exposing the PI and researchers to the process of
translating basic research into deployed technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the
capability of the proposed rehabilitation robot technology for correcting
abnormal coordination of the shoulder complex after stroke. Although
rehabilitation hospitals have long sought a technological innovation that will
lead to a higher clinical efficacy than conventional care, there is no robotic
intervention commercially available that fully addresses the shoulder
rehabilitation problem. The PI and collaborators will validate the proposed
design and controller with experiments with human subjects. The planned
experiments will confirm the proposed robot technology that addresses the
abnormal shoulder coordination problem, which is critical for the shoulder
rehabilitation after stroke. In addition, PI and collaborators will define and
develop a minimum viable product (MVP) of the proposed innovation which will
confirm the product-market fit.
