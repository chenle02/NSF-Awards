Partial support is to be granted to cover participant costs at the Seventh
Symposium on Turbulent Shear Flows, to be held at Stanford University August
21-23, 1989. The support is to go primarily to younger participants including
graduate students. This meeting covers the general area of turbulent shear
flows, including combustion, atmospherics, and a broad range of engineering
applications. Attendance is estimated at 300, with 145 papers accepted and five
keynote speakers selected at this time.
