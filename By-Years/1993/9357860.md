This NSF Young investigator award will investigate the role played by the oceans
in climate variations. Numerical and analytical approaches will be used to study
the air-sea interactions in the seasonal cycle and the relation between the
seasonal cycle and interannual oscillations in the tropics. Transport processes
of deep equatorial waters will also be investigated
