This joint project expands capacity in Information Assurance education at
University at &lt;br/&gt;Buffalo (UB) via new educational materials and
laboratory development and at Genesee Community College (GCC), through faculty
training and adaptation of exemplary IA materials into their courses. A
multidisciplinary approach is taken for IA expansion by considering topics from
computer science and engineering, mathematics, management sciences and legal and
ethical studies with the goal of driving students to become future INFOSEC
problem solvers and training them to derive solutions to a host of problems of
national significance. &lt;br/&gt;
