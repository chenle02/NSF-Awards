The Middle Tennessee Mechatronics Scholars Program at Middle Tennessee State
University (MTSU) plans to increase the number of students in the school's new
Mechatronics Engineering baccalaureate degree program by 50% and retain at least
80% of incoming freshmen to the sophomore year. At least 15 new freshman majors
will receive scholarships each year, allowing students to focus on their
studies, complete college in four years instead of six, and give them two
additional years of earnings and less debt. S-STEM scholarships will enable the
program to recruit talented, dedicated students who will succeed in the rigorous
engineering curriculum. The Tennessee automotive industry needs strong
mechatronics engineers and this project will help meet this significant
workforce need in Tennessee. The need for mechatronics engineering education is
growing, not only in the middle Tennessee area, but also across the entire
country as many mechatronics positions are seeking qualified applicants.

Opportunities for members of the cohort to participate in educational activities
during their first year include a week long summer training experience at
Siemens Headquarters in Berlin, Germany, a four week mechatronics research team
project, intrusive advising, tutoring, mentoring, and manufacturing plant tours.
Later, internships and significant interactions in the automotive manufacturing
industry are possible. A dedicated professional advisor and predictive analytics
software will enable project leaders to detect and address issues that place
students at-risk. MTSU faculty and students will contribute to the engineering
education literature related to early research experiences for engineering
students, the impact of various support activities on the success of freshman
engineering students, and the impact of hands-on project work on retention of
female and minority engineering students. Comparing a) the building of a high
quality engineering program using the Siemens systems approach and high level of
student-industry interaction to b) a traditional engineering education will be a
helpful contribution to the engineering education literature.
