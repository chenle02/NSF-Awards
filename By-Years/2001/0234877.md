With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
will acquire a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer
(FTICR-MS). This equipment will enhance the following research studies: a)
palladium (0) complexes of biphenyl-based monophosphine ligands; b) pericyclic
reactions for organic synthesis; c) asymmetric catalysis; d) proton-coupled
electron transfer; e) asymmetric metathesis reactions; f) multiple metal-carbon
bonds; g) new catalysts for living olefin polymerizations; h) new ligands and
complexes for dinitrogen reduction; and i) liquid crystals and conjugated
polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.
