On-road vehicular emissions make large contributions to urban and regional
pollution in the developed and developing worlds, and as such can exert
significant effects on climate and human health. This project will further
develop an existing infrared photometer method for selective trace gas
measurement at high time resolution and at significantly reduced cost-per-sensor
then test an array of such sensors deployed on multi-lane highways in order to
measure vehicular emissions under a variety of representative road and traffic
conditions. Tasks include optimizing sensor prototype performance, laboratory
testing of sensor response to changes in ambient conditions, then deploying on-
road with further testing and comparisons with more traditional measurement
methods. This improvement of existing technology may lead through field
application to new scientific insights regarding emissions from on-road mobile
sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include
necessary preliminary work leading to widespread application of unattended low-
cost sensors for a variety of on-road vehicle emissions, thereby enabling new
cost effective instrumentation and sampling protocols in the future for
monitoring compliance with vehicular pollution control regulations. This will
have clear benefits for better understanding and improving climate, habitability
and human health, particularly in urban/industrialized regions and lead to
emerging technology of high policy relevance related to public health and
societal benefit through sustainable urban development. The project will also
form the basis of dissertation research for one graduate student and provide
research experience opportunities for a number of undergraduates.
