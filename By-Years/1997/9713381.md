9713381 Garvey The reaction of hydroxyl radical (OH) with volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) of biogenic or anthropogenic origin is a major source of
tropospheric ozone. The reaction of OH with VOCs can also lead to the formation
of harmful acidic compounds. VOCs react with ozone to form a variety of
products, including energetic biradicals and OH radicals, and ozone-alkene
reactions can be an important nighttime source of OH. This project addresses how
the above reactions could be mediated by the presence of aerosol particles (fog,
rain, cloud droplets, etc.). In this research, it will be determined how the gas
phase chemistry changes if the radical reactions occur within a gas phase
cluster of molecules as a model of much larger airborne aerosol particles. The
University at Buffalo group has experience in studying chemical reactions within
gas phase clusters both experimentally and theoretically. It was observed that
frequently, the chemistry occurring in clusters is very different from that in
the gas phase. Solvating molecules within the cluster can stabilize a reagent or
intermediate on a time scale long enough to react within the cluster. In these
experiments, gas phase clusters containing nitric acid, the VOC, water, and
other ligand molecules will be prepared via molecular beam expansion. OH will be
produced via photolysis of nitric acid or other suitable precursors. Reaction
products will be monitored via tandem mass spectrometry. Theoretical
calculations will provide estimates of the energetics and lifetimes of
intermediate biradicals.
