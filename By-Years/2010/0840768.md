Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Physics Classroom is an extensive
collection of web-based, multimedia tutorials covering physics at the high
school level. Developed by high school teachers in Illinois, this web site has
become one of the mostly widely used independently-created resources for physics
education. It is well known and respected by teachers of high school physics and
physical science for its clear explanations and use of concept-building diagrams
and animations. A commercial company previously hosted a version of this
material, but has ceased hosting this material. Sustaining this sort of
exemplary, highly-used materials is an important aspect of the stewardship role
in physics education of the ComPADRE Pathway. This proposal supports the author
of this resource and the ComPADRE technical staff to bring the content into the
library and bring web technology of The Physics Classroom up to current
standards. In particular, accessibility, standards, and library issues are
addressed through integration with The Physics Front metadata and collaboration
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting an online presence for The Physics
Classroom makes it widely available to the physics community and to physics
students around the world. In addition, the awareness and use of The Physics
Classroom is increased through teacher training and in-service workshops.
