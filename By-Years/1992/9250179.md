Control of today's multi-input/multi-output robotic, manufacturing, aerospace,
etc., processes requires modern control algorithms and multichannel digital
signal processors (DSP). It is important that undergraduates participate in some
laboratory experiences in DSP real-time digital control. However, it is
difficult to learn basic controls implementation as well as the programming and
structure of DSPs in one laboratory course.A project being developed at the UTA
Automation and Robotics Research Institute (ARRI) allows seamless integration of
the TI TMS320 C30 DSP with Labview software. Currently the DSP interface is not
seamless, but requires one to learn Labview as well as the DSP operation - this
is not possible in a one semester laboratory course.The ARRI DSP/Labview
interface will allow Labview to be utilized in real-time controls as it has been
in signal processing, and will be available to institutions nationwide. It will
allow the DSP to be treated as the operational amplifier is now treated in
continuous-time control, making it possible to use the device without knowing
the details of its operation. The data passing, sampling, etc., processes will
reside as virtual instruments (VI) in Labview. In a laboratory course, the
controller VI is selected and its coefficients set by the user. Advanced use in
a project laboratory allows the implementation of sophisticated control
algorithms by writing simple C programs without worrying about the DSP protocol.
ARRI was recently funded by a Texas ATP grant to develop the DSP/Labview
interface. This ILI grant will allow porting of that technology to a prototype
undergraduate controls laboratory by purchase of four MAC/Labview stations.
