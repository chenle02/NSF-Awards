In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Adam Matzger of The University of Michigan
will study the structural and energetic factors driving two dimensional crystal
formation on surfaces. The approach is to prepare a series of molecules varying
systematically in structure and/or functionalized through chemical synthesis and
then to study their adsorption and two dimensional crystallization on surfaces.
Structural information will be gained from STM, X-ray diffraction, and sum-
frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, while thermodynamic information
will be gained from flow microcalorimetry. The broader impacts involve training
undergraduate and graduate students, dissemination of results through
publications and presentations, broadening participation through the PI's
involvement as the director of the University of Michigan Sloan Foundation
Minority Ph.D. Program, and continuation of work on the Two-Dimensional
Structural Database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental
understanding on how molecules assemble on surfaces and in crystals. Such work
could impact a variety of areas in which surfaces are important, including
environmental remediation, surface lubrication, and catalysis. The research will
also provide useful insights into crystal growth, which would impact industries
such as pharmaceuticals, pigments, and energetic materials.
