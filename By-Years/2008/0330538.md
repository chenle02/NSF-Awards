This project will deploy a robust, reliable, easy-to-use tool that enables
complex numerical algorithms to be executed on Grids. The thrust of this project
will be to deploy MW, a software tool that encapsulates the abstractions of the
master-worker paradigm, as part of the NMI software release. MW is used to
implement new algorithms for several important problem classes in numerical
optimization. The work will make MW a production-quality tool, enhance its ease
of use and its robustness, and integrate it with other NMI middleware. The goal
is to make MW the de facto standard for master-worker middleware on
Grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the
deployment of middleware that facilitates practical implementation of a wide
range of complex numerical algorithms for solving science and engineering
applications on computational Grids. The tool will add an important dimension to
NMI. The broader impact of providing a comprehensive, easy-to-use tool allowing
researchers, practitioners, and educators to harness the power of the
computational Grid is potentially far-reaching. Researchers can simulate more
complex models of physical phenomena. Practitioners can solve larger problems
that more accurately approximate the system under consideration. Educators can
bring the "complex to the classroom" by demonstrating and simulating complex
systems for the benefit of their students.&lt;br/&gt;
