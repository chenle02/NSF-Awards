The two postdoctoral scholars will be working on separate areas in probability
theory. The first investigator will study a number of problems related to
Brownian motion: Brownian windings in the plane, connections between Brownian
motion and potential theory, properties of the Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process and
Brownian sheet, and problems involving strategies for switching between two
Brownian motions. The second investigator will study a number of problems in the
area of interacting particle systems: asymptotics for the long range contact
process, systems involving coexistence of two species in equilibrium, and a
model for surface catalysts.
