This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Cornell University
supports the research of Professor Geoffrey W. Coates. The themes of the
research are synthesis and application of enantiomerically pure helicates. Work
is directed to the synthesis of two classes of optically active ligands that are
specifically designed to form enantiomerically pure helicates in the presence of
metal ions that prefer tetrahedral coordination geometries. Investigations
include the mechanism of helix wrapping and unwinding and the application of
helicates as catalysts for asymetric synthesis. The project, with components of
organic synthesis, inorganic stereochemistry, and catalysis, facilitates the
comprehensive training of graduate students. The research leads to the synthesis
of a new class of optically active compounds whose helical structures resemble
those of proteins and nucleic acids. Applications provide new opportunities in
the fields of enantioselective catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular topology.
