9506435 Frangopol The essential objective of this project is to develop a new
method for life-cycle reliability-based multicriteria evaluation and design of
structural systems under serviceability, ultimate, and time-dependent
deterioration requirements imposed simultaneously. State-of-the-art time-
dependent structural reliability methods will be used in this research.
Efficient and effective techniques of combining multicriteria mathematical
programming with time- dependent system reliability framework will also be
developed. Successful completion of this project will result in the possibility
to evaluate and design civil engineering systems, including reliability
constraints, by considering life-cycle deterioration effects.
