This project by Julius Rebek within the Organic Dynamics Program, is aimed at
the design, synthesis and study of host molecules that can bind to a variety of
bioorganic ligands. These latter target molecules include heterocyclic bases,
peptides and nucleic acid components. The selectivity of these systems will
provide important information about molecular recognition, and its role in
biological processes. Receptors for adenine have been refined to include
molecular chelation; these systems feature simultaneous Watson-Crick, and
Hoogsteen base-pairing and aryl stacking interactions. The thermodynamics of the
complexation events will be examined, and are expected to reveal the intrinsic
binding provided by the polarizable aromatic surfaces in contact with the
nucleic acid bases in a number of solvents. Base-pairing in model receptors will
be used to drive acyl transfer reactions to learn about the characteristics of
self-replicating systems. This aspect of the project will invlove kinetic
studies, especially those involving competitive inhibitors.
