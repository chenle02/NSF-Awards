PROJECT ABSTRACT:

The project proposed is for the development of computational methods in
financial engineering. Financial engineering deals broadly with the use of
mathematical and computational tools to model the dynamics of asset prices, to
value and hedge derivative securities tied to the underlying assets, and to
measure and control the risks associated with these instruments. The project
proposes three areas of investigation: (1) a stochastic mesh method for solving
high-dimensional stochastic dynamic programming problems embedded in certain
financial engineering problems; (2) models and methods for incorporating jumps
in diffusion-based models of the term structure of interest rates; (3) numerical
methods for path-dependent options.

Research in financial engineering contributes to the competitiveness and
soundness of the U.S. financial services industry. The U.S. holds a leadership
position in this important sector of the service economy; future preeminence in
this industry will rely on innovation in financial services and in the
technology that supports these services, including leading-edge computational
methods for financial engineering and risk management. This area employs highly
skilled scientists and engineers; this project will contribute, in part, to the
training of skilled personnel.
