A number of models exist for the neotectonics involved with a ridge-trench-
trench triple junction, however, these are difficult to test, partly due to a
scarcity of suitable modern examples. This project will focus on differential
uplift associated with the subduction of an active spreading ridge in the
Solomon Islands where the ridge axis is oblique to the trench. Uplifted and
deformed Late Pleistocene coral reefs will provide critical age information and
elevation relative to sea level data required to reconstruct the uplift history
in the vicinity of the ridge subduction. Results are expected to provide
patterns and rates of uplift that can be applied to less well-exposed and more
ancient examples of ridge-ridge-trench systems.
