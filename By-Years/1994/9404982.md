9404982 Manson Calculation of the photoionization and impact ionization cross
sections of atoms will be performed using a variety of computational techniques.
The aim is to employ the simplest approach capable of giving quantitative
accuracy for the process under consideration. The studies include investigations
of excited state photo processes, inner-shell photoionization, photoionization
plus excitation high Z relativistic photoionization and neutral and charged
particle impact ionization. The results of the calculation provide insight into
the basic nature of the atomic/electromagnetic field interaction and are useful
for plasma, astro and radiological physics applications. ***
