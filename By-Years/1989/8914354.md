A primarily experimental research program will be carried out on the existence
and growth of interfacial instabilities which can occur in the coextrusion of
polymer melts. Dies equipped with pressure transducers and optical windows will
be used to determine interface deformation and wall stresses in the coextrusion
of various combinations of resins. Required rheological characterizations will
also be carried out. A theoretical stability analysis will complement the
experiments. The instabilities to be investigated are detrimental to the
processing of multilayer films or fibers through coextrusion. Their
understanding and control is of great importance in materials processing.
