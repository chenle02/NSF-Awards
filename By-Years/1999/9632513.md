The PI will make modifications to his field-proven instrumentation and
participate in a summer campaign in 1996. The spectrometer used in the 1995
campaign will have improved sensitivity, allowing definitive measurements of
ratios between the neutral N2 and the ionized N2+ bands. This improved
sensitivity will be facilitated by using a higher gain image intensifier system,
which will "see" the night sky background. The PI will continue using the
spectrometer with vertical grating rulings to obtain spectrograms, which are
spatially resolved in the vertical direction, providing height resolved spectra.
The spectrometer will also be used in a special mode to obtain a coarse
resolution spectra of other commonly observed optical emission phenomena; the
