This dissertation study focuses on the character of production strategies in
10th to 14th Century Iceland in the context of foreign exchange, ecological
succession and climatic change. Field ethnography and other Icelandic research
on agriculture will be used to carry out a problem-oriented analysis of Medieval
documents on livestock production. This research will provide a valuable
critical analysis of historical data relating to the effects of climate change
and socioeconomic transformations over time.
