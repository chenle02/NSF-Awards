Plant survival and fecundity/productivity under stress conditions determine
species distribution in nature as well as agricultural output. The long term
goal of this research project is to define critical features of plant energy
metabolism that determine stress survival. The specific focus of the research
project is the control of respiration in plant mitochondria, which are critical
energy generating organelles in all organisms. A better understanding of the
regulation of mitochondrial components is needed to explain plant energy balance
and biomass accumulation. Because respiratory activity is part of the equation
determining plant productivity, understanding the control of plant respiration
may enable targeted manipulation of respiration to enhance productivity,
particularly under stress conditions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Experiments will be
performed to define the function of a class of proteins predicted to regulate
plant mitochondrial gene expression known as mTERFs, for mitochondrial
Transcription Termination Factors, using a combination of state-of-the-art
biochemistry and genetics in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The PI has
demonstrated that mutation of an mTERF protein (SHOT1) targeted to plant
mitochondria can enhance tolerance to high temperature stress apparently by
limiting oxidative damage. Experiments will define the molecular mechanism of
SHOT1 function, and go on to test how other mTERFs may also contribute to
control of respiration and plant stress tolerance. The project will provide
training in experimentation and communication for one postdoctoral scientist,
one graduate student and two undergraduates for each year of the award. The PI
will also engage in outreach activities to encourage teenage girls to consider
science as a career option and to inform the public about the scientific basis
of genetically modified plants. These talks will provide information in lay
terms on the underlying biochemistry and molecular biology of GMOs so that
individuals can make informed decisions about the technology.
