This project by the University of Michigan I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF
I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node
called I-Corps Midwest. I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of
Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana
Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely
suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural
communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity
around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with
sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer
discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to
leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by
building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active
and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline,
previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding
of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as
they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue
driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human
capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node
will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will
provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be
propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the
previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically
important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas
to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international
level.
