The primary goal of the project is to analyze the interactions between plasmas
and neutral particles by developing a three-fluid model. The three fluids are
free electrons, the ions and the neutrals. The coupling comes via collisions
among the different species and the electromagnetic field that connects
different regions of interest. The purpose of the analysis is to provide a more
physical and analytical understanding of the coupling. Rather than starting with
complicated equations and a realistic geometry the approach here will be to
conduct as much analytical analyses as possible. Additional terms and equations
and more realistic geometries will be gradually introduced when the simpler ones
are understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the theoretical analysis
will be applied to the coupling between the magnetosphere, the ionosphere and
the thermosphere, but the theoretical analysis could potentially be applied to
many areas of space and astrophysical plasma phenomena. In particular the work
has the potential to give new insight into the problem of chromospheric/coronal
heating. Much of the research will be carried out by a graduate student.
