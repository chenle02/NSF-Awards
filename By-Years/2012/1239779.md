The project will produce advances in the science and engineering of micro-
fabrication technology and the utilization of nanoscale materials to build
medical micro-devices. The research facility will provide engineers with
prototyping tools and nanoscale materials needed to reproducibly build miniature
devices. The devices will allow investigating new approaches to medical science
and enable critical in vivo measurements never made before. The facility offers
researchers a means to economically prototype next-generation devices and to
incorporate nanotechnology into biology and medicine. The first nanomaterials to
be used in the facility will be CNT arrays, ribbon, and yarn (that are already
available at UC) as well as commercially available magnetic nanoparticles. CNT
thread, made using cm long nanotubes, will be lightweight, stronger than steel,
pliable, inert, nontoxic, and electrically and thermally conductive. Initial
devices to be fabricated will utilize these materials for miniature carbon
electronics, electric motors, actuators, carbon wire, sensors, antennae, and
actuators for inside and outside the body. These microdevices will monitor and
repair the body in ways that were not possible before.
