This is an award to support a Phase II, Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) project, the objective of which is to determine the technical and
economic feasibility of a process to convert the clay fraction of paper-making
waste sludges into a product that is of sufficiently good quality to be reused
in the paper-making process. Phase I research, conducted under NSF Grant No.
88-60246, was successful in separating paper mill sludges into long fiber, short
fiber, clay and debris fractions. The long fiber fraction was determined to be
of comparable quality to that used in paper making and the recovered clay was
determined to be susceptible to improvement of brightness which would make it
more acceptable for reuse. In Phase II, the investigators plan to examine the
process developed in Phase I at a sufficiently large scale to provide the basis
for its engineering design and installation in a full-scale paper making plant.
Work will include improving the brightness of the clay fraction by bleaching and
other chemical processes and determination of the physical properties of the
clay fraction. Results of this research project are expected to be utilized in
engineering design of processes and systems for recovery of a large fraction of
the wood fibers and clays now used in making paper that are discarded and placed
in landfills. In addition to the economic benefits of reusing presently
discarded waste materials, recovery of the resource values from paper-making
sludges will reduce the volume that must now be provided for their storage.
