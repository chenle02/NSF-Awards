This conference will bring together experts in the areas of Topological Quantum
Field Theory, Hopf Algebras, Category Theory, Representation Theory, Knot
Theory, and Mathematical Physics. It will contribute to research in all of the
above subjects. Generally, such a conference will increase the knowledge of the
participants and could result in the invention of new theorems, interesting
conjectures, and fascinating generalizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential
feature of this conference is that it brings together people from many different
disciplines. Although these areas of mathematics and physics have impacted each
other often in the past, not all the researchers in a given field are fully
aware of the recent advances in the other ones. One goal of this conference is
to foster a dialogue between the researchers. The second goal of the meeting is
to help students, in particular graduate students, and recent Ph.Ds become
acquainted with the new areas of research. This will broaden their perspective
and will contribute to their mathematical careers, mathematical research, and
teaching. This conference encourages and supports participation of minorities
and women.&lt;br/&gt;
