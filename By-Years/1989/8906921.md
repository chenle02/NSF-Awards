The bond - forming initiation theory proposes that the tetramethylene
intermediates, encountered in the cycloaddition reaction of electron-rich with
electron-poor olefins, are also the true initiators for the spontaneous
polymerizations observed in these systems. Zwitterionic intermediates initiate
ionic homopolymerization of either donor and/or acceptor olefin, while diradical
intermediates initiate the radical copolymerization. In previous phases of this
project, this hypothesis has been proven for a zwitterionic and for a diradical
systems. This theory is now being extended to reactions of electron- rich dienes
with electron-poor olefins. It is proposed that the spontaneous polymerizations
which occur in many of these systems are initiated by a hexamethylene
intermediate, which can be either zwitterionic or diradical. In analogy with the
thermal reactions, the theory will also be extended to photoinduced
polymerization in electron-rich and electron-poor olefin systems. Here again, it
is proposed that a tetramethylene intermediate, zwitterionic or diradical, is
the initiator of the observed polymerizations.
