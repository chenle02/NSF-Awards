9353233 Gilbert, John This is a project for an 18-month Geometry Institute for
some 25 middle school teachers in the Austin area. The project is staffed in
part by 9 Austin area high school mathematics teachers who previously attended
an NSF-supported Regional Geometry Institute (RGI) in Utah. The 25 teachers are
drawn from middle schools that feed into high schools where the 9 RGI teachers
currently teach. The middle school teachers attend a 3-week summer program, as
well as regular Saturday follow-up meetings during the ensuing academic year.
This program will enable the participating teachers to strengthen the middle
school geometry program, and give their students a strong background for the
innovative geometry they will study later with the high school RGI teachers. ***
