In recent years, composite columns have been used to achieve greater efficiency
in many major structures in the United States. Simultaneously, the technology of
high strength concrete has advanced rapidly and several important structures
have been constructed using high strength concrete. The advantages of high
strength concrete and composite construction can be combined to achieve even
further efficiency, particularly in the columns. The combinations is composite
columns with high strength concrete. In these columns, the concrete will provide
extra and stability in compression and the steel will supply strength, stiffness
as well as ductility. The objectives of the research are to study behavior and
to develop guidelines for design of composite columns with high strength
concrete. The objectives will be met by conducting experiments and analyses on a
series of columns have configurations representative of those occurring in
practice. A total of sixteen specimens will be tested. The specimens will have W
shapes encased in the high strength concrete. Using the test results and
analytical correlations of the results, current design procedures for composite
columns will be modified or new procedures will be formulated.
