AST-0130790&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable continued operations of
the Kitt Peak 12m (KP12m) millimeter-wave telescope for 18 months while the
University of Arizona (UA) puts in place a plan to operate the facility using
private funds. The KP12m was formerly operated as a national user facility by
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). The UA and the Research
Corporation will also contribute funds toward operations during the
privatization period. The privatization plan calls for integration of the
operations of the KP12m and the Heinrich Hertz Telescope, a submillimeter
telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona, under a single director to reduce total
operating costs. The UA will seek other partners to form a consortium to operate
both telescopes for the longer term. The KP12m, though over 30 years old, has
continued to produce significant scientific results in recent years. The benefit
to science of successful privatization will be that a still useful telescope
will continue to enable research in millimeter astronomy, helping to maintain
the community of millimeter astronomers in the US as a prelude to ALMA (the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array). During the bridge period, telescope time will
be allocated to the general astronomical community in proportion to NSF's share
of the operations burden. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
