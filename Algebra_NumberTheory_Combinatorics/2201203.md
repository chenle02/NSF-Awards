This project concerns research at the interface of algebraic geometry in
mathematics and string theory in theoretical physics. Algebraic geometry is the
investigation of algebraic solutions of polynomial equations, the geometry of
the graphs of these solutions, and the theoretical structure describing their
properties. It has numerous applications in science and engineering, including
statistics, biology, and geometric modeling, as well as the application to
string theory being advanced in this project. String theory is a physical
theoretical framework for a unified field theory incorporating all the forces
and particles found in nature. String theory has found wide application beyond
unified field theory, including condensed matter physics, black hole physics,
and the application to mathematics being advanced in this project. The Principal
Investigator will involve graduate students and undergraduate students in
aspects of the project, assisting their professional development and
contributing to the development of the scientific workforce.

More specifically, a collection of interrelated questions at the interface of
string theory and singularity theory in algebraic geometry will be explored.
Within algebraic geometry, there are two major sets of problems. The first
pursues some open directions in the theory of canonical singularities of
threefolds, their crepant resolutions, and enumerative invariants of these
resolutions. The other direction is the study of the singularities of
elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds and their connection to Hodge theory
via the decomposition theorem. Within string theory, there are also two major
sets of problems. The first pursues the geometry of 5-dimensional superconformal
field theories and their moduli. The other direction is the development of the
properties of F-theory directly from its definition as Type IIB string theory
with varying axiodilaton without invoking duality. Connections between canonical
singularities and 5-dimensional superconformal field theories will be explored
and developed as well as the connection between Hodge theory and F-theory. The
project also includes investigation of additional topics in string theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
