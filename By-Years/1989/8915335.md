The objective of this project is to conduct research concerning the qualitative
properties of nonlinear systems, with emphasis on the theory of representations.
The research proposed concerns in part an interesting new type of representation
that is an extension of the familiar impulse-response representation for linear
systems. Applications involving, for example, stability theory and systems
governed by nonlinear differential equations are considered. Related nonlinear-
system research concerning representations, stability, iteration and
convergence, etc., is also pursued and this would bear on, for example,
nonlinear filtering for image processing. The tools to be used include topology,
functional analysis, and integration theory.
