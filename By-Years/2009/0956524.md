Professor Reginald M. Penner of the University of California, Irvine is
supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the
Division of Chemistry to investigate the fundamentals of metal nanowires and
their use as chemical and biological sensors. The PI has observed an anomalous
100-10,000% increase in the resistance of silver nanowires upon exposure to
ammonia vapor, and 70% increase when a single atomic layer is deposited on the
surface of gold nanowires. The goal of this proposal is to gain fundamental
understanding of this anomalous conduction behavior at nano dimensions, which
the PI believes is due to the infiltration of oxides into grain boundaries on
the metallic nanowires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guided by the gained knowledge,
single artificial grain boundaries that are optimized for chemical sensing will
be developed. These miniaturized constructs will be ideally suited for detection
within lab-on-a-chip analysis systems. This interdisciplinary research provides
excellent training for students in microfabrication, surface chemistry,
electrochemistry, solid-state physics, electronics, and analytical chemistry.
High school students from underrepresented minorities will be involved in this
research through an outreach plan. &lt;br/&gt;
