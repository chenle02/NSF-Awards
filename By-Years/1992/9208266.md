This proposal addresses the question of whether Solar variability can affect our
atmosphere through UV insolation. Effects have been found statistically (LBitzke
and Van Loon), but we do not know if these have physical causes or just
statiscal "quirks". The effect of solar ultraviolet (uv) insolation variations
on the troposphere and stratosphere will be investigated with a General
Circulation Modedl extending from the surface to 85 km. Solar uv variations at
wavelengths less than 0.3u will be input into the model in three situations: the
model control run (which has light cast tropical winds in the lower
stratosphere) and the two phases of the QBO (strong east winds and strong west
winds). The model simulations for the control, QBO experiments and increased uv
experiments will each be run for three years, in an attempt to separate the
solar impact from the interannual variability. The uv increase first utilized
will be large (50%) to clarify the nature of potential responses. Future
experiments will reduce the increase to 10%, and may alter the spectrum of the
increase, so that a greater percentage of the change is at the shortest
wavelengths. The goal of these experiments is to investgate and understand the
potential impact solar cycle variations may have on the troposphere and
stratosphere. The stratosphere is most likely to be directly affected, and the
method of any potential interaction with the troposphere will be closely
examined. Possible tropospheric impacts of interest include variations in jet
stream, storm track and the general synoptic climatology, all of which have been
reported in the literature but whose mechanism has yet to be identified.
Successful simulation of such responses, if they occur, will help validate the
observations, as well as the ability of coupled troposphere/stratosphere models
to simulate the dynamical interactions between these two regions.
