This project will study uniqueness and stability of solutions of well known
inverse problems. This problems arise in areas as diverse as geophysics,
electrical tomography, crack detection, earthquake prediction, and acoustic and
seismic prospecting. Fundamental mathematical issues will be studied through the
use of advanced techniques such as Carleman estimates and Calderon- Sylvester-
Uhlmann methods.
