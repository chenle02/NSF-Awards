This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant proposal. The
objective of the proposed research is to determine if the attainment of middle-
class status among Afro-American women reduces the influence of the effects of
family and other institutional relationships on natality and reproductive
behavior. Reviewer comments stated that this research will address questions and
issues of great anthropological significance and societal concern. Planning
grant funds will provide support for release time in order to allow the
investigator to pursue various scholarly activities associated with the planning
and development of a competitive research proposal for the MRI research
initiation component. During the planning period the principal investigator
plans to take courses in statistics, demography, and fertility in order to
acquire a needed understanding of the technical tools with which population and
natality studies are constructed.
