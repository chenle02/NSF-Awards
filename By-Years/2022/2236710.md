This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports research focused
on discovering a fundamental mechanism inside the cell nucleus that may
dramatically improve our understanding of how several degenerative diseases
associated with fibrosis occur and progress. Many pathological conditions inside
the human body are associated with an abnormal mechanical environment in the
tissues. Optimal mechanical force is required inside tissues to keep the cells
functional and healthy. This project will elucidate how the biological system's
healthy or pathological mechanical environment affects the structure and
function of cells and tissues through chromatin remodeling â€“ a novel epigenetic
determinant of gene expression inside the cell nucleus. This knowledge can
potentially provide new therapeutic strategies to treat a myriad of degenerative
diseases, such as fibrosis in the lungs, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and blood
vessels. The proposed research will be complemented by establishing a
comprehensive educational and outreach program based on curriculum enrichment,
quantitative biology training, and disseminating biomechanics knowledge in K-12
and students underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
discover how the tensile force at the tissue level reaches the intranuclear
space to remodel the chromatin and determine the gene expression. The
researchers will utilize high-resolution single cell microscopy, knowledge of
mechanics, and advanced image analysis techniques to answer several outstanding
questions in mechanobiology. The work will address: 1) how mechanical forces
drive chromatin remodeling and gene expression; 2) how the changes in chromatin
remodeling and gene expression affect the cell and tissue mechanical properties
that determine the tissue phenotype; and 3) how to intervene in the mechano-
epigenetic pathway to restore normalcy in degenerated cells or tissues. This
project will allow the PI to advance the boundaries of the existing knowledge in
chromatin mechanobiology, epigenetics, and gene expression mechanisms and
establish a long-term career in mechanobiology to solve various problems in life
sciences and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
