9603659 Peterjohn Recent declines in stratospheric ozone may expose native
plants to greater levels of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). While numerous
studies have investigated the potentially damaging effects of UV-B on
agricultural plants, few studies have examined how UV-B affects native plants or
important ecosystem processes. In this project, two field experiments will be
conducted to determine whether UV-B changes the chemical composition of native
plants in ways that alter the rate of nutrient release from decomposing plant
tissue. Decomposition of deal plant tissue is the major source of plant
nutrients in natural ecosystems, and changes in the rate of decomposition may
significantly alter soil fertility. Six species of native plants will be grown
under UV-B levels corresponding to a 0, 16, and 32% decrease in stratospheric
ozone. The effect of removing normal levels of UV-B will also be examined. Data
from this project will be used to test existing models of soil nutrient
dynamics. These models will then be used to evaluate whether the effects of a
major change in UV-B are likely to have an important impact on soil fertility.
