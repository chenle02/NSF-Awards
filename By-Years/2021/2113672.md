This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will
investigate the knowledge and data-driven and cyber-enabled tools needed to link
design and manufacturing, thereby enabling a cyber manufacturing marketplace
that identifies the on-demand manufacturing capabilities necessary for rapid
realization of product designs. Such a marketplace can democratize access to
“know-how” and means of production on a massive scale, by seamlessly connecting
designers with manufacturers in a broad platform of regional and global supply
chains and democratizing access to manufacturing capabilities without
compromising manufacturers’ “know-how” and trade
secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To realize this impact, it is necessary to (1)
create data-driven methods to harvest knowledge of manufacturing capabilities
that can transform a computer-aided design (CAD) into the desired physical
product, and (2) create methods to efficiently search for this knowledge through
the cyber infrastructure. The project hypothesizes that: (i) computing machines
can learn the manufacturing capabilities required to transform a CAD model into
the desired physical part from available design and manufacturing data, and (ii)
efficient cyber-enabled search of the required manufacturing capabilities for a
part design can be realized through statistical similarity-based search methods.
The hypothesis will be tested through innovative and convergent data-driven
approaches that utilize expertise in computer-aided design, manufacturing
science and technology, and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
