Semiconductor optoelectronics is becoming increasingly important in science and
engineering. It is therefore highly desirable that engineers and scientists
should be introduced to optoelectronics at an early stage in their careers. Much
of the relevant material can and should be incorporated in undergraduate
curricula. The Center for High Technology Materials at the University of New
Mexico, in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories, is conducting a seven
day workshop in semiconductor optoelectronics for twenty-five undergraduate
teaching faculty in university physics and engineering departments. The workshop
includes lectures, laboratory tours/demonstrations, and hands-on laboratory
sessions in epitaxy of III-V direct-gap semiconductors, fabrication, processing
and characterization of optoelectronic devices such as semiconductor injection
lasers, and application such as optical fiber communications. This project
facilitates the inclusion of semiconductor optoelectronics as an undergraduate
discipline by developing within faculty a basic knowledge and appreciation of
the subject, providing direct contact with some of the latest experimental and
theoretical advances, and by establishing and ongoing and mutually beneficial
interaction between undergraduate faculty and a national center of excellence in
the field.
