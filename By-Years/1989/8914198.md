It is proposed to hold the 42nd annual Gaseous Electronics Conference in Palo
Alto, California October 17-20, 1989. The Conference will provide a forum for
exchange of information on the basic physics and chemistry of ionized gases and
of macroscopic discharge phenomena, dealing with basic collisional, radiative
and plasma processes. Emphasis is given to the underlying processes that occur
in electric discharges, arcs, gas lasers, and weakly ionized plasma. A
substantial part of the program will be devoted to electron collisional
processes, especially electron impact excitation and ionization of atoms and
molecules in selected ground and excited states. A second area is the
characterization of the fundamental processes important in plasma processing
reactors for semiconductor manufacturing. Sessions are planned on (1) plasma
chemistry and processing, (2) heavy particle and excited state collisions, (3)
the use of plasmas for measuring fundamental data, (4) the argon/Xenon laser,
and (5) electron impact ionization.
