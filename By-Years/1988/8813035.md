This proposal on "Phase Equilibrium Studies: Si3 N4 - Metal Oxide Systems"
between Dr. Tseng-Yin Tien of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Dr.
Yan Dongsheng of the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, is jointly sponsored by NSF
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The investigators propose to perform phase
equilibrium studes in the silicon nitride - metal oxide systems. Such phase
equilibrium information is needed to understand material properties, and is the
basis for modifications and improvements in state-of-the-art materials and the
development of new materials. The two systems are being studied as potential
matrix materials for silicon carbide whisker reinforced composites.
Specifically, the investigators propose to obtain basic information needed for
developing transformation toughened silicon nitride ceramics continuing
zirconia.
