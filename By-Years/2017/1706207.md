This collaborative proposal by Dr. Shepard from Columbia University and an
international team of researchers from the UK, will develop an optical imaging
approach to study freely-behaving animals and potentially humans. The proposal
explores original and transformative approaches for overcoming current barriers
of functional imaging of the brain. If successful, the platform developed by
this project will be critical to many research projects, which will further
understanding of the functioning of the brain as well as various brain disease
mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach builds on the development of a
dense 3D lattice of emitters and detectors embedded onto ultra-narrow
implantable neural probes. The proposal includes 3 aims comprising (1) the
development of fully integrated high-density optogenetic stimulators, (2)
development of time-gated fluorescence detection of lens-free neuronal
recordings and (3) in vitro and in vivo characterization and validation of the
system. The work includes educational and outreach activities, including;
integration of educational material into courses on neuroscience, bioelectronics
and biophotonics at Columbia University and at St. Andrews.
