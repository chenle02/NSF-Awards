9353977 Hartman This is a two week workshop for faculty with limited access to
parallel computers. Participants learn to integrate parallel processing into
their courses. Tools include transputers, simulators, and a network connection
to a research center. Topics include parallel algorithms, design of parallel
programs, parallel architectures, integration of parallel processing into an
undergraduate computer curriculum, and methods for teaching parallel processing
to undergraduates. The workshop includes lectures and laboratory sessions
focusing on writing parallel programs and developing curriculum materials. The
participants are expected to develop an instructional unit on parallel computing
that they will teach in the 1994-95 academic year. ***
