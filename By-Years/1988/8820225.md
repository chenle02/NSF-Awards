This research program primarily involves laboratory studies related to
understanding the metal chemistry of the mesopause region of the atmosphere.
Specifically the work will be directed towards specific chemical reactions and
theoretical calculations associated with the formation and destruction of the
NaO4 molecule. In addition, other studies will investigate heterogeneous
chemistry and photosputtering of the alkali metal atoms, oxidation chemistry for
Fe and Mg and an expansion of the current model of sodium chemistry in the
mesopause region. Understanding of this topic is of great interest in the use of
high power lidar systems to study the structure and dynamics of the mesopause
and lower thermosphere.
