The systolic array is a paradigm for concurrent computation that is suited to
VLSI technology. Many algorithms (e.g., in digital signal processing and
scientific computation) are perfect candidates for implementation on systolic
arrays. We investigate fundamental systolic algorithms so that they can be
realized on systolic arrays that are provably time-minimal, and processor-
minimal. That is, we design arrays that operate systolically, fully exploit all
the parallelism in the algorithm, and do so using as few processors as possible.
The schedules for this kind of optimality often are nonlinear, and this is a
significant departure from the extant research on optimal affine schedules for
systolic algorithms. This research tells us what is the very best that we can
accomplish with systolic realizations of fundamental algorithms. The
investigation of a corresponding systolic programming system is also underway;
software tools are critical to the realization of systolic arrays' potential.
The systolic programming system is intended to be a natural and high-level
vehicle for conducting research into systolic algorithms, and for their optimal
realization on systolic arrays.
