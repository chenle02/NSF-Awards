The island of Borneo, and especially Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), is a major
phytogeographical region of great ecological and biodiversity importance;
however, its flora and fauna are poorly known. Unfortunately, the region is
undergoing rapid deforestation through commercial logging and swidden
agriculture. Thus, unknown species are potentially being lost to science and
others are undoubtedly being forced into extinction. Therefore, there is some
considerable urgency to collect the biota of Kalimantan. In this study,
collection and inventorying of the plant resources of Kalimantan will commence
through six plant- collecting expeditions especially to Bukit Baka/Bukit Raya
Reserve. A specimen database will be developed, and a field guide with keys will
be produced. The project involves extensive interaction with Indonesian
institutions including Herbarium Bogoriense. This project will form the basis
for extended floristic work throughout Kalimantan.
