Two laboratory courses are being developed which are giving undergraduate
Biology majors experience with state-of-the-art techniques in modern
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The project's focus is on preparing Hispanic
women and other minority and non-traditional students for careers in local
Biotechnology-based industries. Courses affected include (in addition to
Biochemistry) DNA Technology, Genetics and Immunology. Existing equipment for
spectrophotometry, ultracentrifugation and isotope counting is being
supplemented by essential additional electrophoretic and chromatographic
equipment obtained through this grant, making it possible to offer laboratory
work in courses where previously such opportunities were lacking.
