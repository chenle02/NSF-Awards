Significant advances in fundamental understandings of the complex interactions
of different components of the Earth system as they operate around the world
have highlighted the need for new and more effective ways to help people
visualize and understand the planet's myriad patterns and interactions. Advances
in holographic technology initially developed for medical uses offer intriguing
new possibilities for projecting dynamic data for the entire world on a three-
dimensional spherical projection surface. This new application will occur
through the development of a five-foot diameter holograph-like representation of
the surface of the Earth that appears to be suspended in the air. Through links
with advanced computational equipment, detailed displays of images and data for
atmospheric, oceanic, geologic, biological, and human components of the Earth's
dynamic systems will be projected onto the globe. An accompanying audio
narration will provide viewers with additional information. This globe initially
will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural
History, with its opening scheduled to coincide with the Smithsonian's 150th
birthday celebration in August 1996. After a number of months, the globe will be
relocated to a more permanent installation at Smithsonian's National Air and
Space Museum. The overall cost of constructing and displaying the globe is
estimated at about $1-million. This cost is being shared by a Federal-private
sector partnership that includes NSF, the Smithsonian Institution, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), Silicon Graphics, Inc., and Dimensional Media Associates (DMA). Through
this interagency agreement, NSF funds will be transferred to DARPA, which will
use them to supplement one or more standing contracts with DMA, a private firm
that is developing and constructing the globe. In addition to being viewed by
hundreds of thousands of museum visitors, all of whom will have an unmatched
opportunity to view, appreciate, and better understand the Earth's integrated
systems, the globe will be accessible to research scientists, who can explore
this sophisticated new technology in order to better understand how three-
dimensional media can be used to analyze and present data about global systems
more effectively.
