The objective of this research is the development of a photochemical flow
reactor linked to a high-performance liquid chromatograph. It is hoped that
continuous removal of product combined with recycle of the starting material can
make photochemical processing practical. (Single-pass photochemical reactors are
very inefficient when compared to modern thermal or catalytic reactors).
