The Coastal Laboratory Consortium, comprised of four North Carolina
Universities, operates degree granting programs in marine science research and
research training. This award will provide funding for the modernization of the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine Science.
Interdisciplinary research activities currently performed at the institute are
in five general areas: experimental analyses of ecological processes of sea
floor communities, biogeochemical cycling and productivity in coastal waters,
geology of sedimentary coastlines, ecology of coastal organisms and air and sea
interactions in near shore waters. The Institute of Marine Science attracts
visiting scientists from many institutions in the US and abroad, fostering
strong research collaborations. Both graduate and undergraduate students
participate in research training activities at the facility, including a large
percentage of minority studnets from historically minority colleges and
universities. Present conditions, at the 25 year old facility, are unsafe and
laboratories are inadequate for conducting research. The lack of climate
control, proper electrical and air supply, incubation facilities, clean rooms,
and modernized laboratory space adds to the problems researchers encounter
daily. Funds are requested to upgrade laboratory space that is designed to
accommodate sophisticated chemical, biotechnological, analytical research
activities and equipment. Modern research facilities at the Institute of Marine
Science will contribute to the productive research and research training within
the marine science programs of the consortium institutions and strengthen the
nation's scientific infrastructure.
