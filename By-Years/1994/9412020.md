9412020 Wise The School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University
will purchase a titanium:sapphire regenerative amplifier laser system which will
be dedicated to support research in engineering. The laser system will be used
for a variety of research projects, which will include: the study of the
electronic, optical and vibrational properties of IV-VI semiconductor
nanocrystals; characterization of the nonlinear response of glasses to
femtosecond laser pulses; studies to determine the underlying origins of
supercontinuum generation; and optical phase conjugation of femtosecond laser
pulses by stimulated librational scattering. ***
