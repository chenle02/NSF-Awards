0210839 Nanny This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
and Engineering Initiative NSF 01-157, category NIRT. The project will identify
key physical, chemical and biological conditions at the nano-scale that govern
the bioavailability of aromatic hydrocarbons associated with NOM isolated from
soils, sediments, and landfills. After NOM characterization and quantitation,
the impact of the localized molecular scale interactions, % hydrocarbon residue,
and activation energy of interactions will be assessed with respect to
bioavailability. Naphthalene dioxygenase activity will be characterized as a
function of NOM type and concentration and NOM-aromatic aging. Coupling to
microbial bioavailability will be made using bioluminescence reporting. An
outcome from the research will be the development of NMR based characterizations
that will correlate with an enzymatic assay and a microbial bioassay.
