This proposal develops an approach for extending what is known about individual
deviations from rationality to aid in understanding the behavior of financial
markets. The project therefore will help to provide a bridge from research
conducted with individuals in laboratory settings to real- world macro-
phenomenon based on the behavior of markets. Financial markets are important and
have been extensively studied from an institutional perspective, but very few
researchers have taken the perspective of the individual and examined the extent
to which deviations from rational, expected-utility behavior among individuals
might affect the aggregate behavior of markets. An extensive data set already is
in hand and early work on investor behavior appears to support the initial
hypotheses of the investigators. The researchers are excellent and they have
extensive experience on topics related to the focus of this proposal. Results of
the project should be of interest to behavioral decision theorists,
psychologists, and economists.
