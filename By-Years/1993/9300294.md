This award provides funds to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site program in the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. The program is designed to provide research
opportunities for students from primarily undergraduate institutions. The
Department will work in partnership with a select group of such schools,
including three minority institutions and a women's college, to provide their
students the kind of research experience only available at a major comprehensive
research university. This REU program will also complement and partially
supplement an internship program for MU students funded by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute. This program follows the successful completion of a Summer
1990 prototype project, funded by the University and a grant from the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute and 1991 and 1992 NSF-REU site grants. Faculty
participant's research programs center on the theme "Cellular, Molecular and
Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems," and utilize methodology ranging from
recombinant DNA technology, to immunocytochemistry, to sophisticated
electrophysiology. All participating faculty are personally involved in their
research projects, are well-funded, and have a history of successful
partnerships with undergraduate interns. The research experience is the
cornerstone of the summer program. Multiple and varied opportunities will be
provided for the students to develop their communication skills, and mentors
will help students present their research at local and regional scientific
meetings. Finally, a number of enrichment activities have been developed
including seminars by research faculty, informal evening programs, and a panel
discussion on graduate schools.
