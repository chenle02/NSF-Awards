This project involves laboratory studies designed to help elucidate the
mechanism of heterogeneous bromine and chlorine activation on ice surfaces.
Halogen chemistry is implicated in the destruction of boundary layer ozone at
high northern latitudes in spring. Proposed mechanisms in the literature involve
halogen chemistry, but require processes to maintain halogens in their active
forms. This work investigates the heterogeneous reactions of hypohalous acids
(HOBr and HOCl) with hydrohalic acids (HBr and HCl) on ice, and the role of
sulfur dioxide and dicarboxylic acids present on the ice surface. The reaction
probabilities will be investigated as functions of sulfur dioxide pressure,
temperature and acidity. This work will improve understanding not only of the
details of boundary layer ozone loss, but will also be relevant to understanding
the fate of atmospheric sulfur dioxide and the stability of dicarboxylic acids
in ice cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to contributing to understanding
in the area of boundary ozone loss chemistry, and gas-surface interaction
phenomena, this project will involve training of undergraduate, graduate, and
post-doctoral students in laboratory methods for studying heterogeneous
reactions.
