Multimedia laboratory software modules for a freshman-level non-major science
course entitled "The Age of Dinosaurs" is being developed. This course enrolls
several thousand students annually at over 20 U.S. colleges and universities.
The modules include high resolution, photographic-quality color images,
3-dimensional models, animations, sound, and text, coupled together with
'hyperlinks' to afford users easy access to all levels of remedial, basic, and
supplementary information. These modules are being published on CD-ROM suitable
for use on both Macintosh and MS/DOS computers.
