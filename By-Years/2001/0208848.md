The objective of the proposed research is to improve network security through an
innovative approach to vulnerability and resiliency analysis. Even well
administered networks are vulnerable to attacks due to the security
ramifications of offering a variety of combined services. That is, services that
are secure when offered in isolation nonetheless provide an attacker with
combined vulnerabilities to exploit when offered simultaneously. Security tools
such as COPS, System Scanner, and CyberCop, are excellent at identifying
specific, known, individual host vulnerabilities in services, software packages,
and configurations. What these methods do not address is the compound effect of
multiple vulnerabilities. The result is a serious problem because interactions
between vulnerabilities can easily cascade across a network. The risk posed by
each vulnerability may be judged either necessary or acceptable in isolation,
but the combination of these vulnerabilities can still turn out to compromise
the network as a whole in an unacceptable way. A limited amount of existing work
in vulnerability analysis addresses this problem, but the existing work falls
short in three key areas, namely resiliency analysis, all-paths analysis, and
inference engine analysis. The proposed work will improve network security by
addressing systematically each of these three areas.
