Dr. Atsuo Kuki is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Grant from The
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of
electron transfer in proteins and peptides. The understanding of this mechanism
is fundamental to the elucidation of the light harvesting chemical reactions
used in photosynthesis. A three pronged approach will be used to investigate the
light induced electron transfer mechanism in aromatic donor-acceptor covalent
complexes. First, model compounds containing short-range and long-range donor-
acceptor pairs will be synthesized. Second, light-induced electron transfer
kinetics of these synthetic compounds will be probed using picosecond
fluorescence and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Third, path
integral Monte Carlo simulations will be used to model the electronic
interactions and interpret the experimental observations for the systems being
studied.
