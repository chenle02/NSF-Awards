Commutative algebra is crucial in developing the foundations of algebraic
geometry. Two central topics of research in these fields are multiplicities and
the homological behavior of modules. This proposal concerns questions related to
these topics and especially their interplay. The first project involves studying
whether Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, an intriguing and not well-understood measure
of the complexity of a singularity in positive characteristic, has an
interpretation in characteristic zero where it could be simpler or clearer to
interpret geometrically (some known examples show that a limit as the
characteristic goes to infinity might exist and seems to be a simpler number).
The second concerns the homology of Koszul complexes, and although in this case
the approaches are not exclusively from the realm of complete intersection
rings, many of the same ideas arise since the Koszul complex is the first step
in constructing a Tate resolution. Many directions are being examined, with
several new approaches to old problems studied by Huneke, Simis, Vasconcelos and
many others. The third concerns an older conjecture in rational homotopy theory,
a field with which the ideas from resolutions of complete intersections and from
differential graded resolutions have a long history of interaction, but have not
yet been used for this particular problem; preliminary results of this approach
look encouraging. The fourth concerns Serre's intersection multiplicity over
non-regular rings.

These projects are at the center of some of the main directions in commutative
algebra, but with a view towards neighboring fields of mathematics or subfields
of algebra. For example, the first and main project concerns multiplicities,
which are numerical measures of the complexity of a non-smooth (that is, sharp)
point on a curve, surface, or higher dimensional object. The investigator is
especially interested in these in an algebraic or number theoretic setting that
is not directly related to the physical geometry of an object. Known results
show quite mysterious behavior of these numbers and the investigator hopes to
shed some light on the situation by relating the setting to a more geometric one
where classical geometric techniques might be applied. This is a delicate
procedure and work in progress. Likewise, the third project involves a problem
that would apply ideas from her abstract field of algebra to a part of topology,
a field which deals with physical spaces. In summary, although the subjects of
the projects are quite varied, they hold a common theme that may not be
immediately evident: Namely, the investigator proposes to apply her experience
in her own area to various problems further removed from this area and not
traditionally studied in this way.
