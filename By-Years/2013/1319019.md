Users today have access to a broad range of free, web-based social services. All
of these services operate under a similar model: Users entrust the service
provider with their personal information and content, and in return, the service
provider makes their service available for free by monetizing the user-provided
information and selling the results to third parties (e.g., advertisers). In
essence, users pay for these services by providing their data (i.e., giving up
their privacy) to the provider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is using cloud
computing to re-architect web-based services in order to enable end users to
regain privacy and control over their data. In this approach---a confederated
architecture---each user provides the computing resources necessary to support
her use of the service via cloud providers. All user data is encrypted and not
exposed to any third-parties, users retain control over their information, and
users access the service via a web browser as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
incredible popularity of today's web-based services has lead to significant
concerns over privacy and user control over data. Addressing these concerns
requires a re-thinking of the current popular web-based business models, and,
unfortunately, existing providers are dis-incentivized from doing so. The impact
of this project will potentially be felt by the millions of users who use
today's popular services, who will be provided with an alternative to the
business models of today.
