A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be established at the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The focus in this program is on astronomy
and astrophysics. The students will be chosen on a competitive basis from
applications from around the country but especially from the southern United
States. There are seven Astronomy Research Faculty at Alabama with whom the
students will become involved in doing active research projects. Through the use
of research activities and coordinated seminars on astronomy and research
techniques, good research skills will be developed in undergraduate science
students. Continued interest in astronomy will be emphasized and the students'
progress will be tracked through continued contact with the students after they
have participated in our program. The REU site will be operated during the
summers of 1993 and 1994.//
