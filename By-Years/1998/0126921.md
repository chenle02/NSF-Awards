The objectives of this project are (1) to integrate selected biochemical
concepts and methods and (2) to introduce project-oriented, student-designed
laboratories into the analytical course. An HPLC system and a UV-Visible
spectrophotometer are making this possible. Specific experiments and the project
laboratory approach are being adapted from the chemical education literature,
the primary chemistry literature, and application notes provided by
manufacturers. The proposed changes are correlated with a Departmental goal to
integrate biochemical concepts across the chemistry curriculum and toward a
college-wide effort for student-directed, individualized learning opportunities.
By incorporating biochemical concepts and group project experiments into the
analytical laboratory, student understanding of selected biochemical topics,
student ability to apply an analytical approach to biochemical problems, and
student capacity for working with other members of a group toward the solution
of a problem are being increased.
