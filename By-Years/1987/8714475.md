Research will be conducted on a diverse array of problems in Theoretical
Astrophysics. Topics within six broad areas will be investigated: (A) Galaxies
and Galaxy Clusters; (B) Stellar Dynamics and Numerical Techniques; (C) General
Relativity and the Generation of Gravitational Radiation; (D) Physics of Radio
Pulsars and Compact X-ray Sources; (E) The Interstellar Medium; and (F) Particle
Astrophysics and Cosmology. The borderlines between these areas of astrophysics
and of hydrodynamics, relativity and high energy physics will be emphasized.
Specific problems for investigation will be chosen for their astrophysical
relevance and physical content. Astrophysical objects which will be studied
include large, self-gravitating, N-body systems (galaxy clusters, galaxies,
relativistic star clusters, and globular clusters), compact stars (white dwarfs,
neutron stars and black holes), interstellar hydrogen, and density perturbations
in the early universe. Methods of analysis will extend from rather simple,
analytic model construction to large-scale computer calculations. The close
relationship between theory and observation will be emphasized.
