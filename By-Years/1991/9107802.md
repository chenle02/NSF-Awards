The objective of this research is to study the various energy exchange
processes occurring between the magnetosphere and low/mid latitude thermosphere
during magnetic storms. The study entails the measurement and interpretation of
optical emissions produced by the precipitation of ring current particles into
the low/mid latitude thermosphere. It is proposed to continue ground-based
optical observations at McDonald Observatory in southwest Texas using a set of
existing photometers and spectrometers. Physical processes to be studied from
such observations include the precipitation of energetic neutrals, ions, and
soft electron fluxes, the effects of ionospheric heating, ionization, and
excitation from such fluxes, and the distribution of ring current particles and
the ionospheric current systems associated with the precipitation.
