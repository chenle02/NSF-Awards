New data-analytic and concepts-based textbooks along with advances in
statistical software, and computer and multimedia technology now offer the
opportunity to rethink the way in which we teach statistics. Our goal is to
combine and augment these resources to develop a unified curriculum and
supporting materials for teaching statistical concepts and methods. We will
deliver: laboratory manuals designed as a bridge between standard texts and
computer software that will guide students through experiments that generate
data for analysis; video stories that take the student "into the field" to see
how data were collected and to help them understand the context of the data
analysis start-up materials to aid students, especially disadvantaged students,
use computers for statistics; a machine-readable encyclopedia of examples and
problems that will include data, descriptions of experiments, and computer-based
retrieval; a computer CD-ROM archive of edited "bites" from the video stories
and existing video materials keyed to specific statistical concepts and tied to
an instructional statistics program; and an experimental test of the effect of
early enrollment in statistics by minority students on their subsequent academic
performance and attitude towards science and mathematics. When this project is
complete, it will represent the first time that such a comprehensive package of
multimedia materials will be used in introductory statistics courses and made
available nationally.
