Many areas in animal behavior, including evolution of a) matings systems (e.g.
monogamy, polygamy); b) sexual selection (differences between the sexes that
make one sex better able to compete for the other sex - e.g., the peacock's
tail); and c) differences in male-female sexual behavior, have been profoundly
influenced by a paradigm known as "Bateman's Principle". In 1948, Bateman,
working with fruitflies, concluded that males compete for females - some males
gain many matings while others do not; most females do mate. Moreover, male
fertility increased with the number of mates, but female fertility did not.
These results were ascribed to the fact that males produce billions of sperm,
while females have relatively few eggs. Consequently, males should
indiscriminately try to mate with as many females as possible, but females
should be discriminating, sexually passive, and mate only with one "best" male.
Bateman predicted that females should favor monogamy, and males promiscuity.
Because males compete for females, sexual selection should be more important in
males. &lt;br/&gt;These ideas began to be questioned when modern data showed
that, in some species, these predictions do not fit. Some males may carefully
choose among females and even refuse to mate with "inferior" females. Presumably
monogamous females may actively seek copulations with multiple males, and
thereby increase their fertility.&lt;br/&gt;This symposium brings together
experts to evaluate which aspects of Bateman's Principles are still valid, and
how modern data on male-female sexual behavior and its effects on fertility may
impact our understanding of Bateman's paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;
