This Americas Program award will support a joint research between Dr. Richard
S. Dodd, of the University of California, Berkeley, Forest Products Laboratory
and Dr. Claudio Donoso, of the Universidad Austral de Chile. This research will
study the population genetic variability and systematics of three Chilean
conifers. The researchers will collect population samples of the three different
genera and use isozyme comparisons for the assessment of genetic diversity in
and among natural populations. They will also document patterns of variations
for morphological traits and use terpenoid profiles in providing a framework for
future genetic studies of these organisms. As a result of the world-wide growing
demand for timber, the integrity of forest ecosystems is seriously threatened.
This study will generate preliminary data that would provide the background for
preparing a comprehensive taxonomic assessment of the genera and provide
information useful for conservation and sustainable management of these timber
resources. The complementary expertise of the investigators in both the
techniques to be utilized and the biology and natural distribution of the plants
is an assurance that the project will achieve its goals.
