This grant provides funding for the continuation of an Research for
Undergraduate site at the Space Physics Research Laboratory of the University of
Michigan. The Space Physics Research Laboratory is a broad interdisciplinary
research organization which is part of the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space
Sciences academic department of the University of Michigan. Research undertaken
in the laboratory spans several fields of engineering and geophysical sciences,
with an emphasis on the observation and understanding of the physical processes
which control the gaseous, plasma and liquid envelopes of the Earth and
planetary bodies. The annual research budget of the laboratory is $9M and major
funding comes from the National Science Foundation and NASA as well as other
agencies. Because of the strong ties to the academic environment as the
University, and its presence within a geoscience department in the College of
Engineering, the Space Physics Research Laboratory has always maintained an
active interest in providing significant undergraduate and graduate research
opportunities, particularly in the area of Solar-Terrestrial research and
Aeronomy. The continued REU site will involve the direct participation of about
11 key faculty members (plus about 7 others) who have all had previous
experience with the training of undergraduate students in research on the REU
program on the SPRL. Funding is requested to provide support for approximately
12 students, of whom at least half will be from institutions other than the
University of Michigan. Because of its commitment to high- quality to
undergraduate education, the University has agreed to waive indirect cost on
this program. The rich variety and significance of the research carried out
within the Laboratory and the commitment of time on the part of the faculty
participants will provide the undergraduate of the program a significant
opportunity to have hands-on experience in active and exciting research.
