This conference will be held at the University of the Netherlands Antilles,
August 8-13, 1988. It is meant to inaugurate a fresh mathematical collaboration
between the University of Florida and the University of the Netherlands
Antilles, which in the long run will become a key component of a more general
scientific exchange between the U.S. and the Caribbean basin. Also, the
conference represents an opportunity to place ordered algebraic structures in an
international forum, providing an opportunity for those in the mathematically
underdeveloped Caribbean region to come into contact with an international array
of outstanding mathematicians. Attendance is expected from a number of younger
researchers from that area, and participant support is available. Ordered
algebra is an important component in the development of mathematics, drawing
from algebra, analysis, and topology, but also replete with techniques of its
own. It is enjoying a period of renewed interest and growth, making the subject
a timely one for a conference. The organizer of this conference is Professor
Jorge Martinez of the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida.
