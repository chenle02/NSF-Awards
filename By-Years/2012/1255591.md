While our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution has increased
enormously in recent years, some of the most important issues are still largely
unknown. In particular, the characterization of low mass, young galaxies in the
early universe remains one of the frontiers of astrophysics. Although we cannot
analyze their spectra until the advent of future ground and space-based
telescopes, we can learn a great deal about their physical conditions using
plausible analogs the more nearby universe. The PI will therefore identify and
study in detail the youngest and lowest mass galaxies at z~2, a redshift at
which the universe was only 20% of its current age, but at which galaxies are
still bright enough for detailed study. The PI will lead a comprehensive
campaign to measure metallicities and ionization parameters in low-mass galaxies
at z~2 from near-infrared spectra; determine the faint-end of the mass-
metallicity relation at z~2; and study gravitationally lensed
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's work will be centered at the University
of Wisconsin Milwaukee (UWM), an institution with a large undergraduate
population in an urban environment, and one with little previous presence in
astronomy. The PI is one of the faculty advisors of the undergraduate astronomy
club, which meets weekly and focuses on giving students the opportunity to
participate in real astronomical research through radio searches for pulsars.
She will also play a leading role in increasing the presence of astronomy at UWM
through curriculum development, outreach, and mentoring of students from under-
represented populations.
