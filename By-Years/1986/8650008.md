Some mathematics educators have taken the position that metacognition- knowledge
and beliefs about cognitive activity as well as awareness and control of that
knowledge-is critical to mathematical performance and that research in
mathematical problem solving would benefit from exploration of this phenomenon.
This project is designed to (1) investigate the relationship between inservice
middle school teachers' metacognitive activity and mathematical knowledge and
their problem- solving ability, and (2) improve teachers' problem-solving
ability through a problem-solving institute focusing on metacognitive knowledge
and experience in mathematical problem solving. Fifteen middle school teachers
enrolled in an institute on problem solving and thinking will be the subjects in
the study. Subjects will be videotaped solving unfamiliar problems before small
groups of their own students and will be tested for problem-solving performance
before and after the institute. Techniques for recording and analyzing
metacognitive activity are grounded in the work of Schoenfeld (1983), and
problem-solving performance will be evaluated using a process/ product scale
developed by Lucas et al.(1979) and Schultz (1985).
