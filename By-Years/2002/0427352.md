The Potomac Communication Group (PCG) proposes to conduct a critical research
study about how to best develop a design for creating and drafting a legacy
document for the Urban Systemic Program (USP). Over a two-year period, PCG plans
to accomplish this task by building on its existing relationship with and work
completed for the National Science Foundation, and in particular, over the last
year with the USP.

The prior work with the USP will greatly enhance PCG's ability to complete this
task. Over the past year, PCG assisted the USP districts with "message
development" as they prepared reports that documented the impact of the USP on
science and mathematics teaching and learning in their respective districts.
Therefore, lessons-learned from these efforts will be useful in researching and
designing a model approach for composing the legacy document for the USP.

PCG's goals are to:

1. Research, write, and produce a printed and electronic legacy document 2. Use
existing background data to conduct a thorough review of all resources critical
to the development of the legacy document 3. Develop a legacy document that will
document the attributions of the USP to the implementation of a higher quality
science and mathematics program in the funded districts 4. Create an outreach
program to share information from the legacy document with the education
community.
