9417085 Pang This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Dr. Jong-Shi Pang of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor Masao
Fukushima of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. The collaborators
will investigate various iterative methods for solving finite-dimensional
variational inequalities and complementarity problems that arise from
engineering and science applications and to gain a solid understanding of the
relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Important issues pertaining
to the variational inequalities and complementarity problems that are deemed
relevant to the design, analysis, and implementation of the iterative methods
will also be studied. This proposal brings together research scientists from two
countries working in the area of variational inequalities and complementarity
problems. By joining forces and combining resources, Drs. Pang and Fukushima
will solidify their research efforts, strengthen their individual research
programs, expand the scope of applications of the results, and establish a solid
base for further collaborations between the two host institutions. Therefore,
this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and
transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
