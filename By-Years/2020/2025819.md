The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a long-lasting antimicrobial and
antiviral solution for medical, military and consumer applications. Antibiotic
resistance has increased the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections, and the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. This
project seeks to mitigate these problems by developing a technology to
effectively decrease the transfer of bacteria and viruses via contaminated
surfaces. This antimicrobial surface coating technology kills pathogens and
minimizes their transport; it can be used in medical and healthcare institutions
to support contagion mitigation efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale up manufacturing
of a silver/zinc ion nanozeolite via a method to produce a spray product.
Formulations that can be easily and uniformly applied on soft and hard surfaces
by optimal choice of additives will be developed. Two unique features of the
spray are increased adhesion of the active nanozeolite to a surface as well as
the ability to predict when the activity of the nanozeolite is diminished by
visual observations, prompting the reapplication process. Uniform spreading of
the nanozeolite on a surface will be controlled by the viscosity of the spray
and the design of the pump sprayer. This project will demonstrate efficacy
against gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria, pathogenic fungi and
coronaviruses, as well as developing application
protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
