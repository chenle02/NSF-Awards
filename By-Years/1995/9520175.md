9520175 Harris This project seeks to understand the roles of symmetries and
pseudosymmetries in novel materials. One project concerns the study of the
magnetic symmetry of the lamellar copper oxide antiferromagnets, with a goal of
accounting for the observed magnetic anisotropy. Since these materials (when
suitable doped) give rise to high temperature superconductivity, this research
can have technological as well as intellectual payoffs. Another project concerns
the symmetry in Kagome antiferromagnets. Such systems are realized in structures
in which magnetic ions occupy lattice planes that are widely separated by
nonmagnetic ions. The principal investigator will attempt to answer the open
question as to whether there is long range order of any type in the quantum
ground state. If there is, it would probably involve a totally new and
interesting type of symmetry. %%% Symmetries play a crucial role as an aid in
interpreting and understanding materials. This research involves work in two
projects in which the symmetries involved are not well understood. Both projects
concern antiferromagnets, in which magnetic spins do not all align but rather
alternate in a regular pattern. The first addresses the magnetic symmetry in
lamellar copper oxides, which are materials that give rise to high temperature
superconductivity when they are doped. The second concerns the symmetry in a
quantum model on a special two dimensional lattice. If long range order is
present in this system in the absence of thermal disorder, this would probably
involve a totally new and interesting type of symmetry. ***
