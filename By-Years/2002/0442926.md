This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
Big Sky, Montana, September 4-9, 2005. This Gordon Research Conference is one of
the major meetings in this field. In 2005, the conference will cover a broad
range of areas in the atmospheric chemistry of clean and polluted environments:
including tropospheric chemistry - laboratory, field and theoretical studies,
upper troposphere/lower stratosphere - composition, chemistry and transport, and
remote sensing. The meeting will be limited to 150 persons in order to promote
vigorous and focused exchange. The registrants will be made up of a mixture of
established U.S. and international researchers and young scientists, among them
the participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging
Senior Scientists (ACCESS). The broader impacts of this Conference include
invaluable opportunities for interactions between scientists at all levels in
all major topical areas of interest in atmospheric chemistry.
