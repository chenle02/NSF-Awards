The National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council will convene a
workshop and undertake related activities that will review existing and proposed
intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes for databases and other collections
of information with special emphasis on science and technology as both users and
generators of such databases. The workshop will identify policy and legal
aspects of such regimes and asess their importance for science and technology;
identify and analyze benefits that might accrue to science and technology from
these regimes and issues that might impact science and technology negatively as
a result of such regimes; and develop conclusions and recommendations that might
assist in addressing these issues. The workshop is expected to include
presentations on the key issues; panel and general discussions; and development
of conclusions and recommendations. The workshop is expected to result in a
report to sponsors and to the research community.
