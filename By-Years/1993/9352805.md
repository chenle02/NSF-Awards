This project is developing an undergraduate laboratory using high speed
microcomputers and an ethernet network. The network bridges the institutional
Academic Computing Facility Network and the NSFNET/Internet. The laboratory
permits the department to significantly enhance its undergraduate curriculum at
the introductory and advanced levels. Also, four major objectives are being
emphasized. These include infusing content with hands-on laboratory exercises,
simulations, experiments, and research experiences, mathematically-based social
science courses, and the dissemination of results and products of the project.
Also, special efforts are being made to disseminate our results to historically
Black colleges and to other interested institutions via the institutional
Faculty Resources Network.
