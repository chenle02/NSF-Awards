A majority of the oxides of nitrogen which are produced in the atmosphere by
anthropogenic and natural processes is converted to nitric acid. Nitric acid is
ultimately removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition processes.
This surface loss of nitric acid and nitrate in aerosols is the major sink of
the oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Nitric acid is not only an important
species in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle, but it can also contribute
significantly to the acidity of precipitation. An understanding of the cycle of
nitric acid in the troposphere, and especially the processes and rates of
removal of this compounds from the atmosphere, is a current critical issue in
atmospheric chemistry. This project is the continuation aimed at obtaining an
improved understanding of the removal from the atmosphere of nitric acid by
land, water and plant surfaces. Sampling and analytical procedures have been
developed to permit direct field measurements of the dry deposition of nitric
acid. In the continuation of this research, field studies will be performed at
different locations to better define surface sinks of nitric acid and the cycle
of this compound through the continental or marine atmosphere.
