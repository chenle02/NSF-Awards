An experiment designed to connect quantum mechanical textbook examples and
concepts in optics with technologically important materials is being undertaken
in the upper-level undergraduate student laboratories. Using a versatile
spectrometer system and an efficient detector, students are performing
photoluminescence (optical emission), optical reflectivity, and Raman (inelastic
scattering of light) measurements on novel materials. Samples chosen for this
laboratory experiment are semiconductor quantum well heterostructures (QWH),
which are used in lasers and modern electronic devices; and C60, which has
potential applicatimns in several industries. The experiment on QWH is unique in
connecting a real physical system with the one-dimensional square well
potentials treated in elementary Quantum Mechanics or Modern Physics courses.
Similarly, the experiment on C60 serves to illustrate rudiments of optical
spectroscopy and its use in the characterization of new materials. These
experiments modernize the undergraduate curriculum and give the students a feel
for frontier research in new materials. The equipment has a long life span and
is adaptable for experiments on a wide variety of materials. The project
includes the use of the new equipment in two undergraduate laboratory courses
and also for undergraduate student research projects. Details of the experiments
and student experiences will be shared with interested colleagues at other
institutions through workshops, presentations at meetings and publications in
journals - American Journal of Physics and others.
