The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to alleviate issues related to
infant lactation, which impact the health of infants and breast-feeding women,
as well as the ability of the latter to contribute at high levels of
productivity in activities ranging from work to household chores. In the United
States, approximately 85% of mothers with healthy newborn infants express milk
within the first four months post-birth, and the majority do so using a breast
pump. Yet, the CDC reports that compliance with recommended breastfeeding
guidelines is less than 20%. Currently 62% of pump users report problems ranging
from insufficient milk extraction to infections. By providing an easier and more
comfortable means for pumping neonatal human milk, this project will assist
reaching recommended CDC guidelines thereby reducing risks of ear infection,
diabetes and intestinal and respiratory viruses in lactating infants and risks
of infection in breast-feeding women. By providing means for hands-free milk
extraction the technology enables women using breast pumps to remain high levels
productivity at home and at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
develops a compression based breast pump that improves efficiency and
effectiveness compared to current technologies. Pumps for extracting neonatal
human milk currently on the market only operate based on suction, leading to
discomfort and lower levels of production. The exclusive use of suction is one
of the biggest pitfalls of these pumps. In contrast, the technology being
proposed uses compression patterns focused on specific areas of the breast that
have been shown to be effective in scientific research. This is achieved by
closely mimicking motions recommended by lactation experts. The current
prototype can actuate to produce a rhythmic compression on a woman?s breast as
she pumps using a typical breast pump. The technology combines advances in the
fields of robotics, mechatronics, controls, software engineering, materials and
user-centered design with a focus on usability, comfort and ergonomics.
