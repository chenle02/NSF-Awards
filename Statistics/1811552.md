Increasing amounts of high-dimensional data are being collected and analyzed in
a diverse range of research areas. In practice, data scientists face significant
analytic challenges when exploring and understanding the complex and high-
dimensional data. Statistical inference of high-dimensional data is essential in
theoretical and applied research of statistics, biostatistics, econometrics,
geoscience, machine learning, signal processing, and many others. Big Data has
rapidly reshaped statistical modeling and revolutionized statistical analysis.
There exist many challenges and open problems, whose solutions require
innovative ideas and techniques. This project will address new challenges
arising in high-dimensional hypothesis testing.

Testing high-dimensional structural parameters plays a vital role in estimating
and quantifying uncertainty, making informed choices, and discovering knowledge
from Big Data. In this project, novel statistical methods and theory are
developed to study three important topics of high-dimensional hypothesis
testing: (1) power enhancement tests for high-dimensional covariance matrices,
(2) power enhancement tests for high-dimensional mean vectors, and (3) nonlinear
statistical dependence of high-dimensional data. The research outcomes will
provide powerful analytic tools for solving open problems in three research
topics. The methods and theory are general, and they can be directly extended to
address other important hypothesis testings for high-dimensional data such as
testing in high-dimensional spiked models. Software packages will be developed
to make the research outcomes readily available to other researchers and
practitioners.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
