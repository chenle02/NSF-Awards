This program will use the newly constructed POLARBEAR 3.5-meter-diameter off-
axis telescope near ALMA in Chile for observations of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization, in order to measure or constrain primordial
gravitational B-modes and CMB lensing. The data will be used to map large scale
structure and constrain neutrino masses and early dark energy models. The award
will fund both operation of the telescope and production of the scientific
results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
graduate students and a postdoc, collaboration with Chilean and Japanese
scientists, and outreach to low-income and under-represented high school
students.
