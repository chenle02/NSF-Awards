It is proposed to examine field, structural, petrologic, and geochemical
characteristics of several well-chosen plutonic bodies to test the applicability
of theoretical ideas of magma crystalli- zation and convection. Evidence for the
operation of Specific processes (e.g. boundary layer convection, side-wall
crystalli- zation, etc.) will be looked for in these granitic bodies. That is,
magma chamber dynamics models will be examined in the light of detailed studies
of well-exposed granitic plutons.
