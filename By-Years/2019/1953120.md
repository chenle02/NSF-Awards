Many problems in modern material science, chemistry, and cell biology involve
the structural changes at the microscopic level driven by external electrical
fields. A quantitative description must take into account the underlying
electronic structures and the induced atomic motions, leading to complex, large-
dimensional dynamical systems, for which direct simulations are expensive. This
project tackles this fundamental practical difficulty by developing efficient
mathematical models to significantly reduce the computational cost. The
reduction also enables the application of these models to much larger systems
that are of direct practical interest. The project also provides research
training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to develop reduced-order modeling techniques within the framework of ab
initio calculations. The goal is to avoid repeated calculations of the
electronic structures so that the overall computation can be drastically sped
up. Formulated as a Galerkin projection, the techniques project the electron
dynamics to subspaces with much fewer degrees of freedom, while still retaining
the important mapping between the external field and the dynamics of molecules
and atoms. A statistical approach is proposed so that the models be inferred
from a dataset containing atomic trajectories whenever they are available. This
project also includes applications to materials with complex compositions and
electrical properties of biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
