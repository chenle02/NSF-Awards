This is a research project in mathematical physics. The main focus is on
Schroedinger operators, which are basic to the modelling of physical systems at
the microscopic level. In particular, Professor Simon will investigate random
Schroedinger operators, in which the potential term (normally a function of
position) is a stochastic process. He and Professor Avron will also use
Schroedinger operators in constructing a theory of flux through networks.
Various topological problems that have arisen in mathematical physics, e.g.
concerning the set of hermitian matrices with nondegenerate eigenvalues, will be
attacked.
