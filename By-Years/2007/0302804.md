Abstract for award of Balog DMS-0302804

The proposed research areas are extremal graph theory and bootstrap percolation.
They are not far from each other, as many probabilistic tools are used in the
first one, and many combinatorial ideas are needed in the second one. The need
of computer science and demands from applications where discrete models play
more and more important roles, increase the importance of extremal graph theory
and suggests an algorithmic point of view. For about forty years now,
percolation theory has been an active area of research at the interface of
probability theory, combinatorics and physics. Interest in various aspects of
standard percolation remains high, including estimates of critical
probabilities. Lately more and more variants of the standard percolation models
have been studied, in particular, the family of processes known as bootstrap
percolation. Recent applications arise from different aspects, for example from
spatio-temporal dynamical systems. Computer experiments performed by physicists
have suggested interesting non-trivial large-scale behavior, and many deep
mathematical results have been proved about a number of models. The proposer is
aiming to study the percolation process at the critical probability.

The work of the proposer is an extension of Turan's Theorem into several
directions. One direction is to describe graph families which do not contain
certain induced subgraphs. The other is to study Turan type of questions on
hypergraphs, in particular on triple systems, and to develop general tools like
regularity and stability theorems. Bootstrap percolation, a member of the family
of random cellular automata, is a process on graphs, where each site is open or
closed with a certain probability, and these states are changing with time.
Studying bootstrap percolation, the main aim of the proposer is to describe the
phase transition, estimate the critical probability, and the size of the window
around the critical probability. The plan is to prove that the transitions are
sharp, and to investigate different models, whose understanding would be helpful
in the applications.
