9514619 Clark Learning and synaptic plasticity -- the modification of
communication between nerve cells -- play a central role in a wide variety of
cognitive and neuronal processes. Because a single neuron can make synaptic
contacts with thousands of other neurons, a fundamental question is whether
increases in synaptic strength are necessarily expressed cell-wide at all
connections of a given neuron, or can instead be synapse- specific and so occur
at only selected connections of the cell. To investigate synapse-specific
facilitation, this research program utilizes a favorable simple model system,
and focuses on cells known to exhibit learning-related increases in synaptic
strength. Studies will first determine whether long-term (&gt; 24 hr) as well-as
short-term increases in synaptic strength can be synapse-specific. This is a
critical issue, given that long-term facilitation appears to depend on changes
in gene expression. The neurotransmitter serotonin will be applied selectively
onto particular synapses in order to induce facilitation, and intracellular
electrophysiological recordings will be used to test whether synaptic
facilitation is greater at treated synapses compared with other synapses of the
same cell. Second, studies will investigate underlying cellular mechanisms.
These studies will provide new insights into the conceptual and mechanistic
relationships between short-term and long- term memory, and illuminate key
cellular and molecular steps underlying learning-related neuronal change.
