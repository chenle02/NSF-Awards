This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Alison Butler of the Chemistry Department, University
of California at Santa Barbara, on marine haloperoxidase enzymes. The
reactivities of vanadium bromoperoxidase and FeHeme bromoperoxidase, including
their roles in biosynthesis, will be investigated using functional model
complexes and enzyme studies. Vanadium complexes of alpha-helical peptides and
alpha-helical peptide bundles that closely resemble vanadium haloperoxidases
will be synthesized and tested. In addition some new mesoporous and titanium
dioxide materials will be prepared and tested for peroxidative halogenation
reactivity. Reactivity comparisons will be made to marine haloperoxides isolated
from chiral halogenated acetogenins and sesquiterpenes produced from marine
algae. The halide selectivity of vanadium haloperoxidases from algae that evolve
chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons will be investigated. Many marine
natural products and enzymes have important industrial applications in the
specialty chemical, diagnostics, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries.
Development of the use of some of these natural products has been inhibited by
lack of availability of sufficient quantities. This work will identify
functional mimics for some marine haloperoxidases present in marine algae. These
compounds have potential use as catalysts for production of oxidants and
halogenating agents in situ, processes that would be environmentally beneficial
alternatives to present technology.
