9312199 Asgill This research will study a data-selective purely digital timing
recovery scheme for OOK optical receiver. The computation of the timing updates
are made from the symbol-rate samples of the received signal. The proposed
Symbol-rate Sampling Technique (SST) offers the advantages of low hardware
complexity and low timing jitter. This is accomplished by determining the timing
function estimates only when certain data patterns occur. As such a ROM,
containing the coefficients of the adaptive filter, can be used in a table look-
up configuration. Preliminary computer simulations have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this technique, in particular its fast convergence rate. The
proposed research is expected to extend these preliminary results and study
further the convergence behavior of the technique, the effect of receiver noise,
fiber pulse spreading and data attributes on the system performance. ***
