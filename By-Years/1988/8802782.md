This proposal is a request for travel funds to present a paper on EVOLUTION OF
ONSHORE FACILITIES OF THE U.S. ANTARCTIC RESEARCH PROGRAM, at the International
Conference on Technology for Polar Areas, in Trondheim, Norway, June 15-17,
1988. The subject of the paper will provide useful information on technology
transfer from U.S. expertise to other countries, both in Antarctica and the
Arctic. The U.S. Antarctic Research Program has developed a sophisticated
remote-camp concept which yields maximum return of scientific results for the
logistics costs incurred. In addition, the station facilities of the U.S.
program support research projects currently funded at about $10-11 million a
year, with an additional $100 million incurred in logistics support.
