Community College Science Connection Conference The Community-Senior College
Science Connections conference will enhance collaboration and articulation
between community colleges and senior colleges in science and mathematics
education and teacher preparation. The conference seeks enhanced partnerships in
science and mathematics education at the undergraduate level and improved
student awareness of science and mathematics teaching as a career. The workshop
will focus on communication and cooperative interaction between 2- and 4-year
institutions in science and mathematics education and teacher preparation;
improved science and mathematics instruction in introductory science and
mathematics courses; baseline information on partnerships to share as a vital
career choice, and will generate regional groups to work for systemic impact.
The workshop will result in a report of partnerships and a proceedings of the
conference and the establishment of an Inernet home page for Community-Senior
College Science Connections information.
