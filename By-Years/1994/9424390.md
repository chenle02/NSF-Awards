ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9424390 P.I.: Alec B. Scranton The emission of
VOCs from curing inks, films, and coatings is a leading cause of atmospheric
pollution. VOCs impart desirable viscosity and cure rate properties to ink and
coating formulations. An ink or coating formulation must be sufficiently fluid
to be easily applied (often onto a rapidly moving substrate through a series of
transfer rollers), but must cure rapidly to a hard film. These demands have been
met through the use of rapidly evaporating organic solvent in the ink and
coating formulations. This work investigates the use of cationic
photopolymerization of diepoxides and bisvinyl ethers for such inks and
coatings. This process emits no VOCs. This is a fundamental experimental and
theoretical investigation of this process including developing detailed profiles
of the reaction temperature and the extent of reaction as well as the physical,
mechanical and thermal characterization of the final films. The principal
investigator is presenting the results of this research at a "Mr. Clean"
conference at Cocoa Beach, Florida on October 18-21, 1994.
