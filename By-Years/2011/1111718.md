The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor Richard Glass and his
coworkers at the University of Arizona for investigations designed to develop
cheap and efficient catalysts for storing energy from electricity in chemical
bonds, particularly for the production of H2 from water. Design of catalysts
inspired by exceptionally efficient hydrogenase enzymes containing earth
abundant Fe and Ni centers are the focus of this work. New basic science in
which organic redox centers are coupled with diiron and bimetallic catalytic
centers will be explored. Complementary synthetic, spectroscopic
characterization, and electrochemical evaluation studies will be carried out.
Understanding of intramolecular electron-transfer will result from the
mechanistic approach taken in this work. The development of novel catalytic
materials, coupled with an understanding of how these materials operate in the
solar energy driven generation of hydrogen, will result from these studies.
These new materials could have a major impact on alternative energy production,
and on the supply of clean sources of energy.
