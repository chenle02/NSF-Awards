The concentrations of the trace metals MN, FE, Co and Cu are higher at ocean
margins than in the deep oceans. These higher concentrations may both act to
increase primary production locally and be a source (via horizontal transport)
of these metals for the gyre areas of the deep oceans. This research will study
the role of sediments as a primary source for these trace elements. The fluxes
of metals of from the sediments will be studied both insitu (with special
sampling devices) and on board ship using carefully sampled portions of sediment
from the same areas. The water column will also be sampled from the dissolved
and particulate forms of these elements in order to provide additional
information needed for methmatical models describing the distribution of these
elements.
