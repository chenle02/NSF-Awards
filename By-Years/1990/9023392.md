Network location problems occur when new facilities must be located on a
network such as a road network, and the network distances between new and
existing facilities are important, due to travel or transport between
facilities. Other networks of interest include air corridor or sea corridor
networks, river networks, or electrical networks. Such problems occur on a large
scale in urban, regional. or geographic contexts, where there may be literally
hundreds of thousands (or more) of existing facilities, in which case it is
common to aggregate existing facilities, e.g., represent all the existing
facility locations within a zip code area by a single location. This aggregation
makes the size of the problem more manageable for data collection and data
processing purposes, as well as for purposes of analysis. At the same time, this
aggregation introduces errors, and results in an approximating problem being
solved instead of the actual problem of interest. Currently there is very little
theory for doing aggregation, or for evaluating the results of aggregation. Most
approaches are based on experimentation or computational studies. This is a
project to develop theory to improve the means available for doing aggregation.
The project has the potential to enhance greatly the ability to solve important
facility planning problems that occur increasingly in our complex society.//
