Interdisciplinary (99) This is a supplement to award DUE 0087150, "Completion of
Case Studies for the 'Learning through Technology' website (LT2). This website
is being designed on the basis of research and is relatively timeless in its
approach to explaining the effective use of educational technology. Early
feedback indicates that there is a strongly felt need for this resource among
reform-ready SMET faculty. In this final phase, our work is bringing all of the
planned sections of the website to a full-use threshold, which we define to mean
the lowest level of completeness needed to be useful to reform ready SMET-
faculty.
