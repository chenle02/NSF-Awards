One focus of this research is a mechanistic study to determine if a complex
forms that delivers interhalogens to alkenes when xenon difluoride, amine.HF
reagents of boron trifluoride serve as the source of fluorine. In a second part
of the research, the ionic and/or ion-radical addition reactions of
perfluoroalkenes will be probed. In both instances, undergraduates will form a
major part of the research team. With this renewal Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of
Dr. Dale F. Shellhamer of the Department of Chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene
College. Professor Shellhamer will focus his work on the study of the mechanism
of organic reactions. Studying the generation of interhalogen fluorides and the
ionic reactions of perfluoroalkenes provides an excellent venue for the training
of undergraduate chemists.
