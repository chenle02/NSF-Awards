EIA-0203960 Marty A. Humphrey University of Virginia Legion-G: Delivering a
Scalable and Secure Programming Model for Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
date, Grid computing lacks a secure, persistent, fault-tolerant, Grid-enabled
object model that is standards-based and interoperable with the isolated Grid
computing solutions that are emerging from the work in the Global Grid Forum.
Grid-enabled objects must be dynamically instantiated and located, and users and
administrators need to be able to better visualize performance and debugging,
and graphically move objects across Grid boundaries. This project addresses
these problems with three contributions. First, the lack of flexibility will be
solved via the creation of Legion-G, a revolutionary "applications-level"
interface of Legion to Globus. Second, new scheduling support for components
across Grids will be developed. This "Continuous Scheduling" modeling will
facilitate faster customization and more powerful, dynamic control of Grid-based
component applications, resulting in higher performance and productivity. Third,
the Grid Debugging Visualizer (GDV) will give Grid systems administrators and
Grid users more precise, real-time information regarding the timing errors and
functional errors of the component-based Grid computations.&lt;br/&gt;
