This proposal employs ion implantation and ion beam mixing as a means of
alloying low work function elements into surface regions of substrates. Such
surfaces should exhibit high secondary electron yields. Proposed research will
explore the introduction of selected elements (e.g., barium and cesium) into the
emitting surfaces. Potential applications include photomultipliers, electron
multipliers, and channeltron-type devices.
