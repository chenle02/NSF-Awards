This grant covers Accelerator Physics research and development by Professor
Hand at Cornell University. He will study the laser-stimulated emission of
electrons from the surface of a superconducting RF cavity. The technique has the
potential for creating the most intense electron sources with the smallest phase
space. Applications to electron linacs will be studied.
