This project organizes a Symposium of Alumni of the National Science Foundation
EHR/ DUE Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and
Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) program. Complementing the work of another group
which will provide logistical support for the meeting, the Women in Engineering
ProActive Network (WEPAN) is overseeing a program to: 1. highlight and share
best practices in effective mentoring; 2. inform the development of a pilot web
portal/virtual community designed to increase communication among members of the
PAESMEM community and make their work more accessible to the general public and
to serve as a repository of the meetings' products; and 3.engage meeting
participants in interactive discussion and planning toward further expansion and
dissemination of best practices.
