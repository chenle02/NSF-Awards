As atmospheric relative humidity cycles, saline aerosols exist either as ionic
salts, or as aqueous ionic solution. Supersaturated and undersaturated phase
change typically demonstrate hysteresis behavior as a function of relative
humidity. The (increasing) RH at which the phase transition abruptly changes
from solid particle to a saturated aqueous solution is the deliquescence
relative humidity (DRH). The decreasing RH that drying aqueous droplets remain
as supersaturated sols until crystallization, is the efflorescence relative
humidity (ERH). Efflorescence may differ based on the nucleation mechanism,
either by contact with a seed, or immersion of that seed into the supersaturated
droplet. The objective of a series of laboratory investigations is to further
study contact efflorescence compared to immersion efflorescence on aerosol types
and sizes representative of atmospheric particles. Aerosol phase changes in a
single droplet optical trap will be used to systematically follow efflorescence
mechanisms.

The importance of accounting for aerosol particle phase changes includes effects
on heterogeneous chemical processes, light scattering, and cloud formation and
precipitation. Direct effects on homogeneous (gas phase) chemistry and climate
also remain uncertain.
