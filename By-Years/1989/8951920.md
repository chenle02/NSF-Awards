Microcomputers will be integrated into the biology curriculum at Ursinus
College. Initially these computers will be used by students in five laboratory
courses: General Biology, Human Anatomy and Physiology, Animal Physiology,
Neurobiology, and Quantitative Biology. Included is a request for IBM PS/s
microcomputers and compatible plug- in boards. This combination permits the
capture and analysis of signals from a broad range of biological
instrumentation. Laboratory exercises in these courses are designed around
working groups of four to five students, and sufficient equipment has been
included to meet this need. Computer-assisted signal acquisition and data
analysis has become commonplace in scientific experimentation. Computer literacy
is an important component of undergraduate science education. The most
productive approach is student experience with on-line computer- assisted
laboratory experimentation. This achieves the goals of realistic data-gathering
in a laboratory setting, and repeated use of computers in a variety of different
courses. The project is significant because undergraduate students will be
instructed in the use of contemporary data acquisition and analysis in the life
sciences. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
