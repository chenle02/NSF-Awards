The objectives of this research are to overlay lightning ground flash locations
on two radar reflectivity patterns in Doppler derived motions. This will provide
a way to study the lightning characteristics and locations with respect to high
reflectivity patterns and vorticity centers in mesocyclones. One hypothesis of
charged separation in thunderstorms will be examined by determining if the
lightning locations cluster near high gradient dBz values, a region known to
have high velocity updrafts and downdrafts. In addition, an objective of this
research is to examine the 1989 lightning/data for the contiguous United States.
This study will examine the variation of the peak current, polarity, and
lightning flash densities as a function of geographical position and season.
