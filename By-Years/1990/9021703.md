The role of epigenetic regulation of the calcium dependent cell adhesion
molecule, N-cadherin, in cell adhesion will be studied in the chick neural
retina. Biochemical studies will be performed to describe the post-translational
modification of N- cadherin by phosphorylation and sulfation and the
relationship of these post-translational modifications to N-cadherin function
will be determined. More generally, these studies will define mechanisms
involved in cell-cell interactions that are important to the development of
neuronal specificity.
