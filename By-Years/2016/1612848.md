As a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds research and
innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. In this project, the
primary goal of Geo-literacy Education in Micronesia is to demonstrate the
potential for effective intergenerational, informal learning and development of
geo-literacy through an Informal STEM Learning Team (ISLT) model for Pacific
island communities. This will be accomplished by means of a suite of six
informal learning modules that blend local/Indigenous approaches, Western STEM
knowledge systems, and active learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
be implemented across 12 select communities in the Republic of Palau, the
Federated States of Micronesia - which consists of the four States of Chuuk,
Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap - and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Jointly,
these entities are referred to as the Freely Associated States (FAS). Geo-
literacy refers to combining both local knowledge and Western STEM into a
synthesized understanding of the world as a set of interconnected, dynamic
physical, biological, and social systems, and using this integrated knowledge to
make informed decisions. Applications include natural resource management,
conservation, and disaster risk reduction. The project will: (1) demonstrate
that the recruitment and development of an ISLT model is an effective method of
engaging communities in geo-literacy activities; (2) increase geo-literacy
knowledge and advocacy skills of ISLT participants; (3) produce and disseminate
geo-literacy educational materials and resources (e.g., place-based teaching
guides, geospatial data systems, educational apps, 2-D and 3-D models, and
digital maps); and (4) provide evidence that FAS residents use these geo-
literacy educational materials and resources to positively influence decision-
making.
