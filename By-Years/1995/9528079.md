9528079 Vaina This project is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. The
feasibility of new approaches to vision applied to recognition problems of use
to the visually impaired is investigated. These approaches combine coarse,
easily obtainable, visual data with novel adaptive learning algorithms to
recognize features such as moving objects and terrain irregularities. The
results of this research project will be feasibility study as to the robustness
and practicality of this approach in developing a "magic hat" - an aid to the
visually impaired consisting of a sensor and computation ring that would be worn
by users as a hat and which adaptively warn the user of hazards. ***
