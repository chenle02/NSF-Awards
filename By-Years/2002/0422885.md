The Pueblo of Laguna Department of Education will implement a comprehensive
project for teachers and students that will incorporate Geographic Information
Technologies (GIT) into the curricula of several tribal schools serving American
Indian students, primarily by providing extensive professional development to a
cadre of 20 teachers (2-3 per school). Teachers will receive at least 120 hours
of training each year of the project, with 80 hours accomplished during annual
summer workshops. Additionally, each year a team of five students from each
school will be selected to participate in a Summer Institute, where they will
receive a concentrated orientation to the Geographic Information Technologies
field. Over the three-year grant period, 120 students will participate in the
summer institutes. The teachers, in workshops and with students in the
institutes, will develop their knowledge and skills in utilizing GIT tools and
resources and in incorporating GIT into their curricula. They will potentially
involve 2,400+ students in project-related, GIT-infused, problem-solving
activities in their classes
