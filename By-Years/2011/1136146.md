A CPS is a system in which computer-based (?cyber?) technology is combined with
all kinds of physical systems, such as planes and robotic-surgeons. CPSs require
integration (in industry and academia) of different types of knowledge from many
different domains. CPSs are built from often inaccurate, undependable
components, and operate in harsh and unpredictable environments. The cyber
domain, interfaces, and the physical domain are tightly interwoven and networked
(distributed) and hence cannot be designed and optimized individually. The goal
of this project is to create a general CPS design-science that makes the design
of every CPS simpler, faster, and more dependable, while at the same time
reducing the cost and the required expertise level. This project gives rise to a
unified theory that can allow for specification, modeling, design, optimization,
and verification of CPSs on different levels of design abstraction and different
steps of projection, even across boundaries between varied technologies. The
project does bridge the gap between the continuous-time physical domain and the
discrete timed cyber system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has a
broad and profound impact in scientific, engineering, industrial, and academic
communities. By enabling a fundamentally efficient design of CPSs, the most
limiting bottleneck in design technology is eliminated, paving the way for many
new applications and jobs with significant economic and social impact. This
project contributes to the on-line educational endeavors currently underway,
allowing cross education in different disciplines of complex CPS and speeding up
development of new CPS programs in engineering and computer science.
