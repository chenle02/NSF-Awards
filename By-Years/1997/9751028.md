This project is upgrading the undergraduate teaching and research facilities in
the Geography/Geology Department. This upgrade is being accomplished with a
complete x-ray diffraction (XRD) system. The XRD system being acquired is a
Rigaku MiniFlex+ package, including a heat exchanger, computer system, software
to carry out searches of the ICDD files, and the licensing fee to use the ICDD
files. This system is propelling undergraduate student education and research
into the realm of modern instrumentation. All of the geology and environmental
studies (earth science option) majors are being introduced to x-ray theory and
analysis throughout their tenure. This instrument is being used in introductory
geology classes as well as in upper-level classes for majors. This instrument is
being used in classes on mineralogy, sedimentology, and soils, as well as in
senior research, which is required of majors. The quality of undergraduate
education and research is being greatly enhanced by the addition of an XRD
laboratory and is leading to better preparation of students for graduate school
or careers in government and industry. *
