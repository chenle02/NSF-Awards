Graft copolymers represent an important class of network-forming surface active
polymers because they can be produced easily from synethetic and naturally-
occurring homopolymers such as poly (vinyl alcohol), cellulose derivatives, etc.
In this study, self-aggregation and network formation of surface-active graft
copolymers in aqueous solutions will be investigated. The results of this study
should provide the basis for designing unique dispersed-phase membranes and
hydrogels which are selective to solutes based on solute hydrophobicity rather
than size. These novel materials are expected to be advantageous in a broad
spectrum of separations applications.
