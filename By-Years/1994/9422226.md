9422226 Klaiber About one-half of the approximately 600,000 highway bridges in
the United States were built before 1940 and many have not been adequately
maintained. Deterioration caused by environmental factors has added to the
problem. According to the FHWA, 40% of the nation's bridges are classified as
deficient and in need of rehabilitation or replacement. In lieu of replacement
in numerous instances strengthening has been determined to be a cost- effective
alternative. Many researchers institutes, university, and consulting offices
have developed various efficient bridge rehabilitation and strengthening
procedures. To provide a forum for disseminating "tried and true" rehabilitation
and strengthening procedures practicing bridge engineers, an NSF- sponsored
symposium was held in Des Moines, Iowa in April 1993. There is need for a second
bridge strengthening/rehabilitation symposium in that there are still major
bridge problems and a considerable amount of design and research has been
completed within the last two years. Therefore, a second symposium, open to all
interested engineers, will be followed by a workshop of invited participants to
formulate a manual on bridge strengthening and rehabilitation based on the
presentations at both symposiums. The final manual will be prepared by the
symposium steering committee and made available to designers in both public and
private practice. ***
