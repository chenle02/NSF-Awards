Intellectual Merit: The project entails a re-analysis of a 3-d multichannel
seismic data set obtained from the Lucky Strike volcano, Mid-Atlantic Ridge
during the French-sponsored SISMOMAR cruise in 2005, and data from a larger-
scale ocean bottom seismic tomographic experiment in the same region. The
original analysis of these data by a French-led group shows clear evidence for
an extensive magma lens beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In order to look at
finer-scale structure, and particularly to distinguish between melt-rich vs
crystal-laden sections of the magma body (a question of great importance to the
marine geoscience community), the PIs intend to employ a prestack imaging
approach which requires detailed knowledge of shallow crustal structure. The
method proposed to achieve this, SOBE (synthetic ocean bottom experiment) should
enable high resolution tomography of multichannel seismic data. This is a wave
equation solution that extrapolates sources and receivers to the seafloor and
enables detection of the shallowest refracted arrivals recorded on the MCS
streamer that otherwise are hidden in the water waves. SOBE should provide
vertical resolution on the order of 10s of meters to provide the structural
controls required for prestack imaging, and should also make it possible to
highlight the upper crustal fluid pathways and fractures that may be linking
melt-rich zones to the hydrothermal vent fields. If the SOBE method can be
proven through the analysis of this existing data set, it has the potential to
transform marine multichannel seismic investigations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader impacts include capacity building
for MCS data analysis and interpretation, and distribution of visualization
products for public viewing through the RidgeView website, and at an HD stereo
projection theatre at the Paine Forum. The project includes research and
training experiences for a graduate student to be split funded between US and
French institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
