In association with the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow (CoCoRaHS)
Network, this project is providing professional educators affiliated 4-H clubs
with training and resources to involve large numbers of upper elementary and
secondary school students in citizen science, monitoring temperature and
precipitation. The project involves a collaboration among five organizations:
the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI), which has a specialty in Earth
system research partnerships; Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) NY State 4-H,
which will be the focus for project development and the conduit for national
dissemination; the Northeast Regional Climate Center, which maintains a large
database of GIS-based regional climate information, including for NY State; the
Cornell Institute for Resource Information Systems, which specializes in
application of GPS/GIS methods to spatial data such as climate data; and
CoCoRaHS itself, which is based at Colorado State University. PRI geoscience
educators are providing professional development, lesson plans, and equipment
for NY State 4-H educators, coordinating the resources of each of the respective
organizations. Students participating in 4-H programs are being guided by their
volunteer leaders, who in turn have been trained by 4-H professional educators,
to monitor high spatial resolution data on precipitation that is important
scientifically; over time these data may reflect climate change and will be
tightly tied to the environment of their respective 4-H communities. The project
deliverables include age-appropriate curricula adapted to the needs of 4-H clubs
and their communities. The programming is being prototyped in New York State,
with goals of sustaining the NY programming while working toward national
implementation in the next phase of the project.
