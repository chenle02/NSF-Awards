Glycophorins are among the best studied mammalian integral membrane proteins,
and yet, very little is known about their functions or about the regulation of
expression of variant glycophorin forms. This research will focus primarily on
the development of approaches to the study of expression and function of
glycophorin. A transfection system will be developed for high levels of cell
surface expression of the introduced gene in NIH/3T3 cells. The establishment of
such a system will make it possible to test hypothesized roles of
sialoglycoproteins in the cell. The long term goal of this project is to
establish more detailed information on the basic biology of glycophorins as
membrane proteins. Glycophorins are collectively the major class of
sialoglycoprotein on the surface of mature red blood cells, and are extremely
well characterized in terms of protein and carbohydrate chemistry. Glycophorin
has been implicated as a factor in a number of diseases (e.g., as the receptor
for entry of malaria parasites into the erythrocyte). Surprisingly, very little
is known of its function(s) in the cell. These studies, if successful, will pave
the way toward understanding the biology of glycophorins.
