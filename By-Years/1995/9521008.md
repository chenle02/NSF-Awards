In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Gregory Gellene of the Chemistry Department of Texas Tech University
will pursue investigations on the symmetry- induced kinetic isotope effect, a
new mechanism in ion-molcule reactions. Symmetry correlations between reactants
and the interaction region of the potential energy surface, based on nuclear
conformations and isotopc substitutions, have been fruitful in revealing new
effects in chemical reactions. This research attempts to provide answers to
questions such as can the likelihood of a chemical reaction be affected by the
symmetry of the nuclear motions of the reactants, and how is the macroscopic
rate of a reaction modified by altering the symmetry of a system through
isotopic substitution. The symmetry-induced kinetic isotope effect is a sofar
little recognized effect in physical chemistry. The work done by Professor
Gellene has demonstrated that this effect is not only real, but can be quite
large. This effect appears to play a significant role in the ozone chemistry of
the earth's atmosphere, as well as in laboratory situations. This research will
explore further this effect with the aim to bring about an improved model for
chemical reaction theory.
