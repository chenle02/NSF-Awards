This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to observe the microwave spectra of binary and higher order clusters containing
rare gas and small molecular species. This research provides the data necessary
to understand the chemical bonding, dynamics and structure of these simple
molecular species. In addition unique nozzle designs necessary for the
simultaneous pyrolytic decompositon and expansion of a molecule to yield
reaction intermediates will be developed. Among the species to be studied are
argon clusters with HF containing up to five argon atoms and 6 HF molecular
units, carbon dioxide dimers and clusters containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen
cyanide. Nozzle designs will be developed to directly observe reaction
intermediates which have been simultaneously formed by pyrolysis and cooled by
supersonic cooling. This expansion in a rare gas bath will both simplify the
observed spectrum and isolate the reactive intermediate. Species to be studied
include some silicon carbon prototypical molecules.
