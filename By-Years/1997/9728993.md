The PI seeks to understand the dynamics of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere
(MLT) regions of the Arctic and Antarctic, particularly emphasizing processes
originating at lower altitudes. Primarily, he focuses on phenomena involving the
origins and seasonal behaviors of (a) the 12-hour oscillation with zonal
wavenumber s=1, (b) the migrating diurnal tide, (c) eastward-propagating waves
with periods between 1.5 and 10 days, and (d) intradiurnal oscillations with
periods between 6 and 11.5 hours. Using the Global-Scale Wave Model and
nonlinear time-dependent Spectral Dynamics Model, the investigator ascertains
likely mechanisms responsible for these polar-region wave phenomena. In
addition, he conducts data analysis from global satellites on ozone densities,
which will help ascertain whether insolation absorption by ozone possesses
sufficient local time and longitudinal variations to affect the semidiurnal tide
observed in polar mesopause regions.
