This rewsearch is on simulating MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) circuits which
integrate analog and digital components. He proposes an algorithm which
partitions a network of large-scale circuits into numerous small-scale
subcircuits which are resistively isolated from each other. The algorithm
creates a unidirectional signal path graph for the circuit. Once this is done,
the global circuit simulation is decoupled into individual subcircuit analyses
by following the depth levels in the graph. Part of the simulation uses event-
driven relaxation, which is a combination of event-driven simulation and wave-
form relaxation. He is investigating a special purpose analog simulator to
analyze analog behavior. Another problem is algorithms which use piece- wise
linear timing analysis to efficiently and accurately estimate digital subcircuit
response.
