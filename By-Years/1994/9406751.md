9406751 Antoy The object of this project is to develop the theory and
applications of a narrowing strategy that extends the recently discovered notion
of needed narrowing for inductively sequential systems to constructor based
strongly sequential and weakly orthogonal systems. Needed narrowing will be
implemented as it applies to functional logic languages for a prototypical and
portable integration of function and predicates. The efficiency of this
implementation will be compared with that of other implementations of narrowing
previously proposed for the same purpose. ***
