This project supports travel for 27 students in robotics from traditionally
underrepresented groups, including minorities and people with disabilities. The
researchers will participate in the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS)
conference, along with its associated workshops, which runs June 26-30, 2018 in
Pittsburgh, PA. The students will be mentored both through being paired with
senior PhD students and postdocs and participation in a mentorship breakfast led
by the RSS conference chair. By exposing early career researchers from
underrepresented groups to this type of intellectual environment, they will be
better able to be situated in the robotics field and get better ideas for the
type and quality of research needed to have impact in the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
