The University of California Davis is awarded a grant to acquire and deploy
specialized receiver/antenna units that will enable automated animal telemetry
at the Quail Ridge Natural Reserve using the existing wireless communications
towers. The project will also enhance the wireless communications at the UC
Davis West Campus Reserve (Putah Creek) and establish a compatible telemetry
receiver network at that site. The proposed system is compatible with a diverse
range of available radio transmitter devices and will allow researchers visiting
the sites to pursue continuous, real-time animal movement and physiological
studies that would be technically difficult or impossible in settings without an
extensive off-grid communications infrastructure. A key objective of the
automated telemetry program at Quail Ridge will be the integration of animal
movement information from the reserve into the NSF-funded Movebank database.

Automated animal telemetry systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to study
animal movement, interaction, and physiology. With such systems, signals from
tiny transmitters attached to individuals are detected by a network of
receivers, which interpret signal strength and direction to determine real-time
animal location and activity; the transmitters may also communicate
physiological parameters such as body temperature and heart rate. Data collected
by the network are then streamed to the web, where researchers, instructors and
students have instant access. In spite of the enormous potential of automated
telemetry networks, very few operational systems exist. The daunting investment
necessary to establish such a system, given the challenges of constructing
receiver towers, providing electric power, and building a functional
communications network in a remote setting, has greatly limited their
implementation.
