This action funds Sahid L. Rosado Lausell of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project, entitled "Role of sunlight on
virus survival in tropical waters," during the summer of 2012 at National
University of Singapore in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Karina Gin.

This research seeks to determine the presence of human pathogenic viruses and
their survivability in water environments. Results permit microbial risk
assessments in surface waters to be made and contamination prevention strategies
to be addressed, to prevent contamination of surface waters by and thereby
reduce infections. More importantly, if this research and its techniques are
adopted on a global scale, better water quality could be guaranteed to world
populations, thus reducing waterborne diseases worldwide.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
