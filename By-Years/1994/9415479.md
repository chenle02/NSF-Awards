9415479 Morejohn This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. The project is
a fishing expedition for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in plants, using
a high-risk, innovative approach based on the production of anti-idiotypic
antibodies as reagents for identifying putative MAPs. %%% In animal systems, a
lot is known about microtubule- associated proteins (MAPs), in terms of both
protein structure and functions. These MAPs play critical roles in stabilizing
microtubules and regulating the assembly and disassembly of microtubules. In
plants, a generally accepted identification of any MAP has not yet been
achieved. Since microtubules play critical roles in the fundamental life
processes of plant cells, and since they are the targets of action of an
important class of herbicides, there is compelling reason to increase our
understanding of microtubule structure and function in plants, including the
identification of MAPs. This project is a high-risk but plausible approach to
the identification of plant MAPs. ***
