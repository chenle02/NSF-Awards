This project is a collaborative study of political participa- tion in China
using data collected late in 1990. The study is expected to measure the modes
and levels of political participation, and impacts of socioeconomic status,
institu- tional affiliation, political history, and political attitude on
individual political behavior. It will not only examine the modes of political
participation aimed at influencing the decision-making process of the
government, as identified by Verba, Nie, and Kim, but also try to explore
additional modes which may be used to influence the policy implementation stage.
This study will serve as an important basis for understanding political
participation in China and will be useful in future comparative studies of
political systems.
