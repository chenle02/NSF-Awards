One of the major features of the modern economy is that individuals specialize
in production and sometimes in consumption, and that the trading sector plays an
important role in intermediation between producers and consumers. This project
will investigate two problems of the economy with specialized producers and
consumers: one is on the trading process and the other is about business cycle.
The first problem explores (i) how the monetary exchange system facilitates
matching between producers and consumers, and how it is related with the degree
of specialization of the economy, and (ii) how different monetary regimes and
monetary policy rules affect the behavior of macroeconomic variables and social
welfare. The performance of different monetary systems will be analyzed using a
framework in which the use of monetary exchange and the degree of specialization
are endogenously determined. The second problem to be explored involves
analyzing (i) how price setting behavior of monopolistic producers affects the
cyclical property of macroeconomic variables, and (ii) how product innovation
interacts with the business cycle, and particularly how the research and
development activity by firms can be an important source of business
fluctuations.
