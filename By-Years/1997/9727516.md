9727516 Poeppelmeier The preparation of new materials is one of the most
challenging problems in modern solid-state chemistry. The research objective
over the period of the next three years is to synthesize a large number of mixed
metal oxyfluorides prepared from (hydrogen fluoride) x pyridine/pyridine/water
solution (150 degrees centigrade, autoclave autogenous pressure) using metal
oxides as reagents. The "composition space" approach will establish individual
regions of stability (crystallization fields) and enable the selective
crystallization of different phases within each system studied. Structures are
expected which range from polynuclear clusters to one dimensional chains, two-
dimensional layers and three dimensional frameworks. The hydrolytic chemistry of
multi-cation precursors, templating methodology, and pH controlled oxolation
(polyanions) and olation (polycations) reaction chemistry under study will
advance our understanding of inorganic chemistry. %%% The design of inorganic
solids is the important step in the development of materials that enhance our
living standards. Research is proposed to develop new methodologies for
inorganic chemistry leading to more complex inorganic solids compared to those
that are presently available for use in computers, automobiles and as catalysts
in the chemical and petroleum industry. ***
