SUNY College at New Paltz will improve an undergraduate electron microscopy
program for the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics, as well
as a newly organized School of Engineering. The college will purchase a Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM), model JSM- 840 manufactured by JEOL. The primary
application of the SEM will be to shift from the old, descriptive, morphological
applications to current, quantitative, analytical uses of the SEM. This will
impact on 1) E.M. courses for science and engineering majors; 2) the
undergraduate research program; 3) programs for non-majors, specifically, the
general education program; and 4) community outreach to other colleges,
community colleges and high schools. This project will upgrade a program in
electron microscopy, and provide undergraduate science, engineering and science
education majors with the necessary technical background and analytical skills
to be competitive for graduate programs at major universities or to go directly
into the scientific workforce in science, medicine, industry or public
education.
