The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved programs and faster
computers have generated a need for still faster machines. Experienced users
wish to solve larger and larger problems of more and more relevance to the
experimental chemist. Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these results,
are compelled to become new users. The acquisition of state-of-the-art
computational equipment is essential to the modern chemistry department carrying
out frontier research as well as training the next generation of chemists. The
Department of Chemistry of the California State University (CSU), Sacramento
will use this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, jointly-
supported by the Chemical Instrumentation Program, the Instrumentation for
Materials Research Program and the Division of Advanced Scientific Computing, to
help acquire an advanced research computer that will be available to chemistry
faculty throughout the nineteen CSU campuses. The acquisition of the computer
will help to train and involve udergraduates in modern computer methodology and
will enhance research in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Quantum chemistry
of solids 2) Brownian dynamics simulations of semi-rigid macromolecules 3)
Molecular orbital studies of tubercostatic thioamides 4) Ab initio calculations
on fluorine and silicon containing molecules 5) Gaussian and MNDO molecular
orbital calculations on cage polyboranes 6) Molecular orbital calculations of
the reaction path for the thermolysis of dioxetanes.
