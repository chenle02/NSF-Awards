In many scientific and engineering applications, it is necessary to solve an
inverse problem; that is, to determine quantities defining an object or a system
through indirect measurements. The mathematics used to produce images in devices
such as X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are
excellent examples. The mathematical models describing an inverse problem are
often so complicated that it is not possible to find an exact analytical
solution, and it is necessary to use an approximation based on a set of simpler
equations. However, many equations may be needed; in medical imaging, for
example, it is not unusual to compute approximations by solving millions of
equations. Additional complications arise because an inverse problem may have
infinitely many solutions, or the solutions may change dramatically if there are
small errors in the indirect measurements. Thus, additional constraints and
mathematical tools (often referred to as regularization) are needed to narrow
the search to a set of appropriate feasible solutions, and to stabilize the
computations. The type and amount of regularization is problem dependent,
requiring the algorithms to be able to easily adapt to user and/or problem
specifications. The aim of this project is develop a flexible and adaptable
computational platform that can be used for this important class of problems,
which arise in many application areas, including space object identification,
geophysics, microscopy and medical imaging. Thus advancements made from this
project have the potential to benefit national defense, energy exploration, and
human health. Efficient iterative methods to compute regularized solutions of
large-scale discrete ill-posed inverse problems will be developed. The approach
will use flexible Krylov subspace iterative methods, and will exploit low-rank
structure of data, solutions and operators. The approach will allow to
incorporate a variety of regularization techniques, including sparse and low-
rank constraints on the solution. The methods developed in this project can be
used as tools to obtain approximate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems, and
optimized implementations will be included in a new MATLAB package called IR
Tools (Iterative Regularization Tools).
