This award provides partial support of the 2004 Gordon Conference on
Bioanalytical Sensors to be held at Queen's College, Oxford University, July
4th-9th, 2004. Efforts to develop new or improved bioanalytical sensors have
focused on two main themes. One is the creation of sensors that transduce
biomolecular recognition events into an electronic signal; the amplitude or
other properties of the signal can then be used as a measure of the presence and
amount of the molecules participating in the recognition event. These sensors
require the marriage of biological molecules or cells with electronic platforms.
The other main theme is the use of sensors to advance our understanding living
systems, including cells, organs, and whole organisms. Sensors of both types
have become important in areas as diverse as environmental monitoring and
clinical medicine. This year's conference will address single molecule
detection, the use of nano- and mesoscale materials in sensor construction, and
complex macromolecular and cellular interactions. Speakers will present the
latest advances in enzyme, antibody, and receptor-based biosensors, DNA chips
and protein arrays, optical sensing, and nano- and microfluidics. This is the
first time the conference has been held outside the US and, as a result,
increased participation by non-US researchers is expected The funds provided by
the award will be used to cover the cost of travel and conference fees for young
scientists (students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors) active in
the field of bioanalytical sensors who a) will participate in the conference as
an invited speaker or presenter of a contributed poster and b) would otherwise
be unable to attend the conference.
