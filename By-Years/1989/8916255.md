Meiobenthic animals are thought to interfere with larval recruitment of large
marine animals known as macrobenthos, both as they settle and subsequently as
the young juveniles mature and occupy sediments. The nature of this "meiofaunal
bottleneck" is poorly understood except for some experimental evidence from
sandy sediments that some turbellarians eat settled larvae. Experiments will be
undertaken to test the effect of functionally different meiobenthos on the
success of macrofaunal larval settlement, juvenile movement, and juvenile growth
and survival. In both laboratory and field experiments functionally different
kinds of larval macrofauna will be allowed to settle with functionally different
meiobenthos to determine if one more meiobenthic type inhibits or enhances
larval settlement. In the laboratory, metamorphosed macrofauna will be allowed
to migrate from meiofaunal patches to test the effect of meiofauna on juvenile
emigration and dispersion. Additionally selected macrobenthic juveniles will be
forced to live with different meiofauna to determine the effect on juvenile
survivorship and growth. The experiments are designed to predict early
macrofaunal recruitment, growth, and survivorship in the presence of
functionally different meiobenthos.
