Workshop on International Strategy and Policy for Cyber Security

Abstract

The PI is organizing a workshop to involve the community on research problems at
the intersection of policy (International and associated with industry),
individuals? privacy, and security. Future cyber threats are likely to come from
nation states, terrorist organizations, organized crime, or adversaries bent on
industrial espionage, all of who are likely to be well funded, aware of their
targets? weaknesses, and cyber-intelligent. Defenses against attacks will be
driven by the needs of the organizations the target of the attack, including
Government and industry, but also must respect privacy needs.

The purpose of this workshop is to involve the communities concerned with
security and privacy research, international policy (which will help determine
the kinds of cyber defense needed), legal issues, economics (to help determine
under what conditions security defense ? and privacy needs ? are likely to be
implemented by industry).

It is anticipated that the workshop will stimulate discussions and research on
technological and diplomatic options for mitigating cyber threats and reducing
security-related vulnerabilities.
