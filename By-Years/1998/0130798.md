EIA-0130798 &lt;br/&gt;Miroslav Martinovic&lt;br/&gt;The College of New
Jersey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Research Resources: Purpose-Driven Natural
Language Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unifying theme of the three
projects (WHAT, QASTIIR, and Hopewell) is the integration of methodologies of
computational linguistics with statistical techniques and their cooperative
application to question answering and information retrieval systems. QASTIIR
(Question Answering System Through Intelligent Information Retrieval) considers
where and when techniques of computational linguistics could best improve
performance of a hybrid statistical/linguistic question answering system. WHAT
(Web Host Access Tool) addresses client-side personalization of web search
queries, exploiting semantics to disambiguate keyword meaning. The Hopewell
project automates K-12 curriculum mapping (essentially a digital library of
curriculum resources achieved through teacher consensus). NLP/IR techniques
should reduce the need for middle layer expertise to manipulate map databases.
All three projects address how to disambiguate logical and set expression
queries. QASTIIR takes the most theoretical approach, developing theory through
established protocols for testing. The WHAT domain provides a highly ambiguous
real-world domain using well established databases. Hopewell project provides a
second real-world domain whose semantics are more constrained, but that requires
a database design responsive to novice querying. Anticipated outcomes are (1)
new theory development in natural language processing, (2) highly private user
profile development, (3) application of NLP technology to digital library
development and retrieval. &lt;br/&gt;
