9458047 Kouvetakis The design and synthesis of new organic/inorganic materials
that are of value in microelectronics, optoelectronics, and ceramics is
proposed. Emphasis is placed on precursor molecules that incorporate the
stoichiometry and structural architecture, and having facile reaction pathways
that lead to metastable and equilibrium phases with potentially unique
properties. Our intergrated approach involving synthetic chemistry, physical
chemistry, and chemical engineering is important to the development of new CVD
and solution polymerization processes. %%% ***
