This proposal is to request supplemental funding to support a collaborative
project between the I/UCRC Center for Advancement Knowledge Enablement (CAKE) at
Florida International University (FIU), and the I/UCRC Center for Autonomic
Computing (CAC) at the University of Florida (UF).

This TIE proposal brings together the two centers in a synergistic project that
investigates, on one hand, the benefits of applying autonomic computing
principles to the management of Web-based geospatial infrastructures, and on the
other hand, provides autonomic computing researchers with access to data and
expertise in the context of a rich IT environment representative of an important
class of Web applications, thereby helping conduct quantitative, experimental
systems research.

The proposed collaborative study will provide direct benefit to the I/UCRC
stakeholders (industry partners) and help recruit additional members. Member
organizations that provide servers, server software, and data center services
would benefit from a direct technology transfer; and their customers in turn
would thereby benefit indirectly, from the improved application performance that
would result from acquisition of software and services. The successful
completion of this work will, therefore, aid companies and universities by
allowing them to be able to tap into this powerful tool and not have to invent
and deploy the same solution for their own organizations to utilize.
