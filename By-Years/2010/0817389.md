Engineering Other - (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the rate of technological
change growing rapidly and technological systems becoming increasingly complex,
engineers capable of designing adaptable systems from both a systems level and a
component level are needed for the US to remain competitive. Addressing this
problem requires a transformative change in engineering education. Thus, a long-
term goal of this project is to make this transformation a reality across the
nation. Short-term goals of the project include the development of Technology
Leaders, a transportable interdisciplinary program that will prepare engineers
and technicians to lead geographically-distributed teams in the designing and
building of multiscale agile systems. Building on prior work at the University
of Virginia, Central Virginia Community College, and the Learning Factory at
Penn State, the Technology Leaders program will integrate three elements: a new
interdisciplinary, design-focused undergraduate curriculum; the hands-on
Multiscale Agile Systems Technology Lab (MAST Lab); and applied summer
educational experiences for students.
