The Secretary-General of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics
(IUGG) will be supported for a two-year period. The Secretary-General (SG) will
function as a member of the IUGG Bureau over this period. The IUGG has the
overarching scientific objective of improving scientific understanding in seven
geosciences disciplines while at the same time working to assure that the
results of the research that is conducted under the broad IUGG umbrellas can be
applied to important societal and economic needs such as those generated by
natural hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven IUGG International Associations
address geodesy (IAG); geomagnetism and aeronomy IAGA); hydrological sciences
IAHS); meteorology and atmospheric sciences (IAMAS); the physical sciences of
the ocean (IAPSO); seismology and the physics of the Earth's interior (IASPEI);
and volcanology and the chemistry of the Earth's interior
(IAVCEI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These associations will convene meetings ranging
from large international conferences and symposia to small focused scientific
workshops and planning meetings. The associations will encourage full access by
scientists from all countries to such international meetings and will strongly
encourage and promote full international exchange of scientific data and
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IUGG and its associations will continue to
provide opportunities for scientists from developing countries to interact with
their colleagues in the U.S. and other industrialized economies. The Secretary-
General will also serve as a liaison between the IUGG and the U.S. National
Committee for the IUGG, thus helping to build especially effective
communications between the U.S. National Committee and the IUGG.&lt;br/&gt;
