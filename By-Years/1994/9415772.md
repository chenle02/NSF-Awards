In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Roseanne J. Sension of the Chemistry Department of the University of
Michigan will investigate the redistribution of energy in condensed phase
reactions of small polyene molecules, and the influence of solvent parameters on
this redistribution. Simple diene and triene species which serve as prototypes
of complex bioorganic molecules will be investigated . Specifically, femtosecond
absorption spectroscopy will be used to investigate the cis-trans isomerization
reactions of 1,3,5-hexatriene, 2,4-hexadiene, 1,3-butadiene, and the
electrocyclic ring opening reaction of cyclohexadiene. The detailed mechanism of
chemical transformation in fluid environments remains among the most important
unresolved problems in chemistry. While much attention has been given to
chemical reaction dynamics of isolated molecules in low pressure gas phase
systems, the majority of interesting reactions from a biological,
environmental,, or engineering perspective, occur in fluid condensed phase
environments. The research done in this project will attack some of these
problems in order to meet two goals. 1) To develop a detailed understanding of
the role that the electronic structure of polyenes plays in their
photochemistry, and 2) to develop a detailed understanding of the role that
energy redistribution plays in controlling polyene reactions since this is the
ultimate factor in most, if not all, chemical reactions, be they in condensed
phases or in isolated molecules. The principles deduced from the studies carried
out in this research on prototype molecules will have application to general
condensed phase reaction dynamics.
