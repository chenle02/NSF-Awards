This project is creating an outcomes assessment instrument to identify
engineering student misconceptions in thermal and transport science courses,
such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer. The
instrument focuses on misconceptions concerning fundamental molecular-level and
atomic-level phenomena, including heat, light, diffusion, chemical reactions,
and electricity, which differ in significant ways from observable, macroscopic
causal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important student misconceptions
identified by surveying experienced engineering faculty are validated through
student interviews for inclusion in a multiple-choice pencil-and-paper
instrument patterned after successful misconception instruments such as the
Force Concept Inventory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument is being field
tested to demonstrate its validity and reliability and its usefulness for both
course-level and program-level assessment of student misconceptions in thermal
and transport science topics. The instrument is designed to allow for pre-
testing (at the beginning of a course or curriculum) and post-testing (at the
end of a course or curriculum) to measure changes in student mental model
development.
