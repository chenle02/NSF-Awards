Dr. Kargon, a historian of science, Dr. Schoenberger, a geographer, and Dr.
Leslie, a historian of technology, are collaborating in a study of the
development of science- technology-industry regional complexes or growth
centers. They are developing detailed pictures of two prototypes--"Silicon
Valley" in the Santa Clara Valley of California and Route 128 around Boston--and
then examining the origins and development of three attempts to follow their
example. These three case studies will be the Princeton New Jersey corridor, the
New York Capital region surrounding Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New
York, and the Boulder-Denver corridor of Colorado. By examining the prototypes
and then three attempts to copy them, these investigators how to be able to fill
gaps in our understanding of the dynamics of these growth centers and their
evolution, and to illuminate the more general problem of the construction of
agglomeration economies as they are influenced by the scientific-technical
frontier, the social and industrial histories of the specific locale, and the
structure of the industry. These studies should also address significant issues
concerning the science-technology relationship and governmental- industrial-
academic interactions in the critically important post-World War II period, 1945
to the present.
