This award to the University of Kentucky's Department of Geological Sciences is
made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire microcomputers, software, TV monitors,
overhead projection and digitizing tablets, and a printer. The University is
committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The equipment
will be used in the University's undergraduate sophomore-level course in
mineralogy, where it will be developed for use in laboratory computerized
instruction in crystal chemistry, crystal morphology, atomic structure, mineral
identification, x-ray diffraction methods, optical microscopy and phase
equilibrium studies.
