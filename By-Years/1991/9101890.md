This award will allow continuation of a scientific collabo- ration between the
Biochemistry Departments of the University of Maryland at Baltimore and the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The investigators are Guiseppi Inesi
(U.S.) and Leopoldo deMeis (Brazil). The research is aimed at a clarification of
the mechanism of ATP dependent calcium transport across biological membranes.
The experimental system will consist of membrane vesicles derived from
sarcoplasmic reticulum, and obtained by homogenization and differential
centrifugation of muscle tissue. CA2+ -ATPase expressed in transfected cell
cultures will be also used. The chemical derivatization experiments will be
complemented by expression of mutated cDNA in cell cultures. Microsomes prepared
from transfected cells display a very active transport activity, and constitute
a highly favorable system for studies of specific mutations. The collaborators
have a long standing record of productive collaboration. The biological
significance of this research is related to control of contractile activation
and relaxation in muscle fibers. Its chemical significance is related to enzyme
kinetics and catalysis, coupling of catalytic and transport activities, channels
and transmembrane fluxes of electrolytes, and structure of proteins.
