In the evolution of mountain belts, major episodes of tectonism are often
recorded by the development of rocks of the mylonite series. The relationship of
deformation and associated chemical changes, at the mineral and whole rock
scales, to radiometric ages is the objective of this research. The size of
mineral and isotopic equilibrium domains developed during mylonitization of
mafic rocks and the response of zircon and titanite will be investigated.
Results will lead to applying concepts of domainal equilibrium on measuring
absolute ages of selected faults in the Southern Appalachians and their
geodynamic implications for the accretionary history of the Appalachian Mountain
belt.
