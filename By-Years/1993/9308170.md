The 8th Maryland Theoretical Computer Science Day will take place March 19,
1993, in the new Engineering/Computer Science Building at the University of
Maryland Baltimore County. Five distinguished speakers will deliver fifty-minute
talks on their current research. The program will cover a broad range of current
topics on theoretical computer science and its applications, including
biological computing, combinatorial analysis of algorithms, complexity theory,
learning theory, and cryptology. This one-day event is expected to attract
approximately one hundred researchers and advanced graduate students from the
greater Baltimore-Washington D.C. area, including members of local Universities,
businesses, and government agencies. Maryland Theory Day, which is held in
cooperation with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer
Studies, stimulates and facilitates the advancement of computer science through
promoting interaction and joint work among local researchers. In addition,
holding this event for the first time at UMBC will help establish UMBC's young
and growing Computer Science Department.
