Highway bridges in the United States are experiencing the problems of aging,
corrosion, and excessive cracking of concrete. It is important to evaluate these
deficiencies in terms of the remaining strength of the bridge structure. The
problem of determining the current capacity and remaining life of the bridge is
very complex because of the many and varied factors involved. This project will
investigate the development of a computer program which will take into account
the various defects and aging parameters of the material estimate its strength
and rate of decay. The study will concentrate on the behavior of a scale model
bridge with various intentional defects added to it to develop an appropriate
methodology for future full-scale use by bridge engineers.
