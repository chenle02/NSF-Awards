This grant is to support studies of quantum systems that display regular and
irregular classical trajectories with the aid of various semiclassical methods,
some traditional and some very recently developed. In the first year, attention
will be focused on highly excited atoms in strong external fields. At low
energies and weak fields, these systems show quasiperiodic trajectories, and
semiclassical energies and wavefunctions can be calculated by quantization of
action variables. For high energies or strong fields, the trajectories are
chaotic and familiar methods cannot be used. A theory is being developed that
shows that orderly fluctuations in transition amplitudes are associated with
closed orbits of such systems.
