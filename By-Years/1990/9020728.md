The objective of this proposal is a numerical technique for simulating the flow
of deformable non-spherical particle systems. The proposed technique reduces the
problem to that of solving a set of Fredholm integral equations of the second
kind, and uses parallel processing. The model can simulate mechanisms
encountered in suspension, such as coalescence, break-up, particle rotation,
formation of ordered structures and mixing. The computational time and memory
storage will be significantly reduced as compared to previous methods for
similar solutions. The P.I. will collaborate with the San Diego supercomputer
center. The simulations should lead to a better understanding and basic
numerical solutions to a series of industrial and biomedical applications, such
as blood flow, foams, suspensions, and food processing.
