This fund will support two undergraduate students working on Jefferson lab
PrimEx project. They will work on hybrid crystal calorimeter development, and be
responsible for the photo-multiplier tube's examination and selection by
measuring the linearity and high rate stability. They will also work on Monte
Carlo simulation for the coordinate reconstruction of HYCAL. Upon the
availability of travel funds, they may stay at Jefferson Lab for two months in
the summer to work on the detector assembling and beam test. The participation
of undergraduate students in the physics frontier research will provide them
with interesting challenges while developing skills in many areas. Funds from
this proposal will therefore enrich a solid undergraduate physics program.
