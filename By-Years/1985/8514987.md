This research utilizes recent advances in groundwater hydrology and in the
analytical techniques of distributed parameters estimation theory to design an
optimal sampling strategy for field observations to determine the extent of
groundwater contamination and progress made in its mitigation. The results of
this research will be applicable to engineering design of monitoring systems to
determine the extent of groundwater pollution, mitigation measures and rate of
progress upon initiation of mitigation procedures.
