The Langlands program envisions a deep relation between basic questions about
integers, like how the number of solutions to equations modulo p varies as the
prime number p varies, and the structure of certain infinite dimensional
representations of groups of matrices. This project will investigate how
representations of different groups of matrices are related to one another,
known as Langlands's functoriality, from a geometric perspective. In the course
of the project, the principal investigator will train graduate and undergraduate
students in cutting edge areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry,
representation theory, and number theory.

The Arthur-Selberg trace formula and its relative variants are among the main
tools at our disposal to address Langlands's functoriality conjecture. In this
project, the principal investigator, Dr. Ngo Bao Chau, will investigate the
structure of certain moduli spaces appearing naturally in the study of the
geometric side of the (relative) trace formula. These new moduli spaces can be
seen as a generalization of the Hitchin fibration, which was instrumental in the
proof of the fundamental lemma by Dr. Ngo. Their investigation will require a
new understanding of invariant theory which is a classical topic in algebraic
geometry. Dr. Ngo expects these results in invariant theory will shed light not
only on the trace formula but also on related problems, including the
determination of the kernel of the nonabelian Fourier transform responsible for
the functional equation of automorphic L-functions.
