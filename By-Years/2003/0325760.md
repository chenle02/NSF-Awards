The primary objective of this proposal is to enable first-principle simulations
of liquid atomization involving turbulence in a realistic atomizer, which is at
least an order of magnitude more complicated than is possible today with current
computing capabilities. Achieving this objective will facilitate the fundamental
understanding needed of liquid atomization. It will also enable the develop of a
theory-based method for design, control, and optimization of atomizers for ultra
efficient, clean, and stable combustion in automotive, aircraft, and rocket
engines, for spray forming that creates structurally perfect materials, for
liquid jets that will not atomize until reaching high elevations for fighting
fires as well as other applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the
Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will greatly enhance the
university's infrastructure for performing high-performance scientific computing
of liquid atomization through parallel network RAM and the scientific software
to be developed.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of education and outreach, the results of
this research will be disseminated via annual CFD short course and a workshop to
be held at Michigan State University (MSU). &lt;br/&gt;There will also be a
summer internship program for undergraduate students each summer at MSU, where
students will work with the PIs of this proposal in carrying out the research.
For this internship program, students from under represented groups will be
aggressively recruited.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, undergraduate and graduate courses
will be developed in liquid atomization in order to educate students in this
area of scientific computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
