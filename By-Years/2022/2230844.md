Harmonic analysis is a foundational subject that touches upon many different
areas of mathematics. Much early interest in the subject centered around
Calder√≥n-Zygmund operators and the theory connected to them. Recent interest in
harmonic analysis has been in the construction of different wavelet bases and
utilizing them in medical applications, imaging, and data analysis. The workshop
on Harmonic Analysis will take place at Washington University in St. Louis on
October 8-9, 2022. The purpose is to bring together researchers in harmonic
analysis so that new ideas and past accomplishments in the field can be
discussed by both experts and young mathematicians. The conference's principal
speaker will provide an overview of some recent developments in real and complex
harmonic analysis, including their relations to efficient high dimensional data
processing. Other contributions will highlight both recent advances in the area
as well as past accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this
project will be to provide participant support and fund advanced graduate
students and recent Ph.D.s, allowing them to attend this major conference on
analysis, discuss new ideas, and interact with established researchers. These
interactions will be facilitated by the breaks and discussion sessions that will
be part of the schedule. Advertisement for the conference will take place on the
Department of Mathematics and Statistics website and through email
announcements. More information about the conference can be found at the

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
