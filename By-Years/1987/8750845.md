The Department of Chemistry and Geology at Mankato State University has recently
acquired a high speed centrifuge and a liquid scintillation counter for use in
the improvement of undergraduate instruction in biochemistry. The major
objective is to revitalize the biochemistry program by implementing a senior
level "project oriented" laboratory course. In this course, students learn to
work as a team to solve a specific research problem involving the
characterization of a plant RNA virus. The students design an experimental
strategy to solve the assigned problem including learning how to use the
literature, planning and organizing experiments, performing a wide range of
preparative and analytical biochemical techniques, and interpreting and
communicating data.
