Soliton equations are non-linear wave equation that are completely integrable
Hamiltonian systems and have: Lax pairs, infinitely many families of explicit
soliton solutions, an algebraic superposition formula, transformations that
produce new solutions of the PDE from a given one, and a very large symmetry
group. The most well-known such equations are the KdV equation, the non-linear
Schrodinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation (SGE). The KdV and NLS
arise naturally from geometric flows and the SGE is the Gauss-Codazzi equation
for surfaces in $3$-space with constant negative Gaussian curvature. Many other
partial differential equations arising in geometry are also now known to be
soliton equations. Terng will study submanifolds in symmetric spaces and in
affine flat 3-space whose governing equations are soliton equations or elliptic
integrable systems, construct curve flows in Riemannian, pseudo-Riemannian, and
affine geometries so that the corresponding equations for curve invariants are
soliton equations. Terng will also study the moduli space of the anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills equation. Jointly with B. Dai, and Uhlenbeck, Terng solved the Cauchy
problem with small initial data and constructed all soliton space-time monopoles
when the gauge group is the unitary group. She proposes to investigate this
equation when the gauge group is an arbitrary compact, simple Lie group or the
special linear group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soliton theory is an enticingly
elegant part of modern mathematics. It has a multitude of interpretations in
geometry, analysis, algebra, and applied mathematics. The KdV equation models
the motion of waves in shallow canal, the NLS equation models the motion of a
wave envelope in an optical fiber, and the SGE equation arises in Plasma
physics. The existence of particle like soliton solutions of the NLS has helped
speed up the internet. Soliton equations also arise as equations for many
important geometric problems. Terng plans to study geometric aspects of soliton
equations, use techniques in soliton theory to construct new and interesting
geometric objects, and use geometry to construct new soliton equations.
