9614233 Holloway The PIs propose to study the effect of water on seismic
properties of mantle subduction zones by providing experimental data needed to
model this regime. The proposed research will involve experimental measurements
of sound velocities using their newly developed controlled-pulse- transmission
technique on artificially hydrated, natural mantle peridotite at high pressures
and temperatures. ***
