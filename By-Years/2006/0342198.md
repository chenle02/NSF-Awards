This award will support further development of the Northeastern Ecosystem
Research Cooperative (NERC), which is a grass-roots scientific organization of
ecosystem researchers in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada. The NERC is
dedicated to integrative regional research and dissemination of knowledge to
policy makers and the public. In existence for only 2.5 years, the NERC has
developed into a vital and promising network with broad support within the
scientific community. NERC researchers have established task groups that are
investigating important environmental issues in the Northeast by identifying key
research questions, developing databases, interpreting regional patterns, and
producing proposals and publications. The NERC plans to increase the number of
disciplines represented and the breadth of the scientific community that it
serves. It will stimulate interactions among existing task groups, and initiate
an outreach program that will help disseminate scientific information to the
public and policy makers. A goal is to have the NERC reach its full potential as
a unique organization dedicated to synthesizing site-specific information from
throughout the region and actively communicating that knowledge. The NERC will
have broad impacts on the ecosystem research community through its focus on
regional-scale science and synthesis of information from many sites. The NERC
will also impact the policy arena because it will make active dissemination of
scientific knowledge a primary goal.&lt;br/&gt;
