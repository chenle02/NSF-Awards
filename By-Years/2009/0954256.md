This project explores shape models that unite human shape perception,
computational tractability and mathematical rigor. In particular, it establishes
geometry-based selection criteria for skeletal models, defining the best model
to be the one that requires the fewest bits to approximate within a specified
error tolerance. The goals of the project are to develop theoretical results
establishing selection criteria for skeletal models and to apply those results
to shape-dependent industrial projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skeletal shape
models are attractive for shape-based applications because they decompose shapes
into salient parts that can be manipulated independently. Their primary downfall
for practical applications, a lack of robustness to noises in the shape
boundary, has only recently been addressed. In the classical definition of the
skeletal model, each shape has a unique skeleton. That uniqueness creates a
geometric rigidity that in turn leads to the lack of robustness. A recent
generalized skeletal definition relaxes the uniqueness constraint, allowing
multiple skeletal models for each shape. Multiple models provide the flexibility
to accommodate noisy shape boundaries, but introduce a new problem in selecting
the best skeletal model for a given shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
engages capable but disadvantaged students who would otherwise be unaware of
research as a career in exciting and relevant research. Broader impacts include
extensive collaboration between research students and future teachers to develop
learning activities for K-12 classrooms, development of course modules to
incorporate concepts from digital image analysis into standard sophomore-level
mathematics courses, and development of industrial applications in collaboration
with students and industrial partners.
