This award supports work on the fundamental group of a smooth quasiprojective
variety defined over the field of complex numbers. If such a variety maps
properly onto a hyperbolic curve, its fundamental group surjects onto a
nonabelian free group. The principal investigator will determine to what extent
the converse holds. The problem will be attacked by a variety of methods. These
include a generalization of the Castenuovo-De Franchis lemma, the construction
of L2 harmonic 1-forms on the universal cover, and a study of certain
homologically defined subsets of the groups of 1-dimensional characters of the
fundamental group. This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in theoretical computer science and robotics.
