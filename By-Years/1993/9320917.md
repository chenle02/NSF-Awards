9320917 Jones This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support grant investigates how
Congressional committees and subcommittees influence the policy process for the
issue of health policy from 1945-1992. By applying methods and theory from the
agenda setting literature to study committee behavior, the research develops a
new approach to policy making in Congress. The research consists of two main
sections. First, a theoretical approach to examine the committee system is
developed using an issue agenda driven methodology. Second, the empirical phase
of the project involves the creation of a database that traces policy
development through three phases: committee and subcommittee hearings; committee
markup meetings; and, final passage of statutes into law. By matching a new
theoretical perspective with this powerful database, this research allows for
the examination of the finer details of committee behavior long ignored and
least understood to scholars of Congress. ***
