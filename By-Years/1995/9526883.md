The American Mathematical Society will hold the twenty-sixth AMS-SIAM Summer
Seminar in Applied Mathematics in 1996. Previous seminars were held annually or
at two- or three-year intervals since 1957 for a total of 25 seminars. The 1996
topic, "Mathematics of Stochastic Manufacturing Systems", was selected by the
1994 AMS-SIAM Committee on Applied Mathematics. Members of the Organizing
Committee for the Summer Seminar are: George Yin- Department of Mathematics,
Wayne State University, Chair Qing Zhang- Department of Mathematics, University
of Georgia, Co-Chair John Birge- Department of Industrial and Operations
Engineering, University of Michigan Wendell Fleming- Division of Applied
Mathematics, Brown University Bozenna Pasik-Duncan- Department of Mathematics,
University of Kansas Marty Riemann- AT&T Bell Laboratories All of the members of
the organizing committee have agreed to attend and participate in the meeting.
The 1996 AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar will be held during a one-week period in June,
1996, at a location in the Eastern United States. The Society will be
responsible for making suitable arrangements for lecture and seminar rooms, and
for handling administrative matters.
