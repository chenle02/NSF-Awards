ABSTRACT EEC-9526685 Burgess This award provides funding for a "TIE" project to
pursue cooperative research in the application of acoustics for characterization
of gas and liquid phase inclusions in systems of interest to the NSF I/UCRC for
Separations Using Thin Films at the University of Colorado (CSTF) and the Center
for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of Washington. The
proposed "TIE" project research represents the first step in an anticipated
long-term collaboration towards the development of a new generation of smart
sensors. The specific research objectives involve the adaptation of acoustic
time-domain reflectometry to the study of changes in the pore structure which
occur during membrane compaction and changes in bubble size and position which
occur in process streams. An improved fundamental understanding of these
phenomena is essential for successful development of membrane-based chemical
sensors. The proposed research builds upon existing strengths in acoustics and
membranes at CSTF and expertise in chemistry and chemical processing at CPAC,
and makes effective use of costly resources by designing and fabricating
sophisticated acoustic instrumentation that can be applied to both membrane
compaction and bubble dynamics. In addition, the creation of a formal "TIE"
between the relatively young CSTF and well-established and highly successful
CPAC will enable CSTF to obtain valuable information from CPAC about long-term
sponsor development and facilitation of technology transfer with industry
sponsors.
