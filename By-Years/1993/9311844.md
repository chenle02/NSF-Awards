The International Union for Circumpolar Health has sought support to establish
an international working group on fetal alcohol syndrome in conjunction with the
IX International Congress on Circumpolar Health scheduled for June 20-25, 1993
in Reykjavik, Iceland. FAS is an entirely preventable problem which has reached
epidemic proportions in the Arctic. The FAS problem requires social, educational
and health solutions. International collaboration allows for the study of the
epidemiology of FAS and the planning and development of evaluation and
prevention strategies in the Arctic.
