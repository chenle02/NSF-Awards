9410093 DeMeter The award is for research to develop better understanding of
workpiece deflections due to clamping forces resulting from part fixturing
systems during machining operations and the resulting part geometric errors.
Such improved understanding will help design fixturing systems which minimize
part geometric error in the presence of cutting forces. The concept of
approximate models or meta-models is used to simplify the problem solution. The
results of the research would benefit machining fixture design practices and
would be applicable to a broader class of contact problems in mechanics
characterized by variable boundary conditions. Currently, the area of machining
fixture design is not being addressed adequately by research despite its
acknowledged importance.
