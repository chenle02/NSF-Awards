With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry is
funding Professor Weiping Tang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to develop
novel transition metal-catalyzed cycloaddition reactions focused on generating
valuable seven-membered rings. These new reactions have the potential to fill a
significant knowledge gap in organic chemistry and lead to a fundamentally new
body of research. Professor Tang is integrating his research into education
plans through activities that increase the participation of underrepresented
undergraduate and high school students. The broader impact of this work includes
improved fundamental understanding on metal catalysis and cycloadditions, new
chemical methods for the preparation of medicine and materials, and the training
of students for careers in science.

The project focuses on the development of rhodium-catalyzed [5+2]-cycloadditions
of 3-acyloxy-1,4-enynes with alkynes, alkenes, allenes, and other pi-systems.
Highly functionalized seven-membered rings are prepared from these readily
available enynes. For example, various tropone-containing compounds can be
efficiently synthesized using an alkyne as the 2-carbon component. With an
alkene or allene as the 2-carbon component, multiple stereogenic centers are set
within the seven-membered rings. Professor Tang is also investigating the
mechanism and reactive intermediates involved in these novel
[5+2]-cycloadditions. These new cycloaddition methods provide solutions for the
longstanding challenge to develop efficient and stereoselective synthetic
entries into mono- or polycyclic seven-membered rings.
