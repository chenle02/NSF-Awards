Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will investigate various
mechanisms which can generate masses for the quarks and leptons in the
superstring framework. Of special interest is the possibility that a see-saw
mechanism can arise which would lead to ultralight Dirac or Majorana neutrino
masses. Conditions under which such a mechanism can appear will be studied. In
particular, discrete symmetries which allow or forbid certain entries in the
mass matrices will be identified. An effort will be made to find a suitable
compactification manifold with the appropriate discrete symmetries. The general
issue of quark and lepton families will be addressed, as well as the possibility
of mirror families. Other unforeseen research may be done in response to the
evolution of the field. The work will be carried out by a highly-respected
theoretical elementary particle physicist, and is important to the furthering of
our understanding of the elementary particles and the basic forces.
