It has been shown previously that in the presence of colloidal particles, the
wetting region is comprised of the bulk fluid with the meniscus and the
transition region leading to a thin film of structured colloidal particles.
Experiments with similarly charged monodispersed latex particles show co-
existence of ordered-disordered particle structures, depending on the film
thickness relative to the particle diameter. Since the particles are similarly
charged, there must be some form of long-range attractive force responsible for
creating the ordered structure. Microintereferometric methods are proposed to be
used to measure the film thickness profile and to calculate the capillary
pressure near the contact line. The effect of volume fraction, particle size,
shape and polydispersity on the film structure and stability will be
investigated by direct observation of the ordered microstructure within the thin
film near the contact line. The structural disjoining pressure will be
calculated from the particle radial distribution function and the mean potential
of particle interactions. The contact angle is calculated from experimentally
measured values of the capillary pressure and the calculated disjoining
pressure.
