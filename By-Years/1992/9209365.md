Language has evolved rich vocabularies, especially action verbs and their
modifiers, that can felicitously describe simple as well as complex movements
performed by humans and others. The overall long term goal is to model the
structure of human-like agents, instruct them in natural language to perform
simple physical tasks, and display e actions being performed in terms of
computer graphics animation. The research addresses selected problems, issues
and methods of solutions in the overall endeavor. The PI's Ph.D.
dissertation(1990, University of Pennsylvania). argued that it is necessary to
investigate how natural language relates to concepts of space, motion and force,
and use these relations in the specification of lexical semantics of action
verbs and their modifiers. In the proposed research, we will further strengthen
the claims of obtaining useful lexical entries for an extended set of action
verbs and their modifiers. We will investigate salient functional, structural
and other properties of manipulated objects and the physical environment in
general, required for motion bases on the structure, function and other relevant
constrain: this is crucial to actually executing tasks specified by natural
language instructions in varying physical situations. Meaning entries (given in
natural language) for action verbs in human dictionaries and determine the
nature of processing necessary to use such entries for possible acquisition of
new computational lexical entries.
