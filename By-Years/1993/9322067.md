9322067 Orel This proposal addresses a number of questions concerning electron
polyatomic ion scattering. These include photoionization of simple polyatomic
molecules, dissociative recombination, and photoionization of absorbed molecules
on surfaces. The results are important in low temperature plasmas such as those
which occur in plasma etching and the interstellar medium. ***
