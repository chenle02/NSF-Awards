This project will modify computer algebra systems (CAS) to make it a more
suitable, usable learning tool for calculus and then pre- calculus students. The
PI Child is the first person to develop a prototypical intelligent tutoring
system and a Macintosh graphic interface to Maple. The proposed new computer
technology and curricular revisions will be the basis for faculty retraining and
teaching of experimental applied calculus, pre-calculus, and summer workshops
for secondary school teachers at Rollins College. The equipment will be used for
a computer laboratory components, and faculty desktop access to CAS. Two of the
senior staff have received grants from the Sloan Foundation to develop CAS. The
grantee is providing an equal sum for the equipment obtained from non-Federal
sources.
