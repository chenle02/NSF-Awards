This project will perform integrated studies on earthquake ground motions.
Stochastic modeling of earthquake ground motions will be performed and the
results will be verified with field data. New techniques will be developed to
process and analyze available ground motion data and provide input parameters
for the verification. The stochastic modeling studies will provide the designer
with a realistic and verified method for a seismic design. The seismic risk will
be assessed using time histories of ground motion. As part of this work, new
techniques to process strong motion data will be developed. The accuracy and
numerical efficiency of existing processing algorithms will be evaluated based
on site specific operating characteristics of ground motion instruments. A
comparative evaluation of instrument performance will be made using a dense
array of eight digital accelerographs.
