This renewal proposal is aimed at understanding the behavior of molecular and
polymeric solids when photo-chemical or photo-thermal reactions occur, with a
focus on changes that occur during the first few picoseconds. Three distinct
areas to be investigated are: (1) ultrafast mechanical energy transfer processes
in solids; (2) the study of thermal conduction over nanometer length scales, and
conformal rearrangements in superheated polymers; (3) solid state chemical
reactions in the amorphous solid state (glasses and polymers), and practical
photoresist systems.
