This project implements major changes in the manner in which computers are
utilized in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Recent developments in
hardware and software have made data acquisition, data manipulation, and
molecular mechanics calculations possible at an undergraduate level. This was
inconceivable 10 years ago and too expensive to consider 5 years ago. The
project interfaces the major instruments in the department with computers
equipped with LabVIEW data acquisition and handling software, installs a local
area network for data transport, and creates a workstation area with site-
licensed molecular modeling, scientific graphing, and statistical packages.
Laboratories that are most affected by these additions include organic
chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis,
inorganic chemistry, and the undergraduate research program. Molecular modeling
of chemical systems can be introduced extensively in organic lab and reinforced
with increasing sophistication in the subsequent courses. This program provides
a cost-effective model for the integration of computer technology into the
chemistry curriculum of a medium-sized college. The project's effectiveness is
being evaluated by an external agent chosen from the American Chemical Society's
College Consultants Service.
