A Graduate Research Training program is proposed that integrates high
performance computing into a multidisciplinary thrust in materials physics and
chemistry. The program is designed to provide students with state-of-the-art
knowledge in quantum and condensed matter theory, atomistic simulation methods
and effective use of massively parallel computers. The program takes advantage
of the expertise of six faculty members from the Departments of Physics,
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and incorporates courses, research projects,
seminars and tutorials to train students for leadership in advanced materials
technology. A resource center with student offices and shared capabilities for
distributed computing will encourage interdisciplinary interactions. Students,
especially women and minorities, will be vigorously recruited through three REU
programs as well as the normal institutional recruiting channels. The proposed
program will produce scientists with a broad knowledge of materials theory and
extensive experience in high performing computing.
