This research investigates a novel theory, already supported by some
experimental results, which allows the estimation of certain parameters to give
strong insights into the behavior of catalytic reactors. The key concept which
will be amplified by this carefully coordinated theoretical and experimental
research is feedback-induced bifurcation. The responses induced by this novel
approach are expected to apply to a broad class of catalytic reactions. This new
phase will involve a new reactor with a capability for continuous monitoring on
the catalyst surface. This will give more complete model evaluation and allow
greater feedback flexibility.
