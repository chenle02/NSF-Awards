This effort by the American Statistical Association is designed to improve the
survey research activities of NSF and is entitled "On-site Research to Advance
the Quality of Science and Technology Resources." The goal of the program is to
bridge the gap between the collection, analysis, and dissemination of high
quality statistical information on the national and international resources
devoted to science and engineering, and the users of the data in industry,
academia, and government. Benefits to the academic and social science research
communities and NSF will accrue through formulation of new and innovative
research topics, research results, and an improvement in the approach to
assuring quality in science and engineering data, including all areas related to
post-survey analysis and validation, such as design of nonresponse studies;
analysis of response patterns in longitudinal surveys; analysis of item
nonresponse patterns; and validation improvement and survey research.
