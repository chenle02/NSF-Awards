The aim of this study is to determine whether male northern elephant seals,
Mirounga angustirostris are as polygynous as observations of mating behavior
suggest. Precise estimates of the reproductive success of males breeding at Ano
Nuevo, California, will be obtained by paternity analysis using modern
techniques of molecular genetics. The effect of male age, social rank, and size
on success in siring pups will be assessed and these variables will be
correlated with offspring survival to weaning age. Field methods will yield
measurements of mating success, identity of mates, and social rank. Tissue
samples fromputative fathers, females and their pups will be analyzed by
thetechnique of DNA fingerprinting, a procedure used successfully for kinship
testing and forensic applications in humans, and forpedigree and paternity
testing in other animals. The research will produce results necessary for
understanding sexual selection, the evolution of mating systems, and the social
and developmental behaviors that shape organisms.
