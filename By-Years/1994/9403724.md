9403724 Weiss The research covers several topics in smooth dynamical systems
including hyperbolic sets in dynamical systems, relationships with
thermodynamics, stochastic behavior of flows and related spectral theory. The
research has potential applications to other areas of dynamical systems, chaos
and areas of mathematical physics involving ergodicity and entropy. ***
