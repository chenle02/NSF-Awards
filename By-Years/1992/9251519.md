Non-technical majors are introduced to the process of scientific investigation
and the principles common to living systems. The four broad topic areas
introduced are: Scientific Methodologies; Molecular and Cellular Biology;
Organismal Physiology; and Heredity, Ecology and Evolution. Organisms
investigated include: termites (observation of behavior), potatoes (determining
chemical content), Vibrio natriegens (bacterial growth curves), and a comparison
of F- and F+ E. coli (a study of conjugation). Development of students'
observational skills and appreciation for inquiry are emphasized.
