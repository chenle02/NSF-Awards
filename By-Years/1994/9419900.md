9419900 Benson As the nervous system develops, exuberant connections are made
between cells, many of which are later eliminated to arrive at the final pattern
of connections. A question that has yet to be fully answered is the role that
neural activity plays in this process of synapse formation, elimination, and
consolidation. This research will investigate the formation of synapses between
cultured hippocampal neurons, which have been shown to closely resemble their in
vivo counterparts molecularly, structurally, and functionally. A number of
experimental manipulations will be performed to elucidate the role of neural
activity in the formation and stabilization of synapses and synaptic patterns.
This entire process is integral to the development of the nervous system, and is
one that is modifiable by experience and learning. The outcome of these
experiments may provide fundamental information about how the electrical
activity associated with neural activation refines the connections between nerve
cells.
