Bioengineering and catalysis are important aspects of chemical reaction
engineering education. Problems associated with the maintentance of biocultures
have prevented thee introduction of bioreactors into chemical engineering lab
courses. Similarly, the high temperatures and pressures coupled with student
safety concerns have prevented the widespread use of catalytic reactor systems
for student laboratories. This project will develop an immobilized enzyme
bioreactor that will allow students to thoroughly study both bioengineering and
catalysis systems without the problems associated with conventional reactor
systems. The resulting process will be an inexpensively constructed apparatus
for illustration of the principles of chemical catalysis that can be operated at
near ambient temperatures and pressures. Student interest will be maintained
since the reactor system is based on a proven industrial process. This option
for study of catalytic bioreactors may not have occurred to many chemical
engineering departments. Thus, when the results of this project are presented
and published, there will be a significant positive impact on the chemical
engineering laboratory curriculum nationwide.
