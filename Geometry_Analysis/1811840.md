This research project concerns problems in the interface between Geometry,
Analysis, and the Calculus of Variations. Questions concerning the variational
theory of minimal surfaces and its applications will be investigated. Minimal
surfaces are among the most natural objects in Differential Geometry. They have
encountered striking applications in many other fields, like three-dimensional
topology, mathematical physics, complex and conformal geometry, among others. In
General Relativity minimal surfaces appear as models for the apparent horizons
of black holes. The minimal surface equation plays a very important role as a
model for several kinds of nonlinear phenomena in nature. Significant progress
in this area has always had a great impact in mathematical analysis and the
physical sciences.

The research of this project will advance our basic understanding of minimal
surfaces and their general existence theory. It concerns foundational questions
about when these objects exist and how their properties relate to features of
the ambient space. One of the goals is to develop a good understanding of the
Morse-theoretic properties of the space of minimal varieties in a given
Riemannian manifold. This is to be accomplished by a combination of min-max
techniques and topological methods, where the relevant spaces of cycles are
defined by means of Geometric Measure Theory. We will study the existence and
basic properties, like the Morse index, of min-max minimal varieties.
