This award provides funding to the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), to
upgrade the experimental capabilities of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) reconfigurable reaction wall earthquake
simulator facility at UCB that will be operated by NEES Consortium, Inc., as a
national shared use facility during FY 2005 - FY 2014. The major equipment at
the UCB NEES site, which consists of a strong reaction floor, a reconfigurable
reaction wall, hydraulic supply, seven long-stroke high-speed actuators, a
128-channel data acquisition system (DAQ), a portfolio of instrumentation, and a
four-million pound compression-tension machine, enables testing of a wide
variety of structural components. The requested equipment provides additional
equipment for the UCB NEES site, was selected based on input from earthquake
engineering researchers interested in using this equipment site, and includes: a
64-channel upgrade to the DAQ system, a high-fidelity surface damage
visualization (Hi-Fi Viz) system, and a reconfigurable test platform for
earthquake testing (REPEAT). The additional data channels make it possible to
instrument and test a wider variety of structures. The Hi-Fi Viz system provides
researchers the capability to acquire, quantify, and view damage occurring on
the surface of a portion of or the entire specimen. This system will include a
2D-3D projector system, laser scanner system, and high-speed camera system. The
REPEAT steel structure frame provides a reusable platform for various test
configurations, thus reducing the need to build special-purpose test set-ups for
each experiment. This equipment will be available to the earthquake engineering
research community through the NEES Consortium, Inc., UCB NEES facility. This
award is funded by the NSF NEES Major Research Equipment and Facilities
Construction (MREFC) project and is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).
