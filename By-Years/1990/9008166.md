A major topic of study in astronomy concerns the way in which stars are formed
from the gravitational collapse of interstellar gas clouds. The Principal
Investigator (PI) wishes to extend earlier studies supported by the NSF of
numerical simulations of proto- star under the mutual influence of gravity and
rotation. The PI will use sophisticated new numerical techniques to compute
models in two and three dimensions. Models will be computed to "follow" this
collapse in time, with particular attention to the development of minor density
fluctuations which could grow ultimately into planets or a secondary star. NSF
support will include the purchase of a computer workstation so that movies of
simulated collapses can be followed in "real time" over a wide range of test
conditions. These results are expected to increase our understanding of how
proto-stars lose angular momentum during their collapse and to define the
conditions leading to the formation of two separate "binary" stars.
