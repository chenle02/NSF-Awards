9604950 Fergus This award supports initiation of collaborative research in
materials science between Jeffrey Fergus, Auburn University, and Wang Yinbang,
Beijing University of Science and Technology. The research involves evaluation
of the potential of several lanthanide fluorides in thin-film low- temperature
oxygen sensors. Oxygen sensors are used in industrial processing and control
applications; improved understanding of the mechanisms of lanthanum fluoride
sensors will be of significant value to the electrochemical community. The
project will make use of complementary facilities and expertise at the two
universities. Auburn University will provide expertise in development and
testing of chemical sensors, and will perform the electrochemical
characterization of the sensor performance. Beijing University of Science and
Technology will provide the thin- film fabrication and surface characterization
expertise.
