Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of
normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter"
particles that don't emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories
proposed for other reasons predict the existence of weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If
WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-
based detectors.

This award will provide funding for this Syracuse group to collaborate on the
Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (now SuperCDMS) that has a track record as one of
the world's most sensitive. The PI will lead his group to achieve better
rejection of surface interactions and identify neutrons that multiply scatter
within a detector, aided by detailed simulations of the detector response. The
group will help develop and construct a detector to veto events caused by
neutrons and measure the expected neutron background in SuperCDMS. The group
will take part in SuperCDMS detector testing, including making key contributions
to a unique deep facility, demonstrating the rejection capabilities of new
detectors and providing critical feedback for detector fabrication and
development. The long-term activities include additional cryogenic detector
research, focusing on technologies that allow easier manufacturing and the
possibility of a single cost-effective experiment to detect both dark matter and
neutrinoless double-beta decay.

Broader Impacts: Technological development of phonon-mediated detectors has
widespread applications in astronomy and physics. The project will help train
undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a multidisciplinary field using
techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies with applications in
areas of societal interest.
