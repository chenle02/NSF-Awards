Distributed computing applications, such as groupware and manufacturing
automation, have concurrently executing processes that access common shared
data. The applications require maintaining the consistency of shared data and
correctness of executions, and also, have demanding real-time performance
requirements. This research examines, designs, and implements, a system based on
time-constrained transaction-oriented distributed computations. Consistent
executions are maintained using modified database concurrency control, and
improvement of performance is addressed using techniques from real-time data
management. Building on existing research results, the system incorporates
several correctness and efficiency criteria, and is flexible to changes and
scale-up. Learning from on-going large-scale efforts in the application areas,
the approach is tested by implementation of substantial functionalities for the
target domains. Real-time scheduling algorithms are incorporated into a main-
memory data management system, and the primitives for distributed concurrency
control using synchronization protocols are implemented across multiple
instances of such systems. This approach is to be empirically compared in terms
of functionality and performance against the systems already available. The
complementary education plan includes fostering off-line group study and
learning by doing hands-on work. Students, organized into self-study groups,
examine facets of the research problems, and obtain broad guidelines from
information technology tools. Also, the research problems are assigned as
project work which fosters a hands-on approach to learning. In the long term,
this research and educational dissemination will influence the design and
development of large-scale real-time distributed applications using database and
transaction technologies.
