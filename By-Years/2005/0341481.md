Mathematical Sciences (21) The Mathematical Association of America's
PRofessional Enhancement Program (PREP) enables faculty in the mathematical
sciences to respond to rapid and significant developments that impact
undergraduate mathematics. PREP workshops offer extended professional
development experiences with active involvement by all participants, leadership
by experts, and a commitment by participants to make use of what they learn.
PREP workshops serve faculty in the mathematical sciences from all types of
institutions, at all stages in their careers, and enable faculty to reach beyond
their own educational experiences. To achieve a sustained impact, PREP workshops
extend over time with preparatory, intensive and on-going components. At least
nine workshops are offered each year, including at least one whose intensive
component is on-line. Follow-up components are typically held in conjunction
with the Joint Mathematics Meetings each January. Program details can be found
