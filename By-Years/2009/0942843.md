This project develops, pilots, analyzes, and refines a set of tasks and
activities that make up the first semester of a two semester calculus sequence
designed specifically for elementary education majors and replaces the current
elementary mathematics undergraduate courses. Calculus is foundational not only
to mathematics, but to other STEM areas as well, so learning calculus is
important for this new brand of STEM-focused elementary teachers. This Calculus
for Elementary Majors serves the nation's need to educate elementary teachers
who know STEM. Future elementary teachers also need a profound understanding of
elementary mathematics and this project makes necessary and important
connections between calculus and elementary school mathematics. To do this,
educators in the mathematics department, mathematics education department, and
elementary education department at NC State developed a set of materials that
serve as the basis for this innovative calculus course and a textbook for
elementary teachers. In the process of conducting this development, field
testing of the materials and assessment of the learning of the preservice
teachers determined the validity of this intriguing hypothesis.
