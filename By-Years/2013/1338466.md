Current state-of-the-art organic semiconductor materials are plagued by low
performance (low electrical conductivity), short life-time, and high
manufacturing costs. Researchers recently developed a one-step process that
converts legacy organic semiconductors into new materials with outstanding
electron affinity, highly sought-after solid-state molecular packing, excellent
stability (under light and air) and processability (by solution and low-
temperature vacuum deposition). The combination of these valuable properties is
uniquely suited for a variety of organic electronic devices (OLEDs, OPVs).
During this project the research team plans to demonstrate the high performance
of the new materials in devices and generate important new knowledge concerning
new materials and fundamental device function. The versatility of this synthetic
method allows researchers to prepare many new, relatively inexpensive, and
broadly tunable materials composed of earth-abundant elements. The predictable
properties of these new materials will enable researchers, in collaboration with
developers of various organic electronic devices, to transition from the current
trial-and-error approach to intelligent design of high-performing inexpensive
organic electronics.

The demonstration of the high performance, stability, and broad applicability of
the new library of advanced materials may have a strong impact on the organic
electronics industry and academic research field. The new materials address the
major problems of current "state-of-the-art" organic semiconductors: low
performance, short lifetime, and high cost. This library of broadly tunable
materials has the potential to provide industry with a breakthrough capability
to improve the lifetime and efficiency and lower the cost of organic electronic
devices. Furthermore, the materials evaluated during this project will enable
the emergent organic electronics industry to engineer more efficient, longer-
lasting, and cheaper devices faster and more efficiently, leading to an
accelerated global replacement of silicon- and metal-based electronic components
with rationally-designed, finely-tuned, and recyclable organic molecular
assemblies. This technology has the potential to improve the electronics
industry bringing about new models of sustainable, long-lasting, and eco-
friendly flexible devices that can be manufactured inexpensively using additive
manufacturing methods.
