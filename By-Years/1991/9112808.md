This award will be used to construct a surface analytical system capable of
measuring surface vibrations and phonons of materials with sub-meV energy
resolution, as a function of momentum, over a temperature range from 20 Kelvins
to 800 Kelvins. Simultaneous characterization of electronic and structural
properties of surfaces will be possible. The fundamental properties of surface
phonons for simple metals, semiconductor, insulators, and thin films will be
investigated as well as the vibrational modes of surface defects and adsorbates.
The improved resolution and signal will allow detailed phonon dispersion curves
to be obtained for various surface structures. The surface phonon spectra will
be correlated with the geometrical structure using Low Energy Electron
Diffraction, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, X-ray and Ion scattering, and with
the electronic structures using XPS, AES, and Angle-resolved photoemission.
Close coupling of experimental results to theoretical calculations of the
lattice dynamics will be carried out. This instrument will be the first one of
it's kind in the United States.
