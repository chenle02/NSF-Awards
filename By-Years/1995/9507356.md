NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY IBN: 9507356 Hailman, J. This proposal is a request for
support for a symposium on "Conservation and Behavior in the Wild" to be held at
the annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society to be held July 8 - 13 at the
University of Nebraska, Lincoln. The purpose of the symposium is to address the
role of Behavioral Science in biological conservation. As biological
conservation is a topic of utmost importance today, it is essential that all
pertinent knowledge be brought to bear on the issue. Clearly an increase in
sophistication concerning animal behavior would be of great benefit to the
conservation efforts. The objective of this symposium is to foster functional
links between biologists working directly with conservation and with those more
basic scientists who study animal behavior.
