9416773 Okaya This project will acquire, reprocess and interpret 60-200 miles of
recent industry seismic reflection data from the epicentral region of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The data will be used to provide
constraints on geologic models of the Northridge earthquake source zone and to
study the geometry of faulting in the epicentral region. The results will be
integrated with seismic refraction data collected as part of the Los Angeles
Region Seismic Experiment through out the Northridge epicenter. The data, which
was collected using Vibroseis sources, will be provided by Chevron and at least
three other companies. This study is being adopted by the American Geophysical
Institute as one of their first pilot projects to archive and make public data
that are no longer of commercial interest but that have societal and/or
scientific relevance. The results will provide images of the causal fault for
the Northridge earthquake, possible mid-crustal detachment surfaces and the
Moho, and will thus provide important constraints for all mechanical and
kinematic models of the region.
