AST 97-22839 Andrea Dupree This award supports a Workshop on Cool Stars,
Stellar Systems, and the Sun, to be held 15-19 July 1997 in Cambridge, MA. The
meeting will focus on the interdisciplinary study of cool stars, including
observations from the infrared to X-ray, and theory. Current topics such as
brown dwarfs, stellar activity cycles, high-resolution techniques and
helioseismology/asteroseismology will be addressed by review talks; workshop
sessions will treat topics such as rotation and lithium, abundances, evolved
stars, and field T Tauri stars. ***
