This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Using the Past to
Predict the Future: A Computational Approach to Broad-scale Patterns of Avian
Island Biodiversity" for Alison G. Boyer. The host institution for this research
is University of California, San Diego, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr.
Walter Jetz.

Study of island ecosystems is a cornerstone of ecological research. Recent
discoveries of fossil birds on islands across the Pacific reveal the ancient
extinction of up to 50% of bird species on some islands. The extinction event is
linked to the arrival of Polynesian colonists, and human activities continue to
threaten island bird species today. Fossil data enable reconstruction of the
bird diversity of the Pacific before human impacts and could potentially change
our understanding of diversity and community structure of Pacific island
ecosystems. This research is quantifying patterns in the extinction, diversity,
and community structure of island birds by creating the body of recently
published fossil data from Pacific islands and comparing this data with
decision-tree models.

The training goals include developing new skills in decision tree and spatial
modeling and relational databases, in addition to advancing the emerging field
of conservation paleobiology by applying the recent fossil record to
conservation of modern species through collaboration with local and
international conservation scientists. Broader impacts include improving
understanding of living and non-living organisms' effects on biodiversity,
identifying the causes and contexts of anthropogenic extinction, and
establishing an interdisciplinary collaborative network. In addition, knowledge
gained in this research will directly aid in prioritizing international efforts
to ease the effects of human impacts and global change on biodiversity.
