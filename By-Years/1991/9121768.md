This award is to purchase high-speed workstations, high- resolution cameras,
digitizers, and actuator-control equipment to enhance an existing pair of
industrial-quality robot arms. The equipment will support research projects in
real-time collision avoidance, integration of stereo range estimation and
cooperative manipulation, planning for real- time control in real environments,
and planning and simulation. Virginia Polytechnic Institute will purchase
equipment to support several research projects in the area of real-time control
of robotic manipulation tasks. The research will center on the cooperative use
of artificial intelligence techniques, machine vision, efficient world models,
and hierarchical design for robust planning and control.
