ISI 2003 Travel Grant

PI: W. B. Smith

Proposal Number: DMS-0303688

Abstract

The American statistical Association (ASA) will use this travel grant for 12
United states participants to attend the 54th Session of the International
Statistical Institute (ISI) in Berlin, Germany, from august 13-20, 2003. The ISI
meeting holds an umbrella meeting of several allied societies with sessions of
interest for thousands of statisticians. This travel grant will provide travel
awards to partially defray transportation costs for individuals selected from
educational institutions and other non-profit organizations. An emphasis of the
award is to encourage and provide opportunity for younger statisticians to
participate in the meeting.

Participants will be notified of the availability of the travel grant through
AMSTAT News, a membership publication with over 16,000 circulation and on the
ASA Home Page on the internet. Also, notices will be sent to university and
college Statistics departments to encourage younger statisticians to apply for
travel support. An ASA committee will do the review and selection of
applications. Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have
recently received their doctorates and to women and minorities in order to
broaden research, educational and networking opportunities.
