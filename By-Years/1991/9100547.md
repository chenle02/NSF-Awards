This program at the University of Pennsylvania provides nine undergraduate
students with research opportunities in the broad area of Sensor Technologies.
The goal of the effort is to generate scientific knowledge and to apply this
knowledge to sensor development. The REU Site is part of the Summer
Undergraduate Fellowship in Sensor Technologies (SUNFEST) program of the
University's Center for Sensor Technologies. The Center provides the
infrastructure for faculty and students to collaborate, exchange ideas, co-
supervise students, and share resources. Students are selected by a faculty
committee based on their academic potential, interest in pursuing a research
career, attitude towards graduate studies, advisors, recommendations, membership
in under-represented groups, and research opportunities in the mother
institution. It is anticipated that about half of the students will come from
outside University of Pennsylvania. The undergraduate students participate
actively in a research project of one or more participating faculty. Special
emphasis is placed on the broader interaction of these SUNFEST fellows with the
graduate students and faculty members associated with the Center. The projects
suggested to the students are chosen for their educational value, scientific
merit, and the prospects for continued involvement after the summer. Project
topics include: chemical, optical, mechanical, and neural network based sensors;
microdynamical systems, phenomena and micromachining; and sensor interfacing.
The Center provides an additional $1000 per student as matching funds towards
the student stipend. The school also contributes $500 per student to be used for
computing facilities, in addition to making facilities and laboratory personnel
available.
