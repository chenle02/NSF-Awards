This award is supported through the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
mechanism. The Soviet Union is experiencing unprecedented political reform.
These reforms are producing corresponding changes in the relations between
political institutions and the public. Because the individual citizen is playing
an expanded civic role, survey research is essential for understanding the new
politics emerging in the Soviet Union. This project entails research on
political attitudes and political participation among the citizens in three
Soviet republics: the Russian Federation, Estonia and the Ukraine. The study
involves interviews with 1600 Soviet citizens and is conducted in cooperation
with scholars from the Center for Political and International Studies in Moscow.
It is critical that this research be done as soon as possible. Scholars have
never before had an opportunity to study the democratization of a communist
political system. Researchers must act quickly to establish a baseline measure
of public opinion before too much change occurs. Moreover, if this project is
delayed, future events, such as political turmoil, might make it impossible to
conduct systematic rigorous surveys. All materials will be catalogued and
archived for use by other social scientists interested in studying political
change in the Soviet Union. The project should add considerably to our
understanding of the democratization process in a communist political system.
