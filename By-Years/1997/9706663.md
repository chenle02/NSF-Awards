9706663 Ritsema This research involves the use of the expanding data base of
high- quality, broad-band digital seismic networks, both permanent and temporary
to invert for earth structure in regions previously undersampled, especially the
lower mantle. Several source- receiver path geometries provide unique sampling
of the lowermost mantle beneath the Indian, South Pacific and Atlantic oceans
that cannot be obtained with comparable detail with past seismic station
coverage. The construction of seismic models for unmapped regions and the
analysis of the full spectrum of length scales over which seismic velocity
structure varies in the lower mantle are primary goals. These aspects remain
crucial to advancing our understanding of the relation of seismic structure to
the thermal and chemical composition of the region, and their influence on
dynamical processes near the core-mantle boundary. ***
