The proposal initiates a partnership to support an LSAMP Phase I alliance of
seven institutions to address the problem of underrepresentation of African-
Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in technological education and
enterprises. The partnership institutions are Elizabeth City State University,
Fisk University, James Madison University, Johnson C. Smith University, St.
Augustine's College, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
The goal of the alliance is to double the current number of SMET degrees earned
by underrepresented minorities (371) in five years. To achieve this the alliance
will incorporate regionally focused orientation programs for first-year
students, oversee program management and technical assistance aggressively, and
measure progress toward the outcomes through internal and external evaluation.
Skill development activities including undergraduate research experiences and
mentor guidance will be provided for LSAMP participants, and enrichment
activities will be provided to improve the analytical skills of K-12 students.
The program will also pursue goals for graduate school matriculation by LSAMP
graduates.
