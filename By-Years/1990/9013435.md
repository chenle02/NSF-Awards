This investigation is directed at improving our understanding of the relatively
large amplitude interannual-interdecadal climate variability. The study
involves: (a) Development of a better documentation of the nature and causes of
the global El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, (b) Use of the NMC
analysis and forecast model output, to develop a better understanding of the
processes associated with tropical-extratropical teleconnections, and (c)
Development of a better understanding and description of low-frequency, large
basin-scale atmospheric-land surface hydrological variations over North America
in general and the Great Plains in particular. This investigation will make
valuable contributions toward our ability to distinguish natural climate
variability from anthropogenic climate trends.
