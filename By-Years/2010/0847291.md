Professor Jayne C. Garno of Louisiana State University &amp; Agricultural and
Mechanical College is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry CAREER
Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a new scanning probe microscopy
method, termed "Magnetic Sample Modulation" for mapping magnetic domains at
nanometer dimensions. The project aims to: (1) evaluate the size scaling effects
of nanomaterials in a range from superparamagnetism to regular bulk
ferromagnetism; (2) study the effect of material composition on magnetic moments
of nanomaterials; (3) differentiate and map magnetic and non-magnetic
nanoparticles; (4) implement magnetic imaging at the level of individual cells;
and (5) apply the newly developed imaging method for dynamic studies with
ferromagnetic proteins such as ferritin. Fundamental knowledge of the effect of
particle shape, size, and surface structure, on the magnetic properties is
essential for understanding the scaling effects of nanomagnetic materials. The
results will have a high potential impact in the fields of nanoscience, surface
chemistry and biotechnology. Scanning probe microscopy imaging concepts will be
introduced in several courses, and students will receive training on state-of-
the-art instrumentation while conducting fundamental research.
