9614562 Kassner The metal fatigue phenomenon is poorly understood, in part
because the dislocation dynamics of reversed deformation is not well
characterized. The direct observation of dislocations during cyclic deformation
(such as with in-situ cyclic or reversed plastic deformation tests in the high
voltage transmission electron microscope) is hindered by the buckling of thin
foils when the applied tensile or shear stress is reversed. Recent experiments
show that buckling of the foil can be avoided and dislocation movement can be
reversed by tensile stressing in alternating perpendicular directions. A new
specimen stage was designed to facilitate this loading and tested in the high
voltage transmission electron microscope under an NSF small grant for
exploratory research (SGER). A series of reversed deformation and fatigue
experiments were successfully performed in the microscope on aluminum single
crystals pre-cyclically deformed to presaturation, forming dense edge-
dislocation dipole bundles with screw dislocations that span the channel. It was
found that screw dislocations move early during reversal although edges and
screws contribute equally to the strain amplitude. Dislocation loop expansion
from the dipole veins appears to be a major source of plastic strain amplitude.
Dipole flipping does not appear to contribute significantly to reversible
strain. In this project these preliminary conclusions are examined using the new
techniques. These experiments are extended by improving the quality of the
microscopy images. The important case where persistent slip bands form is
included in the approach because the slip bands create extrusions and intrusions
which may be sites for fatigue crack nucleation. %%% Fatigue failure is a major
failure mechanism in metal alloy components used in applications that see
alternating loads. This project provides insights into the fatigue mechanism in
reversed loading situations. *** _
