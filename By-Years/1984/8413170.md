The understanding of phase separation phenomena in branching conduits is of
great practical importance in the chemical process, petroleum, and nuclear power
industries. No reliable phase separation models or correlations exist with which
phaseseparation can be predicted in a branching conduit of untested
configuration and/or operating conditions. Moreover, the existing data base is
insufficient to support the development of mechanistic models or reliable
correlations. Phase separation data in relatively large diameter tees and data
in wyes and tees for so-called impacting flows will be obtained. These data are
badly needed for the development of physically-based phase separation models.
