The theoretical treatment of atomic and molecular systems has benefited greatly
in the past thirty years from the development and evolution of high speed
computing facilities. In particular, with the help of computers, scientists are
now able to explore the myriad implications of quantum theory and statistical
mechanics, and analyze much more completely the information derived from
experiments. As a result, scientists are much closer to realizing the eventual
goal of being able to understand and predict the structure, dynamics, and
reactivity of atoms and molecules. Electronic structure theory has been one of
the primary beneficiaries of the increased capacity and speed present in modern
computers. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will aid
the Chemistry Department at the University of Pittsburgh purchase a mini-
supercomputer. This computer will be used in the following research areas of
study: 1. Theoretical Studies on the Nature of Charged Molecular Clusters 2.
Problems in Chemical Dynamics 3. Techniques for Temporal Evolution of Many Body
Quantum Systems 4. Ab Initio Quantum Theory of Structural and Dynamical
Properties 5. Dynamics of Van der Waals Molecules 6. Investigations into
Condensed Phase Dynamics 7. Theoretical Studies of Electronic and Vibrational
Energy Transfer involving unusual Potential Energy Surfaces 8. Analysis of
Molecular Beam Scattering Experiments
