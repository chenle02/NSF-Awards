Police officers’ informal relationships and workplace interactions often guide
police work. As well, organizational hierarchy shapes officers’ daily
interactions through their rank, assignments, and partnerships. By studying
police networks, insight can be gained into the social structure of departments,
organizational cohesion and fragmentation, and the consequences of network
structures on the diffusion of behaviors and attitudes. This project will
investigate the dynamics of police networks on the social transmission of police
behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ surveys to collect
longitudinal data from police officers across disparate law enforcement agencies
in the U.S. The project’s comparative approach to its case studies will be used
to analyze the informal network structure of police departments, and to identify
how various officers are positioned within these network structures. The
research will further test whether and how informal interactions and working
relationships promote the diffusion of various behaviors, and it will examine
the network structures most conducive to these behaviors. The project will
advance our understanding of the informal social organization of policing in
order to determine whether an officer’s position within departmental networks
enables or constrains different behaviors or peer groupings. Findings will
illustrate police network mechanisms and provide tools to identify and respond
to problematic behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
