This project will look at the chemical practice of one of the most important
chemical educators, Herman Boerhaave, and will examine how Boerhaave analyzed
ideas and practices from laboratory work, correspondence, books, and his own
university experiences to produce an organized body of chemical knowledge that
was easily teachable to students. By approaching the problem of chemical
practice in this manner, this research will ultimately illuminate the importance
of both Boerhaave and university education for the development of chemistry as a
scientific discipline. In addition, this work will illustrate the connections
between Boerhaave's pedagogical practices and the social and intellectual
culture of Leyden.
