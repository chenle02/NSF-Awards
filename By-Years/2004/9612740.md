Abstract Lyons 9612740 The PI proposes to carry out an experimental
investigation aimed at making velocity field and scalar field measurements in
turbulent diffusion flames (nonlifted, lifted, and acoustically forced).
Particle image velocimetry (PIV) will be used to obtain velocity data while
planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) will be used to image scalar fields
such as those of CH and OH. The goals of the research are: (1) to measure
velocity fields in turbulent methane jet flames, (2) to measure the velocity
field near the point of stabilization in lifted diffusion flames, (3) to couple
these velocity field measurements with the scalar field measurements to better
understand how the fllowfield interacts with the combustion front, and (4) to
assess the effects of acoustic forcing on the behavior of lifted flames.
