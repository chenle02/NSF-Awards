9412561 A soap film is proposed as the simplest physical system which possesses
icosahedral symmetry. Numerical construction of such a surface with constant
mean curvature is expected to advance our understanding of the quasicrystalline
state. This approach will test the universality of tiling description in
quasicrystals. %%% The proposed work is to obtain a new way to to understand the
quasicrystals without tiles. This will be achieved by numerically constructing
surfaces such as soap films which exhibit icosahedral symmetry. This research
will test universality of the tiling description.
