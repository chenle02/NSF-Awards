Information about neighbor recognition is basic to an understanding of the
behavioral interactions that occur within a social unit. Most studies on the
role of familiarity in mammalian social organizations, however, have been done
on social mammals. Little attention has been given to solitary species, although
most mammals live as solitary individuals during most of their lives. Dr.
Randall's research will examine the role of familiarity in spacing, mate
selection, and kin recognition in the social organization of two species of
solitary, desert rodent: the bannertail (-Dipodomys spectabilis-) and Merriam's
(-D. merriami-) kangaroo rat. Animals of known age, sex, and relationships will
be paired in a large portable enclosure in the field, and their interactions
will be documented and compared. Dr. Randall will also track animals with radio-
transmitters to determine their spacing relationships before and during mating,
and will continue detailed observations of both species' mating behavior. In
addition, a number of studies in the laboratory are planned to examine whether
the kangaroo rats could recognize each other from odors deposited during scent-
marking. The information obtained from this project should help in promoting a
basic understanding of the steps that lead to the development of sociality as it
has evolved in mammalian communities.
