The goals of this project are the analysis of certain problems in number
theory, function theory and scattering theory. Techniques to be used involve
spectral theory of the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on automorphic functions
over a fundamental domain with a finite number of sides and of either finite or
infinite volume. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is central to all three fields
representing an important concept worthy of concentrated study. This work as
well as that recently completed on explicit expanders and Ramanujan graphs gives
the best possible expanders; these are the building blocks for switching
networks as well as sorting schemes. A sharpened form of the Moser inequality
for the projective plane and detailed estimates on the destruction of cusp forms
under perturbation of the Laplacian (and thus the winding number of the
determinant of the scattering matrix) on surfaces of finite volume are expected.
