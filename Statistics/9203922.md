A central question in multivariate data analysis is the number of factors,
usually couched in terms of the "true" rank of the covariance matrix. A variety
of optimality criteria can be applied to the sample covariance matrix; and these
are in fact the basis for many standard multivariate inferential procedures
including principal components analysis, factor analysis, multivariate analysis
of variance and discriminant procedures. This research will examine various
model selection methods, giving special attention to robustness. New approaches
to discriminant analysis will be drawn using ideas from projection pursuit.
Researchers analyzing observations on many variables simul- taneously face the
problem of deciding how many factors are really important. The statistical
procedures used to assess the e number of important factors needs to be stable
in the presence of normal variation present in the data. This research focusses
on desirable new methods to determine the number of such factors and also on
methodology to identify interesting features in the data when many variables are
observed at the same time for only a moderate number of individuals.
