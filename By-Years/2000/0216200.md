This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
prototypes of fieldable eddy-current systems with GMR and SDT sensors that can
detect defects in metals even with significant lift off from the material under
inspection due to such things as thermal barrier coatings. Techniques for
maintaining the a constant distance between the eddy-current probe and the
conductive surface despite intervening coatings will also be developed in this
project. Such a system can be used to lengthen the lifetime of mission critical
components such as aircraft bearings, which at present have to be replaced on
schedule using rather conservative lifetime estimates.&lt;br/&gt; The main
commercial application of these systems would be military and commercial
aircraft. A simple system capable of rapidly scanning an area would require
eddy-current probes that can inspect a large surface in a single pass. Compact
and low-power arrays of GMR and Spin Dependent Tunneling (SDT) sensors developed
for this program can be used in this application as well as other applications
such as nanotechnolgy read heads to read implanted magnetic noise that is
extremely difficult to compromise. The implications for more secure forms of
identification are clear for the post 9/11 world.
