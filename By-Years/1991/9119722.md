Despite the recent advances in the area of adaptive control, most of today's
adaptive control schemes often exhibit poor transient and steady-state
performance. Phenomena such as bursting, chaos and large transient oscillations
are often observed in simulations of stable adaptive schemes. The proposed
research aims to eliminate these undesirable phenomena by studying new design
approaches and introducing the appropriate mathematical tools that can be used
to quantify and analyze transient and steady state performance in addition to
stability and robustness. The design approaches proposed are based on the
augmentation of the certainty equivalence control laws that are used in almost
every adaptive control scheme, by using performance considerations in addition
to stability and robustness. Such augmentation includes discontinuous control
laws as well as smooth ones. The research goal is to develop a procedure for
designing and analyzing adaptive control schemes that can meet prespecified
performance and robustness requirements.
