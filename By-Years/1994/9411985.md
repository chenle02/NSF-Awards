9411985 Shackelford The objective of this Workshop is to promote intra- and
inter-national interaction between the academic, governmental, and industrial
segments of the U.S. and Scandinavian geotechnical communities. It is expected
that this interaction will lead to the definition of common grounds concerning
outstanding geotechnical problems and of probable research avenues toward their
solution. The Workshop will draw together experts from U.S. and Scandinavia in
the following four areas: 1. ground improvement for engineering and
environmental purposes; 2. deformation of geo-materials; 3. hazards, reliability
and risk assessment, and 4. investigation and performance control for geo-
structures. ***
