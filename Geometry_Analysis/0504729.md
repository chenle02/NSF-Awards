Abstract

Award: DMS-0504729 Principal Investigator: Harold Donnelly

The principal investigator plans to study three separate topics: i) Lower bounds
on the counting function for resonances, ii) Quantum unique ergodicity, iii)
Behavior of eigenfunctions near the ideal boundary of hyperbolic space.There is
a large discrepancy between the known upper and lower bounds for the resonance
counting function of Euclidean space with odd dimension.It has been conjectured
that there is a general lower bound which is comparable to the known upper
bound.The proposal is to construct counterexamples which falsify the
conjecture.Quantum unique ergodicity concerns concentration of eigenfunctions on
manifolds with ergodic geodesic flow.In earlier work,manifolds were constructed
where quantum unique ergodicity is violated for packets of eigenfunctions.It is
now proposed to construct counterexamples to quantum unique ergodicity for
individual eigenfunctions.The proposed examples would be perturbations of
manifolds with rotational symmetry,in the exceptional cases where KAM theory
fails to provide invariant tori for the perturbed system.The Laplacian of
hyperbolic space has absolutely continuous spectrum.If one alters the metric on
a compact subset there may exist eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues lie below the
bottom of the essential spectrum.The goal is to understand the nodal set of
these eigenfunctions near the ideal boundary at infinity.

Resonances are mathematical models for physical phenomena related to atomic
spectra.In general,states do not exist forever if unperturbed and resonances
correspond to decaying states which oscillate.Mathematicians seek to understand
quantum mechanics by analogy with classical mechanics.If the classical motion is
chaotic,one expects the probability distribution of the quantum particle to be
dispersed.Exceptions to this pattern,where the particle concentrates,are of
particular interest.The nodal set of a quantum particle is the stationary set
for the associated wave motion.Its distribution and shape are of basic
importance.
