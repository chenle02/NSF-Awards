This research will examine soil carbon dynamics in a free-air carbon dioxide
exchange (FACE) experiment. FACE technology provides an enriched carbon dioxide
atmosphere by pumping carbon dioxide through vents surrounding experimental
plots. This technique avoids confounding effects of increased temperature and
reduced ventilation in chamber studies. This study will address the balance
between carbon inputs and outputs in forest soil/litter and will compare carbon
storage and turnover in soil between experimental and control treatments. %%%
Increased carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is expected to influence
ecological processes, but manipulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide for
experimental purposes has been hampered by technical limitations. The new FACE
technology offers an opportunity to examine effects of carbon dioxide enrichment
on ecological processes. Forest soil organic matter represents a major pool of
carbon. Carbon dioxide enrichment likely will alter turnover of this pool with
potential consequences for further carbon accumulation in the atmosphere.
Therefore, this research will substantially improve our understanding of
consequences of global change.
