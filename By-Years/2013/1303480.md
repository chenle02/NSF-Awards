This project engages Ursinus College undergraduates in experimental nuclear
structure research. The project is part of an ongoing collaboration with
colleagues at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and
Florida State University (FSU). The proposed work will contribute to the
understanding of the evolution of shell structure and core polarization in
neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond 48Ca and the collapse of the N = 28 shell
in 42Si via inverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements at the NSCL.

The broader impact of the project includes maintaining an active research
program in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus College is a
national liberal arts college of about 1700 students with a long history of
strength in the sciences. This project will provide students opportunities to
apply their knowledge of physics outside the classroom, gain practical skills in
data acquisition and analysis, observe and participate in the operation of a
nuclear accelerator facility, and present their work to colleagues. The project
will span three years and support two students for 8-10 weeks per summer.
Participants will travel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data
at Ursinus. They will present their results to the Ursinus community as part of
the Ursinus College Summer Fellows Program and to the nuclear physics community
at American Physical Society/Division of Nuclear Physics meetings.
