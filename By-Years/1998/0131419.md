Catecholamines, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are regulatory molecules
produced by neurons and the adrenal gland. Recently, investigators discovered
that selected cells of the immune system not only take up catecholamines, but
also synthesize these molecules. There is no information, however, on the
regulation of catecholamine synthesis and release in these cells. Furthermore,
the functions of catecholamines released by immune cells are not clear. The goal
of this project is to investigate the molecular regulation of catecholamine
synthesis, storage, and release in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in
peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice. The autocrine and paracrine actions
of macrophage-derived catecholamines also will be investigated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macrophages are important cells in the immune system, and
catecholamines are important molecules produced by neural and endocrine cells.
Based on new evidence that immune cells produce catecholamines, this project
will explore the synthesis and function of these molecules in macrophages.
Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of macrophage
functions and provide clues to links between the nervous, endocrine and immune
systems. &lt;br/&gt;
