This project supports the achievement of higher education degrees by talented
but financially disadvantaged students in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) fields by providing scholarships. Academic and student
support infrastructure for successful graduation of scholarship recipients
includes classes and programs through the college's high quality STEM
departments, faculty advisors for each student in his/her discipline, and
connections to student support services and professional organizations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project advances current knowledge
of best practices in student success strategies for computer science,
engineering, mathematics, and science preparation programs for two-year
colleges. Key personnel have extensive experience on other NSF projects, and
several have been recognized nationally for innovative approaches at two-year
colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project addresses the
severe shortage of students entering STEM fields. Therefore, it benefits society
by enabling more students to enter STEM programs at four-year universities
and/or the workforce. It allows the college to respond to the state's and the
nation's economic needs by cultivating a workforce with the knowledge, skills,
and education level in STEM fields needed to compete in and contribute to the
increasingly knowledge-based global economy.
