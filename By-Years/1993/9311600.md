The traditional subdisciplines of population, community, and ecosystem ecology
have long represented separate avenues for research in terrestrial and aquatic
ecology. Given the pressing environmental needs of the future, interaction and
cooperation between specialists in these subdisciplines becomes imperative. The
purpose of this conference will be to focus on the interface between population,
community, and ecosystem ecology. The fundamental goal of this conference is to
bring together specialists in these subdisciplines to address questions and
issues that lie at the interfaces of population, community, and ecosystem
ecology. Attendees will be challenged to expand their thinking beyond their own
subdisciplines to encourage integration and development of new research.
Proceedings will be published in book form. %%% This conference is an important,
timely, and cost-effective forum for discussion and dissemination of information
on the integration of these subdisciplines.
