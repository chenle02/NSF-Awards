The focus of this research is a broad spectrum study of the transition metal
stabilized phophinidenes, which are believed to be singlets in contrast to the
uncomplexed triplet phosphinidenes, R-P. Phospinidene triplet-single energy gaps
will be determined by high level ab initio calculations, which will also be used
to characterize structural and electronic features of the cycloaddition
pathways, product stabilities, isomerizations, and P-epimerizations. Mechanistic
studies will determine kinetic (absolute and relative rates), thermodynamic
(activation enthalpies and entropies), and stereoselectivity data (anti-/syn-
ratios) for olefin cycloadditions. Phosphinidenes will be used to synthesize
highly strained ring systems, which include alkylidene-phosphiranes, phospha 3
radialenes, phosphaspiranes, phosphabicyclobutanes, phosphiranes derived from
aromatic compounds such as buckministerfullerene, and new heteroycles from
heteroolefins. With this award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Koop Lammertsma of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Alabama at Birmingham. Professor Lammertsma will focus his work on the
exploration of the unique-carbene-like properties associated with transition
metal stabilized phosphinidenes. The study will involve a blend of
sophisiticated calculations, detailed analyses of reaction mechanisms, and a
spectrum of synthetic applications.
