The purpose of this Gordon Research Conference (July 10-15, 2011) is to bring
together established and developing experts in the field of catchment sciences,
to share the results of cutting-edge research, develop new collaborations, and
assess where the science stands, where the sciences needs to go and to best
understand the future of catchments under global change. The 2011 GRC on
Catchment Science will be chaired by Irena Creed (University of Western Ontario,
Canada) and co-chaired by Doerthe Tetzlaff (University of Aberdeen, Scotland).
