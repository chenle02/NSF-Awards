This award will support an international conference organized by the American
Quaternary Association (AMQUA) in Anchorage, Alaska on August 5-7, 2002 entitled
"Paleoclimate, Environmental Change, and Human Migrations in the North Pacific
Basin." The purpose of the conference is to bring together international
experts, practitioners, and students to share the latest developments in North
Pacific paleoclimatology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, funds will provide
an undergraduate assistant to help with organizational logistics, travel support
for 15 students who will present posters on their research projects, and travel
support for 7 experienced professionals who will be invited to provide
presentations that synthesize the latest research in their area of
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific themes of the various conference
sessions are compatible and relevant to research projects supported by the
Paleoclimate Program and include Late Holocene high-resolution climate studies,
Quaternary paleoecology, and paleoclimatic teleconnections between high and low
latitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A final report synthesizing and summarizing the
conference findings will be posted on public websites for reading by the wider
scientific community.
