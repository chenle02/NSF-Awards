Research in turbulent non- premixed combustion will be conducted. The issue of
flame-turbulent flow is of fundamental importance to combustion science and
technology. The approach of simultaneous measurements of flow topology and
reaction structure is ideally suited to obtain detailed information
onturbulence-reaction field interactions and to gain deeper insight
intofundamentals of turbulent combustion. In this approach, advanced
lasertechniques are to be used which are ideally suited to obtain
detailedinformation. Most high-yield combustor systems operate in the turbulent
regime; acquiring basic knowledge in the area can lead to improvements in
combustion technology.
