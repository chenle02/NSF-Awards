ABSTRACT AST-9420159. Irvine, William M. The 14m radio telescope of the Five
College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) is owned and operated by the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. By operating the facility under the Five
College Astronomy program, faculty and students at the University and 4 other
nearby institutions (Smith College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College and
Hampshire College) can utilize each other's facilities. The antenna is used
primarily for interstellar spectroscopy in the 80-120 GHz band, although single-
pixel receivers are also available for the 130-170 GHz and 35-50 GHz bands; a
dual-channel 1mm receiver system is also available. This award will support
education, technology development and research with the 14-meter radio telescope
for a period of three years. Building on its success during the past three-year
grant period, the 15-element focal plane array receiver and recentlycompleted
autocorrelator spectrometer will be used in a wide variety of studies of objects
ranging from the Solar system to the distant galaxies. Major observatory
programs in this period will include an imaging survey of carbon monoxide
emission from the first quadrant of the Galaxy, a systematic survey of the cores
of several nearby molecular clouds, objects believed to be sites of imminent
star formation, and a systematic, high-resolution study of molecular gas in the
nearby Andromeda spiral galaxy. Work will also begin on a new generation of
focal plane array receivers, intended to increase the mapping capabilities of
the FCRAO antenna by an order of magnitude. ***
