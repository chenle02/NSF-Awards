The objective of the proposed research is to use a molecular genetic approach
to gain an understanding of the developmental mechanisms that regulate cell
expansion in tip-growing plant cells. To achieve this goal, Dr. Schiefelbein has
chosen to study elongation in root hairs, a relatively simple and accessible
cell type in plants. Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated that
synthesize root hairs with irregular growth patterns. He will initially
concentrate on two mutants (rhd3 and rhd4) that, based on preliminary analyses,
are likely to harbor mutations in genes intimately involved in root hair
elongation. The specific research approaches will include: 1) characterization
of the ultrastructure, microfilaments, and ion currents in the wild type and
mutant root hairs, 2) linkage analysis and isolation of new alleles of the RHD3
and RHD4 genes, 3) RFLP mapping and molecular cloning of the genes by chromosome
walking with a yeast artificial chromosome library, and 4) isolation and
stepwise characterization of additional genes affecting root hair elongation.
The results from this research are expected to provide basic information on the
mechanism regulating expansion in tip-growing cells, as well as to define
specific genes governing root hair elongation in plants.
