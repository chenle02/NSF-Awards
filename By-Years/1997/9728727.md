9728727 Nijhout Metamorphosis is one of the critical periods in insects
development, during which an immature larva transforms into a mature adult
insect. Understanding the mechanisms that control metamorphosis is of critical
importance to many areas of insect physiology and development. Dr. Nijhout's
current understanding of the hormonal control of metamorphosis rests largely on
information derived from studies on the epidermis and general body wall. The PI
has found in recent years that metamorphosis of the imaginal disks, the
structures that give rise to the legs, wings, antennae, and mouthparts of the
adult insect, appear to be controlled in a manner quite different from that of
the general epidermis. In particular, these structures begin the developmental
process of metamorphosis much earlier than the general epidermis. Imaginal disks
begin metamorphosis at a time when the level of juvenile hormone (the hormone
that controls the progress of development of insects) is present at high levels
in the blood and is still actively inhibiting metamorphosis of the epidermis.
The PI has developed a series of investigations to test an array of alternative
hypotheses that could explain this divergence of physiological control of
development of epidermis and imaginal disks. Among others, the PI will study the
relative roles of juvenile hormone and ecdysone (the molting hormone) in
controlling the expression patterns of genes associated with the early stages of
metamorphic development, the relative sensitivities of imaginal disks and
epidermis to these developmental hormones, and the role of cell-cell
communication signals in determining the timing and spatial pattern of the
developmental commitment to metamorphosis in these tissues. By providing a
comparative understanding of the control of development of epidermis and
imaginal disks, these studies will provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms
that control of insect metamorphosis.
