9724169 Campbell This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
between Dr Charles T. Campbell and Dr. David G. Castner of the University of
Washington to work with Professor Martin Schmal at the Federal University in Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil on the influence of support and additives on Pd-based
catalysts for emission control. The goal of this project is to clarify catalytic
processes which are relevant to environmental protection. They will investigate
the relationships between the activity of a series of palladium-based catalysts
and their surface structure. They will prepare catalysts and test them with
classic techniques, such as activity measurements, surface areas, temperature
programmed reduction, and porosity. Their surface structure and composition will
be characterized using facilities at the University of Washington, which are not
available in Brazil. Schmal's group has extensive experience in the
characterization of supported catalysts with reactor studies, selective
chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction and temperature programmed
oxidation and adsorbate structure. The U.S. group brings expertise in the area
of surface analysis and the surface science of catalysis. Findings from this
research will be useful in developing commercial supported catalysts with
optimum structures and maximum emission control activity. The full kinetic and
mechanistic information will identify critical barriers and operating conditions
that limit emission control activity, and possibly provide a basis for
developing strategies to overcome barriers and limitations. The results will
also provide information about properties that would be desirable to have for a
promotion of emission control catalysts. * * *
