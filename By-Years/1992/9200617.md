The PI has organized the XXth Informal Conference on Photochemistry scheduled
to be held in Atlanta during the period 26 April - 1 May, 1992. The conference
will address the following topics: atmospheric photochemistry, free radical
kinetics, free radical spectroscopy, optical diagnostic techniques,
photochemistry on surfaces, photophysics and energy transfer, reaction dynamics,
and photodissociation dynamics. The PI has requested funding from NSF to cover
the cost of travel and conference fees for junior scientists (postdoctoral and
graduate students) only. (The PI will seek funds for travel support for invited
speakers and other attendees from other government agencies.)
