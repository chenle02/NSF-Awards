DEB-0129105 R. DeSalle & P. O'Grady

A grant has been awarded to Drs. Rob DeSalle and Patrick O'Grady of the American
Museum of Natural History to investigate evolutionary relationships of flies in
the family Drosophilidae, a group of about 3,300 described species. In spite of
recent research efforts, systematic relationships of genera and species groups
within the Drosophilidae remain unresolved. This is likely due to the rapid
diversification of this large group. The proposed work will generate about 60
gene sequences from over 100 species. This will comprise one of the largest
collections of nucleotide data, in terms of number of loci and taxa, ever
gathered for a phylogenetic study. In addition to being applied to understanding
the phylogenetic relationships within the Drosophilidae, these data will also be
used to examine the molecular evolutionary patterns and processes acting on the
genomes of these species.

The Drosophilidae has served as a model system in genetics, evolution, and
development for over one hundred years. The recent completion of the Drosophila
melanogaster genome sequence, provides us with an unprecidented amount of data
which can be used to initiate comparative studies in other drosophild species.
The proposed work will make the entire Drosophilidae a model system for
molecular phylogenetic studies. Furthermore, the data generated in this proposed
work will facilitate the next stage of comparative evolutionary studies -
comparative genomics.
