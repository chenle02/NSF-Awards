In this project Bromberg will investigate a number of different questions in 2
and 3 dimensional hyperbolic geometry. One problem is to understand the topology
of deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3- manifolds. For example, when are these
spaces locally connected? The PI is also working to understand the most general
conditions for a sequence of Kleinian groups to converge. Another topic is to
find a quantitative version of Thurston's Bounded Image Theorem. The PI is also
studying the Mapping Class Group, the group of symmetries of a two dimensional
topological surface. One particular question is the asymptotic dimension of this
group, which is an important invariant defined by
Gromov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two and three dimensional manifolds are some of the
most important topics mathematicians study. They are the objects we live on and
in. &lt;br/&gt;Going back to Poincare and Klein mathematicians have used
geometric methods to study these topological objects. Thurston's work from the
seventies showed the special importance of hyperbolic geometry. More recently
many of Thurston's original conjectures have been proven by bringing new
techniques into the field and at same time new questions and conjectures. This
project will explore these new approaches with the hope of expanding our
knowledge of two and three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;
