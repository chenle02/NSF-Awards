The mathematical theory of weak convergence has been shown to have important
applications to problems arising in continuum physics because it describes the
relations between microscopic variables and their averages at a macroscopic
level. In order to average nonlinear quantities, a mathematical tool called
compensated compactness has been developed by F. Murat and the principal
investigator and it has been used to obtain various relations of a macroscopic
nature from corresponding microscopic relations. An improvement of this tool,
based on so called H- measures that first appeared in questions of
homogenization, has been developed recently by the principal investigator. The
goal of this project is to further study the mathematical properties of
H-measures, enlarge the class of its applications to nonlinear partial
differential equations of continuum mechanics, and define more general
mathematical objects that could remedy some of the already known limitations of
H- measures. Particular areas to be studied include effective properties of
mixtures, nonlocal effects induced by homogenization, evolution of
microstructures in composite materials and damping of waves in heterogeneous
materials.
