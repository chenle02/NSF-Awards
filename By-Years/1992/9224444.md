This is a study of social networks and community response to a natural
disaster. It will survey officials and a random sample of residents in an area
of South Louisiana recently devastated by hurricane Andrew, to learn the roles
played by informal and formal social structures in shaping individuals' actions
before, during, and immediately after the storm. In particular, individuals in
highly dense networks are predicted to behave very differently from those in
more extensive networks, for example in how quickly they evacuated their homes.
Furthermore, individuals may use different portions of their social network to
seek different kinds of aid. The study employs well-developed techniques for
collecting network data, and it will analyze them with appropriate statistical
methods. The hurricane offers a practically unique opportunity to examine human
behavior under extreme conditions, extending the knowledge social scientists
have gained in research on more usual conditions. Well grounded in standard
sociological theory, this study promises significant scientific gains. But it
also will offer insights to help community leaders communicate and provide
social services more effectively in times of crisis.
