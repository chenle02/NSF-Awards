The objective of this research is to examine the effect of some important soil
variables under controlled laboratory conditions on supercritical extraction of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from soils. Furthermore, it is also proposed to
evaluate the properties of soils before and after supercritical extraction is
performed. Numerous sites in this country are contaminated with PCBs. The
remediation of PCB contaminated sites requires the excavation and treatment of
the contaminated soil. This information this research will provide is required
before treated soil can be safely returned to its original site.
