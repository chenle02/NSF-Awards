Current phylogenetic hypotheses for orders of insects are seriously restricted
by the lack of clear synapomorphies in the morphological data. In particular,
relationships among members of the Holometabola are highly controversial and few
ordinal relationships are well supported. Through the use of DNA sequence data
taken from various loci in the nuclear and mitochondrial genome, I propose to
produce a new data set for reevaluation of current phylogenetic hypotheses. The
objectives of this research are threefold: (1) to produce a phylogeny for the
Holometabola based on DNA sequence data, (2) to test for the monophyly of the
Holometabola, and (3) to compare hierarchical patterns among different classes
of data i.e. morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and single copy nuclear DNA.
