The proposed research, a collaboration between MIT and Raytheon Research
Laboratories, is aimed at applying focused ion beam implantation to high
performance GaAs integrated circuits. Since microwave and millimeter wave
monolithic circuits (MMIC's) often have a variety of high performance devices on
each chip, we will particularly focus on this class of circuits. The research
will have three main components: a) integration of the focused ion beam into
MMIC fabrication including verification of registration and of equivalence with
conventional implantation; b) demonstration of the focused ion beam for
prototyping of MMIC's by the implantion of a large variety of doses and energies
in one step and; c) fabrication of high performance FET's by special implanted
structures, i.e. variation also of the implant geometry within a device; d)
implantation of complete MMIC.
