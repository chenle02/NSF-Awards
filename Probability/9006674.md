The principal investigators will study stochastic process models for systems
which are naturally monotone and they will solve stochastic control problems for
these systems. One important application for such processes is in optimal
control and replacement problems for systems subject to deterioration and
failure. They will work with a class of system models for wear in which one
component of a vector process is monotone. These systems are constructed from
diffusions and dynamic programming techniques for the analysis of controlled
diffusions can be extended. The monotonicity of the wear process provides
additional structure and their analysis will take advantage of this structure.
