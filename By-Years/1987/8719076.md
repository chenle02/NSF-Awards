The project is to optimize conditions for germination of the sexually formed
macrocysts of Dictyostelium discoideum. We plan to 1) Screen wild isolates for
pairs making macrocysts which germinate quickly and at a high rate. 2) Select
mutant strains which increase germination. 3) Accelerate germination with
enzymes which digest the macrocyst wall and with pheromonal factors from other
germinating macrocysts. The goal is to achieve at least 10% germination of
macrocysts after 6 weeks of dormancy, a rate which has proved adequate for
routine use with other species. Genetic experiments which use macrocyst system
will not be attempted during the period of this project. Dictyostelium has been
used for studies in development for a number of years. But its potential has
never been realized because rapid genetic methods for obtaining high-frequency
recombination within a linkage group do not exist. The successful completion of
this project would be of great service to the scientific community and a
contribution to the development of Dictyostelium as an experimental genetic
system.
