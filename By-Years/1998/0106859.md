This research will investigate deformation mechanisms in quartzo-feldspathic
rocks with the aim of enhancing our understanding of deformation history of the
crust as well as to facilitate accurate modeling of the stress levels and stain
partitioning in different tectonic settings. The investigators will work on 3
research projects. First they will complete an experimental calibration of the
recrystallized grain size piezometer for the 3 recrystallization mechanisms and
corresponding dislocation creep regimes previously identified in quartz, and
will test them with application to a natural shear zone which spanned a wide
temperature range including all 3 regimes. Second, they will complete an
experimental study of the processes by which a relatively small amount of weak
mica in a quartza-feldspathic aggregate becomes interconnected and dispersed,
leading to profound strain weakening and localization into ductile shear zones.
Third, they will complete a reconnaissance experimental study of the variation
in deformation mechanisms and strength across the plagioclase solid solution
series. Based on that study the investigators will choose 2 or 3 key
compositions for further stepping experiments in a molten salt assembly to
determine flow law parameters.
