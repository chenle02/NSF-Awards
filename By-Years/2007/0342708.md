Abstract for the award DMS-0342708 of Solomon

A conference on "Advances in Groups, Geometries, Representations and Galois
Theory" will be held on October 26--29, 2003 at Yale University to honor Walter
Feit on the occasion of his 73rd birthday and his retirement. We are requesting
$15,000 in addition to the $7,500 being provided by Yale University. The work of
Walter Feit has profoundly influenced the development of finite group theory,
representation theory, finite geometry, coding theory and Galois theory. This
conference will bring together researchers in all of these areas, pure and
applied, ranging from Feit's great contemporaries, such as Serre and Thompson,
to the budding young researchers of today.

There is no doubt that the mutual interaction of these researchers from
different generations, different fields and different countries will be
inspirational and fruitful of new research breakthroughs and create new networks
of research interaction, both in pure mathematics and in applications to the
crucial areas of coding theory, cryptography and computer recognition of groups
and combinatorial structures. The additional funds requested here will help to
guarantee the international nature of this conference, bringing in leading
researchers and students from England, France and elsewhere. It will also ensure
the participation of U.S. graduate students and recent PhD recipients, many of
whom are women. (Six young women participants are specifically mentioned at the
end of the project description.) We also intend to publish and disseminate
broadly a set of proceedings of this conference, which will delineate the
advances in the field over the past 50 years and point the way for the research
and applications of the future.
