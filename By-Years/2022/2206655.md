This project is focused on an investigation of the atmospheric chemistry
processes that lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the
urban atmosphere. The research will address the key precursors or gases that
lead to the formation of SOA and their sources and volatility ranges. The
information developed will help to predict the evolution of urban SOA that leads
to air pollution and the design of effective mitigation
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science questions that will be addressed
are: (1) What are the most important SOA precursors in urban air? (2) What are
the sources of the most important SOA precursors? (3) What are the SOA formation
pathways for the most important precursors? (4) Has SOA chemistry changed over
the past decade? and (5) Can the description of urban SOA in chemistry-transport
models be improved?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-week field campaign will be
conducted in the Los Angeles area in Summer 2022. Comparison of the data with
previous studies, including the CalNex study in 2010, will show how the SOA
precursors and chemistry have evolved over the last decade. The project includes
training for several graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
