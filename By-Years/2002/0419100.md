This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to
demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of cost- and energy-
efficient conversion of carbon-containing feedstocks to well- defined carbon
nanotubes. The proposed work will include a) the proof of concept of high-yield
synthesis of carbon nanotubes in premixed flames with catalyst precursors added
to the initial feed gas and b) the establishment of correlations between yields
and characteristics of carbon nanotubes and experimental. Results will provide
qualitative insight in the formation mechanism(s) whereas kinetic modeling will
assist in the identification of optimized operating conditions.

The unique electrical, mechanical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes
allow for a large range of applications. Some of them, such as their use as
field emitters in flat panel displays, are approaching market maturity while an
inexpensive supply of well-defined carbon nanotubes is currently missing.
Results of the proposed work are expected to have a significant impact on the
achievement of the technological and commercial potential of carbon nanotubes.
