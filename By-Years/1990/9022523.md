Research is the area of fluid mechanics, specifically laminar- turbulent
transition. The focus is on two critical issues: boundary-layer receptivity and
the stability of supersonic/hypersonic boundary-layers. The following features
of high-speed flight must be addressed and their effects on transition
determined: nonequilibrium chemistry and the sweep of the wings. This research
will combine the effects of chemistry and sweep and, in the process, determine
appropriate shock boundary conditions for the disturbances as well as include
the effects of leading-edge bluntness and nonparallelism. The research will
consist of both a linear stability analysis and a Parabolized Navier-Stokes
(theoretical/numerical) treatment.
