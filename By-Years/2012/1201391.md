The proposal is composed of three parts. The first part is aimed at problems in
Poisson Lie groups and cluster algebra aspects of representations of quantized
universal Lie algebras. The results of this investigation will be used to
construct and study invariants of knots and invariants of 3-manifolds. The goal
of the second part is the development of the semiclassical quantization of
classical field theories. It has two major directions: the first one is the
definition of the partition function for space time manifolds with boundaries,
the second one is the verification of locality of quantum field theory through
the gluing operation for partition functions. This portion of the project is
focused mainly on topological gauge theories, in particular on the Chern-Simons
theory. The third part of the proposal is focused on problems in equilibrium
statistical mechanics. The PI plans to continue to investigate the behavior of
correlation functions and of the partition functions for models with fixed
boundary conditions on states and, in particular, scaling limits of
semiclassical type. Such semiclassical limits appear in the study of correlation
functions of `long operators" in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

Significant portion of the first part of the proposal is aimed at providing
algebraic tools for constructing quantum topological gauge theories. One of the
fundamental problems in particle physics is to construct a theory which explains
the dynamics of experimentally detected particles and would explain their
variety. The Standard Model is a candidate for such theory. One of the key
aspects of this theory is that its classical counterpart has infinite
dimensional internal symmetry known as gauge symmetry. This makes the
construction of the quantum theory incredibly complicated. Strictly speaking,
mathematically the theory is still in its childhood. The second part of the
proposal is aimed at resolving such problems in a simpler case of topological
gauge theory, where the dynamics is much simpler but the symmetry is exactly the
same. The last part of the proposal focuses on the study of phenomena very
similar to large deviations in probability theory (estimate the probability that
a coin will fall xN times on one side and (1-x)N times on the other side in N
trials for large N) and to the stochastic origins of hydrodynamics (we know that
the motion of water is deterministic at large scale, but is random at the
molecular scale). The PI will continue to study similar phenomena in a number of
two dimensional models.
