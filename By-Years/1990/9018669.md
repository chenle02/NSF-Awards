The College of Engineering at Michigan State University project will develop
funding, recruiting and retention programs for women and minorities seeking
Ph.D. degrees. The College will continue to recruit these students to its
nationally recognized research centers. NSF funds initially will be used for
support of six students while the College develops recurring fellowship funding
to provide long-term stability for the program. The efforts will emphasize
recruitment of African Americans and women. The goal is to provide a four to
five year funding profile for outstanding Ph.D. students having the monetary
advantages of a fellowship while involving the student in regular research and
teaching. The full fellowship during the first year permits the student
flexibility while choosing a research advisor. During years 2 through 4, the
student's primary support will be provided by research and teaching
assistantships. This helps assure that the student contributes to research and
teaching, thereby acting as a role model for other students. Dissertation
fellowships are available for the final year to allow the student to complete
papers and the dissertation. During the NSF award period, the NSF fellowship
model would be used while Michigan State University develops continuing
endowments to operate the proposed program.
