Understanding the nature of theorems and proofs has been a central quest in the
foundations of computer science. The design of the modern computer owes its
origins to this quest, and this quest has continued to play a pivotal role in
developing a theory of computing. This research project investigates new
questions in the context of verifying proofs. It investigates the capacity of
proofs to be verified probabilistically, trading off a small possibility of
incorrect verification for a huge advantage in the time taken to verify proofs.
Research in the recent past (last ten years or so) has shown that probabilistic
verification of proofs is a feasible goal and can lead to surprisingly efficient
verifiability. However the results have not been of practical use so far. The
main obstacle to practical utility is that the probabilistically verifiable
proofs are much longer than classical proofs. This project investigates the
tradeoff between the size of a probabilistically checkable proof and the
complexity of verifying it. It will also investigate new applications of such
proof systems, and in particular, to the task of automatic verification of
correct execution of computer programs. For broader impact, the project will
also foster understanding and interest into the foundations of information and
computation to a wide audience via educational and outreach activities.
