Most recently the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but also the preceding
experiments with democracy by Eastern European countries and the return to
democracy in several Latin American countries have heightened international
interest in democracy. Essential to advancing our knowledge of the causes and
consequences of liberal democracy--the extent that a political system allows
political liberties and democratic rule--as well as to policy decisions
facilitating democratic initiatives is the accurate measurement of democracy.
The goal of this continuation project is to advance the measurement of liberal
democracy of countries. The project will complete a cross-national time series
(1950-1990) data set containing indicators of liberal democracy. Measurement
models to estimate the validity, source biases, and random errors in the
indicators will be developed. In this veritable age of democratization, access
to the data set developed in this project will permit systematic comparative
time series analyses by political sociologists and political scientists of the
causes and consequences of democracy on a variety of political and economic
conditions. The project's findings on the measurement properties of the
indicators of liberal democracy will be useful not only to the scholarly
community, but also to a number of U.S. government and international agencies
that are seeking ways of assessing democratic developments in countries.
