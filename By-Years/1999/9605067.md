The 1997 Gordon Research Conference on Molecular Energy Transfer is the 15th in
the series to explore the role of energy transfer in the interactions between
molecules. The program of the conference will address the role of this process
in a broad range of physical environments, including clusters, condensed phases,
and combustion systems, as well as the more conventional reactive and non-
reactive dilute gases. Meetings will be held during the week of January 5- 10,
in Ventura, California.
