This project is for the conduct of an international assessment in science and
mathematics of 13-year old students. In 1988, six countries will participate in
the assessment (England, Korea, four provinces in Canada, Ireland, Spain, and
the United States). Items selected from the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) will be used to test 2,000 students in each of the six
countries. A report of findings showing the relative achievement of U.S.
students vs. the other countries will be issued within 18 months of the conduct
of the assessment.
