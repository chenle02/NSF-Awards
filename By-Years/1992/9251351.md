This project is to improve and upgrade the optics laboratory experiences for
physics students at St. Mary's University by enabling our students to measure
intensity and polarization in addition to the geometrical properties of light,
work with lasers and interferometers and perform some two-dimensional image
processing. Hands-on experience with modern equipment at the college level is
particularly important for our students, a predominant percentage of whom are
minority Hispanics who come from high schools having limited physics courses
with poorly equipped laboratories. Optics has been chosen for improvement at
this time because other parts of the physics laboratory curriculum have received
some update and improvement during the past several years. The equipment
purchased includes eight optics systems, each with laser and interferometer,
provide the means to study traditional properties of light. A microwave set has
been obtained to demonstrate optical phenomenon with three cm waves. The 386 SX
computers equip our students to explore automatic data collection and online
data analysis as well as to perform image processing. The instruments acquired
allow these students to perform experiments at a level that increases their
interest in physical science and encourages participation in science beyond the
introductory level.
