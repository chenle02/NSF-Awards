At the number of jobs in which shared rather than individual work continues to
grow, the way people work must be re- examined. This proposal suggests that in
today's workplace, computer scientists must be adept at both technical as well
as communication skills. Educators must prepare students to work in the
collaborative environments found in today's industry. The individual programmer
is rapidly becoming extinct. This proposal is to adapt an existing computer-
supported cooperative problem solving environment and use it in software
development courses. By doing this, the problem solving skills of students will
be expanded and thus release into the computer science community graduates who
are more effective programmers. The environment will encourage cooperative work
and yet provide instructors with some ability to monitor individual as well as
group performance. This proposal is to network the requested machines, configure
them with the cooperative problem solving environment, and dedicate them to this
project. With a student machine ratio of 3.5, students will be able to learn
software engineering techniques and, at the same time, gain valuable experience
in working together on large team projects.
