Diadenosine 5'5"-PI,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A), a dinucleoside polyphosphate
present in all organisms examined including humans, has several properties
expected of a regulatory nucleotide. Ap4A has been proposed to function in cell
proliferation and the adaptive response to oxidative stress. The major goal is
to determine the function(s) of Ap4A in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
during growth, starvation-induced arrest and the cellular response to oxidative
stress. The processes that will be examined are growth under different
conditions including catabolite repression, arrest of cell growth by deprivation
of specific nutrients, and cellular responses to oxidative stress induced by
several agents and conditions.
