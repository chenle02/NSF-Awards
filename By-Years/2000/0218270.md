This inter-disciplinary research examines a growing controversy in Hawai'i over
the introduction of marine aquaculture (mariculture) technology, which involves
both a new technology and a new system of property. Hawai' i is a multicultural
society in which there is no racial or cultural majority, and where a strong
indigenous cultural and political movement brings to the fore a clear cultural
and epistemic dimension to technology policy controversies. The nature of open
ocean mariculture technology that depends on a common resource demands a level
of consensus among the broader community. These two conditions make the case of
mariculture in Hawaii highly instructive for understanding the role of culture
in mediating the interplay between technology and society. The main research
questions are: &lt;br/&gt;How does culture influence the mutual interplay of
technology and society in a multicultural plurality? &lt;br/&gt;How do cultural
differences complicate conflicts, in this case those surrounding property
changes brought by mariculture technology? &lt;br/&gt;What are the implications
of the findings for the technological development, the evolution of property
regimes, and cultural transformation? &lt;br/&gt;This investigation of the
introduction of mariculture uses the qualitative method of event analysis; it
follows the actors from different standpoint epistemologies to solicit their
framing of the events, interactions and surrounding controversies. Key actors
include mariculture entrepreneurs, scientists, Native Hawaiian advocates and
cultural practitioners, fishers, state agency personnel, land-based
&lt;br/&gt;aquaculture farmers and state legislators. Operational questions are
organized along four areas of inquiry including: a) substance, character and
dynamics of controversies; b) property claims; &lt;br/&gt;c) social contests,
techno-scientific choices and evolving property regimes; and d) cultural norms
and practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
