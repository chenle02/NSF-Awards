This research proposal seeks to use fractal or self-similar models to describe
the long-range correlations observed in measurements of traffic from actual
networks, and apply techniques to deal with fractal models, well-known in
physics but hardly ever used in the area of network performance analysis, to
obtain relevant insight into the performance of modern high-speed networks for
their design, management, and control. The research seeks to quantify the impact
of fractal traffic characteristics on network performance, building on the
present experience with self-similar traffic models. First, the work will extend
the understanding of simple single-server models achieved by the PIs and other
authors. The effects of complications such as multiple service classes and
finite buffer sizes, and the modifications needed when self similarity is only
asymptotic (relevant for variable-bit-rate services) will be considered. Second,
the effects of connecting a large number of nodes in a network will be
investigated including issues such as the robustness of self similarity.
Finally, the project will tackle the difficult problems of understanding the
transformations induced on self similar traffic by network controls as well as
the consequences of self similarity on the effectiveness of the controls
themselves. The work will consist of constructing simple models for networks,
testing their validity through numerical simulations, and comparing their
behavior with experimental measurements from real networks. The behavior of
these models will be studied through a combination of numerical and analytical
techniques.
