This project uses the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-CHEM) three-
dimensional chemical-transport model to investigate processes controlling
tropospheric ozone and selected related trace constituents of the troposphere,
relying heavily on satellite remote-sensing, aircraft and surface station data
sets to initialize, constrain and evaluate the model. The high-resolution
modeling will focus specifically on process and regional studies of selected
trace gases important to the global environment, placing emphasis on interannual
variability and an investigation of regional sources and sinks. Work on trace
carbon gases will be carried out in collaboration with Daniel Jacob (Harvard
University). The Asian region and its effect on the global environment will be
investigated, including the somewhat novel consideration of the influence of
European and American emissions on Asian air quality. The project will provide
important updated information on concentration fields globally of several
important tropospheric trace constituents, important for projections of future
concentrations. Results will have important policy-relevant implications within
the global community of nations, especially those undergoing rapid economic
development. This award will provide educational opportunities for graduate
students and a post-doctoral student.
