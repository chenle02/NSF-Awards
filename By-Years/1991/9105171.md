The 1991 symposium will be the twenty-fourth in an annual series. It will be
held in San Antonio, Texas in August, and its theme is Theoretical Approaches
for Predicting Spatial Effects in Ecological Systems. Topics included are the
use of diffusion based models to predict the movement and distribution of animal
populations, the use of renormalization theory to develop scale- independent
spatial models, non-linear Markov models for simulating landscape changes, the
development and application of spatial ecosystem models for estimating long-term
ecological effects, the effect of economic policies on the spatial patterns of
land-use, and the use of percolation theory to examine the effects of spatial
heterogeneity. The overall goal of the symposium is to expose biologists to
recent theoretical work by mathematicians, and to expose mathematicians to some
of the key problems and constraints faced by ecologists in the analysis and
simulation of ecological systems.
