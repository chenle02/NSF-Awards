Paczynski will carry out theoretical research centered on problems of stellar
evolution and neutron stars. Paczynski is a world-class theoretical
astrophysicist who has tackled problems of stellar evolution, x-ray emitting
stars, binary pairs of stars that transfer matter among each other in a violent
manner, and more. This award allows him to continue his research with additional
focus on stellar evolution and neutron stars.
