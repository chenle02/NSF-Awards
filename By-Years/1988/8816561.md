The objective of this investigation is to determine the role of diagenesis in
controlling the accumulation of carotenoid and chlorophyll pigments in lake
sediments. The research plan includes both field data collection and laboratory
experiments. The field approach involves measuring the concentrations of parent
pigments and their derivatives in sediment traps and sediment cores from a group
of contrasting lakes. Comparisons of sediment trap material and surface sediment
cores from a group of contrasting lakes. Comparisons of sediment trap material
and surface sediments will be used to evaluate the importance of oxygen status,
sediment mixing, detritivore activity, and organic matter content in controlling
diagenesis rates. Laboratory experiments involve production of 14C-labelled
pigments using algal cultures, incubation of labelled pigments in sediments
under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and measurement of the rates and
pathways of pigment degradation by sediment bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic) and
a detritivore (chironomids). Methodology will include analysis of pigments and
degradation products by HPLC and mass spectrometry and use of 210Pb to determine
sedimentation rates, sediment mixing, and sediment focusing. Information on
pigment diagenesis in lake sediments will facilitate using sediment pigment
profiles to determine organic matter sources, changes in algal types and primary
production, and to evaluate the role of organic matter cycling in controlling
the chemical composition of lakes, all of primary importance to
paleoenvironmental reconstruction of lake history and to understanding of how
biomolecules develop into geomolecules.
