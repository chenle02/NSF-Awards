9706720 Mitchell This research involves the mapping of attenuative dispersion
along paths through the source zone of New Madrid earthquakes as well as along
paths outside of, but contiguous to, that zone. Both theoretical and
observational research has shown that waves which have been attenuated by either
intrinsic anelasticity or by scattering processes also exhibit dispersion.
Attenuative dispersion associated with regional seismic phases has been found to
be easily measurable in regions where those phases attenuate rapidly with
distance. Abundant amounts of data obtained from PANDA stations, as well as from
USNSN stations, in and surrounding the New Madrid seismic zone should be
available for these studies. Relating the variation of Q to the properties of
the crust may provide new information on earthquake processes in the New Madrid
region. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
