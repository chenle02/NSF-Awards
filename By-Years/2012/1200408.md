The grant provides funding for a study of structure-property-processing
correlations in ice-templated materials, applying the unique facilities of the
Ice Research Laboratory at Dartmouth College to gain insight into the
fundamental science of the freeze-casting process. The objectives are to test
the following hypotheses: (i) that ice crystal growth in polymer solutions can
be carefully controlled so that scaffolds can be created that have highly
aligned, unidirectional pore structures with additional microstructural features
within the pores, (ii) that the geometry and surface structure of the ice
crystal, and thus the ice-templated scaffold, can be controlled through
materials composition, additives and freezing conditions, (iii) that pore size
and geometry and pore surface structure can be modeled and predicted. Collating
the empirical and theoretical results and plotting them in structure-property-
processing charts will aid the systematic exploration of currently unpopulated
?white spaces? in the material structure and property space, enabling an
objective comparison of the performance of different scaffold compositions and
designs, pointing out property profiles which are of particular promise.

The successful completion of the described work will provide knowledge and tools
that guide a paradigm shift towards a more systematic approach for the design
and manufacture of porous materials made by freeze casting by making the
collected structure-property-processing correlations accessible to a broad
audience. Major contributions of this work are expected to impact a multitude of
application areas such as biomaterials and tissue scaffolds (e.g., nerve, bone),
multifunctional materials for architectural and environmental engineering (e.g.,
infra-red reflecting, thermally insulating, electromagnetic shielding
materials), green design (e.g., renewable packaging) and energy generation and
storage (e.g., biobatteries, nuclear fuel pellets).
