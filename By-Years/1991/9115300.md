Dr. Sandra Vargo is the Associate Director of the Florida Institute of
Oceanography of the University of South Florida. The Institute, in partnership
with the Florida Department of Natural Resources, operates the Keys Marine
Laboratory on the site of a former Sea World theme park on Long Key. Keys Marine
Lab is uniquely situated for mainland research on tropical marine habitats, and
the Lab is actively used for State-sponsored research. Dr. Vargo plans to
improve the Lab's research capabilities by acquiring items of basic lab
equipment for general use (balances, a deionized water supply system, a pH
meter, four microscopes, two centrifuges, and a low temperature freezer). The
Keys Marine Lab is a potentially important research facility with a growing
number of active on-site research projects. The new instrumentation will make it
possible for the Lab's impact to grow as investigators establish research
programs there. Research into fragile marine and coastal tropical environments
is currently constrained by the lack of adequate and easily accessible research
facilities. The continued growth of the Keys Marine Lab will open up new
research opportunities in marine science.
