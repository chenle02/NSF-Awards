This project is part of a larger collaborative experiment called "Rain in
Cumulus over the Ocean" (RICO), which will be conducted from November 2004 to
January 2005 near Antigua. A primary RICO objective is to understand warm-rain
formation, the formation of rain in clouds that do not reach the freezing level.
To contribute to that goal, these investigators will determine the composition
and concentration of particles present in the air where clouds and rain form.
Large particles, with sizes of a few to tens of micrometers, are thought to play
an especially important role in the initiation of rainfall from warm clouds.
Using a research aircraft, the investigators will collect samples of such
particles and analyze them using electron microscopy to determine their sizes,
composition, and concentration. They will compare samples collected outside
cloud to those obtained by evaporation of cloud droplets in cloud to help
determine how particles influence the formation of cloud droplets and how the
internal composition of the drops is modified while they are in cloud. The study
will also assess the importance of mineral-dust particles, sea-salt particles,
and particles containing elemental carbon and organic species. The results will
be used by these investigators and others in RICO to understand how large
aerosol particles influence the formation of rain in trade-wind Cumulus clouds.
