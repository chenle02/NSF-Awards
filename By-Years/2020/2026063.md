The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore
translation of diagnostics for the aquaculture industry. Pathogens cost the
aquaculture industry approximately $6 billion a year and are the greatest
challenge to farmers regardless of location or size of operation. Rapid, low-
cost diagnostic tests are needed to mitigate disease impacts and improve overall
stock health. The proposed technology may be incorporated into user-friendly
tests for farmers to perform on-site, without additional equipment nor training.
The results are easy-to-read and can inform an action plan for the farmer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
platform technology to produce rapid, on-site diagnostic tests for aquaculture
disease pathogens. Unlike conventional tests that use antibodies as detection
agents, the flexible and adaptive technology utilizes bioengineered proteins to
rapidly bind a target analyte creating stable, consistent, and easy-to-read
colorimetric results in a paper-based test. The test works by applying a sample
to the surface of the test strip where the bioengineered proteins capture any
target analyte present. As the sample flows through the paper layers, reactions
occur that amplify low signals for increased sensitivity. When exposed to light,
a chemical reaction is initiated that results in an easily interpretable
colorimetric result in as few as 10 minutes. The farmer can relate this color to
a concentration and take appropriate actions to mitigate disease impact. This
project will explore relevant parameters for technology
translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
