This project is to have the PI participate in the development of a novel data
assimilation system that will be applied to numerical global weather prediction
models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). With
colleagues at the University of Maryland, the PI has implemented a preliminary
version of a data assimilation scheme that applies the Kalman filter to a
sequence of local regions. In this project, the PI will spend 11 months in
residence as a full-time visiting faculty member in the Department of
Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College Park, where he will study
atmospheric science and satellite data analysis. This visit will allow him to
apply his existing skills in dynamical systems, high performance computing, and
data analysis to make substantive contributions to the data assimilation
project. The PI expects to develop a graduate course in data assimilation as
part of the ongoing development of a graduate Certificate in Atmospheric
Sciences. The latter program is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the
departments of mathematics, mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry,
geography, and physics at ASU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly
supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the
Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;
