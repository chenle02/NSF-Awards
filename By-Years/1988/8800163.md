This research develops computer systems for representing knowledge,
particularly by rule-based systems, and for reasoning with that knowledge by
many processors operating in parallel. Target machines to support these parallel
reasoning systems, such as the NCUBE hypercube, will be tested. The importance
of this research is that rule based systems are the core of many "expert system"
applications in artificial intelligence. These systems however are very
demanding on the resources of a single-processor computer. In order to improve
their performance, the theory and practice of their implementation on
multiprocessor systems must be developed.
