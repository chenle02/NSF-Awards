Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
and organometallic molecules. When combined with gas chromatography (GC), the
resulting GC/MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for
the seperation and characterization of compounds. The acquisition of GC/MS is
essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
The Department ofChemistry at the University of California at Irvine will use
this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a
GC/MS system. The areas of chemical research that will enhance by the
acquisition include the following: 1. Organic and Polymer Chemistry 2.
Exploratory Organic Synthesis and Rational Drug Design 3. Synthesis and
Chemistry of Yttrium and Lanthanide Metal Complexes 4. Mechanistic Studies of
Biological Systems 5. Studies in Bioorgnic Chemistry 6. Synthesis of Phosphonate
Analogs of Oligodeoxyribonucleotides 7. Synthesis of Helical Receptors:
Molecular Recognition of DNA
