This three-year grant supports the work of the University of Washington
particle physics group, directed by Professors Cook and Rothberg. Their main
activity is completion of the construction of the "SLD" experiment at the
Stanford Linear Collider. SLD will study electron-positron annihilations at an
energy of 100 Gev. The group will continue its work on the liquid argon
calorimeter. The work supported here is on one of a new generation of
experiments which will study the structure of matter at a new and shorter
distance scale. The particles produced in these collisions will tell us about
the validity of current theories of matter and forces, and in particular give us
information on the number of "generations" of elementary particles.
