Gregg 9730009 Fast-response thermistors capable of measuring temperature
microstructure throughout most of the ocean from vehicle moving as fast as two
knots will be developed using modern material sciences technology. Two
techniques will be used: one making uniform thin glass coatings and another
laying thin film thermistors on substrates to combine the sensitivity and long
life of thermistors with the fast response of cold films. In addition, it is
hoped that the new design will lead to smaller (and thus faster) probes with
more uniform shapes (same dynamic response for units of the same design).
