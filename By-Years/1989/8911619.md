It is planned to attempt to optimize the source quality of channeling radiation
(CR), develop its suitability as a tool for analyzing crystal structure, analyze
excited state population inversions with a view toward CR lasing, formulate a
general resonance theory of free-bound CR transitions including polarization of
the radiation, and develop a theory of CR based on fully three-dimensional Bloch
functions in order to test the effects of longitudinal potential variations.
Work will be carried out in partial collaboration with the radiation theory
group at the Naval Research Laboratory.
