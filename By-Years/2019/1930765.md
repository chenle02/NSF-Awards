This travel grant provides support for 18 US-based students to attend the
Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS) to be held in Stockholm, Sweden
from July 16-20, 2019. PETS brings together privacy and anonymity experts from
around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses
the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data
systems and communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will
enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US
citizen graduate students. Attending conferences like PETS is an important
component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science
researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with
world-class researchers in privacy, and establish networks, connections, and
mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.
This award aims to increase the participation of students from underrepresented
groups and those from smaller institutions of education, to provide them with
equal opportunities, rather than leave them behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
