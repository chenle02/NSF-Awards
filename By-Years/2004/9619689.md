This proposal requests funding to continue a summer REU site in the various
disciplines of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Eight
undergraduates are to be recruited from science, mathematics, and engineering
departments nationally to conduct research at URI. Each student is paired with a
research scientist or faculty advisor, chosen to reflect the student's interests
and background. The program consists of a variety of scientific lectures and
discussion groups, a written report, a final oral presentation, and a program of
social and scientific interactions.
