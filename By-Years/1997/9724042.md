This award supports a planning visit by Dr. Altug Iftar, of the Department of
Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Anadolu University in Turkey, to visit
Ohio State University to meet with Dr. Hitay Ozbay, of the Department of
Electrical Engineering. The purpose of the visit is to develop a collaborative
research activity on an integrated routing and flow control algorithm for
traffic networks. Little research has been done on the integration of routing
and flow control algorithms, and the results of this study are expected to yield
useful results that can be applied to traffic control, communications, and
manufacturing systems.
