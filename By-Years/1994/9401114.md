9401114 Evans This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research Program. The study will examine the effect of political
reform on rural social conflict in Columbia. During the past decade, Columbia
has presented contradictory trends toward democratizing reform and escalating
political violence, a paradox that defies the predictions of prevailing theories
of democratic transition and guerrilla movements. New theories suggest that
elite-sponsored violence may escalate in reaction to increased peasant control
over rural institutions, or that in some cases more representative institutions
can now mediate peaceful, institutional resolutions to conflicts. This research
will study the effect of a specific reform, allowing the direct election of
county executives, on several rural conflicts. The four stages of the
investigation will focus on: 1) the national context of violent democratization,
2) the causes of rural social conflict, 3) the effect of reform on these
conflicts, and 4) the mechanisms accounting for these effects. %%% This research
will contribute to political sociology and to the sociology of development. The
key international issues for policy makers today revolve around the success or
failure of various routes to democratization, so the findings of the study
should have substantive significance. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of social scientists. ***
