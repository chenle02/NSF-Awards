0339751&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project addresses an entirely new approach to identification of pathogens in
bio-aerosols based on performing and controlling biochemical reactions and
microbiological interactions directly in air. Current methods for testing
infectiousness of air, e.g., contaminated by biological warfare agents or other
pathogens do not provide direct detection of pathogens in air. Aerosol samples
are usually converted into a liquid sample, e.g., using wet cyclones, where
analysis based on PCR or immunoassays implies long analysis time. Phase I
research will demonstrate feasibility of performing sample preparation and
highly specific identification of pathogens directly in air without introducing
the sample into liquid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will aid in developing
diagnostic methods that are based on collecting and/or detecting pathogens in
breath exhaled or cough, methods to rapidly determine infectiousness of air in
an environment, e.g., contaminated by biological warfare agents and point-of-
care diagnosticmethods.. The Phase II research will provide full development of
a marketable prototype with a number of potential medical applications as well
as applications ranging from forensic analysis and air-quality monitoring in
farming and agriculture to detection of biological warfare agents in portable
field devices.
