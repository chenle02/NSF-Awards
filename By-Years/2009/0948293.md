The Environmental Chemical sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. John Morris of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. Prof. Morris' research program focuses on the
application of molecular beams to investigate the interactions between gas phase
molecules of atmospheric significance and organic surfaces. The research
discoveries will further molecular level understanding of how common atmospheric
pollutants react on surfaces of environmentally important organic materials,
including surfactant-coated water droplets or aerosols, soot particles, and
polymers. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for
students, including some from under represented groups, desiring to work at the
forefront of environmental science.
