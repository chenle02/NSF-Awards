9453774 Coyne The Great Lakes Museum of Science, Environment, and Technology
will develop a 10,000 sq. ft. exhibit focusing on The Great Lakes Environment.
Addressing the core mission of the museum, the exhibit will promote
understanding about "the interdependence of scientific, environmental, and
technological activities in the Great Lakes Region." The exhibit will focus on
the Great Lakes as an ecosystem. By means of interactive activities, visitors
will learn how this ecosystem was formed, the web of life it supports, the
stresses it receives, and the efforts to restore its health. The Great Lakes
Museum is a new 165,000 sq. ft. facility located in downtown Cleveland on the
Lake Erie Shore and is scheduled to open in 1996. The exhibit area will cover
50,000 sq. ft. and will be fully accessible. An entire floor will be dedicated
to the Great Lakes Environment. Complementary educational programs will consist
of the following: take home activity guides to encourage the discovery and
exploration of ecosystems in backyards or neighborhoods, pre and post visit
activities for school groups, and teacher enhancement activities. Museum staff
are participating in the planning process for the Urban Systemic Initiative of
Cleveland and activiites and content of exhibits will be developed to complement
the curriculum. The museum will develop a menu of activities and databases for
electronic networking with homes and schools. They will have video conferencing
capabilities to connect the museum with classrooms.
