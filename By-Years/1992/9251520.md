The Department of Geology is purchasing a computer controlled size analysis
instrument. This equipment is used in the analysis of sand and fine grained
sediment samples collected in coordinated field/lab exercises in introductory
geology, geomorphology, hydrogeology and in independent student research. It
allows students to conduct detailed and accurate analyses of geologic materials,
including provisions for data reduction and graphic presentation of analytical
results with a minimum of time expenditure and sample preparation. Automated
sediment analysis enhances the existing curriculum in geology by introducing
students to modern analytical techniques. Grain size distributions are an
important descriptive tool used by geologists to characterize depositional
processes or environments of deposition. In addition, grain size and sorting are
important controls on permeability of unconsolidated deposits.
