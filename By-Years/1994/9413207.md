Theoretical studies will be carried out in the theory of gravitation where
general relativity, statistical mechanics, and quantum theory meet. The
principal effort will be to construct a statistical mechanics foundation for
gravitation that can also include all other matter fields. From this mechanics,
the thermodynamics of black holes and horizons will be deduced and their
fluctuations calculated. Emphasis will be on a consistent formulation of quantum
field theory in curved spacetime, and the back reaction of these fields on
spacetime geometry, including study of structures of possible importance in
early cosmology, as well as black holes and cosmological event horizons. The aim
ultimately is to develop the statistical mechanics framework as a paradigm for
all dynamical processes; therefore, formulation of the description of
irreversible processes in the developing framework will be carried out. This
classical problem has applications in numerical relativity and astrophysics. It
is expected to contribute insights which will be valuable in the search for a
correct quantum theory of gravitation.
