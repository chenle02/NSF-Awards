9702419 Burkett Advances in magnetic materials research have had a remarkable
impart on the data storage industry in the last decade. As the demands for
faster operation and increased density intensify, it is clear that device
dimensions must be reduced. Future increases in density will require radical new
developments. However, the advent of any new major technology brings with it a
wide variety of technical problems. In the case of magnetoresistive (MR) field-
sensing devices, a number of these problems are materials related. One such
problem, receiving surprisingly little attention, is that of electromigration.
Other problems of interest in the application of MR technology are the origins
of electrical noise and of thermally induced spurious output signals. An
improved microscopic understanding of the failure modes of electronic conduction
in magnetic multilayers of small dimensions that may be used in magnetoresistive
sensing devices has vast technological implications. Additional studies include
investigation of thermal integrity of patterned multilayers, and a special
multilayer structure, the "spin-valve" as well as signal to noise ratio (SNR)
measurements on patterned multilayers for evaluation of the relationship between
noise, microstructure, and absolute physical size of field-sensing elements. The
primary objectives in the proposed career development plan include: development
of photolithographic techniques for magnetic materials, the study of
electromigration effects under high current densities, evaluation of related
thermal degradation effects in magnetic multilayers, noise measurements in
mesoscopic multilayers, integration of research topics to the engineering
curriculum, creation of research projects to aid in educating
undergraduate/graduate students, and provision of adequately trained engineers
for placement in the magnetics industry. ***
