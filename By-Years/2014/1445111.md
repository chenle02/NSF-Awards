Proposal: 1445111 EAGER: Smart Phone Platform for Personal High-Resolution 3D
Optical Imaging

The successful outcome of this research project will have a far-reaching and
broad impact on many segments of our society. Most significantly, the technology
and innovation in this project will enable novel mobile health applications and
capabilities that will enable more sophisticated personalized health monitoring
for the general public as well as for those in rural or developing regions of
our world. This technology, for a number of very common diseases in the ear and
skin, will serve as a means for early detection of disease. In addition, after
treatment has been prescribed, it will serve for monitoring of the regression or
progression of the disease.

This project will design and develop a smart phone platform that enables
personal high-resolution 3D optical imaging. In addition to the traditional CCD
cameras currently found in every smart phone and used for photography, this
platform will implement a low-cost, compact, and portable optical imaging system
based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). This self-contained handheld device
with a unique set of optical elements will utilize the smart phone light source
and camera, as well as its on-board processing and wireless communication
hardware.

This group will develop a novel high-resolution 3D optical imaging platform
designed for integration into the next-generation of personal smart phones. This
platform which is based on low-coherence interferometry is regularly utilized in
OCT, and therefore will have widespread applications not only along the medical
and biological development paths established by OCT, but also a larger number of
other applications because of the compact, portable, low-cost, and virtually
ubiquitous nature of the technology.
