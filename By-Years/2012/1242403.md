This award will partially support the 6th Graduate Climate Conference at the
University of Washington from October 26-28, 2012. Specifically, the award will
be used to support the travel, meals and lodging costs for 30 US graduate
students to participate in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate
Climate Conference is an annual event that provides students with a discussion
forum on all topics of climate change research - including atmospheric,
biological, earth and ocean sciences - and allows the students to see how their
own research fits into this breadth of climate research activities. The workshop
provides a relaxed environment for interactions with individuals at a similar
early career stage and the opportunity to develop a network of collaborative,
interdisciplinary relationships that will prove beneficial throughout their
careers.
