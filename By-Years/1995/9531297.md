9531297 Wenger This project will integrate research and education through a
program of activities aimed at developing and enabling a new generational cohort
of social science researchers who will investigate various aspects of hazards
and disasters. A comprehensive and creative program for mentoring recently-
appointed junior faculty at research universities will be established. The
format is to bring promising and newly appointed faculty members into sustained
contact over a one-year period with seasoned researchers from several
universities. The effort will be organized around a faculty panel consisting of
six persons with strong research and publication records in economics,
geography, planning, political science, psychology and sociology. The panel will
engage in mentoring 12 junior faculty who will be competitively selected as
fellows. The two-year program will involve detailed planning, a set of
workshops, one- on-one mentoring, and research and writing activities. ***
