AST-9731165 ABSTRACT A new approach to speckle imaging using a large format CCD
will be developed. In this technique many speckle patterns will be accumulated
along a subarray strip of the chip. When the strip is full, all the patterns are
read out together. This method can reduce the read time overhead and allow for
efficient speckle imaging. In this way, large format slow-readout CCDs, which
are already widely used in astronomy, can be used for high-resolution imaging
with little change in hardware.
