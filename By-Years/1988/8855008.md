The Cornell University Natural Sciences Interns Program will include three
major components: 1) Training Segment--a four-dayresidential program to train 60
junior high and high school youths (30% of whom will be minority and/or
disabled) and 10 adult educators in the natural sciences disciplines, and to
expose youths and adult educators to research and career opportunities in the
natural sciences; 2) Problem-Solving Segment--a five and one-half week
residential program actively involving 12 minority and/or disabled high school
youths in a forest science research project and exploration of natural sciences
careers; and 3) Follow-up Activities--designed to create an awareness of natural
sciences research and career options among 300 junior high and 300 high school
students and their 24 teachers, 48 junior high and high school counselors, 520
4-H club members and their adult club leaders, and 12 4-H agents. Youths
involved in the more in-depth Problem-Solving Segment will first participate in
the Training Segment, thereby receiving the background necessary to begin their
research projects.
