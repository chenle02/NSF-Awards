This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF), the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the Department of Chemistry at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology acquire nanosecond to sub-picosecond
time-resolved laser instrumentation. This equipment will enhance research
spanning the disciplines of inorganic, organic, and material chemistry. A sub-
picosecond laser can provide important information about chemical reactivity.
Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of
reactive and nonreactive molecules.
