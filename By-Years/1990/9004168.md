The mathematical theory of sets first developed in response to deep problems in
the foundations of the calculus and the theory of functions. After considerable
initial success, progress in these areas came to an abrupt halt and an number of
natural open problems stubbornly resisted solution. The explanation came only
later; in fact, these problems cannot be answered on the basis of the standard
axioms. This discovery led to a search for new axioms, and today's set theorists
are faced with two distinct theories, theories that provide opposing answers to
many of the previously open problems. The question of which of these theories is
true is not strictly mathematical; one isn't looking for a proof. Previous
axioms were judged on their purported "obviousness", but the current candidates
enjoy no such status. Thus a novel methodological problem arises: how can such
hypotheses be judged? Professor Maddy's goal is to provide a philosophical
analysis of the nature of this question -- is such-and-such a an axiom candidate
true? -- and to delineate that range of methods appropriate to answering it. She
will then apply these methods to one particular new axiom candidate: the
assumption that all sets are constructible. This research is of great importance
for the philosophy of science and foundational studies of mathematics.
