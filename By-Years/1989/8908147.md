The Ornithology Collections of the University of Michigan contains
approximately 200,000 specimens (including skins, skeletons, fluids, eggs,
nests, and frozen tissues), making it one of the ten largest such collections in
the country. The collection's strengths are in the mid-west U.S., and recent
research activities by the Museum's staff is adding to the fluid and frozen
tissue holdings. The collection is used actively for research, environmental
impact studies, and education. Curator Mary McKitrick proposes computerization
of the handwritten accessions ledger, with subsequent addition of data and
verification from the specimen labels. The proposed computerization effort will
increase greatly the research impact of the collection. Data inquiries and loan
requests will be managed in a fraction of the time now needed, and computerized
queries will give researchers the first opportunity to study broader questions
of diversity and geographic distribution.
