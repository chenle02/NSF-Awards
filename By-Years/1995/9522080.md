This program is the third year of a three year continuing grant awarded to the
Florida Institute of Technology. The principal investigator has transferred to
the University of Central Florida, and had no residual second year funding;
thus, the one-year award to UCF. The project investigates the rotational
bursting of F-coronal dust particles to high density coronal mass ejections in
the F-coronal region. Rotational bursting of F-coronal dust may take place due
to the tension caused by high spin rate, which can be driven by four different
spin mechanisms. These mechanisms will be investigated theoretically. Repeated
rotational bursting from the parent particle and its fragments will alter the
size distribution of the dust, and ultimately result in ejecting the resulting
smaller particles from the solar system by the action of solar radiation
pressure overcoming the gravitational attraction of the Sun.***
