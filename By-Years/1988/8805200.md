A database query embedded in a program is optimized when the program is
compiled. An embedded database query is executed repeatedly with different
variable instantiations, i.e. different constants in the query predicate. In
order to optimize an embedded query, the query optimizer must make assumptions
about the values of the program variables that appear as constants in the query
and about the data stored in the database, and the optimality of the resulting
query evaluation plan depends on the validity of these assumptions. This
proposal aims at developing criteria when reoptimization is required, how these
criteria can be implemented efficiently, and how reoptimization can be avoided.
by using a new technique called dynamic query evaluation plans. The query
optimizer will determine which cases are worth distinguishing, prepare more than
one query evaluation plan using a multi-goal search strategy, and prepare a
decision tree for the run-time system. The new query optimization technology
promises advantages for both conventional and advanced data models.
