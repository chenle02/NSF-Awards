Dr. Mary K. Boyd and other members of the Chemistry Department at Loyola
University of Chicago are being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, nine
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry. In
addition, field trips are scheduled to nearby industrial and government research
facilities. Participants are recruited from the Chicago metropolitan area. The
recruitment emphasis is on students who might not otherwise choose a career in
chemistry.
