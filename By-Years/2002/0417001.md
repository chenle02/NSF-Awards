0417001 Bart&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Tulane University has been awarded a grant to
redesign and re-implement the original FishNet into FishNet II and to further
develop and integrate the successful GEOLocate georeferencing program. The
resulting system will make 2.3 million ichthyological records for ca. 39 million
specimens from North America and beyond readily available using the modern
natural history collections data sharing protocol DiGIR. This will enable the
data to be widely accessed through the many portals that now use this protocol.
It will also provide a very low cost and simple-to-maintain open source server
software package that can be easily adapted to multiple types of natural history
collections. Continued development and maintenance of the DiGIR system and
GEOLocate will occur over the five year life of the award thus enabling the
entire natural history collections community to benefit. The award is
collaborative with an award to the University of Kansas. &lt;br/&gt;
