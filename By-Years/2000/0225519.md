Water covers approximately 70% of the earth surface. However, this majority of
the planet is under-explored and poorly understood. This is largely a result of
the significant challenge posed by the underwater environment, with its high
pressure, unpredictable currents, nearly freezing temperatures, attenuation of
electromagnetic waves and light, and harsh chemical compositions. A variety of
scientific, military and industrial tasks call for tools that function in the
ocean environment. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are important platforms
for carrying out sophisticated underwater tasks. Currently some tasks are not
suitable for AUVs due to technical limitations. More advanced applications
demand small, integrated, power efficient and potentially networked AUVs to
increase the effectiveness and reduce the costs. A key step in moving toward
this vision is improved sensors for AUVs. This project aims to develop
integrated underwater sensors inspired by the fish lateral line system.
Prototypes of sensors will be built and used to investigate the fluid mechanical
behavior of such sensors through computational and experimental means. The
potential applications include the detection of hydrodynamic wakes, tracing of
chemical plumes, and determination of hydrodynamic properties at the interface
of fluid and structures. The proposed effort will focus on one problem - that of
detection of hydrodynamic wakes.

Planned research activities consists of three integral components: (1) The
development and improvement of biomimetic integrated microsensors; (2) The
validation and prediction of sensor performance using full scale direct
numerical simulation and reduced-model simulation; (3) The experimental
validation of sensor performance and computational results.
