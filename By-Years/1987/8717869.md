A collaboration between the University of Minnesota, UM, Louisiana State
University and the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Kracow, Poland will continue
its studies of relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions using nuclear emulsion as
both target and detector. First, they will finish the analysis and publication
of data from central collisions of O(16) with Ag-Br, in emulsion, at energies of
15, 60 and 100 GeV/n. Second, these studies will be extended to heavier
projectiles, Si(28) at 15 GeV/n and S(32) at 60 and 200 GeV/n. This data will be
important for evaluating a wide range of physics models. For example, those
which predict the existence of a new form of nuclear matter called quark-gluon
plasma. The field of research is that of experimental elementary particle
physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of matter at very high
energies. The experiments use accelerators which provide the highest energy
particles made in the laboratory.
