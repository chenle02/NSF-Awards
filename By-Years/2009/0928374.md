The PI has imaged a massive submarine flow that defies ready identification on
the flanks of an island caldera in Papua New Guinea. Its size (~14 km3)
underscores its importance in understanding arc volcanic processes and
stratigraphic records. A few dredge samples could go a long way in understanding
this feature, and the PI will use 1.5 days (plus 1.5 transit days) on a transit
of the R/V Melville from Guam to Fiji to carry out 4 dredge hauls and local
multibeam bathymetric study along this flow. The samples will allow the PI to
determine how the flow might have formed (i.e., whether lava flow, pyroclastic
low, pumice/ash fall, debris flow or a composite flow). He will carry out four
14C dates and Ra/Th dating on at least one these samples.

The will involve both a US graduate student and a scientist from the Geological
Survey of Papua New Guinea.
