Cellulose synthesis is a significant activity of the differentiating cells of
the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, but the role of cellulose
during development and the control of its synthesis have received little
attention in the literature. The objectives of this project are: to determine
the rates, sites, and timing of cellulose synthesis; to analyze the cellulose
found in each of four distinct extracellular structures to see if there are
biophysical differences in the cellulose that can be related to differences in
cellular structures or control; to determine if cellulose synthesis is at any
time a cell-type specific process; to describe the interactions between
cellulose and extracellular matrix proteins in structuring the stalk tube; to
characterize mutant strains that are unable to synthesize cellulose or are
somehow altered in their cellulose synthesis; and to identify the gene for
cellulose synthase and thereby study the molecular control of cellulose
synthesis. The results of this project are significant not only for the
contribution they will make to our knowledge of D. discoideum development, but
also for what they may tell us about the control of cellulose synthesis in
plants.
