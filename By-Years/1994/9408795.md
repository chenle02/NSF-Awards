9408795 Sorensen The research proposed here has two main objectives. The first
is to develop and test new algorithms and approaches for addressing
computational operations that are encountered in a wide range of computational
science and engineering applications (e.g.,eigenproblems,linear equation solvers
an propagation methods). The second is to enhance significantly the range of
chemical reactions that can be studied with ab initio quantum scattering methods
(e.g., four-atom systems and heavier three-atom systems). The basic approach is
to bring together in a single research team knowledge of an experience with the
most advanced numerical algorithms for solving the kinds of mathematical
problems that are at the core of these scattering methods.
