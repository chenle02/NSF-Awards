9713032 Rice University R. Cartwright CISE Educational Innovation: Exploring A
Safe Approach to Software Engineering This CISE Educational Innovation award
supports the development of a new undergraduate course sequence in software
engineering that focuses on emerging principles of program design and validation
applicable to type-safe languages. These courses are built on the high-level
design principles incorporated in the new introductory programming sequence at
Rice and draw on recent research in algorithmic verification through soft typing
and modular program composition. Two courses, targeted at upper-level
undergraduates, are being developed. The first course is a foundations course
using safe languages that focuses on the principles of program and module
design, verification, debugging, and performance tuning and the second is an
interdisciplinary studio course that applies the principles of the foundations
course to writing innovative networking software. These courses have the
potential to make major impact on course work in software engineering in the
future.
