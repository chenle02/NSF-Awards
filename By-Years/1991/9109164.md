Accurate measurements of total photoionization cross sections, of photoelectron
angular distributions and of the positions and widths of autoionizing resonances
near thresholds will be made for excited states of neutral atoms. Continuously
tuned pulsed dye lasers will be used to both excite and ionize free atoms in an
atomic beam. Absolute photoionization cross sections will be measured using a
fluorescence-reduction technique. An angular-selective electron detector/time-
of-flight energy analyzer will be used to measure the angular distributions of
ejected electrons.
