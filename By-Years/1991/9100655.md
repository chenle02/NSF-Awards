This proposal deals with the general problem of recovery of discontinuities in
image processing problems such as image restoration, edge detection, and surface
interpolation from sparse depth data. It proposes to use a natural
generalization of the basic Geman and Geman line process to handle arbitrary
real-valued directions and magnitudes, and methods such Besag's pseudo-
likelihood methods to estimate parameters.
