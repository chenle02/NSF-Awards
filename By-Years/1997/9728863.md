This grant supports the study of one of the fundamental constituents of matter-
the b quark. This quark is one of the six types of quarks known to exist.
Studies of its properties will lead us to a better understanding of how the
different types of quarks are related to each other. We may also gain an
understanding of why the Universe is comprised of matter and not anti-matter. In
addition, this grant will support work to construct a detector which will be
used at the energy frontier of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and which will
investigate why matter has mass.
