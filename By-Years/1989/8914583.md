Theoretical work has far out-paced empirical studies in addressing the
evolution and maintenance of gynodioecy a specialized mating system in which
individual plants are either female or hermaphroditic. The proposed study will
explore the importance of the nutrient limitation in influencing reproductive
allocation patterns in a gynodioecious population of Sidalcea oregana ssp.
spicata, a perennial plant native to the Sierra Nevada. Resources available to
plants in the field will bemanipulated and records of nutrient allocation
patterns will becompiled. This work will be the first to address the
implications of nutrient allocation patterns in a gynodioecious species and it
will shed light on the validity of resource-based arguments for the maintenance
of gynodioecy. This study also concerns resource use patterns in a montane
perennial, an area in which current knowledge is especially weak. Information on
nutrient limitation may be applied to programs of revegetation. Today, more and
more habitat reclamation projects involve the use of native species. Moreover,
there is a growing demand for high quality seeds from native species in the
horticultural industry. Results from this study will contribute to understanding
how resources are used by wild plants in native habitat. //
