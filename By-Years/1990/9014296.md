This award will implement a dual-channel chopping photometer for use on the
completely renovated 0.76-m Keeler reflector at Allegheny Observatory. A dual-
channel chopping photometer is ideally suited to the observatory's needs because
the primary interest is in colors in their photometry program. Furthermore,
observations of stellar colors are insensitive to the conditions of non-
photometric weather, which is common at Allegheny Observatory. According to
record books at Allegheny Observatory, there are an average of 120 nights per
year which are suitable for dual-channel chopping photometry. Some astrometric
target stars are variable; their light curves will be observed so that a search
for any type of correlations between magnitude and astrometric position can be
made. Photometric observations of stars in new astrometric regions will provide
the astrometric program with an efficient method for choosing appropriate
reference stars.
