A wide range of phenomena in nature, physics, and society can be viewed as the
byproduct of many similar components or agents interacting in a seemingly random
or disordered manner (e.g., stock markets, condensed matter in physics, prime
numbers in mathematics). The focus of this project is the study of rare events,
or extrema, that emerge in disordered systems. The vast number of agents and the
disorder present in these complex systems make straightforward predictions
impossible. The project goal is to develop tools of probability theory to
improve our fundamental understanding of disordered systems and, ultimately, to
lead to better statistical modeling of rare events, such as high volatility
episodes in stock markets and certain kinds of phase transitions in physics.

Specifically, the aim of this project is to extend the theory of extreme values
in probability to random systems with strong and complex correlation structure.
The first objective is to derive fine asymptotics for the maxima of
characteristic polynomials of random matrices and for the local maxima of the
Riemann zeta function (which controls the distribution of prime numbers). These
systems are examples of stochastic processes with logarithmically decaying
correlations. The second part is a study of extrema of spin glasses, an
important class of physical systems with more complex correlations that includes
disordered magnets. The main objective there is to find a new approach to
investigate the structure of the Gibbs states of the models. In addition, the
nature and the existence of phase transitions for spin glasses in finite
dimension (which are realistic models of disordered magnets) will be studied by
extending methods based on fluctuations of relevant thermodynamic quantities.
