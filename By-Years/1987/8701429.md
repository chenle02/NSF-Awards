The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, Lie
theory has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. A major
application of Lie thoery is to algebraic number theory, for which an
understanding of the p-adic theory is essential. Professor Moy is possibly the
strongest young researcher in this area. His recent work on minimal K-types and
Hecke isomorphism provides some of the most important advances in the
representation theory of p-adic groups in a long time. Moy plans to continue the
development of this theory. His proposed work generalizes the most current
results from the real theory to the p-adic case. Professor Moy envisages
application to the crucial discrete series of representations.
