This research is concerned with a fundamental problem solving method - heuristic
search, and an important heuristic search algorithm - the best-first search. A
new best-first search algorithm is developed, whose memory requirement is only
linear in the search depth, at the cost of expanding some nodes more than once.
The algorithm runs faster than classical best-first search due to its simple
structure and reduced overhead. It removes the memory limitation of best-first
search, and opens up a host of new applications: combinatorial optimization
problems, optimal decisions under real-time constraints, selective search
algorithms for two-player games, and difficult constraints satisfaction
problems.
