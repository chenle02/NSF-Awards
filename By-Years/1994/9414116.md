Abstract ATM-9414116 Bierly, Eugene W. American Geophysical Union Title: Support
for U.S. National Office for Earth Systems History (ESH) This award supports the
management infrastructure for the coordination of U.S. research activities in
connection with the Earth System History (ESH) Initiative of the United States
Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The EHS Office at the American
Geophysical Union (AGU) will provide the secretariat for the ESH Steering
Committee and a point of contact for interaction with the international effort
in Past Global Changes (PAGES) of the International Geosphere Biosphere
Programme (IGBP). The initial effort will be a workshop designed to obtain
paleoclimate community input regarding the goals and priorities of the Abrupt
Climate Change effort. Subsequent workshops and meetings will be held to insure
that implementation of the program is carried out and that the goals of the
program are met to the objectives.
