Proposal Number: ECS-9734283 Principle Investigator: Luke Mawst______ Title:
CAREER: Al-free vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) for reliable,
high-single-mode output power Abstract This proposal is aimed at (1) developing
aluminum-free, InGaAsP/GaAs-based vertical cavity surface emitting lasers
(VCSELs) for high reliability and high single-mode output power, and (2) to
integrate III/V compound semiconductor device design principles and fabrication
into the undergraduate course curriculum at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
This proposal is recommended for a CAREER award at $200,000 for 48 months.
