The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative
models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU
undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or
careers. Through this catalyst project, Prairie View A&M University will
initiate a comprehensive and synergetic forensic genomics program which will
broaden awareness and access to the STEM workforce by engaging students in
innovative interdisciplinary educational activities. The program will impact
society by increasing minority representation and advancement in the forensic
science workforce.

The proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within the
field of Forensic Science as well as across multiple disciplines, both STEM and
non-STEM at PVAMU and the surrounding educational communities. By enhancing the
scientific exposure of students, they will graduate with a more well-rounded
training that can improve competitiveness in the STEM workforce.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
