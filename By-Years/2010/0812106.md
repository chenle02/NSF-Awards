For years, the robotics community has sought to enable robots to efficiently
learn new skills from a human trainer. While motivated by the idea of robots
that are easy to teach, there's been a lack of focus on several aspects
essential to this goal. This project will advance the state of the art in robot
Learning by Demonstration (LbD) by focusing the issues of learning from everyday
human partners. LbD work has usually been evaluated with expert humans,
typically the system designer. We will develop implementations and experiments
on a humanoid social robot to address the following research questions: 1. In
continuous embodied experience, how can a robot use cues from the environment
and the person to segment its own learning examples? 2. What social cues does
the human use to indicate salient aspects of the environment? What expressive
mechanisms can the robot use to communicate relevant aspects of the learning
state to the human partner? 3. Imitation learning is broader than the typical
?human-demo robot-repeat? LbD interaction. How can the robot use the human as an
information source beyond generalizing a way to repeat motion trajectories? For
example, it may be biased to interact with objects it?s seen the human interact
with.
