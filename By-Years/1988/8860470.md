Microstructure control in advanced ceramics and composites would be enhanced by
the availability of high purity, submicron powders of controlled particle size
and surface chemistry. A vapor phase reaction process is proposed for
investigation which has the potential for economically synthesizing submicron
ceramic powders. A study would be conducted to evaluate the parameters
controlling the synthesis of silicon carbide and silicon nitride in a chemical
flame.
