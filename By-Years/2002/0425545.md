Funds are provided for a process study of the causes of the vertical structure
of tidal currents in the Arctic using a 3-D primitive equation numerical model.
The generation of baroclinic tides as barotropic tidal currents interact with
steep topography, the development of thick boundary layers near a tidal
constituent's critical latitude (where the tidal and Coriolis frequencies are
equal), and the interaction of these two processes will be studied. The proposal
is motivated by the demonstrated importance of tide-induced mixing in the World
Ocean's interior, and by observations showing that similar processes occur in
the Arctic,&lt;br/&gt;particularly in the straits and passages where heat and
fresh water exchanges between the Arctic and North Atlantic occur. There is,
also, evidence that tides are an important contributor to sea ice deformation
including an increase in mean open water (lead) fraction and subsequent ocean
heat loss and ice growth rates. The proposed work will investigate how
baroclinicity enhances the mean lead&lt;br/&gt;fraction relative to the value
obtained using depth-averaged tidal currents from barotropic models. The long-
term goals of this work are to: (i) elucidate the tide's true contribution to
the general circulation, hydrographic structure, and sea-ice characteristics of
the Arctic; and (ii) devise techniques to parameterize this contribution in
general circulation models (GCMs) where the resolution required for explicit
inclusion of tidal effects (~1 km laterally, a few m in the vertical, and short
time steps) will remain out of reach for the foreseeable future. &lt;br/&gt;
