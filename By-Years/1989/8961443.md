A technique is proposed whereby energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis
can be made to accurately measure small concentrations ( 1%) of an element in a
sample whose composition is dominated (>90%) by an element of similar but larger
atomic number (Z). Such measurement is now precluded by the overwhelming
fluorescence signal from the dominant element. The proposed technique would
employ a primary photon source, a secondary fluorescer, one or more filters, and
differential analysis of the observed spectra. The key features of the technique
are (1) reduction of the fluorescence from the interfering element by
appropriately shifting the incident energy below the excitation of the dominant
(K ) X rays and (2) incorporation of secondary effects by use of a differencing
scheme. As an initial demonstration of the technique, we will attempt to show
that it is possible to detect manganese (Z=25) at the 1% level in carbon steel
having 98% iron (Z=26). Experimental verification of the technique will be
undertaken.
