Herbert 9526639 Recent 40Ar/39Ar dating has validated changes made to the
Pliocene and Pleistocene portions of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS)
by orbital tuning methods. Because orbital cycles mark off time in geologically
short increments, they may be used to measure elapsed time between events such
as magnetic reversals or biostratigraphic datums very precisely. We outline a
work plan to improve and refine the Cretaceous and early Paleocene portion of
the GPTS, an interval which is subject to errors from spreading rate changes in
the South Atlantic sea-floor template by studying a number of DSDP/ODP drill
sites of late Cretaceous to early Paleocene age that display precessionally (20
kyr repeat time) forced carbonate cycles. High resolution paleomagnetic sampling
will be combined with gathering digital time series (color reflectance
spectrometry) to produce a composite astronomical chronology for magnetochrons
C33R through C27N (83 Ma to 62 Ma). The resulting improvement in the GPTS will
be of use to geodynamicsts, biostratigraphers, and paleoceanographers.
