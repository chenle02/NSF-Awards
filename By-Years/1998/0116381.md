With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Scranton will acquire a gas
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) microwave accelerated
preparation and reactions of tricyclic and tetracyclicazepines using room
temperature ionic liquids as solvents; b) studies on the presence of
polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic compounds in the Lackawanna River;
c) development of environmentally-suited methods for chemical synthesis and
processing; and d) determination of polyphenols in common fruits. The GC/MS will
also be used in advanced laboratory courses and by faculty at other universities
in the area.

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
This instrument will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular
environmental and synthetic organic chemistry.
