9705458 McConnell Museum of Science will develop a 4500 sq. ft. exhibit "Finding
the Pattern". The primary objective is to develop activities and programs that
encourage visitors to practice scientific thinking skills in settings that have
interdisciplinary science content. The main component is an activity area that
will encourage visitors to observe, compare, and sort objects and phenomena in
meaningful ways; help visitors recognize that systems of organizing and
classifying objects and phenomena reveal underlying meaning; provide visitors
with opportunities to practice answering questions and solving problems based on
museums collections; and encourage visitors to search for the "hidden" meaning
in things around them. The exhibit will be composed of three overlapping areas:
1) the sorting area, 2) the mystery area, and 3) the open collections area. This
project is one of the six science activity centers that have been described in
the museum's long-range plan; two activity centers/exhibits have been completed.
The impact of "Finding the Pattern" will be extended via the museum's web site.
Activities that employ the kinds of scientific thinking skills targeted in the
exhibit will be developed to engage informal learners at home. Complementary
programming linking the exhibit with formal education will include the
development of teacher workshops and programs for school groups. Teacher
workshops will be developed in consultation with groups of Project PALMS
teachers. The activities will be accessible to individuals with disabilities.
They plan to open the exhibit in the fall of 2000.
