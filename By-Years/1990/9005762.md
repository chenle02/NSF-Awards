In recent years, a marked depletion of stratospheric ozone has caused an
increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface of the Earth. With
this increase, concern and interest has been raised as to what specific effects
UV radiation has on cellular processes in organisms. One such effect, the damage
of DNA, has been extensively investigated in bacterial and mammalian systems;
however, limited information exists on the effects of UV damage to plant DNA and
its in vivo repair by cellular mechanisms. This proposal describes the initial
study of a ring- saturated pyrimidine incising activity found in plant cells
against UV irradiated or oxidized DNA. This enzymatic activity will be purified
from Brassica oleracea (cauliflower) by conventional techniques including ion-
exchange, affinity, and gel filtration chromatography. The substrate specificity
against UV- irradiated or oxidized, radiolabeled polydeoxyribonucleotides will
be characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using the
purified enzyme as a probe, the effects of DNA base sequence on the formation of
these lesions and their subsequent in vivo repair will be quantified. Since the
chloroplast genome is also susceptible to damage, the presence of the ring-
saturated pyrimidine-DNA repair enzyme in chloroplasts will be investigated.
This should determine if there is a means to effectively remove this damaged
lesion from chloroplast DNA to maintain the integrity of this genetic material.
The results of these studies should lead to a better understanding of the
biochemical processes that constitute the plant cellular response to DNA damage.
The aim is to ultimately use the knowledge obtained from this project to isolate
plant strains that have an increased ability to repair damage caused by
radiation and oxidation and therefore have an increased survival capacity.
