This conference, held in conjunction with the Association of Independent
Technological Universities during the Spring of 1991, is to determine the future
needs in undergraduate engineering education within the framework of what is
needed, feasible, and available for immediate implementation. Innovative
modifications -- even major changes -- are critical for engineering education,
not only for the U.S. to be competitive in the global sense but also to
recapture U.S. industrial leadership. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are more an equal match for the NSF award.//
