Trey Wenger is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out
a program of research and education at the University of Wisconsin. Wenger will
use large high-quality observational surveys of H II regions – the bubbles of
ionized gas around young hot stars – to create the most comprehensive map of the
chemical and morphological structure of the Milky Way galaxy. Results from the
study will advance our understanding of how the Galaxy formed and evolved. For
the educational component of this project, Wenger will develop materials to
broaden the use of small radio telescopes as an instructional tool for non-major
astronomy courses and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using existing and
new observations of H I absorption, radio recombination lines, and radio
continuum, this research project will yield the most comprehensive picture of
the Milky Way’s present day morphological and chemical structure. To achieve
that goal, the investigator will: (1) determine the origin of apparent ionized
gas velocity gradients serendipitously discovered in hundreds of Galactic H II
regions; (2) resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity for approximately 100
newly discovered H II regions; (3) create the first Galaxy-wide map of H II
region metallicities; and (4) apply a novel machine learning technique to infer
the morphological structure of the Milky Way’s high-mass star-forming region
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
