Alexey I. Ovchinnikov proposes to develop efficient algorithms that determine
the differential, difference, and algebraic structure of solutions of difference
equations using methods of differential, difference, and computer algebra. The
investigator has successfully contributed to the development of computational
differential ideal theory and the Galois theory of linear differential
equations. He will apply these results and methods to give efficient algorithms
that compute properties of systems of difference equations. These properties are
reflected in characteristic sets and Galois groups of the equations. In
particular, the investigator will develop algorithms to reduce systems of non-
linear difference equations to simpler systems. These algorithms test
consistency of the input system and eliminate variables from the equations of
the system. He will also give a Galois theory of linear difference equations
with difference parameters to study difference algebraic dependences among
solutions of difference equations.
