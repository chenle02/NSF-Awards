This project is to study robust control strategies which are uncertainty
tolerant. The objective is to develop practical civil structural control
technology for seismic resistant applications. The project will consist of the
following tasks: (1) study of robust feedback loop control design in the
frequency domain, (2) study of nonlinear design issues, (3) study of control-
structure interaction such as time delays, and (4) experimental verification of
control strategies. The research would contribute to the development and
implementation of robust structural control strategies for earthquake hazard
mitigation.
