In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Benjamin Widom of the Department of Chemistry of Cornell University will study
the theory of fluids, phase transitions and interfaces. The PI will study the
structure of the interfaces between fluids using a local density functional
theory, the contact angles between liquids and low energy surfaces, the Mcleods
law relating the interfacial tension of two fluid phases in equilibrium to the
difference in their densities and the hydrophobic interactions in water
solutions. The PI is one of the leaders in the field of liquid theory and phase
transitions. His theoretical work has strong practical implications for colloid
chemistry and biochemistry.
