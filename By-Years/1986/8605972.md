The objective of this research is the development of a methodology for the
repeated production of parts over the planning horizon of a shop. The primary
focus is the regulation of parts flow among available resources utilizing real-
time shop and cell controllers which enable automation of the process. The shop
controller dispatches batches of work parts and schedules them among cells. The
cell controller schedules a batch of parts among workstations. The fundamental
analytical and design concepts underlying this approach are: resource grouping,
real- time scheduling, hierarchical control, stability, and state-space
representation of the system. The methodology includes a hierarchical
decision/control structure consisting of shop and cell levels, dynamic grouping
of a pool of resources (machines, robots, transporters) into virtual cells by
the shop controller, the use of minimax algebra to permit state-space
representation of repeated discrete events, and implementation based on linear
control theory.
