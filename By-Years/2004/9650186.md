The Department of Chemistry is using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy
(GC/MS) across the undergraduate chemistry lab curriculum in a series of
research-oriented, problem-based labs. The objectives of this program are to
develop a lab curriculum that is appropriate for a wide range of student
interests by placing students in the role of investigator; to increase student
(especially women and minority) interest in chemistry by allowing them to use
modern instrumentation in the study of relevant problems early in the chemistry
lab curriculum; and to allow students to use state-of-the-art instrumentation
for increasingly sophisticated experiments through all their years of chemistry
study. The problem-based approach has already been introduced in the general
chemistry lab, and the GC/MS makes possible the development of additional
research-oriented lab modules. Undergraduate students use the GC/MS in problem-
based experiments beginning with general chemistry and continue to use it for
organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, environmental chemistry, physical
chemistry, biochemistry, and finally, for chemistry majors, a senior research
project. This results in students who, first, have a sense of how modern science
is done, how scientists know what they know about molecules, and how powerful a
tool modern instrumentation is and, second, have developed critical thinking
skills by being active participants in the planning and execution of
experiments.
