Proposal Number: SRS-0209274&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Smith, William
B.&lt;br/&gt;Proposer: American Statistical Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unsolicited proposal from
the American Statistical Association (ASA) to the Division of Science Resources
Statistics (SRS) of the National Science Foundation involves establishing an
ASA/SRS-NSF Research Program. The Program would entail having an outstanding
academic researcher/fellow conduct interdisciplinary research using SRS data.
The researcher/fellow would be selected through a rigorous, competitive
application process. The proposed program is similar to other that ASA has
established with several other Federal statistical agencies including the Bureau
of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Center for Health
Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Bureau of
Justice Statistics.&lt;br/&gt;
