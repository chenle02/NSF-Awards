9318063 McClure Rochester General Hospital (RGH) has an extensive internal
network (RGHNET) that services all of the buildings on the campus, providing
state-of-the-art computing and communications services to over 1500 educators,
researchers, clinicians, administrators and students. A major teaching facility
offering primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care, Rochester General
Hospital is constantly seeking innovative technologies that maximize the
abilities of hospital staff. The following are a few important examples of the
wide range of services available through the INTERNET that can enhance
productivity and clinical care at Rochester General. Physicians participating in
clinical trials can log patient-care data and share this data on a national
basis, surgeons will have access to vascular and trauma registries and medical
images, administrators and residents in the independent residency programs will
have access to the AAMC electronic residency application service, nurse
researchers will have access to the Sigma Theta Tau National Nursing Research
Library, educators can use the INTERNET to acquire and transmit curricular
materials, pharmacists will be able to exchange protocols for new drugs, and the
library will use the INTERNET to offer enhanced reference and document delivery
services. Such access will greatly assist the hospital in "building a superior
system of care which meets the lifelong health needs of our community."
Initially, the clinicians, educators and researchers at Rochester General will
be the primary users of the INTERNET. But the impact of the INTERNET link will
extend beyond RGH to its corporate partners. As well, the circuit librarians
based in the Health Sciences Library will provide INTERNET training and linkages
to the practitioners in the rural hospitals surrounding Rochester.
