The primary goal of the Chemistry Department is to provide a high-quality
education for undergraduate students. The laboratory experience is a vital part
of the chemistry curriculum. The incorporation of a state-of-the-art gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument into the laboratory program
permits the department to develop new experiments that increase the
attractiveness of the chemistry program and greatly enhance the laboratory
experience for both chemistry majors and nonmajors. A new Environmental Chemical
Analysis course is using the GC/MS in the examination of three sets of real-
world samples and employing EPA reference procedures. The GC/MS is also being
used in Quantitative Organic Analysis and Instrumental Analysis courses.
Students also use this instrument for research projects that enable them to
investigate, characterize, and identify compounds of interest. In summary, the
goal of this project is to strengthen the undergraduate curriculum by
introducing students to state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and
encouraging the pursuit of further scientific studies with GC/MS.
