Manteuffel The researcher and his colleagues organize a conference devoted to
iterative methods for the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations.
Particular themes are nonsymmetric linear systems, globally convergent
algorithms for nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of work, and
applications on multiprocessor computer architectures. The mathematical
description of real-world problems leads inevitably to equations to solve. Many
times the equations are nonlinear ones, arising because the underlying problem
is nonlinear. Often, however, the original problem is linear and the
mathematical equations are too. Such problems arise in all areas of science and
technology, and are of special interest in biology, materials, environmental
studies, and manufacturing. Progress in these areas requires solution of more
comprehensive modeling equations, or more accurate solution of existing models.
In either case, these needs increase the size of the equations or their
nonlinearity. The conference addresses advances in algorithms to deal with the
bigger size of the equations, nonlinearities, the amount of time and work needed
to get a solution, and the possible use of multiprocessor computers. ***
