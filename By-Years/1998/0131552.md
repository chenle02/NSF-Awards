&lt;br/&gt;Viruses are suitable tools to study trafficking of macromolecules
through plants because they encode specialized movement proteins (MPs) that
enable these pathogens to move cell to cell via the plasmodesmata. Moreover, the
MP encoded by the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of Tomato bushy
stunt virus (TBSV) is functional in many different families. Recent data have
shown that the TBSV MP interacts with a novel host factor (HF3.5) with
similarities to a class of transcription factors that are known to traffic
through plasmodesmata. Results of in vivo and in vitro binding tests with
defined MP mutants provided support for the hypothesis that the interaction
between HF3.5 and the TBSV MP is functionally relevant. The objectives of this
project aim to further test this hypothesis by: I) a detailed molecular analysis
of the P22-HF3.5 interaction, II) localization of the HF3.5 protein in planta,
III) biochemical verification of P22-host protein interactions in plant
extracts, and IV) studying the functional role by monitoring the effect of HF3.5
gene silencing on TBSV movement and infection. It is anticipated that the
studies of this newly described movement-associated host protein will provide
novel insights into the interactions that control movement of viruses and other
macromolecules through plants.&lt;br/&gt;
