Accelerators were invented in the 1930s to provide high-energy particles to
investigate the structure of the atomic nucleus. Since their invention, there
has been a growing list of applications of accelerators both for scientific
discoveries and for the benefits of the society. Approximately 30,000
accelerators are currently used to diagnose and treat diseases, to improve
manufacturing processes (ion implantation for electronics; hardening surfaces
and materials; welding and cutting; and treating waste and medical material),
and to address energy, environment and security issues (biofuel production and
oil and gas exploration; cleaning flue gases of thermal power plants; and
inspecting cargo and improving the monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance).
If much brighter (much more intense) beams can be produced via understanding the
fundamental issues that govern beam intensity, the accelerators of tomorrow
promise greater opportunities. This would require breakthroughs in accelerator
science and their translation into applications for the nation's health, wealth
and security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, some of the challenges in
achieving much brighter beams will be tackled by the "Innovations in bright beam
science" team at the University of Chicago. (i) A study will be undertaken to
understand the science that underlies dramatic improvements in the quality
factor of superconducting, radio-frequency cavities via nitrogen doping. This
could reduce capital and operational costs. (ii) A proof-of-principle experiment
for accelerators with highly non-linear components will be performed. This could
lead to a significant suppression of the instabilities that have plagued intense
beams. (iii) New mechanisms will be developed to produce intense X-rays, an
indispensable tool for studying the atomic and molecular arrangement of
materials.
