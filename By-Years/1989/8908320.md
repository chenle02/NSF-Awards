There is growing evidence that Antarctic, and possible Subarctic, marine.based
ice sheets experienced rapid collapse as world sea level rose to its present
position after 18,000 B.C. Individual events probably took place within 1,000
years and resulted in rapid rises in sea level of several meters. These events
would have caused shoreline translations of tens of kilometers on continental
shelves of gentle gradient, such as that offshore Texas. Existing marine
geologic data from this region indicate that as many as four relative
stillstands and associated barrier trends existed on the northern Texas shelf
during the late Wisconsin and Holocene; these features are separated by up to 30
kilometers and represent rapid "jumps" in the paleoshoreline. The proposed
research will examine the distribution, character and age of sediments within
buried incised valleys and their associated estuaries. The objective is to
develop a high frequency sequence stratigraphy for the region which depicts the
nature of recent (<10,000 BP) sea level events and the manner in which these
events have influenced the evolution of the North Texas coast and its estuaries.
