This project supports a major reorganization of the laboratories for the second
half of the introductory physics sequence for all science majors and pre-
engineers (approximately 80 students each year). This continues the
restructuring, begun in 1990, of the introductory laboratory sequence for these
majors. The department is organizing four laboratory modules, Wave Motion,
Electricity and Magnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics, each requiring 3 to 4
weeks to complete. Each module contains several innovative experiments that are
run weekly until the module is completed by all of the students. This
arrangement reduces the number of setups for an individual experiment, resulting
in significant cost reductions to the university and its sponsors. This project
specifically addresses Module 2, Electricity and Magnetism. Classic experiments
have been merged with new approaches to introduce the student to the concepts of
exponential decay in physical situations, behavior of pulses in transmission
lines, and experimental determination of fundamental constants. The exercises
encourage creative curiosity and rely heavily on the use of analytical
techniques made possible by computers. The module represents a more loosely
structured laboratory than the conventional approach in which everyone does the
same experiment at the same time. The involvement of the students in discussions
with one another and the enhancement of creative curiosity should occur more
readily in a less structured environment. The project uses student focus groups,
survey instruments, and observations in formative and summative evaluation.
Dissemination products include course materials, software, a laboratory manual,
and final evaluation reports.
