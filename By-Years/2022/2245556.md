This project is in graph theory, where properties and structures of a network
are explored. The PI will focus on extremal graph theory which attempts to
quantify what combinatorial properties a graph must have when it gets large
(where size can be defined by several graph parameters, each giving an
interesting theory). The project has two main thrusts. First to study classical
Turan and Ramsey theory, two central areas in combinatorics. And second to study
extremal problems in spectral graph theory, where one uses linear algebra to
deduce combinatorial properties of the graph via matrices. These problems are
fundamental ones in graph theory and additionally have applications to finite
geometry, combinatorial number theory, combinatorial matrix theory, and
theoretical computer science. The project will will also have a specific focus
on advising student research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will first
attempt two notoriously difficult problems in extremal graph theory: finding
constructions of graphs certifying lower bounds for bipartite Turan numbers and
finding constructions of Ramsey graphs. The PI will develop the recent trend of
combining algebraic and geometric objects with probabilistic methods to make
progress on these two difficult areas. Second, the project will attempt to solve
several long-standing conjectures in spectral graph theory regarding for example
spectral gaps of graphs, Nordhaus-Gaddum type problems, and spectral versions of
Turan-type problems. Additionally, applications in discrete geometry and
combinatorial number theory will be explored using graph theoretic
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
