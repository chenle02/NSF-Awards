9508574 Wake This research involves study of the evolutionary relationships of
terrestrial lungless salamanders , family Plethodontidae. The proposed work
concentrates on obtaining DNA sequence data and new morphological data for the
Bolitoglossini tribe so that explicit phylogenetic hypotheses can be tested at
several hierarchical levels. %%% Not only does this study have value for
understanding the evolutionary history of members of this group, but knowledge
of this group will provide information of critical value in developing land use
and conservation strategies in the future. Several of the taxa involved are
federally listed species and some others may already be extinct. ***
