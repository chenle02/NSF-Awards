With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Reed College will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry
out studies on a) enzyme mechanisms through magnetization tansfer; b) synthesis
of transition-state mimics; c) natural product synthesis; and d) mechanistic and
structural studies of sugar isomerases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
