This study looks at a neglected field in American natural history. It examines
American participation in an international `extinction` controversy involving
the location of fossil bones of an animal incognitum found on the banks of the
Ohio River. The focus is on a debate involving a network of correspondence
between Americans and Europeans in which knowledge in the form of written and
visual descriptions, specimens, and publications flowed back and forth across
the Atlantic. This network was the principal means by which naturalists obtained
knowledge about distant objects of Nature. The location of these fossil bones in
North America gave the contributions of American naturalists unique epistemic
importance in the debate. The study examines American participation in the
controversy as a means of understanding the social relations that governed this
transatlantic community of naturalists.
