This award is partial funding for the purchase of equipment for an image
analysis and image processing system. Specific studies will include analysis of
patterns of particle deposition on surfaces in contact with blood, analysis of
patterns of particle deposition during electroplating, measurement of
interactions of biological cells with surfaces, characterization of the
structure of porous media, and analysis of CAT scan images of two-phase flow in
porous media. The information to be obtained should illuminate processes
occurring in systems with truly complex geometry of the type often encountered
with practical operations on energy and materials processing. The work with
blood and cells should help develop improved materials for blood processing and
bioreactors.
