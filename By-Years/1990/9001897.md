The two principal investigators will study the isolation of a geometric aspect
of integrability, singularity analysis of Toda equations and stratification of
Bruhat cells, solutions to the sine-Gordon equations involving constant mean
curvature tori immersed in spheres, and the universal enveloping algebra
associated with properties of Poisson brackets. This project concerns deep
properties of Hamiltonian systems. These are systems of differential equations
which describe in particular the motion of mechanical devices. Such devices must
conserve both energy and momentum. Recently, various algebraic methods as well
as Painleve analysis of integrability has been used to make considerable
progress toward the understanding of such systems. This project will contribute
to these developments.
