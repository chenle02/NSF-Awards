{\em Algorithmic game theory} is an emerging research area on the interface of
theoretical computer science and economics. This field is largely motivated by
the inadequacy of traditional algorithmic techniques for what is arguably the
central application in computer science today---the Internet and other similarly
large, heterogeneous networks. The PI will pursue a broad research agenda in
algorithmic game theory,&lt;br/&gt;which can be loosely split into two related
categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main thrust of this research will be
to analyze the inefficiency inherent in selfish behavior in numerous different
applications (primarily in networks). The twins goals here are to develop
general mathematical methods for determining when selfish behavior leads to a
near-optimal outcome, and, for applications where this is not the case, to
understand the degree of centralized intervention required to recover a near-
optimal solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second main thrust of the proposal is
a deep and systematic study of the computational complexity of equilibria, such
as Nash equilibria. In addition to being an important, fundamental, and as yet
poorly&lt;br/&gt;understood theoretical issue, polynomial-time algorithms for
computing equilibria are a crucial step toward establishing their credibility.
In particular, we cannot expect a computationally intractable notion of
equilibrium to be an accurate model of the behavior of real-life strategic
agents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above research agenda is complemented by an
educational plan which includes extensive graduate course development,
undergraduate teaching and course development at the senior and freshman levels,
and active&lt;br/&gt;recruitment of undergraduates into
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The {\bf intellectual merit} of the proposal
stems from its goal of making several fundamental scientific advances across the
emerging, interdisciplinary field of algorithmic game
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{\bf Broader impacts} of the proposal include the
integration of research and teaching through graduate courses, the dissemination
of educational materials, the introduction of state-of-the-art research ideas
into undergraduate courses, and the recruitment of undergraduates into
research.&lt;br/&gt;
