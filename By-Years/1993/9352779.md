This project will develop an intermediate level instrumental analysis course and
upgrade the advanced instrumental analysis course. The major instruments to be
purchased and their applications include a high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system and a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. This
project is significant because "hands on" experience with modern instrumentation
that was formerly available only to senior level chemistry majors will now be
accessible to many more students. In addition, student understanding of the
principles and student proficiency in the practice of liquid chromatography and
capillary electrophoresis will be enhanced.
