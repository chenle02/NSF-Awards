ABSTRACT EEC-9713368 MAHAJAN It is potentially feasible to use
MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to produce a device for
trimming and providing the fine RF tuning adjustments needed in
microwave/millimeter-wave integrated circuits. However, to date there has not
been a reported demonstration of this technique in a MEMS device. This award
supports a tie project between two Industry/University Cooperative Research
Centers, Berkeley Sensors and Actuators Center (BSAC) at the University of
California at Berkeley, and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Packaging
of Microwave, Optical and Digital Electronics (CAMPmode) at the University of
Colorado at Boulder, to develop a complete numerical/experimental
characterization at microwave/millimeter-wave frequencies to derive an RF
network model for MEMS. The methodology developed will be illustrated by
implementation of the technique in a high-efficiency, switched mode
microwave/millimeter-wave power amplifier for mobile and portable systems.
CAMPmode is one of the leading university research centers in millimeter
microwave packaging technologies, and BSAC is one of the leading research
facilities in the development of MEMS technology. Together, these two Centers
are well qualified to perform the proposed research, which is a project that
neither Center has the capability to perform on its own.
