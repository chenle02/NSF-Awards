This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of separations science and in the subfield of liquid chromatography. The
thrust of this research is the design, construction, and evaluation of a new
type of chromatographic system capable of separating gram quantities of peptide
hormones and other substances with high resolution. The heart of this system is
a commercially available, extruded multichannel ceramic block having several
thousand parallel channels of identical dimensions. This is equivalent to using
thousands of identical chromatographic columns in parallel. Thus, the resolving
power of a capillary column can be combined with the higher sample capacity of a
preparative scale column. Specific Phase I tasks include development of a method
for dry-packing the ceramic blocks, construction of an entire chromatographic
system incorporating these blocks, and evaluation of the system using
fluorescent hydrocarbon test compounds. Success of this project will be a major
step forward in separations technology. It is expected that the development of
the projected preparative capillary column technique could have major impact of
biotechnological separations.
