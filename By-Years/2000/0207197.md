The optimal microstructural design of superplastic ceramics using finely
dispersed second phases will be studied. Intergranular silicate phases and
nanodispersed crystalline oxides will be used to create ceramic materials with
improved properties for shape forming via superplastic deformation. The volume
and distribution of second phases and their interfacial energy and solubility
will be variables analyzed with respect to grain growth, grain boundary sliding,
and fracture in polycrystalline oxides. Experimental analysis techniques will
include analytical electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy as well as
mechanical deformation tests both at room temperature and at high temperatures.
The goal of this research is to understand how chemically dissimilar dispersants
can be used at the nanoscale to tailor the mechanical properties of oxide
ceramics, so that highly deformable ceramics can be net shape formed at high
temperatures while retaining a superior mechanical and electrical performance at
lower temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superplastic forming has the potential
to allow the production of shapes not easily attained by conventional ceramic
processing techniques. Superplastic deformation of ceramics currently, however,
is currently possible only in a few limited ceramic systems that retain a fine
grain microstructure. In addition, the extremely high temperatures required for
this process and slow strain rates attained limit the industrial applications of
this technique. This research will focus on optimizing the microstructural
design parameters that will result in lower temperatures for superplastic
forming and increased deformation rates while expanding the range of ceramic
materials that can be shaped by superplastic forming, thus making this technique
a more economically viable method for net shape forming of ceramics. &lt;br/&gt;
