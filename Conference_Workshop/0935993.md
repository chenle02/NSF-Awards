This award provides support for the mathematics components of the 2009 and 2010
SACNAS Conference. SACNAS is a national organization with members residing
throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. The mission of SACNAS is to
encourage Chicano, Latino and Native American students to pursue graduate
education and obtain the advanced degrees necessary for research careers and
science teaching professions at all levels. The annual national conference is
the centerpiece of the SACNAS programs.

Via its national conference SACNAS effectively implements a broad range of
ongoing educational, professional, and leadership development supports and
service mechanisms for undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and junior and
mid-career professionals. The conference features career advancement workshops,
scientific symposia, exhibits, student presentations, and guest speakers
designed to provide the resources Chicano, Latino, Native American, and other
postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students need to pursue advanced
degrees in the sciences. Guest speakers are chosen for their excellence in
scientific research and their ability to convey the wonder and importance of
science through the presentation of their research results.
