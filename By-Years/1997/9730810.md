9730810 Deering This award to the University of Delaware will provide
instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on the R/V Cape Henlopen, a
research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
instruments to be acquired include water sampling bottles, sensors for measuring
conductivity, temperature and depth, an attenuation and absorption meter for
studies of sea water clarity, and an acoustic tracking system for monitoring
depth and altitude of towed instrumentation. The shared-use instrumentation
supported here will assist marine scientists conduct NSF-supported research,
particularly along the central Atlantic U.S. coast, in 1998 and in future years.
