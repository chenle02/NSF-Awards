The purpose of this award to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is
for ASCE to organize a technical study mission to Germany, Austria, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. ASCE has in effect Agreements of Cooperation with engineering
societies in these countries (with the exception of the Czechoslovakian
societies) and these agreements are instrumental in strengthening the
relationships between American civil engineers and those of the countries where
the Agreements exist. This study mission will assist materially in cementing
these relationships and energizing future cooperative research efforts between
U.S. engineers and those in these countries. The mission to Hungary and
Czechoslovakia is particularly significant in this regard as these countries
move from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy.
