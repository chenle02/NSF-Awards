This research will investigate fault injection techniques for the evaluation
and validation of dependable protocols. The project will focus on techniques
that can be used to demonstrate three aspects of a target protocol: (i)
detection of design or implementation errors, (ii) identification of violations
of protocol specifications, and (iii) insight into design decisions made by the
implementors. The end goal of the project is the investigation of techniques for
testing the fault-tolerance capabilities of dependable protocols and the
development of a tool for the experimental evaluation of commercial and
prototype protocols. The approach will center around a technique called`script-
driven probing and fault injection.` A distributed protocol can be viewed as an
abstraction through which a collection of participants communicate by exchanging
a set of messages. Hence, no distinction is made between application-level
protocols, communication protocols, or device layer protocols. A probe/fault
injection (PFI) layer is inserted below a target protocol to filter and to
manipulate the messages that are exchanged between participants. The fault
injection layer supports the execution of deterministic or randomly-generated
test scripts to probe the participants and inject various faults into the
system. In particular, by intercepting messages between two layers in a protocol
stack, the fault injection layer can delay, drop, reorder, duplicate, and modify
messages. Furthermore, it can introduce spontaneous messages into the system to
probe the participants and to orchestrate the system execution into a particular
path. Since timing constraints are often an important component of the
dependability requirements on a system, the intrusiveness of a fault injection
mechanism on a target system is a key issue which will be addressed by this
research. The educational component of this CAREER project will include
`undergraduate mentoring` and `learning via experimentation.` Mentoring exposes
students to one-on-one technical interactions with instructors and more senior
students. Learning via experimentation has a two pronged effect. It allows
students to `practice` how to apply knowledge and to`learn` how to obtain new
information. These two aspects of the plan will be formalized into the
curriculum with the following educational activities: (1) Refocus the
Undergraduate Directed Study to involve junior and senior-level students in some
of the ongoing prototyping activities in research projects and in various
laboratories on campus; (2) Develop a curriculum track that emphasizes
experimentation to enhance learning of software systems concepts.
