The molecular biology of coronavirus replication will be examinined using mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model system. It has been shown that MHV infection
induces the synthesis of two separate RNA dependent RNA polymerase activities.
The proteins responsible for these activities will be identified by preparing
specific antisera raised by immunization with either ppol-B-gel fusion proteins
or synthetic peptides derived from both the 5' and 3' ends of the polymerase.
These antisera will be used to inhibit polymerase activity, identify the
proteins, and in conjunction with cross-linking reagents determine the presence
of the nonstructural proteins in the polymerase complex. It has also been found
that the nucleocapsid proteins binds specifically to genomic RNA and the
subgenomic mRNAs. The RNA sequence that initiate this interaction will be
determined. Finally, the maturational pathway of the virions will be studied by
defining the interactions between the nucleocapsid and matrix protein. Recent
interest in this group of viruses is based on the fundings that they have very
unusual molecular structures and an unique mode of replication. They are a group
of enveloped helical RNA viruses which have characteristic petal shaped clubs on
their surface much like the influenza virus. The genomic RNA of this virus is
considerably larger than any stable RNA known to exist in nature. The subgenomic
mRNAs of coronaviruses are synthesized by a unique mechanism of discontinuous
transcription, i.e. a leader RNA-primed transcription.
