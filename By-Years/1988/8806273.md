Accumulation of sterols and sesquiterpenoids have been correlated with changes
in the activity level of particular branch point enzymes of the isopernoid
biosynthetic pathway, squalene synthetase and sesquiterpene cyclase. The next
obvious question is whether these enzyme activities are regulated by the
absolute amounts of the enzyme proteins. Both enzymes are to be purified,
antibody probes for each generated, and the absolute amount of each protein
determined. The subcellular distribution of an enzyme activity common to both
pathways, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and those activities
unique to each, squalene synthetase and sesquiterpene cyclase, will be
determined in tobacco cells fractionated by conventional biochemical methods.
Experiments measuring the in vivo incorporation rate of radioactive mevalonate,
isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and farnesyl pyrophosphate into sterols and
sesquiterpenoids, and subsequent in vitro enzyme assays will identify other
regulated, and thus potentially limiting, enzyme activities.%%% Plant
isoprenoids comprise a wide range of compounds of physiological importance (ie.
plant growth hormones), as well as of agricultural (ie. flavor and aroma
constituents) and pharmaceutical (ie. oral contraceptives) interest. Our
understanding of how plants regulate the production of these compounds is still
incomplete. The proposed work is to examine 3 putative mechanisms regulating the
biosynthesis of two classes of isoprenoids, sterols and sesquiterpenoids.
Information of this type should provide additional strategies for the future
genetic and biotechnological improvement of plants for agriculture and
industry.***//
