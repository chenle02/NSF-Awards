This proposal requests continuing support for a broad spectrum of modeling
activities concentrating on the high speed transport of polar into the
magnetosphere and on ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling. Specifically, support is
requested for the following major research areas: 1. The use our hydrodynamic
three ion species (H+,He+,O+) polar wind model to reproduce observations of the
classical polar wind under changing geophysical conditions with special
attention to modeling the He+ dominated transient outflows. Individual polar
wind and upwelling ions events will be also modeled and compared the
observations. These comparisons will be done in cooperation with Drs. M. Blanc,
M.O. Chandler, J.M. Grebowsky, and T.E. Moore. 2. Further studies of the
ionosphere-plasmasphere system with our ionosphere to conjugate ionosphere
model. Specific studies include the investigation of solar cycle and seasonal
variations in plasmaspheric parameters, the effects of variations in atmospheric
neutral hydrogen on plasmaspheric densities and modeling the effects of
substorms on the coupled ionosphere-plasmasphere system. 3. A multispecies model
will be developed based on a gyrotropic twenty moment approximation. The coupled
time-dependent 20 moment transport equations will be solved with a second order
accurate (both space and time) Godunov-type upwind differencing technique with
dimensional splitting. The numerical scheme itself is being developed with the
support of the NASA Space Physics Theory Program; however, its application to
polar wind and plasmaspheric flows is to be carried out in the framework of this
proposal.
