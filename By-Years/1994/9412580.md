9412580 Smith Abstract The 12th International Congress of the International
Union for the Study of Social Insects will be held from 21 to 27 August 1994 in
Paris, France. This Congress, held once every four or five years, is the premier
world forum for research on social insects. It is the only meeting devoted to
this important group of organisms. Support from the National Science Foundation
will permit participation by young American scientists who might not otherwise
be able to attend this meeting, with its opportunities for exchange of
information and for establishment of international collaborations in research.
