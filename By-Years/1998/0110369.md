Professor Paul Barbara of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study single molecule
spectroscopy of organic polymer films, including poly-phenylene-vinylene
polymer, a fluorescent conjugated polymer. Among the other systems to be
examined are photo-driven polymeric motors and model single-molecule photonic
devices. Polymer conformation, conformational relaxation, photophysics and
chain-chain interactions are some of the issues. Ultrapure conducting polymers
are to be prepared and their photophysics studied in the presence of charges, as
in a LED device. The PI proposes to attempt femtosecond time-resolved
measurements on these single molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials to be
studied are important in electro-optic, opto-electronic and photovoltaic
applications.
