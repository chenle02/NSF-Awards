In this project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
Professor Campbell will study ensemble effects in surface reactions catalyzed by
platinum. The use of bismuth atoms as random, electronically neutral site
blockers allows the determination of the size of the platinum site necessary for
the hydrogenation of cyclohexene and the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of
cyclohexane. The overall goal of this work is to develop a stepwise kinetic
model for these catalytic reactions on the platinum surface. This sort of
microscopic information is essential to a detailed understanding of
heterogeneous catalysis. %%% The detailed microscopic understanding of the
active site for catalysis of hydrocarbon conversion chemistry on platinum is
important for the design of effective catalysts for use in the petroleum
refining industry. This research project uses bismuth atom adsorption methods to
probe the active site for hydrocarbon reactions on model platinum catalysts with
a view to understanding the microscopic details of this heterogeneous chemistry.
