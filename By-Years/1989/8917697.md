A rigorous systematic methodology will be investigated for generating the
initial topology or layout of structural members based on mathematical models
and physical principles. The new method of homogenization provides a unique and
exciting approach for addressing rigorously how structural topologies may be
optimized. This fundamental new capability offers a unified scheme for carrying
concept evolution through detail layout design, using rigorous principles
together with appropriate empirical knowledge, so that realistic, manufacturable
shapes can be obtained. The broad techniques and skills required are served by
the diversity in the investigators team.
