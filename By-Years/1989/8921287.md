The objective of this project is to develop a new psychological model of expert
software effort estimation based on analogy and case-based reasoning. The
research activities include psychological studies, computer modeling and
validation, and simulation experiments to formulate an accurate model of
analogical reasoning in the domain of effort estimation. The results of this
research will provide major insights into how expert effort estimators perform
their task and how to improve the effort estimation process. The long term goal
is to weave together the symbolic methods of the expert with analytical methods
in order to provide more understandable and more accurate estimates of project
effort.
