This application seeks partial funding for a FASEB Summer Research Conference on
Somatic Cell Genetics to be held July 6-10 in Saxtons River, Vermont. The goal
of this conference is to bring together somatic cell geneticists and molecular,
developmental and cell biologists who utilize somatic cell genetics in their
work. Recent progress on a broad range of central questions in biology has
involved the use of somatic cell genetics. The FASEB Summer Research Conference
has been the only meeting of its type explicitly focused on somatic cell
genetics. The organization of the conference is intended to draw together
investigators from the broad range of disciplines which are directly touched by
somatic cell genetics. Thus, many areas of biology will be covered and
scientists who would not normally be at the same meeting will have a chance to
communicate.
