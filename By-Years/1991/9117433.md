The principal investigators will study mineral behavior at high pressures and
temperatures and attempt to relate changes in crystal structure under such
conditions to changes in physical and thermodynamic properties. They will
collect X-ray and Raman spectroscopic data in-situ, and analyze the data in
light of Landau theory. This work should lead to a better understanding of the
behavior of materials in the Earth's crust and upper mantle.
