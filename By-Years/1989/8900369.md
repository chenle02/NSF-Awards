The research investigates reconciliation of unconditional (pre-data) inference
and conditional (post-data) inference using an objective means of assessing
conditional validity of frequentist confidence. General methods of assigning
post-data confidence are considered which are based on posterior distributions.
The resulting properties and frequentist validity of the post-data confidence
estimator are examined. Post-data inference for volume-reducing confidence sets
for normal means and variances is to be studied where it is possible to achieve
lower volume and coherent post-data confidence in a frequency- valid way. The
conditional properties of admissible nonrandomized confidence sets from discrete
distributions will be investigated with the goal of obtaining coherent
frequency-valid post-data inference.
