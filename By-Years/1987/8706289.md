Studies will be made of electron states in the gap (in the bulk and at
interfaces), carrier transport and recombinatiion processes in a-Si:H and
related materials (undoped and variously doped films,and multilayer structures).
CW and time-resolved photomodulation spectroscopy in a broad spectral range and
time domain from femtoseconds to seconds will be used. Photogenerated carriers
will be followed as they dribble down in energy through band states, different
traps in the gap, and eventually recombine. In the femtosecond range, the pump
and probe technique for studying energy, momentum and coherence relaxations of
excited electronic states will be employed. In the picosecond range, a new
technique, optical time-of-flight method will be used, for studying the carrier
transport in a-Si:H at very short times, using the a-Si:H/a-SiNx:H multilayer
structures. In the ranges fromnanoseconds up, studies will be made of the
evolution of the carrier densities both in energy and time from which carrier
transport between specific states in the gap and carrier recombination can be
obtained. Another new method, cw photomodulation spectroscopy of vibrations, for
identifying the bonding structures with which a certain electronic state in the
gap is correlated will be used.
