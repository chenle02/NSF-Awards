The Principal Investigator proposes to work collaboratively with researchers at
Palmer Station to create a suite of 10 drawings titled ?Antarctica: Micro, Macro
and In-between,? which will represent multiple perceptions of the Antarctic
environment?from a variety of scales--in a triptych format.

A macro view of the Antarctica landscape will present an average person?s view
of the natural world ? a panoramic view of the landscape. A second panel will
present a microscopic view of the natural world ? a view typically seen only by
research scientists. The third panel will be placed between the macro and micro
panels. It will present an ?in-between? view of the landscape that ranges from 3
feet to 15 feet in total area. Aspects of the macro and the micro images will be
intertwined or layered with this image to create a seamless connection between
the broad view and the microscopic view
