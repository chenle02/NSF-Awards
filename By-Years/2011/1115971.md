The goal of this project is to develop new techniques for visualizing static and
dynamic data. Visualization allows us to perceive relationships in large
interconnected datasets. While statistics may determine correlations among the
data, intuitive visualizations of these correlations helps us frame what
questions to ask about the data. Moreover, algorithms for visualizing processes
that evolve over time will have applications beyond the traditional uses of
information visualization in exploratory data analysis and searching for
patterns and trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphs are often used to capture
relationships between objects and visualized as node-link diagrams. Contact
graphs provide an alternative and often more intuitive way to visualize planar
graphs. In contact graphs, nodes are represented by regions and edges are
represented by two regions sharing a common border. Such representation suggests
the familiar metaphor of a geographical map. In this research project the PIs
will study characterizations of the classes of graphs that admit contact graph
representations where nodes have "nice" shapes (e.g., convex, with small
complexity, with predetermined areas) and techniques for creating such
representations. While contact graphs are restricted to planar graphs, the PIs
will extend the notion to general graphs using clustering and embedding
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an integral part of this project, graduate and
undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the described research
activities. This continues a tradition of integrating undergraduates into
research projects that are easily accessible and visually appealing. As with
past projects, all new software developed will be made available to the broader
community.
