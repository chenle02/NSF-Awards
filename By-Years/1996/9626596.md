9626596 Markus A two day workshop will held December 4-6, 1995, to introduce
U.S. based academic researchers and faculty members to MicroElectroMechanical
Systems (MEMS) technology, and the Multi-User Mems Processes (MUMPS) facility.
MUMPS exists to provide low-cost easy access to MEMS technology and services,
and the attendees will be encouraged to make use of this facility to expose
students at all levels to the enabling new field of MEMS. ***
