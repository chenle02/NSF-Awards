This project is to support international and travel within the U.S. and living
expenses for Professor Haifan Xiang for technical consultations and cooperation
on the following research topics: (1) evaluation of structural response under
severe earthquake and wind excitation, (2) active and passive controls of
structures under severe earthquake and wind excitations. Professor Haifan Xiang
is Vice Dean of the College of Structural Engineering, and Director of the
Institute of Bridge Design and Research at Tongjie University, Shanghai, China.
He has been a faculty member of Tongjie since 1958, rising through various
academic ranks to a Ph.D. Supervisory Professor, the highest distinction
conferred by the Chinese Ministry of Education. He was awarded the Certificate
of State Expert in Bridge Engineering in 1986. He is an Executive Deputy
Director of the Chinese National Laboratory for Natural Disaster Prevention,
Vice President of the Chinese Wind Engineering Society, a Director on the
Executive Board of the Chinese Society of Civil Engineers, and General Secretary
of the Institute of Bridge and Structural Engineering of Chinese Society of
Civil Engineers. He led the research team at Tongjie that investigated the wind
resistance for nearly all the recently constructed long-span bridges in China,
including Nanpu Cable-Stayed Bridge, Yanpu Cable-Stayed Bridge, Wuhan Yangtze
River Bridge, Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, Shantou Bay Bridge, and Jiujiang
Yangtze River Bridge. He is currently a consultant for the designs of three
suspension bridges and five cable-stayed bridges in China. Professor Xian will
visit the United States for five weeks, with approximately four weeks at the
Florida Atlantic University, and the remaining week at the National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research and the University of California at Irvine. The
research programs in the above- mentioned institutions will be benefited greatly
from Professor Xiang's consultation and cooperation.
