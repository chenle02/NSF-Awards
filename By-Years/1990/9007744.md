This is an award to provide support for a workshop on nitrate contamination of
groundwater, exposure, consequences and control. The workshop will be held at
the University of Nebraska, Lincoln from September 10-14, 1990 and is being
principally supported by the NATO Scientific Affairs Division. This award from
NSF will permit extending support for participation in this conference by Dr.
Jaroslav Vrba, Chairman of the Commission for Groundwater Protections of the
International Association of Hydrogeologists (Czechoslovakia) who will speak on
Hydrogeological System Nitrate Contamination - Origin and Control in Eastern
European Countries, or by an alternative person on a similar topic. Results of
this workshop are expected to provide guidance to the program in its support of
research on groundwater pollution from substances that contribute nitrogenous
substances to groundwater aquifers.
