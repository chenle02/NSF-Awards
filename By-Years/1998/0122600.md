EIA- 0122600&lt;br/&gt;Panchanathan, Sethuraman&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Innovation: A Concentration Track in
Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents a novel structure
for a concentration track in embedded systems. The new curriculum combines
important aspects of content, synthesized from the latest research in academia,
with industry research aspects channeled through a capstone project (implemented
as internships in industry). The curriculum spans a spectrum of activities
related to the design and delivery of educational and research efforts and is
characterized by three main innovative components namely; a new industry-
university collaborative model for integrating basic and applied research,
creation and delivery of state-of-the-art course content and appropriate
laboratories, delivery of a capstone project through internships. The embedded
systems curriculum emphasizes fundamental issues such as the balance between
hardware and software and the respective trade-offs in building embedded
systems. Practical design experience is fostered through the courses, laboratory
experiments, and capstone projects that expose the students to the state-of-the-
art design methodologies. In addition, internships, funded by industry, expose
the students to work on applied projects mentored by the industrial supervisors
and faculty fellows. &lt;br/&gt;
