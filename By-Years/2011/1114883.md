The project supports a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders in
the ATE, CCLI, STEP, and TUES programs, and in various EEC programs. The
investigators are organizing poster sessions at the American Society for
Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.
The project invites engineering grant award recipients in these programs to
submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. Submissions are reviewed
for quality and, if accepted, award recipients submit a paper that is published
in the meeting proceedings and also present a poster in a special session at the
meeting.
