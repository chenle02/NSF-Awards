Abstract

Award: DMS-9971756 Principal Investigator: Wolfgang Ziller

The principal investigator plans to continue his work on various ways in which
Lie groups arise in geometry. Special emphasis will be put on geometry and
topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. manifolds on which a Lie group
acts with one dimensional quotient. One goal will be to show that every
cohomogeneity one manifold has a metric with non-negative sectional curvature,
which would imply that many exotic spheres admit a metric with non-negative
sectional curvature. The second goal will be to classify cohomogeneity one
manifolds with positive sectional curvature, with the hope of finding some new
examples of compact manifolds with positive sectional curvature. For non-compact
manifolds, we will examine the converse to the Cheeger Gromoll soul theorem,
which asks which vector bundles over compact non-negatively curved manifolds
admit complete metrics with non-negative curvature. This can be done by
examining cohomogeneity one action on the principal bundle of the vector bundle.
Further studies include the classification of primitive subgroups of finite
dimensional Lie groups and global variational properties of the scalar curvature
functional on homogeneous spaces.

A subject of major interest in Riemannian geometry over the last 30 years has
been the geometry of exotic spheres, which are manifolds that look like spheres
but on which ordinary calculus is quite different. These objects were discovered
40 years ago by Milnor and ever since then geometers were interested in finding
a geometric description of them where the natural local invariants look like
spheres, i.e. where the curvature is positive or non-negative. In our project we
have found many new examples of exotic spheres where the curvature is non-
negative and have further plans for finding more such examples. A natural
question is if one can deform these to metrics with positive curvature, one of
the most intriguing open problems in global Riemannian geometry. Our major
technique is to examining symmetry properties of such objects and related
manifolds. A large group of symmetries usually implies interesting geometric and
topological properties and has always been a key ingredient in many mathematical
subjects. We were able to construct many new manifolds with non-negative
curvature and such large symmetry groups, which has a number of interesting
applications, both in geometry and topology.
