9626130 Terng The proposed research lies in the area of submanifold theory in
differential geometry. The investigator plans to study submanifolds of complete
Riemannian manifolds that have simple focal structures. In particular, she is
interested in examining submanifolds with constant focal radii in compact
Riemannian manifolds and taut immersions into complete Riemannian manifolds. In
addition, the investigator is to engage in a collaborative project with K.
Uhlenbeck on integrable Hamiltonian systems and their applications to harmonic
maps and isometric immersions. Submanifold theory is a vast and one of the
oldest areas in geometry. Original motivation comes from surfaces in space,
where a great deal of work was done prior to this century on constructing
surfaces satisfying certain special properties, many of them having to do with
curvature. The proposed research aims to delve into two of these special
properties using modern techniques: surfaces with a simple focal structure, and
surfaces admitting 'Bianchi-Backlund' transformations.
