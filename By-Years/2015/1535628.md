A very powerful laser can be used to accelerate electrons to high energies by
interacting with a state of matter known as a plasma, an ionized gas of charged
particles. The laser achieves this by creating waves in the plasma, like a boat
pushing through water, on which the electrons can surf and be accelerated to
high energies. In this specific project the pulse of laser light will be
controlled and the structure of these waves mapped out in time and space, both
with unprecedented precision. These techniques should help the development of
compact particle accelerators. Accelerators represent a $3B per year market, but
their overall impact is even greater since they find use in everything from
cancer therapy to imaging stresses in aircraft wings. Thus, the development of
compact and cheap accelerators is likely to have a significant impact both
economically and technologically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will
use the high repetition rate of the relativistic intensity (~10^19 W per square
cm, 35 fs) laser, "Lambda-cubed", located on campus at the University of
Michigan - Ann Arbor to enable unique measurements of laser propagation and
wakefield formation, to exert unprecedented control of laser wakefield
acceleration, and to generate up to 10 MeV, few fs duration electron beams at
0.5 kHz. Stable, high quality relativistic electron beams at up to 10 MeV at 0.5
kHz repetition rate using the Lambda-cubed laser will be generated by making use
of advances in pulse compression and feedback control made at the University of
Michigan. A 5 fs pulse will be used as an ultrafast 4D probe of the plasma
wakefield structure, allowing unique tomographic characterization of the
accelerator structure.
