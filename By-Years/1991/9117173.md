The Sleeper deposit presents the opportunity to study the details of gold (and
silica) depositional processes over a wide vertical interval, extending from
depths of 500m to almost the original paleosurface. The proposed research
consists of 1) detailed (band-scale) isotopic, trace-element geochemical, and
textural studies of the shallow banded ore to document the isotopic and
geochemical signature of the ore-forming fluids; 2) studies of deep veins, which
will include fluid inclusion, isotopic, mineralogic, textural, and trace-element
geochemical analyses. The data generated should provide input for thermochemical
modeling, which should in turn provide tests of hypotheses formulated to explain
salient features of the banded high-grade ore at the Sleeper deposit. Results
will provide new insights into gold depositional processes in shallow epithermal
vein systems and how the processes change with depth. It also will refine
existing genetic and exploration models for these vein systems.
