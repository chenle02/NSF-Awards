This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
powerful enzyme / biocide formulation for industrial water treatment. The
research concept targets enzyme-facilitated diffusion of biocide for maximum
biofilm control efficacy and provides a resultant low cost product with lowered
environmental load. Proprietary gene evolution technologies will be used to
enhance enzyme efficacy and to optimize process stability to provide robust
enzyme candidates for formulation with conventional biocides. Optimized enzyme /
biocide formulations will be tested against multispecies biofilms grown under
simulated industrial process conditions. The commercial application of this
project is in the area of industrial bioproducts. Microbial fouling is a common
problem in a variety of industrial, household, personal hygiene, and medical
settings. To this end, a critical need exists for improved microbial control
methods that are effective, economically beneficial, non-toxic and
environmentally friendly. The anti-biofilm enzyme products, such as those
targeted in this project, are expected to meet these needs for a market that
represents an opportunity value of $995 million.
