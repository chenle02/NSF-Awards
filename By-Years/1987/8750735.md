A number of recent developments make it highly desirable for this institution to
develop its capability to exploit the Fox River as a convenient outdoor
laboratory for coursework and independent student research. Included among these
are the approval of a new Environmental Science major, increased emphasis on
aquatic research by faculty in the Biological Sciences, improvement in water
quality and biotic diversity in the Fox River, and the relative inaccessibility
of traditional terrestrial and small aquatic sites. (Although limited shore-
based sampling was possible before the acquisition of the equipment provided in
part through this grant, a lack of sampling gear appropriate for large riverine
habitats prevented thorough use of the river.) Acquisition of a versatile new
boat-contained aquatic sampling system with capabilities for electrofishing and
for making standard limnological measurements in large aquatic habitats
effectively removes that barrier, making possible sound field-based laboratory
experiences for undergraduates in this program.
