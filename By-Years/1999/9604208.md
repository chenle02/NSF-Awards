9604208 Berger Chromosomal DNA is packed into higher ordered structures by
spaced assembly of nucleosomes composed of histone proteins. Gene activity is
repressed by nucleosome binding and gene activation has been correlated with
chemical modification of histones. In particular histone acetylation and
deacetylation may be associated with modulation of gene activity. The recent
discovery that the yeast transcription factor GCN5 has enzymatic histone
acetyltransferase activity potentially links transcriptional activation and
chromatin modification. GCN5 is one component of an ADA complex that physically
interacts with both DNA-associated transcriptional activator proteins and basal
transcription factors. The activity of the ADA complex suggests both a possible
mechanism to target the HAT activity to chromatil through activator interaction,
and a possible outcome of acetylation in the promotion of basal transcription
factor binding to nucleosomal DNA. This research will investigate the
relationship between the HAT activity of GCN5 and transcriptional activation.
The HAT domain of yeast GCN5 will be mutagenized; growth deficient mutants will
be selected and tested for coordinate reduction of enzymatic acetylation and
transcription. Genetic suppression of GCN5 substitution mutants that exhibit
profound growth defects but maintain HAT activity in vitro will be used to
identify novel yeast genes whose products may interact with and/or modulate the
HAT activity of GCN5. Exploration of the relationship between HAT activity and
trascriptional activation will fill in a key gap in current understanding of
eukaryotic gene regulation. Chromosomal DNA is packed into higher ordered
