The research objective of this award is to understand the physical mechanisms
that will enable biomolecular materials to mimic the mechanosensitive response
properties of animal auditory systems. This research will build on significant
advances in the understanding of hair cell physiology for the purpose of
elucidating how these response properties can be mimicked in a biomolecular
material. The approach will be to study the underlying physical mechanisms of
mechanotransduction in membrane-based artificial hair cells for the purpose of
understanding how the underlying mechanisms control the sensitivity and
frequency selectivity of the material system; construct new methods to fabricate
arrays of biomolecular materials for use in arrays that contain a large number
of artificial hair cell structures, and; conduct systematic experiments on an
array of membrane-based artificial hair cells and study both the individual and
collective responses of the material system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
the benefits of this research will include a fuller understanding of the
mechanosensitive transduction properties of both natural and artificial hair
cells for the long-term purpose of improving methods of treating disorders
associated with hearing loss. Approximately 36 million American adults (about 17
percent) report some degree of hearing loss, and age-related hearing loss
affects 18 percent of adults between the ages of 45 and 64 and 47 percent of
adults 75 or older. Knowledge will be disseminated through graduate-level
research as well as undergraduate educational programs. The undergraduate
programs will benefit from the introduction of a three-year educational project
that focuses on physiological modeling of the human auditory system,
characterization of artificial systems excited by physiological inputs, and a
fundamental understanding of how ion channel-based material systems can mimic
the properties of human auditory systems.
