There are three variations of the maple sugaring process, all of which return
to the use of the basic open pan system. This system has been returned to
repeatedly throughout history. However, this system has not proved to be energy
efficient and/or sanitary and it is extremely time consuming. %%% The objective
of the proposed research is to modernize the present Maple Syrup process. The
goal of the proposed system is to become energy efficient. The impact of this
system will overtake the sugaring industry; the cost of producing Maple Syrup
would drastically be reduced. Through preliminary calculations the cost per
gallon of Maple Syrup would be 55 percent less than the present day costs.
