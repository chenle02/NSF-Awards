This award supports the first South Central Topology Conference (SCTC) taking
place September 25-26, 2021 at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas.
The primary goals of this regional conference include: developing a community of
collaborators and experts of varied interests in topology in the region,
showcasing a sample of current research directions in topology in the South
Central region and beyond it, and communicating developing and exciting results
in ways accessible to topologists of all ilks. This conference is timely in
light of the research growth in topology in the South Central Region in recent
years.

Modern topology is a large and active field. The conference will be broad in
its focus, and will provide a sample of recent research developments in fields
such as chromatic and equivariant homotopy theory, higher algebra, symplectic
and contact topology, mirror symmetry, and the topology of embedding spaces. The
six plenary speakers, Anna Marie Bohmann (Vanderbilt University), Kristen
Hendricks (Rutgers University), Robin Koytcheff (University of Louisiana at
Lafayette), Jo Nelson (Rice University), Paul VanKoughnett (Texas A&M
University), and Abigail Ward (MIT), will give one-hour colloquium-style
presentations. There will also be eight short talks given by graduate students
and postdocs on a wide range of topics. More information can be found on the
conference web page: https://www.hiroleetanaka.com/sctc/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
