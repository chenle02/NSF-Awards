The composition of the earth's early atmospheric will be studied using a one-
dimensional photochemical model. Three specific questions will be addressed. The
first is whether impacts could have converted a CO2-dominated atmosphere into a
CO-dominated one during the first several hundred million years of the earth's
history. The oxidation state of the atmosphere, and the C/O ratio in particular,
is an important boundary condition on the origin of life. The second question
deals with the coupling between ammonia, methane, and sulfur in the early
atmosphere. Elemental sulfur vapor could have provided an effective screen
against solar near-UV radiation if the early earth was warmer than today. By
shielding ammonia and methane from photolysis, such a screen may have allowed
much higher concentrations of these gases to exist in the prebiotic atmosphere.
This, too, could have affected the origin of life. The third question concerns
the transition from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere. The photochemical
model will be used to simulate atmospheres containing low levels of O2 (about
10-10 to 10-5 times present) and to determine where the oxygen concentration
would have stabilized once photosynthesis had overwhelmed the supply of reduced
gases.
