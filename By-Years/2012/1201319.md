The current research pursues new directions for geometric representation theory
inspired by supersymmetric gauge theory. It also proposes new approaches to
Fukaya categories of Lagrangian branes with consequences for mirror symmetry.
Specific research includes a Fourier analysis of character varieties in terms of
character sheaves, a theory of character sheaves for loop groups via bundles on
elliptic curves, and new local and homotopical models for Lagrangian
intersection theory. The methods are primarily algebraic and topological, but
inspired by basic patterns found in harmonic analysis and microlocal analysis.
Potential applications range from Langlands dualities for the cohomology of
character varieties and categorical quantizations of bundles on elliptic curves
to a sheaf-theoretic reformulation of Fukaya categories without appeal to
holomorphic disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to further
interactions between mathematics and physics and to educate students in the new
tools of homotopical geometry. Its focus includes objects at the crossroads of
gauge theory, harmonic analysis, and the Langlands program. Activities include
further exposition of important but difficult topics such as quantum field
theory, as well as opportunities for students in diverse areas to interact with
established researchers. It is difficult to estimate the impact outside of
mathematics and physics, but the research has potential links to computational
topology and its applications to understanding large data sets through small
samples.
