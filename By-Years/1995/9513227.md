9513227 Platz This award supports the travel costs for Dr. Matthew Platz from
the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio State University to enable him to make a
three month stay conducting collaborative research with Prof. Curt Wentrup of
the Queensland University Department of Chemistry. Dr. Platz will use this
period to study dialkyl and cycloalkylcarbenes by the technique of matrix
isolation spectroscopy. The investigators will attempt to isolate simple
carbenes in cryogenic matrices and to characterize them through UV-Vis and IR
spectroscopy. This work will determine the ground state multiplicity of simple
carbenes. This projects draws together the complementary expertise of Prof.
Platz in the area of carbene reactivity, using laser flash photolysis,
fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy, with that of Prof. Wentrup in matrix
isolation.
