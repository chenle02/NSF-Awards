Endophyte Mediation of Tri-Trophic Interaction in Quercus gambelli&lt;br/&gt;PI
Name: William J. Boecklen&lt;br/&gt;Institution: New Mexico State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of endophytic fungi (fungi that
live within the leaves of plants) in mediating interactions between host plants,
insect herbivores, and the natural enemies of herbivores (predators and
parasitoids) is poorly understood in natural systems. The proposed research will
examine both direct and indirect effects of endophytic fungi on plant herbivore
interactions in a southwestern oak (Quercus gambelii) by using a combination of
field sampling, chemical analyses, and controlled field experiments. In
addition, the influence of environmental variation on the outcome of
antagonistic interactions between endophytic fungi and interactions between
endophytes and herbivores will be tested using field inoculations of fungal
species onto oak hosts. The proposed research will contribute to our
understanding of plant-herbivore interactions, and will help identify factors
that influence plant susceptibility to herbivore attack. By understanding how
herbivores respond to plants bearing endophytic fungi, results of this research
will provide important insights into developing new strains of pest-resistant
crop plants. In addition, the results of this research will provide background
data on the potential use of endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents against
insect herbivores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
