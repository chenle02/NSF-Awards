A Workshop on Computer Support for Policy Analysis and Design was supported by
this award. This is a topic that has been addressed in many journal and
conference papers, but never in a coordinated way: thus a paper on security
policy seldom deals with safety or high-speed response considerations, except as
a footnote or ending paragraph. The purpose of this workshop was to provide a
forum in which researchers in different fields could discuss their interests in
computer support for policy.
