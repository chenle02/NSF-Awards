The focus of this research is to probe the role of secondary metabolites in the
evolutionary success of the organisms that produce or acquire them. Metabolites
from opisthobranch molluscs will be studied to define their function as defense
compounds. Further, the possibility of the production of metabolites by
symbionts of selected marine invertabrates will be studied. The focus here will
be placed on the production of polychlorinated metabolites and alkaloids. %%%
With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. John D. Faulkner of the University of California, San Diego,
Scripps Institute. Professor Faulkner will focus his work on chemical studies of
marine invertebrates in an effort to discover new natural products and to
investigate their ecological and evolutionary roles.
