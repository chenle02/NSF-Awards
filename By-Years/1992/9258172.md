This research will develop mechanistic models to describe how inorganic matrix
composites will behave in high temperature environments. Three specific areas
are under study: effect of temperature change and mismatch in coefficients of
thermal expansion on composite creep, deformation mechanisms in composite
materials and composite processing.
