There has been an explosion of information in molecular, cellular, circuit and
systems neuroscience but little of that information has made significant inroads
into our understanding of cognitive function. This Gordon Research Conference on
the Neurobiology of Cognition should help bridge the gap, at the very least by
identifying the avenues for connection that have the most potential for near-
term traction and by linking scientist from disparate fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will take place in Newry, ME on July 20-25,
2014. The emphasis of the workshop is to facilitate in-depth discussion between
scientists working in divergent fields whose integration is essential to
understanding the neurobiology of cognition. NSF support will enable graduate
students and postdoctoral trainees to participate in this high-profile workshop
and will allow early stage investigators (non-tenured) to attend as speakers and
full participants.
