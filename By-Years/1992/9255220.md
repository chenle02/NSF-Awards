The purpose of this planning proposal is to investigate the feasibility of the
Sea Education Association (SEA) providing a preservice teacher preparation. The
SEA will link with institutions that have teacher preparation programs. This
pool of institutions have a long standing relationship with SEA in the area of
undergraduate science instruction. SEA, as the only institution offering
undergraduate programs combining the rigorous study of science with the
practical application of classroom work at sea, offers a distinctive educational
model. It is proposed that the experience gained in educating students in "real
life: science experiences aboard ship can be utilized in preparing teachers. The
staff will visit teacher preparation programs in order to assess just how to
integrate the existing program into a teacher preparation program.
