This project improves the cell and molecular biology curriculum by providing
equipment to (1) develop a hands-on, instrument-based course in Microscopy; (2)
improve the quality and effectiveness of laboratories in existing courses in
Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Immunology, and Biological Methods and
Instrumentation; and (3) add current technology in microscopy to the available
options in the department's undergraduate research program. The equipment
includes three high quality light microscopes equipped with optics and
accessories designed for multiple applications of brightfield, phase, polarizing
and epi-fluorescence, and a state-or-the-art image processing and analysis
system. These new microscopes (along with two existing transmission and x-ray
analytical scanning electron microscopes) will be interfaced by film and video
with the image processor. The integrated imaging system will be applied in
"bench-type" laboratory courses to real experimental situations. This
instrument-intensive approach allows students to gain the experience required to
operate modern equipment and the critical thinking and appreciation required to
design modern experiments. It is expected to produce graduates who are better
equipped for and more likely to undertake post-graduate studies. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
