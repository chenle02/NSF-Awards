The integration of statistical computing into the psychology curriculum is
providing substantial improvement in the quality of instruction in statistics
and methodology, and an increase in the quality and quantity of research being
conducted by the psychology majors. A microcomputer laboratory is being
established for statistical computing to be used predominately in three research
courses designed as part of a recent curricular revision. The activities are
increasing the student's understanding of science, and are contributing to the
preparation of scientists and policy-makers who have a more sophisticated
appreciation of the research process.
