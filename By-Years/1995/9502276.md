ABSTRACT CTS-9502276 A Combined research and educational program is proposed in
the area of colloid science and engineering. The main objectives are
understanding the role of electric field on material behavior, and determining
the rheology properties of non-Brownian suspensions. Modeling efforts are
designed to reveal controlling mechanisms, and make connections between the
underlying mechanisms, relevant physical properties and macroscopic behavior.
Experiments on well-characterized electrorheological fluids will be performed. A
variety of undergraduate and graduate student courses and activities are planned
in the area of particulate, multiphase flow and interfacial phenomena at the
University of Wisconsin. ***
