Creating and distributing software written in Python, in a secure manner, is
surprisingly difficult. And as many recent incidents demonstrate, the security
of this software chain is dramatically vulnerable. Right now, in nearly all
Python packaging and distribution tools, there are no mechanisms in place for
someone who downloads software to understand whether a malicious party has not
inserted or removed code, or if the code was even written by the right
developers! This work will for the first time capture metadata about the steps
of the Python software supply chain systematically. This project will carry
information between the steps of the chain in a way that an external party can
verify author signing and repository signing of packages. This project will also
be breaking ground for researchers and developers who want to improve how other
interpreted languages handle managing dependencies. The project's impacts are
particularly strong in academia, science, and industry, where Python is the most
widely used programming language; millions of users will be more protected
against a variety of attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project transitions two
security mechanisms -- backtracking dependency resolution and The Update
Framework (TUF) -- into practical use in the core Python infrastructure.
Backtracking dependency resolution ensures that users get understandable package
dependency installation, even in the face of attacks or missing metadata. TUF
ensures that even a compromise of the major package infrastructure will have
severely limited impact on clients. Together, the resolver and TUF work will
ensure that important research transitions into substantial security
improvements for all Python software, and will positively impact millions of
developers and many more users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
