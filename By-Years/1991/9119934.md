This award will be used to cover participation costs of selected attendees to
IAU Colloquium 135 entitled "Complementary Approaches to Double and Multiple
Star Research". The meeting will be held near Atlanta, Georgia, April 5-10,
1992. The theme of the Colloquium will be the combination of observational data
obtained from complementary techniques -- primarily from astrometry,
spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry -- to more fully ascertain the
physical and dynamical properties of binary and multiple star systems.
