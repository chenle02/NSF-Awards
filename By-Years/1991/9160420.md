Field Flow Fractionation (FFF) has been demonstrated as a high speed analytical
tool for separation and characterization of macromolecules, biopolymers, and
cell particles in the size range of 0.01 to 50 microns. Filtration is a widely
accepted technique for simple purification and is commonly practiced in many
analytical and biological research laboratories. Coupling these two bio-
compatible techniques in a two dimensional multi-channel design will
significantly increase the power, selectivity, separation speed, throughput, and
analytical information related to the analytes. Extension and commercialization
of this technology for preparative scale application offers a new bio-
compatible, rapid separation, characterization, and purification system for
meeting the needs in bio-polymer, cell, and subcellular research. Two
dimensional multi-channel design involves the use of membranes with decreasing
pore size in a stacked assembly. Purified fractions would be collected at the
outlet of each channel. This project focuses on membrane and multi-channel
detector technology, and the feasibility of commercialization of this multi-
channel universal biopolymer purification system.
