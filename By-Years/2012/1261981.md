In recent years, the University of Houston has established an excellent
reputation in the field of nanotechnology by developing and refining techniques
in the areas of nanofabrication, nanomagnetics, biosensors, nanocomposites,
nanoscale filtration, and self-assembly. To draw on this collective expertise
and experience, the 2013-2015 REU Site will be a themed "Innovations in
Nanotechnology" program. The 2013-2015 program will draw exclusively on the
strengths of the interdisciplinary nanotechnology research being conducted
across various departments of the Cullen College of Engineering, including
Chemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and
Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The research climate for
nanotechnology-related research in the Cullen College of Engineering is one of
innovation and interdisciplinary cooperation, and is fueled by nationally-funded
research programs supported by the National Science Foundation. Student
participants in the UH "Innovations in Nanotechnology" REU program will be
afforded the opportunity to conduct research under nationally recognized experts
in the field of nanotechnology. Students who are under-represented in the field
of engineering on the basis of their ethnicity or gender, as well as students
from Hispanic and African-American serving institutions will be recruited for
participation. The students who participate in our REU program are likely to
pursue graduate education to further their interests in research, enhancing the
diversity and number of research oriented technological leaders, and helping to
fill our nation's need to establish and maintain a diverse, technological
workforce. The REU Site at the University of Houston is supported by the
Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science
Foundation.
