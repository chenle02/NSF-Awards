9634570 Elgaaly Economical design of girders normally requires thin webs. The
use of corrugated webs is a possible way of achieving adequate out-of-plane
stiffness without recourse to using stiffeners. A report by the Principal
Investigator summarizing the results from a research project, to investigate the
behavior of beams with corrugated webs under static loading has been completed.
This project will investigate the behavior of girders with corrugated webs under
repeated loading. Preliminary results from very limited tests indicate that the
fatigue strength for the girders with corrugated webs can be higher than for
conventionally stiffened girders. This project will determine the behavior of
bridge girders with corrugated webs under repeated loading and establish the
fatigue strength for such girders. The optimum shape of the corrugation under
static loading may not be the optimum shape under repeated loading. ***
