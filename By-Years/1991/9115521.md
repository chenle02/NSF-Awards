This award, which is jointly funded with NASA, supports the systematic
measurement of the natural thermoluminescence levels in suitable Antarctic
meteorites. Since natural thermoluminescence is a function of radiation and
thermal history, its measurement enables partial assessment of questions
relating to the origin of the meteorites and how to choose significant
meteorites for detailed study. Some of the meteorites to be studied have
experienced minimal exposure to cosmic rays (those that are undersaturated with
26Al) and thus are extremely interesting. This project is designed to help
clarify natural thermoluminescence production systematics and to improve
interpretation of the results of geochemical analyses of meteorites.
