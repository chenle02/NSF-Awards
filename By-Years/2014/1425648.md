The objective of this research is to explore ultra-broadband on-chip light
trapping mechanisms for efficient photon/thermal management, energy harvesting
and enhanced heat-to-photon conversion. The promising applications enabled by
this work could have enormous long-term impact on our national energy,
environmental and sustainability needs. Integrating research with education is a
high priority in this interdisciplinary effort, which links nanotechnology,
computational electromagnetics, optoelectronics, electrical engineering, and
energy research. This program will deliver state-of-the-art nanophotonic
technologies to students, and instill in them the skills, values, and broad
perspectives necessary for success in the global market place, for leadership in
complex, multidisciplinary projects, and for a lifetime of continued learning.

The approach is to develop a patterned hyperbolic meta-film that can
efficiently absorb broadband electromagnetic waves. Large area multi-layered
metal-dielectric films will be investigated to develop a planar thin-film
absorber with tunable absorption profile from optical to thermal domain, which
will create new regimes of optical/thermal physics and applications. The
proposed large area patterned hyperbolic meta-film would represent a major
breakthrough in our understanding of absorption/emission engineering of slow-
light chips, and holds promise for developing novel applications for energy
conversion and thermal management devices. This very high-index effective medium
holds much more density of states than low-index media and therefore has greater
potential for efficient heat-to-photon conversion, which, unfortunately, is NOT
naturally available. Therefore, being able to create a high index metamaterial
will provide a technological foundation that will revolutionize a variety of
photonic/thermal applications.
