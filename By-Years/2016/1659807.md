This project sets up an REU site focused on software systems and analysis at
Texas State University. This REU site provides opportunities for a cohort of
undergraduate students to participate in research and development of innovative
software systems and analysis technologies that would have enormous public
benefits. The site emphasizes the participation of a diverse group of students,
in particular, women, minorities, first generation, and non-traditional
students. The project includes workshops, entrepreneurship forum, student
presentations and posters, field trips and other professional development
opportunities. The goal is to increase retention of computer science students,
instill in them the spirit of innovation, improve their career perspectives,
engage them to participate in cutting-edge research in software systems and
analysis, and motivate them to enter graduate computer science
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software affects nearly every aspect of our lives
and holds the key to many scientific and engineering challenges. As software is
increasingly pervasive nowadays, software-related problems have become much more
prevalent. This project will study new trends in software systems including
mobile software systems, green computing, internet of things, big data and
parallel systems while analyzing various software qualities such as reliability,
performance, usability, safety, maintainability, and energy efficiency.
