*** ABSTRACT 96-61235 O'Callaghan This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
I project aims to develop next generation analog and digital Ferroelectric
Liquid Crystal (FLC)-VLSI spatial light modulators (SLMs) which surpass the
speed of present generation SLMs by nearly an order of magnitude. In addition to
their commercial use as miniature displays current generation FLC-VLSI SLMs are
enabling long awaited, commercially viable, optical image processing systems
whose computing speed outstrips purely electronic processors. When used as part
of a computing subsystem the performance of present generation SLMs is enough to
tax the data bandwidth capabilities of inexpensive general purpose digital
computers. The intent of this Phase I effort is to greatly extend the
performance of analogized digital FLC-VLSI SLMs to match or surpass the data
throughput rates of current high performance digital systems. The plan is to
achieve this goal by drawing on and extending combined advances in both VLSI
design and FLC performance. The proposed high-speed SLMs can be used in
biometric applications such as fingerprint and face recognition, high-speed
image processing, volumetric 3-D displays, industrial machine vision, and
improved sequential color miniature displays. ***
