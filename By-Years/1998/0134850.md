Advances in science and technology give scholars and institutions new means of
undertaking research on historical figures and historical artifacts. Techniques
of bio-analysis commonly used in medicine and forensics, such as DNA testing or
biochemical assays, are now being applied to answer historical questions. Recent
proposals for bio-historical investigations of scientist Albert Einstein,
explorer Meriwether Lewis, and presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
and Abraham Lincoln have generated scientific, historical, ethical, and legal
controversies. The Institute for Science, Law, and Technology (ISLAT) at the
Illinois Institute of Technology and the Chicago Historical Society (CHS)
coordinate a collaborative investigation to develop ethical guidelines for the
emerging field of bio-historical research. The project fosters interdisciplinary
academic partnerships between specialists in bioethics, science, law, social
science, history, and museology. The researchers investigate the reasons bio-
analysis has been used, and might be used in the historical context, and the
scientific, legal, ethical and social concerns raised by bio-analysis. The
project examines pplicable existing guidelines for professional organizations of
historians, anthropologists, museum curators, survey researchers,
epidemiologists, pathologists, geneticists, forensic scientists, archeologists,
and sociologists. They also analyze ethical and legal precedents such as those
governing informed consent, privacy, respect for the dead, duties of museum
curators, access to information about historical figures, contracts between
donors and museums, and access to body tissue. Building on this research,
ethical guidelines for bio-historical analysis will be developed for use on
tissue samples (such as hair, blood, or bones) from figures of historical
interest. Such guidelines are useful to geneticists, chemists, forensic
scientists, and others who are requested to test such artifacts; and to
foundations, government agencies, and others asked to fund such analyses. The
draft guidelines will be posted on the Chicago Historical Society's Internet
site, submitted to professional organizations for written comments, and
presented at selected conferences for discussion. The principal investigators
will incorporate this comprehensive feedback in the final draft of the
guidelines that will be published in various academic and professional journals.
