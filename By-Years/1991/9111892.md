This research is to continue prior NSF supported research to address various
technical problems that impede progress toward software reuse. A comprehensive
approach to reuse has been developed, which permits people to write formal
specifications of reusable components, to certify their correctness using both
verification and testing, and to build particularly efficient implementations
for them. The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate the
practicality of a new generation of formally specified, certified, and efficient
reusable software components. Specifically, the researchers intend to design
understandable formal specifications for a representative sample of general-
purpose reusable software components; to show how to use these specifications to
verify and to test the correctness of both implementations of these modules and
their clients; and to apply several novel data structures and algorithms to
build efficient implementations of these components. Successful completion of
the project will include among its results (1) a catalog of formal
specifications of reusable software components having certifiably correct and
efficient implementations, and (2) a "handbook of design" containing explicit
guidelines for developing other reusable components in a similar way.
