This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Dr. Fultz, whose research
interests include electron microscopy, diffusion, and ordering kinetics in
metallic alloys. Computer simulation of atomic relaxation in nonequilibrium
metals, experimental Mossbauer spectroscopy, and x-ray analysis of rapidly-
solidified alloys are part of his research program. The emphasis is on the
kinetic paths that nonequilibrium metal alloys take as they progress towards
equilibrium.
