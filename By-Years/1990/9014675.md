Birkeland in 1908 was the first to introduce the famous terrella experiment
which simulated some of the features of the magnetosphere in a controlled
laboratory environment. Utilizing electron beams, this first terrella experiment
supported his auroral investigations. This grant is for terrella experiments of
the following studies: 1) global structures of the earth's magnetotail, 2) large
scale field-aligned polar currents, and 3) temporal variations of fields with an
emphasis on fluctuations. An intense spherical dipole field will be used as a
model earth. A high density cold plasma injected from inside the sphere will
surround the model earth, simulating the ionosphere. This model earth will then
be exposed to a moderate density magnetized plasma beam produced by a large
plasma gun, simulating the solar wind. To achieve the proposed objectives,
various computer-aided diagnostics for particles, fields, currents, and waves
will be used to obtain and analyze the comprehensive data.
