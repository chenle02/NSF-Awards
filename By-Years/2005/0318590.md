The aim of this investigation is to fashion a conceptual framework for
connecting magnetic flux emergence at the solar surface with the evolution of
the overlying solar atmosphere and the solar wind. This will be accomplished by
developing a physical theory, and thus a usable model based on this theory,
which describes the coupling between the emergence of magnetic flux on the sun
and the formation of the heliosphere. The critical premise of the effort is
magnetic reconnection between closed-field loops and open field lines. This
leads to (i) transport of magnetic flux, (ii) evolution of closed and open field
regions, (iii) non-thermal heating of the coronal plasma, and (iv) acceleration
and structuring of the solar wind. Each step in the chain will be examined and a
quantitative prediction made of the processes involved. These predictions will
be compared with observations and tested, thereby producing a conceptual, and
physically intuitive, paradigm for this complex system.
