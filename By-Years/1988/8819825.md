This research will investigate mechanisms of intraseasonal tropical wind
variability associated with the "40-50 day" or "Madden and Julian oscillation"
(MJO). The research is motivated by results suggesting that intraseasonal wind
variance, though coherent throughout the tropics, may be separated into two
dynamical regimes. Within a "convective regime" across the western near-
equatorial Pacific, wind anomalies on 40-50 day time scales seem to be directly
coupled to convection anomalies. At other longitudes (within a "dry regime"),
wind anomalies may be forced by seasonally-varying dynamical interactions with
the extratropical circulation. The objectives of the research are to examine
these two hypothesized mechanism, and the coupling among dry and convective
regimes and the extratropics, using time series analysis of observed data. It is
anticipated that the results will yield a global overview of intraseasonal
variability. In addition to the goal of elucidating the MJO, which represents a
significant fraction of the total variance of the tropical circulation, the work
would contribute more generally to better understanding of large-scale ocean-
atmosphere interactions in convective regions of the tropics, and atmospheric
tropical-extratropical interactions.
