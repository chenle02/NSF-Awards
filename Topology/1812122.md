A doughnut-shaped surface, perhaps with more than one hole - or none at all, can
be cut into triangles, and if we record how the cuts were done, we can put the
surface back together by gluing. Alternatively, we can create a dual surface,
where we make new triangles with a vertex for each of the original ones, and
sides corresponding to the touching data of the original triangles. Poincar√©'s
amazing theorem from 1895 tells us that the dual shape is deformable to the
original, regardless of the way cuts were done. Since its discovery, this
duality result has been improved on and generalized in many different areas of
mathematics. In homotopy theory one not only studies objects up to deformations,
but also keeps track of deformations between them as well as coherence data, all
in a streamlined way. Along with its recent augmentation into derived algebraic
geometry, homotopy theory has become a unifying ground for numerous mathematical
concepts, including duality.

The PI will work with her collaborators to explore two duality contexts in
which homotopical and arithmetic information are intertwined. One of those
involves establishing a homotopical extension of a classical result of Poitou
and Tate about duality in the cohomology of number fields, as well as
investigating the implications of such an extension to questions in arithmetic.
The other involves understanding duality for some of the basic objects in so-
called chromatic homotopy theory, whereby one organizes structural and
computational information in homotopy according to periodicity properties. This
would be a homotopical enhancement of a cohomological duality property of the
chromatic Galois groups known as Morava stabilizer groups, and is based on
seminal work of Gross and Hopkins. Both of these project goals may involve
further developing the foundations for profinite group actions on profinite
objects.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
