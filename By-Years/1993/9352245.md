This project integrates microcomputers into various aspects of our biology
curriculum. The main goal is to enhance and extend the hands-on experience of a
lab or field project by using microcomputers. Various tasks, including data
management and analysis, simulation and model experiments, are performed in the
laboratory or field. Versatile hardware is used with innovative educational
software (e.g., BioQUEST) and standard software applications (e.g., StatView).
In classrooms or labs, Duos with MiniDock attachments are also used in
conjunction with Liquid Crystal Displays on overheads to demonstrate software
applications and simulations.
