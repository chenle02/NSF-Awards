Through this project, the university is seeding its upper-division
undergraduate laboratory courses in physical and analytical chemistry with
selected interdisciplinary applications. Faculty expertise is being used to
develop new applications that demonstrate the role of chemical measurements in
addressing topical problems in biological chemistry, materials chemistry, and
environmental chemistry. Students enrolled in Instrumental Methods of Analysis
are using fluorescent probes of species in biological and environmental
matrices. In Physical Chemistry Laboratory I students are performing
calorimetric measurements on liquid crystalline materials of interest in
biological chemistry (synthetic biomembranes) and in materials chemistry (liquid
crystal display materials). In Physical Chemistry Laboratory II students are
using fluorescence methods to explore complex formation on chemical models of
active enzyme sites. By offering students the opportunity to perform
measurements on chemical systems that are in the broad public view and of direct
relevance to society, the university is motivating its diverse student
population. These experiments are providing opportunities for investigations on
more complex chemical systems than those typically studied in undergraduate
laboratory curricula. The department is purchasing two fluorescence
spectrophotometers, one fluorescence detector for the HPLC, and two differential
scanning calorimeters. This instrumentation is essential for developing and
implementing these new applications. The impact that these new applications have
on student motivation and chemical reasoning provides a rational guide to
furthering curricular development at colleges and universities.
