This proposal describes a possible method for transforming Drosophila embryos by
injecting them with defined oligonucleotides. If the nucleotide sequences
substitute for the normal gene, mutation will be produced. Putative mutations
will be confirmed by breeding tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
diagnoses. This is a high risk effort with a large payoff if successful. If it
works at a reasonable rate, the transformation of Drosophila will be greatly
simplified if not become routine.
