9319605 Fehn This project is a continuation of the Principal Investigator's work
on the determination of cosmogenic isotopes in fluids from the KTB deep drill
hole in Germany. Initial results suggest that 36 Cl/Cl ratios in waters
collected from the pilot hole and from the main borehole reflect the subsurface
production of these isotopes. The results can therefore be used for the
determination of residence times and source formations of these waters. The
Principal Investigator has made good progress with modest initial funding to
demonstrate the feasibility of using the chlorine isotope systematics to
determine the residence times and sources of deep fluids found in the KTB
boreholes. The results of this project should lead to a much better
understanding of fluid flow, origin, and residence time of deep crustal fluids.
