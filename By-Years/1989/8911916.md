This project by C. Foote and R. Lehrer of UCLA is within the Chemistry of Life
Processes Program, jointly supported by Organic Dynamics of the Chemistry
Division and Cell Biology of the Division of Cellular Biosciences. This work
deals with the role of white blood cells in the defense against infection.
Efforts will be made to learn the details about how oxygen is utilized during
this process. The active chlorinating species and other strong oxidants in the
antimicrobial action of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), eosinophils
and macrophages will be characterized by chemical means. A quantitative
trimethoxybenzene assay will be used for the production of hypochlorous acid,
and systems will be designed to trap other possible oxidizing species in defined
locations in both the interior and exterior of these cells. Reactions of HOCl
and other chlorinating agents will be studied to obtain chemical fingerprints
for various positive chlorine species "in vitro" and in cells. Although it is
likely that HOCl or a similar species is the major oxygen-dependent
antimicrobial species of the neutrophil (HOBR in the eosinophil), an unresolved
problem is the mechanism by which macrophages (which lack the MPO of PMNs) and
MPO-deficient PMNs kill organisms. This mechanism might involve singlet oxygen,
other active oxygen species, or something else. Singlet oxygen detection
methodology will be further refined, and technology will be developed for the
detection of other reactive species to attack this problem. Attempts to detect
singlet oxygen quantitatively in eosinophils and further improvements on the
halogen assay will be made. Chemical probes for singlet oxygen, halogens, and
other species which are covalently bonded to readily-phagocyzed polymer
microbeads should provide useful, localizable probes for the white-cell
phagocytic vacuole. This should allow an answer to the question of whether all
the oxidant is produced within the phagocytic vesicle or whether some escapes to
the media.
