9313158 Thorne In the basically collisionless magnetospheric environment, wave-
particle interactions replace the role of particle-particle collisions; they
provide an important and often dominant mechanism for pitch-angle scattering,
energy diffusion and anomalous crossfield transport. The proposed study will
consider such processes and consequently make important contributions to our
understanding of the origin of waves and the source and loss mechanisms for
energetic particles in the radiation belts. A principal objective of this
proposed investigation is to understand the origin of observed plasma waves and
their dynamical consequences on trapped particles in planetary magnetospheres.
Emphasis will be placed on terrestrial wave-particle interactions but
applications to related phenomena in other planetary magnetospheres will also be
considered. A combination of theoretical analyses and extensive numerical
computation will be employed to achieve these objectives. The path-integrated
growth and ultimate damping mechanisms for plasma waves will be studied in
realistic model plasma environments using a unique hot ray tracing code. The
mechanisms and conditions for significant wave gain will be established and the
effectiveness of energy transfer via the waves to other components of the plasma
will be determined. Since magnetospheric plasma usually contains a high energy
tail that can best be modeled with a Kappa rather than a Maxwellian
distribution, an investigation will be made of whether this feature
significantly modifies the growth or damping of waves and the stability
properties of the plasma. The long term variability of inner zone electrons will
be investigated and theoretical models will be developed for the rate of radial
diffusion and scattering loss. The effect of inner zone electron precipitation
on the global scale chemistry of the upper atmosphere will also be analyzed. ***
