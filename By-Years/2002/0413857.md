This award supports research by Professor Alan Balch at the University of
California at Davis concerned with the synthesis, structure, and
characterization of assemblies of fullerenes into larger molecules. Procedures
will be developed for the formation of nano-scale molecular materials that
contain two or more fullerenes connected by a variety of transition metal
complexes as bridging groups with donor groups (amine, phosphines) positioned
close to the fullerene surface. These assemblies will be examined by X-ray
crystallography, electrochemistry and their chemical reactivity will be
determined, particularly with regard to cage coupling reactions. These studies
will help to provide models for the types of metal binding sites that are
present in the redox-active films resulting from the reduction of fullerenes in
the presence of metal complexes such as Pd(acetate)2.

The endohedral fullerene aspects of research involve an active collaboration
with professor Harry Dorn at Virginia Tech. The broader impacts of this work
involve the education of undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students in
synthetic and structural supramolecular chemistry. As fullerenes and endohedral
fullerenes are likely to be produced in bulk quantities, they are under active
investigation for biomedical applications as MRI agents and as carriers of
radiopharmaceuticals, as well as electronic applications.
