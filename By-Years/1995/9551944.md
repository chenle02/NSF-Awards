The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60-MHz Hitachi Model R-1500 FT-NMR
to improve the undergraduate chemistry laboratory program by incorporating new
or enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance laboratory experiences within the
existing framework of the laboratory courses. The NMR spectrometer is suitable
for teaching, routine analysis, and senior research applications. Increasingly
complex laboratory utilization of the instrument is planned as the students
progress from introductory organic chemistry to instrumental analysis and
physical chemistry and finally to senior research applications. These laboratory
experiences complement and supplement the students' past laboratory experiences.
