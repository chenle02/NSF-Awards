With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Jonathan McMurry of Kennesaw State University will acquire a surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) optical biosensor. It will be used in research by eight faculty
members in studies of flagellar biosynthesis, enzyme catalysis, cellular
signaling and stress response. It will also be used to analyze newly synthesized
polymers for antifouling and antimicrobial properties, and in the development of
low-cost fiber optic capillary SPR sensors.

SPR biosensors are analytical tools used to study biomolecular interactions. An
SPR biosensor measures changes in refractive index of a solution close to a
surface. The changes can be caused by changes in concentration of an analyte
that occur on binding to a surface-bound ligand. Changes over time can reflect
association and dissociation and thus, affinity. This instrument will be used by
undergraduates in their research. Novel uses in a laboratory courses will also
be undertaken.
