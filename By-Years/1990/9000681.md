The goal of this project is to provide undergraduate students with meaningful
research experiences in order to encourage them to choose graduate careers in
computer science. American University will select 10 students for the summer of
1990 primarily from minority groups from the Washington, D.C. area. Student
activities will focus on the area of expert systems research. American
University has developed a Knowledge Engineer's Workbench, an expert system
prototyping environment. Students will use this workbench to design an expert
systems parts library, to experiment with algorithms for inferencing, to create
small knowledge bases, and to experiment with expert systems. They will be
assisted by five AU computer science faculty.
