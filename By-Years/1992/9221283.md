Professor Surko will study the interaction of low-energy positrons with a
variety of molecules in a Penning trap. Positron interaction with matter is not
very well explored and Professor Surko will examine the nature of recently-
discovered long-lived positron-molecule resonances and their dependence on
specific chemical structures in the molecules.
