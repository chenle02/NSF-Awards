9421380 Simons The region of the brain called the 'cerebral cortex' is involved
in cognitive functions such as learning, recognizing objects, and performing
skilled movements. It's function is determined, in part, by the way in which
billions of cortical nerve cells are interconnected. Some cortical cells are
organized into working clusters called 'columns'. This grant will allow a team
headed by Dr. Simons to study how cortical columns make computations about
information coming to the cortex from touch receptors. The analysis of the
columns will first involve physiological studies of electrical signaling among
cells within columns, and these results will be understood by constructing
mathematical models of the column circuitry. The results will be important for
understanding how the brain constructs flexible representations of the external
world. This is likely to advance our ability to design intelligent systems that
can perform some of the operations that are normally performed in the cerebral
cortex. ***
