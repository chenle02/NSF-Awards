Efficient Geometric Algorithms in Support of Virtual Reality Systems (ES
Postdoctoral Associate) This award supports CES associate Claudio Silva. The
goal of this project is to advance the state of the art in virtual environment
systems by making use of methods of the field of computational geometry and the
power of highly parallel computing architectures. New efficient algorithms are
being devised and implemented for critical geometric problems that arise in
virtual environments and three-dimensional simulations, including collision
detection, visibility/visualization, and mesh simplification. A prototype
software system is being written, incorporating new algorithms (sequential and
parallel), and a library of efficient code for geometric primitives. Special
attention is being given to robustness and efficiency issues of the algorithms
and implementations. The impact of the project will be to advance the state of
the art in virtual environment simulations, by increasing the complexity of the
models that can be handled in real time. ***
