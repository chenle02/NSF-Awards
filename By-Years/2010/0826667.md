The proposed planning visit will develop a collaborative research and education
partnership between U.S. and Spanish scientists to study sea-level changes in
the Western Mediterranean during Quaternary time. A team of four U.S.
researchers will take part in the planning visit, which include specialists in
isotope geochemistry, paleoclimatology, and Quaternary geology. The host for the
planning visit is Dr. Joan J. Fornos, a geomorphologist from the Universitat de
les Illes Balears (UiB) in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. Dr. Fornos will work with
the U.S. research team to identify field sites in Mallorca that will best
support a long-term collaborative research program that will involve scientists,
graduate students, and undergraduate students. Research outcomes will provide
insight into the relationship between the timing of major rises and falls of sea
level and abrupt climate events, as well as help educate the next generation of
Quaternary paleoclimatologists.
