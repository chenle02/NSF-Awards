9315074 Bradt In recent years numerous x-ray sources have been discovered from
satellite observations. To learn the nature of these objects it is generally
necessary to observe them in other parts of the spectrum, particularly in the
visible region. To this end, a long-standing program of optical studies of X-ray
sources will be continued under this grant. It will include identification of
x-ray sources discovered by ROSAT and HEO-1 satellites and determination of the
masses of black holes in previously identified sources.
