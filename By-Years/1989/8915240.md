This award will support a workshop on the applications of set-theoretic methods
to algebra. The workshop will be held from May 28 to June 1, 1990 at Baylor
University in Waco, TX. This workshop has two main purposes: (1) to provide the
audience with a working knowledge of set-theoretic axioms and a working
knowledge of infinite combinatorics used in the construction of algebraic
structures, and (2) to help the audience to become aware of recent progress in
this area and to learn to recognize situations where these methods are
applicable. This workshop is on the applications of axiomatic set theory, a
branch of formal logic, to algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and
modules.
