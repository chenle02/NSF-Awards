The Conference follows the four International conferences held earlier (Modena
1973, Denton 1977, Montpellier 1981 and Innsbruck 1985). It will focus on the
key experimental and theoretical physics as well as solid state electronics
issues relevant to non-equilibrium, hot carrier transport in semiconductors. It
will encompass such topics as ballistic transport, overshoot phenomena, quantum
transport in both electric and magnetic fields, novel differential resistance
device behavior, ultra-small, ultra-fast semiconductor devices and general
solid-state dynamical considerations relevant to hot carrier physics. This
conference is intended to provide a forum for intensive discussions on key
experimental and theoretical aspects of non- equilibrium and hot carrier
phenomena in semiconductors and semiconductor devices.
