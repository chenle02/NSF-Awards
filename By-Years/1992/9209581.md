The heat transfer behavior for a novel micro-configured heat sink for cooling
high flux micro-electronic components is proposed. The concept makes use of two-
phase cooling, with large numbers of small cavities (e.g. pyramidal re-entrant
cavities on the order of 10 >m and up to 420 cavities per cm2) etched directly
on the silicon wafer. Such cavities have been demonstrated to entrap vapor, and
hence acting as stable nucleation sites. Another advantage is that the heat sink
is integrated into the wafer itself, eliminating the additional resistance due
to heat sink to heat source bonding. Parameters which would minimize temperature
overshoot will be investigated, including shape, size and density of the etched
features. Their effect on fully developed nucleate boiling will also be
investigated.
