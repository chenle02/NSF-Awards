9627839 McDowell This grant provides $17,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring components to upgrade the Potassium-Argon geochronology laboratory in
the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas. Specifically,
turbomolecular pumps will be purchased to replace antiquated and potentially
hazardous mercury diffusion pumps used to maintain a vacuum within the sample
preparation lines and the physical components of the sample preparation line
will be rebuilt. This laboratory is presently 25 years old and these upgrades
will allow this lab to maintain a safe and viable future program of research
utilizing K/Ar geochronology as applied to studies of the magmatic history of
northwestern Mexico and the tectonic and magmatic history of Irian Jaya in
western New Guinea. ***
