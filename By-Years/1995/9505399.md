Phong DMS-9505399 Phong will investigate core problems on oscillatory and
singular integrals, Radon transforms, Green's functions, and analyticity of
generalized functions. He will study coalescent versuq uniform estimates for
oscillatory integrals, the singular integral equations for large N field
theories, and the problem of analytic continuation for divergent integrals on
the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. He will also investigate potential
connections with the cut-off phenomenon in probability theory, molecular
collisions in chemistry, string theory, and two-dimensional models of quark
confinement. The mathematics underlying this research is harmonic analysis,
which has as its origins the attempt to approximate an arbitrary function by a
linear combination of very regular, much in the way that a sound wave is
approximated by a sum of its pure tones.
