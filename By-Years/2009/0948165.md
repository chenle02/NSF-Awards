0948165&lt;br/&gt;Thompson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a request
from Spelman College to conduct a 1.5 day regional technical assistance and
information conference/workshop for Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to
broaden their participation in the Division of Research on Learning in Formal
and informal Settings (DRL) programs. Spelman College will invite accredited
minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to participate in the workshop/conference
who have not submitted proposals and/or have been unsuccessful in DRL proposal
competition. The workshop will consist of approximately fifty 2-person faculty
institutional teams consisting of a faculty member from an education specialty
relevant to DRL programmatic activities, and a faculty member in a science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field supported by the National
Science Foundation in order to develop their research or program ideas and to
become more skillful in the preparation and development of competitive
proposals.&lt;br/&gt;
