This three-year R&amp;D project aims at increasing access of learning disability
(LD) students to high-quality science learning and instruction by developing and
implementing curriculum materials for students and teachers; and researching
their effectiveness with 6th -8th grade students (N=380) with executive function
limitations (EFL). This condition is associated with verbal learning
disabilities, which can negatively influence higher order thinking and the
productivity of students able to reason conceptually. These students attend
inclusive classrooms with 76 teachers in 27 middle schools in Massachusetts,
Maine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. The material development component of the
project consists of student unit enhancements, and teacher guides focused on
higher order scientific reasoning for two units of the Full Option Science
System (FOSS) program (i.e., Diversity of Life and Earth History). The research
component of the project comprises a quasi-experimental design that allows
comparison of EFL students? achievement in 76 intervention classrooms (with
enhancements) and 76 classrooms (without enhancements) for each of the two
selected FOSS units. Participating students will not be randomly assigned.
