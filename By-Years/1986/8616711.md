Amphipods are crustaceans that have evolved a variety of feeding behavior. An
analysis of caprellid amphipods is proposed to explore the relationships between
body parts involved in feeding and digestion, and the feeding behavior of the
animal. Data would come from two sources: videotaping appendage motion during
filtering, scraping, scavenging and predation, and morphologic analysis of whole
body, appendages and foregut with light and scanning microscopy. Data would be
collected and analyzed using a microcomputer-based image analysis system. The
proposed research would increase our understanding of crustacean biology and of
how morphology and behavior are related in evolution. The research plan will
serve as a model for the use of computer-based image analysis in functional
morphology research, and will greatly enhance the undergraduate experience of
two students working with Dr. Caine.
