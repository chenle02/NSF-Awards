9514369 Luine Communication between cells in the brain requires the secretion of
a chemical from one cell which then acts on another cell, that is frequently
adjacent to it. One of the chemical messenger molecules of the brain is
serotonin. If enough cells in the brain release the same neurotransmitter in the
same area at the same time, the behavior of the organism may be changed. Dr.
Luine is involved in elucidating whether serotonin or another chemical mediator,
gamma-aminobutyric acid, is responsible for mediating hormone-dependent
behavioral changes. The change in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels after hormonal
treatment or under natural conditions are being assessed, as are modifications
in gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, and the enzymes responsible for producing
this chemical in the brain. Investigating the physical connections between
serotonin- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing neurons is underway. These
studies will allow Dr. Luine to establish the complex interplay between brain
messenger molecules required to formulate a behavioral response. Moreover, these
investigations will provide a useful model for understanding how serotonin and
gamma-aminobutyric acid interact throughout the brain. All vertebrate species
sleep, eat, and behave and these results will be pertenient to the generation of
behaviors in animals in their natural habitats.
