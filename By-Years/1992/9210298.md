In all aspects of negotiation and conflict among individuals and among groups,
there are fundamental theoretical questions concerning biases in human judgment
and decision-making. This project examines the role of social perception in the
development, maintenance and revision of judgment error in interpersonal
conflicts. The first line of investigation examines basic social perception
processes in negotiation and factors that may reduce biases in social
perception. These studies focus on whether judgment error in negotiation is
primarily due to biases in the reception of information or faulty communication
or information exchange. The dynamic effect of the two processes is also
explored in an investigation of behavioral confirmation in negotiation. This
investigation examines how perceivers' expectancies influence their behavior
toward their opponent and may elicit expectancy-confirming behavior from the
opponent. The second line of research investigates social categorization
processes and negotiation. These studies examine whether negotiations with
members of one's own social group are more or less productive than negotiations
conducted with members of an outside group. In addition, these studies examine
how the quality of negotiated agreements conducted with out-group members is
affected by the degree to which one's performance affects the welfare of his or
her group. These studies have important practical implications for enhancing the
quality of interpersonal negotiations and intergroup relations.
