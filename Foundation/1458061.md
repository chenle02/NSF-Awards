In the proposed project, Cai plans to study classical recursion theory with
emphasis on some interesting long-standing questions. In addition, he hopes to
introduce new ideas and concepts to enrich the field, as well as to investigate
some recent new results for different approaches and potential improvements. Cai
also aims to expand the scope to applications of recursion theory, in particular
he will continue the study of the degrees of provability, where proof-theoretic
results can be proved using recursion-theoretic methods such as diagonalization
and the recursion theorem.

Recursion theory is a field of logic addressing effective content of
mathematical practices (e.g., which of the mathematical procedures can be
performed by automated machines, or computers). It has classical applications
explaining why some mathematical problems (e.g., Hilbert's Tenth Problem) are
theoretically unsolvable. The proposed project aims to improve the understanding
of recursion theory by investigating old and new open problems, as well as to
expand it by building connections to other fields such as proof theory. The
proposed project has potential applications explaining how certain arithmetical
facts could be theoretically unprovable.
