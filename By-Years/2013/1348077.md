Bro is an open source network security monitor (NSM) utilized by many NSF
communities nationwide to protect their cyberinfrastructure. This project
establishes a Bro Center of Expertise as a central point of contact for these
communities to leverage Bro technology and expertise expertise. The activity
reaches out to smaller NSF projects and communities helping them to use Bro in
the most cost-effective and sustainable way to protect their
infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity promotes Bro as a
comprehensive, low-cost security capability for these communities; providing
guidance and support on all aspects of a Bro installation. The project devises
reference scenarios for deployment and integration; and develops novel technical
capabilities that cater to NSF environments. The project supports existing Bro
users in optimizing and extending their setups, and makes Bro's capabilities
available to new sites and projects that lack the resources to deploy Bro
effectively on their own. At a technical level, the project is the focal point
of Bro's open-source development, maintaining its code base and documentation.
To the research community, the project acts as a facilitator for transitioning
networking research results into practice by leveraging Bro as a deployment
platform.
