This proposal is for a Research Planning Grant through the Research
Opportunities for Women program. Dr. D'Avanzo proposes to study the process by
which dissolved organic material from decomposing estuarine plants is
reaggregated into organic particles and then utilized in the food webs of
estuaries by fishes, worms and other detritus-eating animals. Dr. D'Avanzo has
done some preliminary work on this area of marine ecology in collaboration with
scientists at the Boston University Marine Program (Woods Hole) and she will be
developing an expanded research proposal to continue these studies. She is
presently a professor at a small, primarily undergraduate institution -
Hampshire College, therefore this award should facilitate both the participation
of this young woman in oceanographic research and better undergraduate training
in this field.
