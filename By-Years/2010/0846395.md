The first goal of the proposed project is to investigate expression-targeted
gene delivery and derive a model to predict its effectiveness in a variety of
situations. This model will provide a better understanding of the technology,
which will enable the applicant to rationally design gene therapy constructs
that will be of high value to cancer research. The project will then focus upon
preliminary applications of expression-targeting. The concept of expression-
targeted gene therapy was an incremental advance for transitional cell carcinoma
gene therapy, for which the principal investigator has been a leader (patent
20050187177, pending). This transformative concept will be investigated further
with the goal of creating a method for cancer screening as well as a potential
treatment for transitional cell carcinomas. In a third application of the
technology, cells will be engineered to utilize novel signaling cascades.
Ancillary benefits of this cellular engineering objective will be the
elucidation of basic biologic principles.

The model mentioned above will lead to transfection procedures for which the
levels of transgene expression can be controlled. This control will offer a
level of variability that will be managed by physiological circumstances within
the body. This integration of engineering and life science would advance
fundamental knowledge and have a significant impact upon the biomedicine
industry. The PI integrates research and teaching and is involved in several
outreach programs, including giving K-12 scientific demonstrations to diverse
student bodies. A program will be developed to promote community involvement for
undergraduate students.
