This research project focuses broadly on the area of combinatorics, and the
questions under consideration are characterized by their connections to several
different fields of mathematics. One of the main aims of this project is to
explore these connections, and to synthesize techniques from different areas and
bring them to bear on some longstanding open problems. Much of the planned work
is concerned with the properties of large discrete structures, and the questions
of interest in this project are relevant to the study of disordered systems that
may be modeled by such structures, such as collections of interacting particles,
large networks like the internet, or the human brain.

There are two primary areas under investigation, namely extremal combinatorics
and Ramsey theory. The project will investigate questions in extremal
combinatorics that involve additional structure, with a focus on algebraic,
number-theoretic, and topological structure. The project will also address
questions of a Ramsey-theoretic nature that additionally have additive-
combinatorial, algebraic, and ergodic-theoretic connections. Finally, the
project will pursue various connections between problems in these areas.
Specific questions to be attacked include a topological Dirac-type theorem for
hypergraphs, investigating product-free sets living inside free structures,
improving bounds for a few Ramsey-theoretic results of an additive-combinatorial
flavor, and investigating the Ramsey-theoretic properties of non-abelian groups.
