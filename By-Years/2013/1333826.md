The PIs plan to establish the effects of climate change on terrestrial organic
carbon (OC) dynamics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra/Bengal Fan system since the Last
Glacial Maximum. Sub-millennial resolution records of sediment and OC burial in
the Bengal Fan will be developed using inorganic proxies of sediment composition
and delivery and paired stable isotope/radiocarbon measurements. These records
will enable reconstructions of variations in monsoon strength, paleo-vegetation,
and OC residence time, providing insight into the relationships between climate
change, geomorphic response, vascular plant biomarkers, and terrestrial OC
dynamics in the Bengal Fan. The proposed work will support two early-career
scientists, and will train two undergraduate students from underrepresented
minority groups. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties
through data sharing and synthesis efforts with Swiss and German researchers.
