This study deals with fundamental research in buoyant convection. The objective
is to investigate the mechanics of heat and mass transfer in plumes in turbulent
flow. The laser Doppler technique will be employed to examine plume
characteristics such as velocity and shear stress distributions at different
elevations. This technique has been acquired as a result of a recent study at
one of the world's leading institutions for experimental heat and mass transfer
research.
