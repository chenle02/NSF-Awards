This project is part of an ongoing study of the function of the large material
donation or spermatophore transferred by male monarch butterflies (Danaus
plexippus) during mating. Because there will often be a tradeoff between
investment in present and future matings, investment by males in more resources
than are necessary to ensure fertilization in a single mating is of theoretical
interest. Two possible, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are the focus of
the project. These are that the spermatophore provides nutrients to be used by
the female in offspring production (paternal investment), or that it delays
remating by the female, increasing the time during which the donating male's
sperm are used to fertilize eggs (mating effort). Studies of sperm competition
and mating frequencies of wild butterflies will allow estimation of the portion
of a male's investment that is available to his own offspring, and relative
fitness gains from the nutrient and delayed remating effects of
spermatophores.***//
