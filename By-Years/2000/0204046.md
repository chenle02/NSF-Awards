Rapidly increasing performance requirements of applications have spurred the
next generation of complex, dynamic, heterogeneous, parallel/distributed
computing system architectures. The emerging computational grid, tightly-coupled
petaflop grids-in-a-box (GiBs), distributed sensor networks, System-on-Chip
(SoC) and polymorphous computing (PCA) architectures are examples of such
systems. To exploit the full potential of this new computing architecture,
applications, as they execute, must be able to adapt to the continuously
changing system. &lt;br/&gt;Although some support for adaptive application
development is available in the form of programming languages and runtime
systems, there is a lack of high level system abstractions that model the
dynamic behavior and runtime adaptivity.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
address fundamental issues in modeling these dynamic, complex architectures and
the design and evaluation of adaptive algorithms for such architectures. The
focus of the proposed research will be on creating a formal framework to reason
about adaptivity at an abstract level.&lt;br/&gt;A direct educational impact of
the proposed activity will be the introduction of new curriculum in academia, to
impart knowledge on algorithm design aspects for dynamic system architectures.
This will include initiating new course-work along with traditional courses
offered on analysis of algorithms and architectures. One of the broader impacts
we foresee is the preparation of future Grid/GiBs/SoC/PCA application
developers.&lt;br/&gt;
