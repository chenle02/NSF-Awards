This project consists of several problems in the theory of automorphic forms
and L-functions. The first problem concerns extending the Weil-Siegel formula
and applying this extension. The second concerns the application of the theory
of seesaw dual pairs to study arithmetic properties of certain automorphic
forms. Research will also be done on the structure of Clifford algebras, as well
as, the cohomology classes associated to certain geodesic cycles. This research
is in the general area of number theory. It is concerned with various aspects of
representation theory in its application to automorphic forms and number theory.
The principal investigator has in the past evolved some penetrating results in
the area of automorphic functions on bounded domains. New and exciting
developments in the areas considered in this project are anticipated.
