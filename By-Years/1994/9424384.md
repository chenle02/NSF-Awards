In this Research Planning Grant (RPG) proposal, the PI will evaluate various
approaches to instruction level parallelism in modern architectures. More
specifically, the project will investigate variations to existing register
allocation approaches to optimize the performance of loops. The project will
also evaluate register allocation approaches with software pipelining.
