While data analytics for business and entertainment have become well
established, the application of data analytics to education needs research and
development. Educational innovation does not have the driving force of economics
generating evolutionary responses to societal and technological change, yet
data-informed instructional methods offer tremendous promise for transforming
American teaching, learning, and schooling. Beyond the potential to enhance
student outcomes through just-in-time, diagnostic data that is formative for
learning and instruction, educational improvements could be substantially
accelerated through data-intensive research fostering rapid cycles of
innovation. This award is for a workshop bringing together education researchers
from industry, non-profits, academe, and government to address issues in data
intensive research ranging from learning analytics to ethics and
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, the second in a series of two, will
focus on applying heuristics from the sciences and engineering to articulate in
education the conditions for success and models for effective partnerships in
data intensive research. Following the workshop, the results will be published
in a formal volume based on the workshop outcomes.
