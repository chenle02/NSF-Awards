The Department of Chemistry and Physics purchasing of a 300 MHz Fourier
Transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. The applications of NMR is
being integrated throughout the curriculum with increasingly sophisticated
techniques as the student progresses through the program's course sequence.
Beginning with exposure to C-13 NMR in general chemistry the experience builds
to investigation of temperature dependent fluxional behavior of organometallics
and 2-dimensional techniques in biochemistry and advanced organic chemistry. The
instrument is also enhancing an active undergraduate research program.
