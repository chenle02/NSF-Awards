The Department of Geology is purchasing computing equipment for use in its
General Geology course -- a course offered to non- science majors under the
university's general education curriculum. The required General Geology lab
focuses on recording observations and using information from lecture to
interpret those observations. Conventional experiments are enhanced through the
use of hypermedia applications that combine text, graphics, animation, and
video. Exercises integrate lecture and lab in a self-paced format that allows
students to test their level of understanding, identify misconceptions, and seek
background information as needed. These include applications ranging from the
verification of appropriate tests in identifying unknown rocks and minerals, to
the visualization of geologic formations and the analysis of earthquake data.
