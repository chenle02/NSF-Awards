Consider a function whose arguments are distributed among several parties,
making it impossible for any one party to compute it in isolation. Communication
complexity theory studies how many bits of communication are needed to evaluate
the function. Pioneered by Andrew Yao over thirty years ago, communication
complexity has become a central research area in theoretical computer science.
First of all, studying communication as a limited resource has a strong
practical motivation. Moreover, open problems in many other computational models
reduce to questions about communication. To date, communication complexity
theory has impacted almost every subject in theoretical computer science, from
classical models such as Turing machines and circuits to more recent topics such
as data structures, learning theory, and quantum computing.

This award takes aim at studying three longstanding open questions in
communication complexity theory: (i) the limits of multiparty communication;
(ii) the limits of communication with alternating existential and universal
quantifiers; (iii) the conjectured equivalence of the combinatorial and matrix-
theoretic views of communication. A resolution of these questions would have
major consequences in theoretical computer science beyond communication,
including lower bounds for ACC circuits and neural networks, efficient learning
of DNF formulas, and an equivalence of quantum and classical communication.

Progress on the proposed problems will exploit insights from, and contribute new
ideas to, other disciplines such as machine learning and matrix theory. This
award provides an ample source of research problems at various levels of
difficulty and will be used in advising students and teaching new graduate and
undergraduate courses. As an integral part of the award, the PI will promote
theory research in the Los Angeles area and take an active part in scientific
dissemination.
