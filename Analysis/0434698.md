The project suggests investigations in the area of Harmonic Analysis and
Nonlinear Hamiltonian Equations. One direction of the research in the analysis
of singular integral operators. Current interests include Lebesgue space
estimates on Fourier integral operators associated to singular and nonsingular
canonical relations. Such estimates provide important tools for the analysis of
properties of solutions to nonlinear Hamiltonian systems: global existence,
smoothness, and stability. The other direction of the research concerns specific
properties of solitary wave solutions to nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Such
soliton-like solutions were proved to exist in many different contexts. If the
equation is invariant under the action of some Lie group, then the solitary
waves may possess stability properties. The program of research focuses on the
stability of solitary waves with minimal energy, which are expected to be of
particular importance for applications.

When the amplitude of the waves increases, their interaction with the medium
becomes important. This interaction may seriously change the behavior of the
waves and lead to the appearance of nonlinear solitary waves, or solitons. Such
nonlinear waves describe central phenomena in fiber optics, plasma physics,
theory of superconductivity, theory of elementary particles, meteorology, and
oceanology. Detailed knowledge of properties of such waves, and in particular
their stability or instability, will allow to predict the chances of sudden
weather changes, develop optical waveguides, and describe quantum effects on the
scales being inexorably approached by today's electronics and chip
manufacturers, let alone the Experimental Physics. Natural phenomena pose new
challenges to the intricately related fields, Harmonic Analysis and the Theory
of Nonlinear Equations, and stimulate further refinement of the tools of modern
Mathematics.
