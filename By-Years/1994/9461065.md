One critically needed improvement in mass spectrometry is increased ion detector
dynamic range. Mass spectrometry is the most widely used analytical technique to
analyze the chemical and structural properties molecules and compounds, with
many applications in chemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science. The
innovation NOVA Scientific, Inc. proposes will improve by several orders of
magnitude the upper count rate limit in commercially available microchannel
plate (MCP) ion detectors, widely used in mass spectrometry as well as other
applications. The substantial reduction in MCP detector gain or efficiency which
usually occurs from deadtime losses at high output count rates, will no longer
occur. They will refine and commercialize a novel heat sinking approach using
extremely low resistance MCPs; in earlier proof-of-concept experiments this
approach resulted in count rates of 1010 to 1011 cm-2s-1, compared with 106 to
108 cm-2s-1 for conventional MCP detectors. This radical departure in MCP
operation and mounting configuration will, if successful, have a significant
impact in mass spectrometry; in particular, it will allow faster and more
efficient chemical analysis. It will also impact many other commercial and
scientific applications. In parallel, they will assess novel MCP single anode as
well as imaging readouts which are compatible with this approach.
