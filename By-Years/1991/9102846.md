The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will upgrade the nine year-old mass
spectrometer serving a number of investigators in its Geology &amp; Geophysics
Department. The existing VG Micromass 602E requires a new source and is no
longer serviced by the manufacturer. The upgrade will involve converting the
machine to a triple collector with a new high sensitivity source, including new
magnets and flight tube. New micro inlet valves will also be developed and
installed. A forty-sample carousel system will be implemented using pneumatic
valves and proven control and data acquisition software. The upgrade will have
several benefits beyond more reliable operation. Automation will enhance
productivity and sample throughput over present manual operation, and will
reduce operating errors. Higher sensitivity and a smaller inlet volume will also
allow analysis of smaller sized samples. Over the years, the present machine has
been in continuous operation in support of numerous NSF-sponsored oceanographic,
earth, and atmospheric studies. This pattern of heavy use is expected to
continue.
