This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) grant provides funding to establish a
methodology for the massively parallel and high throughput manufacture of
nanoscale electronic circuit elements. First, rationally designed molecular
building blocks will be synthesized and assemble them in predetermined
arrangements on DNA-like templates, forming organic semiconductor nanowires.
Commercially validated techniques, such as nanoimprint lithography, will be used
to prepare molecular bread boards. Subsequently, the templating and self-
assembly properties of DNA to form arrays of nanowires at these bread boards
will be leveraged. As part of this effort, industrial and academic collaborators
will partner to establish a nanoscale manufacturing summer school for training
students and researchers in the techniques that we
develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The semiconductor industry produces electronic
devices that drive not only most modern technologies but also the global
economy. Due to the limitations of traditional lithographic manufacturing
techniques, this industry has identified a crucial need for the scalable
nanomanufacturing of futuristic nanoscale electronics. Although researchers have
demonstrated remarkable examples of isolated molecular electronic devices, the
scalable production of such devices remains at a standstill because their active
components cannot be assembled with arbitrary precision or in high yield.
Through an interdisciplinary combination of organic chemistry, biological self-
assembly, and top-down nanofabrication, organic nanowires will be prepared with
rationally designed electrical properties and assemble arrays of such constructs
at solid substrates. This approach will enable the fabrication of the next
generation of nanoscale integrated circuit elements in reproducible fashion and
at low cost.
