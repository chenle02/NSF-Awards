Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and the defining organelle of green
plants. They have the essential role of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide,
which is ultimately the source of food and feed stocks. They are also involved
in the synthesis of many nutrients and specialized chemicals useful to humans,
as well as playing a role in sensing changes in the environment. Most of the
functions of chloroplasts (and other plastids) are carried out by proteins
encoded in the nucleus, the products of the Plastid-targeted Nuclear Genes
(PNGs). This project, through an integration of computational and experimental
approaches, will provide a mechanistic understanding of how PNGs are regulated
transcriptionally in the model plant Arabidopsis, identify what the putative
roles of the PNGs are, and define how various chloroplast functions are
connected. Functions of PNGs implicated in amino acid metabolic networks will be
experimentally verified. These studies will lead to a better understanding of
plastid biology and will also broadly inform systems approaches to
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to enhancing our
understanding of regulatory and metabolic networks in plastid function, this
project will continue to make use of and disseminate the findings through a
publicly available phenotype database (www.plastid.msu.edu ) that is of value to
the scientific community in many contexts, including research and development
for genetically-engineered crop plants. In addition to providing
interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the
project will integrate research and education as part of a successful summer
internship program (www.plantgenomics.msu.edu). Junior and senior undergraduate
students will work in participating laboratories each summer performing research
related to the project. This program will have a strong emphasis on the
recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and women.
