9409963 Chen The award is for research to understand and model the fundamental
physical mechanisms which govern the deformation behavior of 2D and 3D textile
woven fabrics used as preforms in composite manufacturing. Model experiments
will be conducted to quantify local unit cell behavior under a variety of
constraint conditions and to determine critical strain conditions for fiber
buckling for various weave patterns. Results from those experiments will be
incorporated into a unit cell model that can be used to predict quality of
conformance to complex part shapes. The research is directed toward the
establishment of scientific design guidelines for more efficient use of textile
preforms. Insights gained from the research are likely to lead to the
development of new, innovative, and robust methods for high volume manufacturing
of composite parts.
