ABSTRACT 0204113 Gene Cooperman Notrheastern U

The proposed research is part of an ongoing project to provide the software
infrastructure for large symbolic computations. It is proposed to employ the
rich set of computational group theory algorithms, with which the P.I. is
intimately familiar, as a testbed for analyzing the barriers to wider use of
parallelism. In addition to the algorithmic difficulties of irregular
computations that characterize much of symbolic computation, there are barriers
based on limitations of RAM in today's hardware. These hardware barriers are
demonstrably real. A random access to RAM can cost more than 1,000 CPU cycles on
the most recent architectures. This affects symbolic algebra computations to a
much greater extent than traditional numerical or commercial applications, which
emphasize sequential access to RAM. Even some non-parallel applications in
symbolic algebra are shown to be primarily memory-bound (bound by slowness of
RAM), rather than CPU-bound, on current architectures. This requires a revised,
non-uniform complexity model of RAM.
