The research will improve measurement science by developing new statistical
calibration methodology for precision instruments. Calibration with errors in
the standards will be examined through the errors-in-variables regression
problem. Multivariate calibration problems in analytical chemistry will be
studied through statistical models. New data analytic alternatives to hypothesis
testing will be provided by combining parametric and nonparametric aspects in
one model. This semiparametric approach will be used to estimate the percentage
of contamination in a sample and provide asymptotic distributions.
