Microlithography Chemical Company plans to conduct a synthetic research program
to explore a new synthetic and manufacturing approach for the development of
advanced novolak resins for microelectronic, printed circuit board, and LCD
applications. More precisely, an evaluation of scientifically designed novolak
resins with superior properties and reproducibility, specifically applicable for
use in positive photoresists will be undertaken. These resins would be designed
based on recently published work on the hydrogen bonding interactions between
novolaks and photosensitive components of the resist. They would also be
designed to give higher dissolution rates, improved thermal stability, better
batch-to-batch reproducibility, and very low metal ion contamination. We plan to
undertake an experimental program and develop a new synthetic approach, prepare
discrete low MW oligomeric components, and to convert these oligomers into a
series of block copolymer resins to be evaluated for relevant performance. MCC
will carry out a program which could lead to the development of solid novolak
resins with less than 100 ppb metal ion and > 10% batch-to-batch
reproducibility, and which are capable of providing resists with better than 0.5
>m resolution, approximately 100 mJ/cm2 threshold energy, and at least 130>C
thermal stability.
