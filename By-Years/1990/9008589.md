Dr. Linda J. Magid is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the aggregation of surface active agents in water and
hydrocarbons by a variety of experimental techniques. These kinds of studies may
allow for the design of an entirely new family of detergents and, in addition,
may allow us to learn more about the structure of cleansing agents. The main
goals of the investigation are: (1) an assessment of the extent to which
elongated micellar structures in solution behave as polymers, given the dynamics
of micelle formation and breakdown; (2) the dependence of the interfacial film
fluctuations on surfactant (and aggregate) structure; (3) the development of
techniques which enable differentiation between droplet and so-called
biocontinuous morphologies of aggregation.
