This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Keith Pannell of the University
of Texas at El Paso in a research collaboration with Professor Jorge Cervantes
of the Universidad de Guanajuato, Mexico. The objective of the collaboration is
to synthesize new transition metal complexes containing Si-Sn and Ge-Sn bonds
directly bonded to the metal atom, and study their photochemistry, reactivity
toward base, structures and mass spectrometric properties. The researchers also
propose to synthesize a series of metal substituted oligosilyl-siloxanes for
study of redox and conductivity properties, and incorporation into polymeric
siloxane materials. The synthesis of metal complexes, and photochemical, and
structural aspects of the collaborative work will be performed in El Paso, while
base-induced migrations, oligosilyl- siloxane precursor synthesis, and mass
spectral simulations will be performed in Guanajuato.
