The principal investigator will study fine-grained magmatic inclusions in the
plutonic rocks of Cadillac Mountain (Mount Desert Island, Maine) and the
Tumacacori Mountains (southern Arizona). She will attempt to document the
variety of contamination mechanisms and the effects of contamination of the host
materials by these inclusions, and also to evaluate the magmatic processes which
generated the original liquids. The results will help geologists better
understand processes that affect the evolution of magmas in the Earth's
lithosphere.
