The existing saddle-point complex-rotation method will be extended to include
relativistic effects, such as spin-orbit and spin-spin perturbations. This will
permit prediction of spin- induced coupling and spin-induced autoionization,
hopefully removing existing discrepancies between theory and experiment. The
saddle-point method will also be investigated for systems with more complex
vacancy structures, and it will be extended from three electron systems to four
electron atomic systems. The basic idea of the method is to build vacancy
orbitals with parameters directly into the total wave function. The energy of a
multiply excited atomic state appears as a saddle-point in a variational
calculation. Only square integrable basis functions are used. The most
distinctive advantage of the technique is gained in cases where the system is to
highly excited that there are an infinite number of open channels.
