ABSTRACT -- III-9360771 PI: SUDARSHAN In this Phase I program, MMI proposes a
significant innovation in the diamond coating of powders. Using fluidized bed
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technology, diamond coated powders can be
pressed into sheets or shaped parts. Phase I will concentrate on production of
the diamond coated powders, compaction and measurement of the properties while
Phase II will be devoted to scaling up the reactor dimensions, formation of
shapes using the coated diamond powders and subsequent characterization. Rapid
transition to Phase III is expected as commercial partners for testing of
different products during the Phase II effort have already been identified.
