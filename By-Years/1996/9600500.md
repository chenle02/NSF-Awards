9600500 Trautmann The 1996 Nuclear Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will
provide an international community of nuclear scientists with a forum for the
exhibition of the newest development at the forefront on nuclear reactions
initiated by heavy-ion beams. The discussions will emphasize reaction mechanisms
including low- energy fusion, incomplete fusion, deep-inelastic reactions,
multifragmentation, the formation and decay of hot and/or compressed hadronic
matter, and particle production in relativistic and ultra-relativistic nuclear
collisions. ***
