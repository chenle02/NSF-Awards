This award supports the conduct of an Early Faculty CAREER proposal writing
workshop. The workshop will be held at George Mason University, Arlington,
Virginia, March 12-13, 2009. It is expected that there will be about 150
attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a
training session on good proposal writing practices, testimony from previous
CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review and a review session during
which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on their draft proposal
summaries. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF
Program Directors both one-on-one and in the mock panel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for
careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing
and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results
of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young
faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success
rates for the attendees and ultimately better research resulting from better
written proposals.
