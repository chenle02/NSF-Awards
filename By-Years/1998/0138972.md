The objective of this work is the development of a second generation high-power,
high-stability CO2 laser trap and its application to study resonant scattering
interactions in ultracold two-state mixtures of Li-6 fermions. Of particular
interest is the investigation of a new type of superfluid pairing which has
recently been predicted to result from very strong resonant attractive
interactions in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. In such resonance
superfluidity, transition temperatures can be a large fraction of the Fermi
temperature, far larger than in usual BCS pairing interactions, and much larger
than even the highest temperature superconductors known.
