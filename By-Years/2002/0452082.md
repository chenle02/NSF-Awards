In 2004, after several years of legal and structural adjustments, the Polish-
Ukranian border ceased to demarcate just a divide between two nation-states, and
instead became a frontier of the transnational European community. This research
is an anthropological and historical assessment of how the Polish state
establishes, maintains, legitimizes and naturalizes this evolving border
arrangement, and how the emerging classification of populations and territory
materializes in the daily understandings of individuals and groups. Employing
archival work, formal interviews and participant observation, the researcher
will produce an ethnographic account of this reorganization of space and
traffic, by documenting how belonging to, and exclusion from a supranational
community are defined and enacted in key sites through the adjustment of legal
structures and political rhetoric, narratives, official actions and informal
practices of state officials as well as of persons involved in two-way cross-
border traffic. The research will contribute an insight into the processes of
social construction of difference that under the new border regime will concern
Eastern Europeans from outside of the EU.
