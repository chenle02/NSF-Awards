A team of biodiversity specialists will inventory the free-living aquatic
sponges, flatworms, annelid worms, mollusks, crustaceans, and fishes of the
freshwater habitats of the lower Amazon basin of Brazil. This region is
remarkably poorly sampled in comparison to other parts of the basin, and remains
one of the last frontiers for scientific discovery in the tropics. Investigators
from institutions in the U.S., Brazil and other countries will undertake a
multi-habitat, multi-season series of expeditions to collect, photograph,
identify, catalog, and analyze the aquatic fauna. The project will yield large
geo-referenced collections of specimens, produce on-line and printed faunal
guides, generate species descriptions, taxonomic revisions, and synthetic
studies of the ecology and evolution of Amazonian aquatic animals, and will
provide unique opportunities for student training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
collections, data, and products generated by this project will serve as a
lasting resource for understanding how the extraordinary diversity of the Amazon
is generated and maintained, how resilient this diversity is to human pressure,
and how it can be protected. Project results will therefore be valuable to
professionals in fisheries and natural resource management, ecology,
biogeography, paleontology, geology, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and
anthropology. This project will also benefit people of the Amazon whose
livelihoods are dependent upon aquatic resources, and members of the public
worldwide who wish to learn more about the Amazon?s fascinating yet threatened
aquatic life.
