This project upgrades undergraduate instruction in experimental and theoretical
aspects of modern marine geology. The courses affected range from introductory
to advanced levels, and involve seismic and magnetic investigation of seafloor
morphology and subbottom structure, and geochemical sampling of the water column
and seafloor. Data and samples collected are processed and interpreted using
computers in the laboratory. Students write reports from the data sets collected
during cruises. Some of the data sets are utilized also in related courses such
as geophysics or geochemistry. These experiences will better prepare students
for industrial employment or for graduate study leading to professional careers
involving marine geology. The university will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
