The performance of graphic processors is outpacing the performance of general
processors, in fact cubing the growth curve. It has been recently shown that
some graphics algorithms can be performed in new ways on the graphics processor,
using a novel technique known as multipass programming. Multipass programming
treats the graphics processor as a SIMD processor acting on a data array stored
in the screen's pixels, with each operation applied as an image-processing pass.
The proposed research will extend this concept further not only within the
graphics community, but also for the scientific computing and general computing
communities, by developing a multipass programming language general enough to
support both graphical and non-graphical programs. Existing problems of
numerical range and precision will be overcome, and the fidelity of the
resulting numerical implementations analyzed.

Work in multipass algorithms for procedural shading will be continued our, and
multipass programming applied to radiosity and physically-based animation.
Multipass programming will also be extended to applications outside of computer
graphics, including solving linear systems, the finite element method and
computational fluid dynamics.

If graphics processors continue to grow at the current rate, they will attain a
four teraflop performance at the end of the proposed funding period. During this
growth period a library of programming techniques and applications that will
harness this otherwise untapped source of high-performance computing power will
be developed. The result will be richer graphics, more realistic virtual
environments, more natural simulated motion, and the ability to perform
sophisticated supercomputing simulations on consumer-level personal computers.
