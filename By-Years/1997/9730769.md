How much the public should be involved in politics is an enduring question for
democratic theory. Deliberative democratic theorists support involvement because
it can educate citizens. However, they do not believe in expanding all forms of
political activism. Instead, deliberative theorists support expanding what they
call democratic deliberation - - a special form of political discussion that is
cooperative, noncoercive, and among equals with diverse opinions. Overall,
deliberative theorists argue that deliberation extends civic education beyond
the classroom. One possible educative effect of deliberation is enhancing
political tolerance. Political tolerance is the attitude of individuals towards
extending civil liberties such as freedom of speech and assembly to potentially
unpopular minority groups. However, it has not been examined whether
deliberation actually can increase individuals' tolerance. To begin to assess
the relationship between deliberation and tolerance in American politics, this
study conducts an experiment that simulates deliberation in order to examine its
effect on tolerance. Subjects for the experiment will be asked to engage in
either a competitive or cooperative discussion about a particular policy towards
and unpopular group. The expectation is that subjects in the cooperative
discussion groups will be more likely to converge on their attitudes and become
more tolerant while the subjects' initial attitudes in the competitive
discussions will be reinforced. In other words, engaging in political discussion
about a policy issue may lead to attitude change, eventhough it is the policy
and not the attitude that is the topic of discussion. This experiment allows the
investigator to create an environment that is as close to deliberation as
possible in order to ascertain what its effects might be if it were adopted to a
greater extent in America.
