This project addresses a central problem underlying the effort to automate the
process of design software development: the lack of reliable techniques for
solving large sets of nonlinear algebraic equations that form the basis of
chemical process design computations. Such techniques, if available, would be an
essential component in a system capable of generating the required numerical
software rapidly and reliably by machine. Software development costs and delays
could be reduced, yielding an increase in engineering productivity. The
objectives of the research are to produce a numerical solution technique that
will provide a rigorous guarantee of successful convergence; the capability to
identify and compute multiple solutions; the ability to deal with feasibility
constraints defined by inequalities; and the precise diagnosis of
underspecification, overspecification, and infeasibility of complex system
models. The new approach is based on an implicit enumeration strategy employing
analytically-derived bounding functions. The research will encompass development
of the detailed algorithm with analysis of its theoretical properties, followed
by software implementation and computational testing on full-sized chemical
processing system models.
