9405470 Kohlstedt This project involves experimental research on the solubility
of water in nominally anhydrous mantel minerals (olivine and selected pyroxenes)
and on the role of water in ionic diffusion in olivine. The research involves
three aspects: (1) determining the speciation of water in olivine, using
experimental data on the solubility of water in olivine obtained at pressures of
, 0.3 GPa to ~ 12 GPa and over a wide range of water fugacity and proton
activity, (2) constraining the upper limit for water content of the upper
mantle, using measured solubilities of water in high- Ca pyroxene as a function
of water fugacity and proton activity, and (3) determining the mechanism by
which water affects diffusion-dependent properties in nominally anhydrous
minerals, using dependence of Fe-Mg interdiffusion and O tracer diffusion on
water fugacity and proton activity. The results of these laboratory experiments
will provide fundamental constraints on the extent to which nominally anhydrous
minerals can be reservoirs for water in the mantle and also on the magnitude of
the effect of water on diffusion-dependent properties such as creep and
electrical conductivity of mantle rocks.
