This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award provides
research opportunities for U.S. STEM students from underrepresented groups, in
particular women and Hispanics. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students from
University of Texas at El Paso will work with Mexican researchers at the
University of Guadalajara Smart Cities Living Lab on interdisciplinary projects
involving computer science, civil engineering, and neuroscience. These projects
will focus on creating sustainable and resilient infrastructure and services for
city residents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on sensor data
management, data analytics, and multi-modal optimization. Students will develop
innovative solutions for smart mobility and smart buildings related to
scalability, modularity, interoperability and relevant Smart Cities services,
resilience, and security. Students will also have access to a smart city testbed
equipped with cutting-edge technology at the University of Guadalajara in
Mexico.
