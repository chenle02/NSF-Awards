This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the development of
research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In
particular the collaborators' research will focus on measurement and statistical
methodology for physical aspects of mountain system instabilities arising both
from natural environmental factors and from changing levels of human activity.
