A requirement exists for the acquisition, storage, and distribution of large
numbers of micro-samples of DNA. Using the polymerase chain reaction and other
methods, specific DNA sequences may be amplified from very small genomic
starting samples. If large libraries of DNA samples were available, individual
researchers could attack a variety of interesting problems in taxonomy,
evolution, population genetics, genetic screening for radiation and
environmental mutagens, the validation of forensic DNA technology, and many
others using PCR, RFLP mapping and other readily available techniques. LSB Corp.
proposes a systematic program to develop methods for storing large numbers of
DNA samples including dried cells, DNA- enriched extracts, or purified DNA, with
each sample encased in a protective enclosure with attached identifying
barcoding, all arranged for convenient storage and access. LSB Corp. has
developed and described several alternative prototypes for such a storage
system, together with methods for evaluating each. Additionally LSB Corp. has
developed computerized analysis of RFLP, 2-D DNA, and other types of analytical
images.
