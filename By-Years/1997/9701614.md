9701614 Yuh Our primary research objective is to investigate and develop
intelligent control strategies for underwater robotic vehicles (URVs) with
manipulator workpackages. The motion of the manipulator, which is attached to
the vehicle's main body, affects the motion of the vehicle, whose dynamics are
also subject to parameter uncertainties, changes in payload and environment, and
nonlinear behavior. It is necessary to develop an intelligent control system for
such vehicles to provide: automatic compensation for the errors of the vehicle
motion, due to manipulator motion and underwater currents. coordinated control
of both vehicle and manipulator using deliberate vehicle motion; such motion
will help task performance and add the degrees of freedom of the vehicle to
those of the manipulator workpackage; learning and adaptation capabilities to
parameter uncertainties and changes in the environment; and close coupling of
control knowledge transfer between the high-level and low-level subsystems of
the overall URV control system. The study: extends a theoretical modeling of the
underwater robotic vehicle and manipulator, including dynamic interaction
between links and vehicle main body, kinematic redundancy, contact stability of
the system in contact with the environment, and fixtureless manipulation;
develops a theoretical framework for intelligent control strategies based on
fuzzy neural network (FNN) control using fuzzy clustering techniques and on-line
reinforcement learning technique; and includes experimental demonstration of the
proposed approach on the University of Hawaii's underwater robotic vehicle, ODIN
(Omni-Directional Intelligent Navigator). ***
