This research addresses the Outside Vapor Deposition process for the production
of optical fiber preforms. The process is a complex combination of elements
including the processes of particle formation, growth and deposition. The
objective of the research is to determine the particle growth history, the
particle composition and the efficiency of deposition. This will be achieved
through both experimental studies of the soot formation and deposition processes
and analysis of the particle formation, growth and transport. The Outside Vapor
Deposition process produces the highest performance fibers. This process has the
flexibility to manufacture diverse fibers at the lowest cost. However, the
collection efficiency is only about 50 percent. Therefore the understanding of
the basic characteristics of the process will contribute to the advancement of
this process. It is expected that the results of the investigation will advance
this production technique and aid in the optimization of the process.
