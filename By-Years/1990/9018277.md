During the past ten years there has been a close symbiotic relationship between
the areas of probability in Banach Spaces and modern empirical process theory,
with the main ideas from one having one or more useful analogues in the other.
The conference which this grant will support is divided into two one-week
sessions. The first, devoted to probability in separable Banach spaces, will
cover such topics as new finite-dimensional limit theorems, new infinite-
dimensional limit theorems, proofs of probabilistic theorems in Banach spaces
and applications of these results to analysis and random sets. The second week,
devoted to empirical process theory, will cover new work on Vapnik-Cervonenkis
combinatorics, entropy conditions, non-linear functionals and other statistical
aspects. This conference will be held July 7-20 at Bowdoin College. Each week of
the conference will be composed of a minicourse and individual lectures on
recent results. This will provide an excellent atmosphere for analysts,
probabilists and statisticians from these two overlapping fields to interact.
