This award is to support the Doctoral Symposium at the IEEE International
Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC) in Tucson, AZ, September
18-22, 2017. The doctoral symposium is meant to engage PhD students attending
the symposium with interactions that provide the attendees with research and
career mentoring. The primary objectives of the doctoral symposium
are:&lt;br/&gt; *Provide a venue for PhD students to present their research and
obtain feedback from experts in the area. Students will be given the opportunity
to present their research even if they did not have a paper in the main
conference.&lt;br/&gt; *Allow PhD students to present their work at the main
conference's poster session. This will enable students to receive further
mentoring about their research. &lt;br/&gt; *Mentor PhD students by providing
sound career advice from representatives in industry as well as
academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall impact that such a meeting can have
on PhD students, both early and late in their studies, can be invaluable. The
findings at the Doctoral Symposium will be made publicly available to increase
the dissemination of the keynotes and the results of the Q&amp;A session on
career mentoring.
