This work involves a balanced theoretical and experimental program designed to
relate the microscopic properties of collections of magnetic particles to their
macroscopic response to a magnetic field. This fundamental research has
potential for application in the magnetic recording industry. The research group
receives substantial matching funds from the Center for Magnetic Recording
Research at UC San Diego. The theoretical work applies finite element analytical
methods, as well as an integral equation approach, to micromagnetic behavior. A
wide variety of experimental methods are employed. They range from modern nano-
scale lithographic methods to an innovative use of the classical Millikan oil-
drop technique. The latter is used to levitate a magnetic particle in an oil
bath and measure its magnetic moment. Further research is devoted to the
important problem of inter-particle interactions across contact asperities. This
topic is being investigated by high resolution electron microscopy with
collaborators at UC Berkeley.
