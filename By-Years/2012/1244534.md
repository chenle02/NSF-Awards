The carboxysome is a microcompartment that, in cyanobacteria and
chemoautotrophic bacteria, plays an important role as a component of the Carbon
Concentrating Mechanisms of these organisms. However, the pathway for assembly
of the carboxysome is not well understood, and in order to simplify this problem
the assembly of the Halothiobacillus neapolitanus carboxysome will be studied in
Escherichia coli. The proposed study will extend our understanding of
carboxysome assembly, structure and function, and provide insight into how
cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic bacteria regulate the fixation of carbon
dioxide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The uptake of carbon dioxide by
bacteria is important for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the
impacts of climate change, and knowledge of the carboxysome is relevant to our
ability to engineer organisms to produce biofuels. Training opportunities will
be provided for graduate and undergraduate students, including those from groups
underrepresented in science. Outreach to underrepresented minority high school
and middle school teachers and students will provide opportunities for them to
engage with this research project.
