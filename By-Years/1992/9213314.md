This study is designed to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of fungi
in the dens of two species of desert rodents, (kangaroo rats and woodrats) at
the Sevilleta LTER site. These dens are known to be foci of fungal populations,
which influence many aspects of community dynamics and ecosystem processes, from
food storage behavior of the rodents to decomposition of woody material. Small
tubes will be placed in the dens and used as sampling ports, allowing repeated
sampling from the same location within the dens. Six locations within six
adjacent, core, dens will be sampled four times a year for two years.
Concurrently, two transects of six dens each will be sampled at geometrically
increasing distances up to 3.2 km from the core dens. The samples will be
analyzed for fungal diversity, growth characteristics, and growth compatibility.
The results will reveal important aspects of microbial dynamics in settings that
are known to be ecologically important.
