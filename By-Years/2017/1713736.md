The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on
the substantial opportunity to utilize circuit-level electricity usage data to
identify equipment faults, allocate energy costs, and increase operating
efficiency in the residential and commercial building sectors. By monitoring
electricity at the circuit level, it is possible to detect when equipment is
about to malfunction. By sub-metering electricity in multi-tenant facilities, it
is possible to fairly charge each occupant. By auditing energy use and
benchmarking against other buildings, it is possible to identify investment
opportunities that increase operating efficiency or equipment inefficiencies.
All of these benefits, as well as many others, stem from greater visibility into
electricity usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project concerns a new type
of electricity sub-meter that dramatically reduces installation cost and
complexity, the main impediments to greater adoption of the technology. These
results are possible today because of substantial prior research into ultra-low
power energy-harvesting circuits. These circuits enable self-powered sensor
operation, clip-on installation that reduces installation cost and eliminates
the need for electrical shutdowns, new calibration methods that can jointly
calibrate the sensors and front-end electronics for better overall accuracy and
lower cost, and a novel method of non-contact voltage sensing that allows true
power measurement without high installation cost and safety risks of
conventional voltage sensors. When the data that these new types of electricity
sub-meters generate are analyzed and processed by algorithms, it is possible to
identify equipment faults, allocate energy costs, detect inefficient operations,
and reduce high grid demand. This solution addresses key accuracy, cost, and
deployment challenges, filling an important gap in the electricity sub-metering
industry.
