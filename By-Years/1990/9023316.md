Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that carry out green plant
photosynthesis, evolving oxygen in the light. For some strains, there exists a
convenient system of genetic analysis based on DNA- mediated transformation. In
addition, cyanobacteria control the expression of some genes in response to
changes in the quantity or quality of light. We will exploit a gene encyclopedia
(an ordered set of cosmid clones covering the entire chromosome) of
Synechocystis 6803 to locate genes that respond to light changes and then to
define, by in vitro and in vitro analyses, both the nucleotide sequences
required to regulate those genes (cis-acting elements) and the proteins
responsible for their differential expression (trans-acting elements). The
combined genetic and biochemical approach should allow us to identify the
components of the regulatory cascade that transduces a light signal into a gene
expression response.
