With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green State University will
acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-
TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety of
research projects, including a) investigations on novel metal-organic
chromophores and materials; b) studies of de novo designed proteins for use in
electron transfer and DNA damage; c) studies of supramolecular materials as
anion sensors; and d) investigations on self-assembled RNA motifs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-
of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining
accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with
extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore
become a standard technique in studies involving biomolecules. At Bowling Green,
this instrument will therefore also be used in the undergraduate Biochemistry
laboratory for protein analysis. &lt;br/&gt;
