The investigators propose to develop and test new instructional techniques aimed
at teaching high-school science students how to use the diagrams that appear in
their biology textbooks. Research from a range of disciplines has shown that
people have difficulty making sense of diagrams. The investigators had
previously found that inference and other high-level processes that are
important for learning from text are even more important for learning from
diagrams. They further showed that students show little gains in content
understanding from textbook diagrams. The investigators will capitalize on
commonalities among several theories of diagrammatic reasoning to develop four
interventions, following an additive design, aimed at improving classroom
instruction in how to use diagrams. In each iteration, one additional
intervention feature is added to the initial intervention. In the first
intervention, they will teach the components of diagrams (i.e., how to read
captions, color keys, and other conventions of diagrams). In the second, they
will also teach the coordinating of text and diagrams. In the third, they will
also have the students engage in self-explanation. In the fourth, they will also
have students construct their own drawings. In conjunction with these
experimental studies, the investigators will collect eye tracking data on a
subset of participants pre- and post-intervention in order to look for possible
changes in gaze patterns.
