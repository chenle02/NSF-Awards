Waves or oscillations are common in gaseous plasmas. This work, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, seeks to use
the dependence of such oscillations on the chemical makeup of the plasma to
detect assorted chemical species and to quantify them. Both the oscillation
frequency and amplitude are related to the amount of analyte present. The
sensitivity of this dependence is dependent on species structure. Plasmas are
generally regarded as tools for studying atomic species; this work will
characterize molecular species in the plasma instead. With arrays of sensor
cells at different pressures, it may be possible to establish a fingerprint for
specific compounds or classes of compounds. Plausible applications include
detection of gas chromatograph effluents, remote sensing of noxious vapors, and
process control.
