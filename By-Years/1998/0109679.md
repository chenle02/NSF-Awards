This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
optical instrument that measures velocity distribution in a flame species by
species---and on multiple scale sizes---with an accuracy of 1%. This novel
velocimeter is nonintrusive and passive, relying completely on light emitted by
the flame itself. The instrument will be developed with experts in commercial
combustion chemical-vapor deposition, a process that inexpensively produces
thin-film coatings for a variety of applications, including electronics, glass,
anti-corrosives, superconductors, catalytics, polymers, and nanopowders. The
velocimeter will monitor species mixing and velocity in the flame, facilitating
"smart" deposition that can streamline real-time process control and increase
the reliability of the coating process. The instrument will map the velocity of
the flame as a whole. Phase 1 will prove the feasibility of species-specific,
variable-scale-size velocimetry. Phase II will perform a proof-of-principle
demonstration with a prototype instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
commercial application is smart deposition that monitors real-time species-
specific velocity distribution in a flame to maintain flame consistency and
maximize deposition efficiency. Other potential applications include plasma-
based manufacturing and plasma thruster control.&lt;br/&gt;
