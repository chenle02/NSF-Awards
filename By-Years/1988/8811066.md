This is a research program designed to study polymer blends and polymer networks
by scattering methods. The main experimental thrust will continue to be small-
angle neutron scattering (SANS), and will be extended to include comparative and
complementary small-angle x-ray (SAXS) measurements. The polymer blends will be
studied by SANS and SAXS, and both equilibrium properties and polymer
interdiffusion are to be investigated. Polymer networks in bulk and in the
swollen state will be studied by SANS only. Concurrently, elastic recoil
scattering (ERD) will be exploited for the measurement of polymer interdiffusion
and solvent diffusion in bulk polymers. Preliminary SAXS measurements and all
ERD measurements will be performed at the University of Michigan. SAXS
measurements requiring high resolution and high intensity will be carried out at
Brookhaven or Standford. Most SANS experiments are planned to be executed at Oak
Ridge but some may be undertaken at the University of Missouri or at Argonne.
All three scattering methods SANS, SAXS, and ERD are particularly important in
the measurement of small diffusion constants of the order of 10-14 cm2/sec and
less. An important part of the ERD study will be to improve instrumental
resolution and to provide a low temperature central system needed for the
solvent diffusion studies.
