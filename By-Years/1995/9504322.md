9504322 Damuth Mass transport processes(slumps, slides and debris flows) are now
considered as important as turbidity currents in creating deep-sea fans and
their leveed channel systems. However, areal and volumetric distribution of
mass-transported deposits remains uncertain. ODP Leg 155 cored 7 sites on Amazon
Fan. These and high amplitude reflection packages recovered from leveed channel
systems, as well as existing high-resolution seismic data will provide the basis
of the study to understand the role of mass transport in the construction of
deep sea fans. ***
