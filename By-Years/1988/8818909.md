This research will examine how two mutant enzyme variants, found in natural
populations, influence an important metabolic pathway. As a model system the
study focuses on the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the
fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Prior studies have indicated significant
differences in biochemical properties, but it is unclear that these differences
as determined in the test tube in vitro reflect how the genetic variants
function in the living fly (in vivo). This question will be addressed by
examining the amount of radioactively labelled glucose passed through the
metabolic pathway in flies possessing either genetic variant of the enzyme. This
test is essential to our understanding of naturally occurring enzyme variation
because it is usually assumed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
artificial in vitro measures of biochemical function and their function in vivo.
However, no direct experiments have ever been conducted to test this assumption.
This is the crucial experimental examination of that assumption in one of the
very few systems where it may be directly tested.
