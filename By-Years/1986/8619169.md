Four topics are being studied under the heading of modular algorithms for
multidimensional signal processing. The first topic is an investigation of the
subclass of rational transfer functions which can be represented in cascade
lattice form. Second, a multichannel approach is made to the characterization of
all orthogonal lattice configurations for two-dimensional (2-D) signals. A study
of maximum entropy (ME) methods in relation to model constraints constitutes the
third topic of study. This work is based on the investigators recent results
regarding the optimality of recursive autoregressive models in terms minimizing
a certain information theoretic distance from the ME solution. Finally, layer-
pealing algorithms will be investigated for 2-D scattering arrays. This research
concerns the extension of the lattice modeling approach to multidimensional
signal processing. This lattice approach has been very influential in the case
of one-dimensional signals such as audio because of its advantages for VLSI and
also for adaptive processing. The researchers are working on the difficult
problems of trying to extend these advantages to the two-dimensional case for
application to video and computer vision.
