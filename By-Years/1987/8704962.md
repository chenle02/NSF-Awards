This recommendation is to provide funding to enhance the computational
facilities for research in computer vision and related areas in the Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan. The
research efforts in the Computer Vision Research Laboratory address almost all
aspects of computer vision. There is, however, a clear emphasis on symbolic
computation. The activity will involve integrating symbolic computation with the
low-level processes. The increasing requirement for symbolic processing has
resulted in an emphasis on LISP machines. This award will provide funding for a
set of high-quality workstations which will provide the necessary capabilities.
