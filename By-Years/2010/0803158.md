The goal of this research project is to enhance, develop, and publish faint
standard star sequences. There is a long-term need for accurate photometric
standard stars with known intensities and colors at a variety of optical
wavelengths. Use of such standard stars permits the combination and inter-
comparison of the brightness and color measurements of different celestial
phenomena made by different investigators. Examples of uses include the
calibration of magnitudes and color indices of celestial objects to further the
understanding of stellar evolution, ages and distances of star clusters, studies
of variable stars, and to define the distance scale through our Milky Way
Galaxy, the local group of galaxies, and onward to the edge of the Universe.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, using telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile, Dr. Landolt will complete the development of new standard
stars that will be about 100 times fainter than those now available. He will
also begin development of the next set of even fainter standard stars at the
Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. These calibration stars are needed
for, and will be usable by the entire ensemble of the largest ground-based and
space-based optical detectors, both presently built, those under construction,
and those in the planning stage. The overall goal of this project is to extend
the calibration sequences to fainter limits so the limits of interpretation will
be scientific, and not those of calibration.
