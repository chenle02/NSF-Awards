This project continues a series of week long workshops for teachers of calculus.
Common features of workshops in this sweries: review the concerns that gave rise
to the calculus reform movement; summarize the common themes that characterize
the thinking of those who lead the reform movement; enable participants to get a
comprehensive overview of the materials, developed in many different projects,
now available for their consideration; are led by people who have had hands on
experience in the developing of a particular project, and are willing to share
what they have learned about student and colleague reaction without pushing
their particular materials; and help participants to plan a level of involvement
appropriate to their own situation.
