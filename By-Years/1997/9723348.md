Lay Abstract PI: Caron Dean-Bernhoft, Ph.D. Proposal Number: IBN-9723348 The
changes that take place in the heart and blood vessels to maintain blood
pressure under a number of conditions are different, since the requirements of
the body are not always the same. For example, during confrontations, heart rate
and blood flow to the active muscles must go up but blood flow to the kidney can
be reduced. On the other hand, when it gets cold, blood flow to the skin
decreases while flow to internal organs increases to retain heat. These types of
changes in heart rate and blood flow are regulated by a specific part of the
brain called the RVLM. This study examines how these nerve cells of the RVLM
coordinate nerve activity to regulate the cardiovascular system during different
behavioral states. Particular attention is paid to the characteristics of the
chemical substances released from cells in this area that modulate the activity
of this center, and thus change the pattern of cardiovascular activity. The
results from this study contribute to understanding how blood flow and blood
pressure are adjusted to meet the needs of the body under different or emergency
situations. Such information is fundamental to a deeper understanding of how
blood pressure is controlled.
