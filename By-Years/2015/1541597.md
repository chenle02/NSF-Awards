To achieve high efficiency and low emission, many practical combustion systems
have resorted to combustion regimes wherein ignition is severely impeded. To
overcome the difficulties associated with ignition, lasers are an attractive
ignition tool for thse combustion regimes. This International Conference has
been one of the premier interdisciplinary conferences where scientists with
diverse backgrounds (e.g.; experts in combustion, laser physics, spectroscopy,
and plasma) come together to present their highest quality research and discuss
new ideas.
