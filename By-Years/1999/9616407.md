This award will support the final year of a project to establish the fluid and
mineral mechanisms, fluid circulation pathways and time scales responsible for
the formation of authigenic minerals formed at the Chile Triple Junction.
Hydrothermal pulses from the buried ridge system have produced a series of
mineral facies, which will be analyzed with Li, B and O isotopes in addition to
a range of other analyses already accomplished. A hydrogeochemical model will be
constructed using local tectonic and kinematic constraints, in order to estimate
fluid and geochemical fluxes associated with ridge subduction.
