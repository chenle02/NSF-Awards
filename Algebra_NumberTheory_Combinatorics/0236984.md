Pandharipande will study problems in the Gromov-Witten theory of algebraic
varieties. In the first two parts, recently developed methods in Gromov-Witten
theory will be used to study the geometry of the moduli space of curves. In
particular, Hodge integrals and tautological rings will be studied. The third
part of the project is an investigation of the Toda equation for the potential
of the projective line. The fourth part is a study of degenerate and multiple
cover calculations for threefolds and their relationship to M-theory.

In this project, Pandharipande will study basic questions in the geometry of
Riemann surfaces using new ideas from topological string theory. The research
undertaken will involve computations of basic integral series that play a
central role in Gromov-Witten theory. Also, the current perspective leads to
many fundamental new lines of inquiry that will be pursued. The whole subject
lies on the boundary of several fields of mathematics and string theory.
