A substantial literature has developed attempting to determine the impact of
civil rights policies on the 1960's improvement in black relative earnings. Much
less has been written about changes during this period in the economic status of
Asians and Hispanics, who received protections against employment discrimination
via the national origin clause of the Civil Rights Act. One reason for the
dearth of attention is that unlike African Americans, Hispanics and Asians were
not identified on the Current Population Survey (CPS) until 1969. This project
complements previous Census-based studies on Asian and Hispanic economic status
by focusing on the question of whether (and how) the 1964 Civil Rights Act and
associated Federal anti-discrimination efforts affected the economic status of
Americans of Asian and Hispanic descent. Using census and longitudinal earnings
data, two central questions are addressed: 1. Is there an unexplained change in
Asian and Hispanic economic status relative to that of whites that coincides
with Federal anti-discrimination efforts? 2. What were the mechanisms of this
change? In doing so, this project offers two major advances toward the study of
this question. First, it overcomes the identification hurdle by using post-1969
survey data to identify Asians and Hispanics in several data sets that match CPS
and Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data to Social Security's
longitudinal, historical earnings data. Second, by following the same
individuals before and after the Civil Rights Act, this study circumvents the
effects of coincident changes in sample selection. In addition to using Social
Security historical longitudinal data, both alone and matched to survey sources,
the project also uses public use micro sample (PUMS) data from the 1940-1980
decennial censuses.
