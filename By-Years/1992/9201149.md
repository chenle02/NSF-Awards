This research is centered around the preparation of possible geochemical
intermediates which can be used to model the formation of unusual petroporphyrin
structures found in organic sediments. Compounds including
cycloalkanoporphyrins, deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin, meso,beta-
ethanoporphyrins, petroporphyrins with fused exocyclic rings and novel porphyrin
dimers are among the proposed synthetic targets. %%% With this RUI award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Timothy D. Lash of
the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University. Professor Lash will
focus his research on the synthesis of porphyrin molecular fossils. The work
will give a better understanding of the origins of organic sediments and will
involve undergraduates in an exciting area of research.
