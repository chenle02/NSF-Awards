This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of factors that have shaped government policies toward
women-related issues, focusing on sociopolitical variables, the roles of women's
organizations, and the connection between feminization of poverty and gendered
political activism. The research will center on statistical analysis of data for
the fifty American states, 1960-1990. This research will contribute to the
political sociology of social movements and government policy making, and to the
knowledge base concerning gender issues necessary for policy decisions. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
