A gas chromatograph with a mass-selective detector (GC/MSFD) is acquired in
order to improve the chemical analysis capability in the combustion and fuels
research group. The equipment will be used to support development of models of
fundamental processes controlling hydrocarbon combustion, and explore new engine
designs to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.
