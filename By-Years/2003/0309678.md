0309678&lt;br/&gt;Wahr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monthly solutions for the Earth's
global gravity field,&lt;br/&gt;as provided by&lt;br/&gt;the GRACE satellite
mission, will be used to estimate and interpret&lt;br/&gt;month-to-month changes
in the vertically-integrated distribution of&lt;br/&gt;liquid water and snow
stored on land.&lt;br/&gt;The spherical harmonic coefficients of the
gravity&lt;br/&gt;field provided by GRACE will be&lt;br/&gt;used to estimate
mass variations averaged over continental regions&lt;br/&gt;on the Earth's
surface.&lt;br/&gt;This will involve the construction of&lt;br/&gt;averaging
functions that are specially tailored&lt;br/&gt;for those
regions.&lt;br/&gt;These variations will be interpreted in&lt;br/&gt;terms of
changes in the mass of water stored in those regions.&lt;br/&gt;Among the things
that will be estimated and interpreted are:&lt;br/&gt;changes in the total
amount of water stored &lt;br/&gt;within large regions (greater&lt;br/&gt;than
200,000 square km);&lt;br/&gt;precipitation minus evaporation
averaged&lt;br/&gt;over large &lt;br/&gt;river basins;&lt;br/&gt;changes in
snowpack at northern latitudes; and&lt;br/&gt;changes in the total water stored
in regions with&lt;br/&gt;large underground aquifers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work, which will form the PhD thesis&lt;br/&gt;project of a graduate
student,&lt;br/&gt;will be a first step towards integrating time-
variable&lt;br/&gt;satellite gravity observations into the hydrological
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;These observations constitute a new and innovative data type
for hydrology,&lt;br/&gt;with considerable promise for improved
understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the global water cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
