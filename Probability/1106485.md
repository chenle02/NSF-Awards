The proposed research aims at developing new mathematical and statistical
results needed to efficiently analyze biochemical network models based on data
arriving from the new molecular technology of "deep" DNA sequencing. The project
will focus on developing likelihood-based estimates of the biochemical network
parameters and structure from the data consisting of longitudinal species
counts. With respect to parameter estimation, we shall (i) derive conditions on
the data process which guarantee identifiability and estimators consistency as
well as (ii) consider ways of approximating the likelihood of a partially
observed biochemical network with certain other likelihoods (e.g., Gaussian) for
which inference problem is simplified. With respect to network structure
discovery, we shall develop methods of analyzing algebraic varieties associated
with the geometry of chemical reaction networks in order to find stoichometry
structure most consistent with given data. The theoretical results obtained will
be used to develop a flexible framework for statistical analysis of deep
sequencing data. The resulting algorithms will be implemented with software and
their performance tested in real DNA sequencing experiments.

The deep (or next-gen) sequencing technology is a revolutionary, up-and-coming
tool of modern molecular biology, allowing for very precise high-throughput
measuring of DNA and RNA molecular counts in cellular systems. The next-gen
technology will make it possible for biologists to formulate and test very
specific hypothesis about biochemical interactions of various molecular species,
provided that the proper mathematical modeling and statistical analysis tools
(and their software implementations) will be broadly available. Due to his
scientific background and an interdisciplinary nature of his work, the proposer
is in a unique position to develop and then test such tools on data of
biological relevance, ensuring that the mathematical results of this research
are broadly disseminated to the scientific community of experimental biologists.
By transforming the methodology for data analysis in DNA-sequencing, the
proposed mathematical research will have broad influence on experimental high-
throughput methodology in many different areas of modern genetics, ecology, and
population studies. The project will also result in further promotion, both
statewide and nationally, of the fields of mathematics and statistics in the
context of biological research and the interdisciplinary training of young
researchers.
