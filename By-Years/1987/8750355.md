The project will establish a network of workstations to support instruction in
system software, software engineering and operating systems courses. A feature
of the laboratory will be the creation of animated simulations of computer
operations such as the instruction cycle, interrupt processing, time sharing and
message passing. The animated simulations will bring motion to the static,
abstract drawings presently put on the blackboard and on transparencies. The
simulations will allow student interactions. The students will be able to view
the dynamics of computer operation at various levels, interrupt the process, or
make changes in the external conditions and see the changes in computer
operations.
