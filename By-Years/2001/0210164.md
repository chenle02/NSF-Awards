A workshop on "Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control" was held at Stanford
University, March 25-27, 2002. The importance of hybrid discrete and continuous
control has emerged over the last several years, as hardware and software
technology provide ever more applications, ranging from everyday life to
mission-critical situations. At the same time, the lack of a satisfactory, cost-
effective design methodology for reliable and efficient hybrid controllers has
become apparent. This workshop, emphasizing issues in computation and control,
was one in a series dedicated to developing a scientific community and a body of
knowledge that synthesizes discrete and continuous technologies. The purpose of
the workshop series is to provide a regular, annual forum for novel results,
methodologies, and tools in the emerging area of hybrid systems. The proceedings
of the workshop are published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.
