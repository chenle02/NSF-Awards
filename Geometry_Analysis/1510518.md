This is a project in symplectic geometry, a branch of pure mathematics. It
focuses on Gromov-Witten theory. Gromov-Witten invariants are numbers that
appropriately count curves in spaces satisfying certain conditions; just as the
fact that there is exactly one straight line passing through any two given
distinct points. These invariants have been a central object of study in several
fields, from their origins in theoretical physics (string theory) to algebraic
and symplectic geometries. Computing such numbers for general spaces is a
difficult task. For spaces with symmetries, gauged Gromov Witten theory has
proven to be a far-reaching tool used to systematically understand the behavior
of Gromov-Witten invariants as well as to compute them. One of the major
accomplishments of gauged Gromov-Witten theory is the discovery of several
explicit formulas for the invariants, which have been recently used to tackle
open questions. This research project aims to advance understanding in this
area. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this field, new results will find
direct applications in other areas.

One of the major accomplishments of gauged Gromov-Witten theory is the discovery
of wall-crossing formulas, which in turn proved to be decisive in the proof of
the so-called crepant conjecture. The present project undertakes work to further
advance the research program in gauged Gromov-Witten theory for algebraic and
symplectic quotients. The Principal Investigator and collaborators will work on
an explicit computation of quantum K-theory of toric varieties and Grassmannians
by means of the K-theoretic quantum Kirwan map, and extend wall crossing
formulas to quantum K-theory. The Principal Investigator and collaborators will
also study the moduli of parabolic gauged maps and the gauged Gromov-Witten
theory for hypersurfaces. They will investigate relations to other constructions
such as stable maps with p-fields and the Landau-Ginzburg A-model. The Principal
Investigator will continue his joint work on a degeneration formula for Seidel
elements and its relation to mirror symmetry and potential function of disc
counting. He will work on a construction of invariants for toric orbifolds
generalizing a Calabi quasi-morphism for projective spaces, and plans to use
this to study non-displaceability. Finally, he will investigate the possibility
of extending other equivariant tools into quantum cohomology and quantum
K-theory.
