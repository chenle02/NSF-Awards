Through this project, equipment for experiments in thermodynamics, gas
diffusion, liquid-liquid extraction and gas absorption significantly improves
laboratory instruction in chemical engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute. This
equipment gives students experience with automated control of process equipment,
with improved data acquisition, and with modern computer control and data
logging equipment and techniques.
