In the setting of secure computation, a set of mutually distrusting parties wish
to compute some function of their inputs while preserving security properties
such as privacy, correctness, etc. One important property is fairness, which
roughly means that if anyone learns the result of the computation, then everyone
does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been known since the mid-1980s that complete
fairness is impossible, in general, without a strict majority of honest parties.
For over 20 years, the accepted folklore has been that nothing non-trivial can
be computed with complete fairness without an honest majority. Recent work of
the PI and others shows that this folklore is false, and demonstrates that the
question of fairness in secure computation is wide
open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to expand the initial feasibility
results (or prove corresponding impossibility results) and to develop a better
understanding of fairness in cryptographic protocols more generally. This
includes work on partial fairness, as well as exploring rationality as a means
of obtaining fairness. The educational component of this project will focus on
graduate student education and outreach efforts to the broader research
community.
