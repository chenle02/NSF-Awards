This two-year grant will provide detection equipment to support an experimental
program with radioactive nuclear beams (RNBs) at the National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University (MSU) and at the recently
upgraded low-energy facility at the University of Notre Dame(UND). Special
arrays of silicon position- sensitive and fast-timing detectors will be used for
a variety of cross-section measurements: total reaction and for neutron and
proton removal, elastic scattering and inelastic scattering (including Coulomb
excitation), and RNB transfer reactions and isomeric-beam induced reactions.
Measurements of the 1- and 2- neutron removal cross sections from the neutron
`halo` nuclei Li-11 and He-6 and He-8 and the proton `halo` nuclei N-12 and
Ne-17 are particularly important. The detectors will be used in the focal plane
of the S-800 Spectrometer at MSU and with the new double UM-UND superconducting
solenoid system at UND. As part of the project, several specialized detectors
will be developed in collaboration with US-based suppliers and DOE and NSF
supported national laboratories. Several graduate and undergraduate students
will participate in the research using these detectors. This grant is made
possible by the support of the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
equipment initiative.
