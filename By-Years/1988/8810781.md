Southern University will undertake a one year interdisciplinary self assessment
and planning project. The objective is to evaluate present potential and
identify researchers with common areas of interest with the aim of preparing an
implementation grant application for the Computer and Informations Science and
Engineering (CISE) Institutional Infrastructure Program. Plans are to be
developed to enhance the instructional and research capabilities of minorities
in fields supported by the NSF CISE directorate. The current areas of strength
at SUBR and the maximization of resource utilization, including a
multidisciplinary approach, are two major considerations throughout the planning
process. A description of the planning project management and the duties,
responsibilities and qualifications of key personnel is included. Also included
is a framework for the establishment of a CISE advisory committee and the CISE
administration during the implementation stage.
