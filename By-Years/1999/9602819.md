Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has devoted considerable resources to
support the expansion and continued growth of a biochemistry initiative in the
Department of Chemistry. The increased numbers of students desiring a degree in
biochemistry, now over 50, with 50% women, has necessitated the establishment of
a formal biochemistry program. In 1995, the faculty endorsed the incorporation
of the interdisciplinary biochemistry program to create the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry. Current biochemistry and associated facilities are
grossly inadequate to support quality research. To ensure the success of this
initiative and provide students with a first rate research experience, WPI and
the National Science Foundation will commit resources to modernize laboratory
space and establish a biochemistry core facility. Renovation of existing
research facilities in Goddard Hall, a structure built over 30 years ago, is
needed to accommodate the growing programs. Renovations will entail
reconfiguring of bench space, upgrading HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems,
and installing new cabinetry, cold room and a built in glass washer. Research
programs benefiting from the this project include molecular plant pathogen
interactions, ion transport though red blood cell membranes, synthesis and
isolation of biologically active natural products from plant and marine sources,
and molecular photochemistry and laser spectroscopy. The renovations will
increase available laboratory space, ensure safety, and enhance the overall
research experience enabling students to successfully compete in advanced
graduate programs.
