This proposal enables selected graduate students to attend annual professional
meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science. This society is the
central meeting place and intellectual forum for those engaged in Science and
Technology Studies and it is a welcoming place for graduate students: they not
only see papers, they also present, and are connected with mentors who advise
them on careers and intellectual matters. The maximum award for a graduate
student is $750 for a domestic flight and $1000 for international, and all must
be US students flying on US carriers. There is a competitive selection process
and the students are required to provide follow-up documentation on their
experience. This is the fourth iteration of this graduate student funding
request; earlier ones have brought students into the field who are now leaders
in education and innovation.
