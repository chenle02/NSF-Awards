ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0312839&lt;br/&gt;Verdu, Sergio&lt;br/&gt;Princeton
U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal we describe an integrated research
program on a new research area with a very rich&lt;br/&gt;array of applications:
the problem of .ltering or denoising of discrete sequences. This
statistical&lt;br/&gt;signal processing problem arises naturally in a wide range
of applications spanning a variety of&lt;br/&gt;information technology
applications in .elds as varied as computer science, statistics,
engineering,&lt;br/&gt;astronomy, biology, and information
theory.&lt;br/&gt;Consider the problem of recovering a signal from a noisy
version, which has been corrupted&lt;br/&gt;by a known channel. The recovery can
assume two major modes depending on the application:&lt;br/&gt;noncausal, i.e.
it starts once the entire signal is available;and causal, i.e. decisions must be
made&lt;br/&gt;immediately after each symbol is received.&lt;br/&gt;The
continuous case, where the input and output alphabets are the real line (or
other Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;spaces), has received immeasurable attention for over
half a century, as witnessed by major contributions&lt;br/&gt;to linear .ltering
by Wiener, Kolmogorov and Kalman, and to nonlinear .ltering by&lt;br/&gt;Donoho
and Johnstone.
