This three year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
program, Green Energy Technology for Undergraduates Program (GET-UP) at Rutgers
University was developed to address the national need for environmentally
friendly power and to this end, enrich the population of STEM professionals that
are prepared to tackle the technical challenges associated with this national
need. The proposed program will broaden its impact via recruitment of students
who may not have an opportunity to engage in undergraduate research, such as
(but not limited to) underrepresented minorities and women, students from two-
year colleges, veterans, and first-generation college and economically
disadvantaged students. The intellectual focus of GET UP centers around three
thrusts: nanotechnology and materials, renewable and sustainable fuels, and
devices and energy management systems and civil structures for energy
generation, conversion and storage. New components have been added to the
program to enhance GET UP fellows' self-efficacy in STEM: an industrial advisory
board and a workshop and study on gender implicit bias for programmatic
transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of GET UP are to: (1) engage
undergraduate (UG) students in innovative "green" science and engineering
research over 10 weeks during the summer, (2) provide UG scholars with
professional development and academic enrichment programs and (3) foster UGs'
understanding of science, technology and engineering and math (STEM). REU
scholars will spend the majority of their time conducting research, while the
remaining time will be allotted for professional and academic development,
seminars, field trips, and social events aimed at developing student-faculty
interaction and student-student communication. Students will be supported during
the academic year through e-mentoring and funding for publication of papers and
travel to technical conferences.
