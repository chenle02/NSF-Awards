The conference "Algebra, Combinatorics and Representation Theory" will take
place April 24-28, 2013 at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. The objective
of the conference is to disseminate progress in a diverse but interconnected set
of topics in Lie theory and cluster theory as well as build and maintain
connections between researchers in these various areas. Among the topics
considered will be (1) cluster algebras and cluster categories, (2) allied
geometry, including Poisson-Lie groups and moduli spaces of flat connections on
surfaces, (3) quantum groups, categorification and canonical bases, (4) the
general representation theory of Lie groups, algebras and Lie superalgebras.

The topics of the conference lie on the interface between many different areas
of mathematics, bringing together discrete mathematics (in the form of
combinatorics) with continuous mathematics (in the form of Lie theory) and
creating new and unexpected connections. By bringing together distinguished
senior mathematicians in several fields with talented young mathematicians, we
aim to create new opportunities for tying together seemingly separate fields.
The grant will provide funding for 40-45 participants with special emphasis on
graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s to attend the conference. See the following
