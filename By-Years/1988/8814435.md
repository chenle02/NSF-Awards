Infertility is a medical condition that has behavioral, sociocultural, and
psychosocial dimensions. In Islamic cultures it is a highly stigmatized
condition. Blame is placed on the barren married woman. While this is known, no
researcher has completed a comprehensive study of the sociocultural dimensions
of the condition. In this study the researcher will look at the beliefs and
behaviors surrounding fertility, the social consequences of infertility, the
coping strategies of infertile women and the structural and ideological factors
underlying the cultural response to infertility in Alexandria, Egypt.
Information from this project will be of use to health policy-makers and
demographers in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.
