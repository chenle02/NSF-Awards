Flights of elevated marine terraces near Cape Blanco, Oregon, have soil
chronosequences that include, from youngest to oldest, Andisols, Spodosols,
bisequal soils (Spodosols/Ultisols), and Ultisols. The goal of the project is to
determine the evolution of geochemical processes in these soils. Quantitative
changes in soil constituents over time will be determined from the geochemical
mass-balance approach and measurements of particle-size distribution, bulk
density, extractable Fe, Al, Si, and C, exchangeable bases and acidity, and
total elemental analysis (NAA and XFA). Thermodynamic stability indices will be
estimated from soil mineralogical data (petrography and XDA) and aqueous
solution- chemistry data (pH, redox potential, Fe, Al, Si, DOC, DIC in bulk
precipitation, canopy throughfall, and soil solutions collected) using the
GEOCHEM chemical-equilibrium model. The geochemical mass balances and modeling
will be used to test hypotheses regarding the origin of the parent materials
(aeolian deposition vs. weathering of beach sediments. Soil-forming processes
will be elucidated from the forementioned data and microscopic analyses (soil
micromorphology and SEM) of diagnostic soil features (melanic epipedons, placic
and ortstein horizons, and argillic horizons).
