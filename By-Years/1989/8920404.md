The broad goal of this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program is to understand better the phenomenon of photodissociation. Professor
Houston and his colleagues emphasize the study of vector correlations among
various photodissociation products, using these correlations to extract detailed
information on the photodissociation process. Using tunable vacuum ultraviolet
laser-induced fluorescence and resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization
techniques to detect photodissociation products, Houston is studying both
triatomic molecules most amenable to insightful comparison with theoretical
treatments and larger systems, particularly events producing three
photofragments. Vector correlations are revealed through Doppler profile
measurements on state-selected fragments; state-selected three-dimensional
velocity profiles are extracted from an analysis of a two-dimensional projection
of the full velocity profile.
