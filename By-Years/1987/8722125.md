The separation of cells is accomplished by subjecting the aqueous suspension
containing cells to cross electric and magnetic fields. These fields cause the
cells to drift and the drift velocity is a complex function of cell structure,
cell size and the operating conditions such as the strengths of and the phase
shift between the two fields. The feasibility of the technique has been
successfully demonstrated in Phase I experiments, in which a latex and three
mammalian cells were separated. In this Phase-II project, flow systems will be
constructed and tested, better resolutions for cell sorting will be obtained,
and a theory will be established for predicting dependence of the cell drift
velocity on the operating conditions as well as the structure and size of the
cell. Successful results from the project would lead to a new technique for cell
sorting which is needed in medicine, biochemical and biomedical engineering
operations. This technique would be superior than electrophoresis in that it
requires much lower electric fields.
