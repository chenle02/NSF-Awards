9411567 Kelley The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North
Carolina State University will purchase a Hewlett-Packard 3577B Network Analyzer
and an Apple Quadra 950 Computer. The new equipment will support ongoing power
quality and efficiency research funded by the Electric Power Research Center of
North Carolina State University. Increasingly, the line-current and line-voltage
distortion produced by nonlinear loads reduces power quality and creates
unexpected high-frequency loss. One project the network analyzer will measure
line impedance to find the impact of line-current distortion on line-voltage
distortion. In a second project the network analyzer will measure transformer
and motor impedance to find excess loss due to voltage and current distortion.
The impedance measurements provide a better understanding of power system
operation with nonlinear loads and are essential to maintain power quality and
efficiency in the presence of current and voltage distortion. ***
