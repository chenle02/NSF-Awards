This award will provide partial support for a one-week school on spectrum
management to be held at the Joint ALMA Observatory offices in Santiago, Chile,
during April 7-11, 2014. The emphasis is on protection of radio astronomy
frequencies against encroachment by industry and governments throughout the
world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school will provide a comprehensive overview of
both technical and regulatory issues related to radio astronomers' use of the
spectrum. In the past few decades demands on the spectrum have increased
substantially due to increases in the demand and availability of wireless
applications. Spectrum management is an importance task for radio astronomy as
well as for other radio services, but it is not part of any academic curriculum.
The IUCAF Spectrum Management School provides an introduction to a unique
combination of technology, science and international diplomacy by experts in
this field. Radio astronomers interested in pursuing this area will get valuable
training via this school; the broader impact of this proposal lies in this
training.
