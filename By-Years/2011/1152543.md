In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Alan Heyduk of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of California, Irvine will develop the early transition metal chemistry of
redox-active, pincer ligands. Redox-active ligands provide a method for
facilitating multi-electron reactivity at metal centers that are traditionally
incapable of redox reactivity. Professor Heyduk's research effort will focus on
understanding the impact of metal choice and ligand substituent on both the
redox properties of these novel ligands as well as the capacity for small
molecule activation at the metal center. Systematic synthesis of ligand
derivatives will be complemented by detailed spectroscopic, electrochemical, and
computational studies to developing a deeper understanding of the electronic
interactions between redox-active ligands and coordinated metal
ions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work could lead to new homogeneous
catalysts for small molecule reactions such as water oxidation, hydrogen
production and C-H bond functionalization. Success in the former two areas could
impact energy storage strategies for alternative energy solutions such as solar
and wind. Success in C-H bond functionalization would have an impact on any area
of chemical synthesis in which it is desirable to utilize low-cost, readily
abundant chemical feedstock in an atom-economical way. The proposed work will
also provide training in both fundamental chemical sciences and in next-
generation alternative energy chemistry to the next generation of scientists.
