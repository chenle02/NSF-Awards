Abstract Hammond/Brewer Radon isotope Rn-222 is a tracer that may provide some
insight into kinetics of hydrate formation and their characteristics. Little is
know of the interaction of radon with methane. The work will focus of
measurements in the lab on the ability of Rn-222 to be incorporated into methane
hydrates as they form and its post-crystallization retention. The high-pressure
apparatus of MBARI will be used. Cores and seep samples will be collected from
the Cascadia margin and Eel River basin to measure naturally occurring Rn/CH4
ratios in hydrates. Local benthic flux measurements will characterize the carbon
dynamics in the vicinity of the hydrates. The work will establish whether Rn can
be used as a geochronometer.
