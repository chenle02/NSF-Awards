The research objective of this EArly-Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using web-enabled serious games to
conduct controlled experiments for answering questions about decision making in
systems engineering projects. A serious game is a game used for purposes other
than entertainment, such as a flight simulator for training pilots. The research
will leverage established techniques from the behavioral sciences to determine
whether subjects in the gaming intervention behave, on average, the same as
those given a traditional text-based survey. The investigation will focus on the
sunk cost phenomenon in the context of a satellite engineering project as a
study scenario. The sunk cost phenomenon has been widely studied in the
behavioral sciences community, so it provides a solid frame of reference for
this investigation. A web-enabled framework for game-based experimentation will
be created to support this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this
research will have a significant impact on systems engineering research. The
need for research on systems engineering methods is apparent: many of the
largest systems engineering projects incur significant delays, cost overruns,
and often fail to meet stated performance objectives. However, to date the
systems engineering research community lacks a framework for controlled
experimentation for evaluating proposed methods. This limits research progress
and impedes new method adoption. The game-based approach investigated in this
research can serve this role. This research also will contribute new evidence
about the sunk cost effect in engineering decision making. Prior studies of sunk
cost have not focused on engineers or engineering decisions, so this new data
can provide important insight into one problem that potentially plagues
engineering projects.
