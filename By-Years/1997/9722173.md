9722173 McCammon New theoretical and computational methods for computer
simulation studies of biomolecular systems will be developed. These methods will
be applied to help explain the activity of several systems of chemical and
biological interest. The new methods will include extensions of the molecular
dynamics simulation method, with modifications to allow for faster sampling and
quantum dynamical features. Applications will be made to acetylcholinesterase
and other biomolecules. The goal of this work is to develop new theoretical and
computational methods to investigate the structure and function and interactions
of biological macromolecules. Biological macromolecules that serve as receptors
for biologically active molecules, such as hormones, and flexible molecules;
computer simulations describe the structural adjustments of the molecules as
they interact. The basic understanding of these molecular interactions is the
key to many practical applications, including rational drug design. ***
