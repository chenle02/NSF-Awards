We propose to continue for three more years the research program currently
supported by NSF Grant ATM-8721669. Most of the work will fall into one of three
areas: (1) incoherent scatter research, particularly at high altitudes, (2)
auroral radar studies, and (3) studies of temperate latitude E-region plasma
instabilities similar to those seen at the equator, and perhaps also temperate
latitude spread F. Some effort may also be devoted to PMSE (polar mesospheric
summer echoes) research. In most of these areas an active research program is
already underway; in some cases the program has existed for a number of years
and has produced a substantial scientific return.
