For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant
inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to
enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on
the Jones polynomial in knot theory, and to recent progress in the geometric
Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and
n-category theory. In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists
with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for
solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K
theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau
manifolds and string compactifications, and to the use of modular forms and
other arithmetic techniques. The depth, power, and novelty of the results
obtained in both fields thanks to their interaction is truly mind
boggling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project initiates a biennial series of large
meetings bringing together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas
related to string theory. The nature of interactions between mathematicians and
physicists has been thoroughly transformed in recent years. String theory, as
well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which
gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. By now
there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and
physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic
fields. The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and
ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory. Our conference
will stimulate further research in both fields, and will help establish and
deepen the interactions between them.
