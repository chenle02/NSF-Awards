Purdue University seeks funds for a three-year program to enhance middle and
high school mathematics teachers in teaching mathematics as communication. This
will be accomplished through two-week workshops held in each of three
consecutive summers as well as monthly meetings during the school year. During
the second summer, ten of the original participants will serve as teacher-
leaders to help enhance 35 new participants. During the third summer, 35
teachers from the first two years will be invited back. There teachers will act
as teacher-researchers, developing suitable teaching and learning methods which
will be edited and disseminated by the Principal Investigator. They will also
prepare to serve as teachers-teaching-teachers, conducting approximately 35
half-day workshops for their colleagues. Sixty-five middle and high school
teachers will receive first-level enhancement, and 350 additional teachers
should receive second-level enhancement through the half-day workshops. In all,
415 teachers and administrators will be enhanced. Purdue University's cost-
sharing will account for 15% of the NSF budget. Mathematics as communication is
one of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards which needs
further research, development and implementation. This project should help
accomplish these goals.
