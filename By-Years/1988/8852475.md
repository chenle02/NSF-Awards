This data acquisition and analysis laboratory supports a unique applied
scientific computing program at this institution. Students in this program study
digital electronics, interfacing, science applications and carry on individual
computing projects. In their courses, they gain experience in using off-the-
shelf interfacing equipment and software and develop their own versions for data
acquisition and instrument control. Because of its simplicity, this lab is also
used by other science majors at this institution. This award is being matched by
an equal sum from the grantee.
