McKeegan&lt;br/&gt;0421795&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides continued
support of the UCLA ion microprobe laboratory as a national facility for
research in the earth and planetary sciences. It enables access to the facility
by qualified external investigators. In addition, it permits: (1) Further
development of analytical methods that take advantage of the unique strengths of
SIMS for in situ analyses of isotopic abundances relevant to problems in
geochemistry and geochronology; (2) Hardware upgrades to critical components of
the UCLA CAMECA ims 1270 that will significantly extend its life as a state-of-
the-art instrument; and (3) Development of an education and outreach program
focused upon K-12 students and teachers and establishment of a summer intern
program for UCLA undergraduates. Partnerships are established with the NASA
Astrobiology Institute and with the California Science Project in order to
leverage education and outreach opportunities. Data produced from the UCLA
national ion microprobe facility have led to an array of significant discoveries
in fields ranging from tectonics and igneous processes to sedimentary processes,
paleoclimatology and paleobiology, the earliest history of the Earth and the
origin and early evolution of the Solar System that have been detailed in 120
scientific articles since 1995. Presently, nearly three dozen NSF-supported
projects are reliant upon the facility to conduct research in these diverse
fields. Based upon current interest levels, we expect that the unique
capabilities of the high-resolution ion microprobe will remain in high demand in
the coming years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
