This project is supporting two cohorts of financially disadvantaged students to
address the shortage of labor, women, and underrepresented groups in computer
science and related disciplines. Each scholarship is being awarded for four
years to remove the financial barrier to degree completion. Sixteen S-STEM
scholars in 2013 and 15 in 2014 are being selected based on (1) NSF
citizenship/residence requirements, (2) financial need as determined by the
FAFSA, (3) academic qualification, (4) personal qualities (e.g., leadership),
and (5) contribution to the diversity of the computer science student body.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives include (1) identifying and
recruiting students with interest and high potential in computer science, with
priority given to women and underrepresented groups, (2) improving retention
through cohort class enrollments, S-STEM tutor networks, and enriched
interactions between S-STEM scholars and existing academic support units and
student groups, (3) providing internship and research opportunities to S-STEM
scholars for timely professional development, and (4) gathering feedback to
refine the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is
creating interactions with different campus units and examining financial,
social, support structure, curriculum, and environmental factors that contribute
to the lack of women and underrepresented groups in computer science. S-STEM
cohorts are serving as focus groups to examine the computer science education at
the university, including curriculum, counseling, mentoring, professional
development, and extracurricular activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The scholarships are allowing financially disadvantaged and debt-averse
students to focus more on their degrees. Recruitment activities focus on women
and underrepresented students to reestablish their critical mass in the program.
Project results and findings are being disseminated through a web portal and
education publications.
