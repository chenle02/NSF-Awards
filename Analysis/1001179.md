In many problems in physics and engineering the relevant energies are
proportional to the square of the velocity. The resulting equations are linear
and model very well small variations from equilibrium. But more substantial
variations are better modeled by considering non-quadratic energies. In this
proposal we study some aspects of the mathematical theory of the equations that
result from the minimization of energies (or other quantities in physics and
engineering) that are given by power laws of the type "Energy is approximatley
the sum of the absolute values of velocity raised to the pth power", for p
different from 2. The minimizers of these non-quadratic energies are p-harmonic
functions. When the energy is quadratic (p=2) the resulting equations are
linear, but for non-quadratic energies we are necessarily led to non-linear
equations. Recently Peres and Sheffield found an unexpected connection between
random Tug-of-War games and p-harmonic functions. Motivated by these
considerations we introduce the class of p-harmonious functions and explore its
relationship to the classical p-harmonic functions. In particular, p-harmonious
functions serve as very good discrete approximations to p-harmonic functions and
suggest novel approaches to some long-standing open problems.

The possible impact on other sciences comes from the connection between
p-harmonic and p-harmonious functions and stochastic games. It may shine new
light into some optimization problems that can be formulated in spaces quite
more general than Euclidean space (graphs, trees, length spaces). The more
immediate impact will be on human resources. The PI will use the formulation of
Tug-of-War games in simple graphs to mentor several freshman students who used
computer simulation to run these games, and are exposed to mathematical thinking
early in their undergraduate career. The PI current graduate student will
graduate in December 2010. The PI will mentor a postdoc in Analysis funded by
the University of Pittsburgh for the duration of this project.
