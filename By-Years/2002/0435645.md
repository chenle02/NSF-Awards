The DLESE Climate Change Collection is an exploratory project to develop a
process whereby high-quality, annotated thematic collections can be developed
for DLESE. The theme of the collection effort, which will identify and annotate
at least 50 seminal resources, will be climate change and variability. As an
experiment in digital science education collection development, the effort will
bring together a community of experts through an interdisciplinary review board
supported by an extended network of climate scientists and educational
researchers, developers, and practitioners. The work will improve the DLESE
collection in an exceedingly important area of the Earth sciences, while
producing and refining a protocol for collection-building that can be
transferred to other Earth science topics.
