This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Matthew Zinkgraf is "Transcriptional Regulation and Gene
Networks Underlying Vascular Cambium Development in Populus". The host
institutions for the fellowship are the US Forest Service and the University of
California, Davis and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Andrew Groover and
Vladimir Filkov.

The research will lead to a more fundamental understanding of secondary, woody
growth in trees. Secondary growth is an important part of the carbon cycle,
specifically carbon sequestration, and an integral aspect of forest ecology. The
training objectives of this project include learning opportunities in advanced
molecular genetic techniques and computational biology for the Fellow and the
development of an independent career. Broader impacts include mentoring
undergraduate students, professional development, and public outreach to
communities in California and Wisconsin.

The proposed research focuses on secondary growth, the radial growth of woody
tree stems from the vascular cambium meristem. Secondary growth presents
opportunities to understand fundamental aspects of tree growth that are of
direct economic and environmental importance. This project will use genomic
tools to characterize transcription factors that regulate gene expression during
secondary growth in the model forest tree, Populus. This will allow for the use
advanced computational methods to examine fundamental features of
transcriptional regulation during secondary growth, including the role of
combinatorial binding of transcription factors in regulating gene expression,
and the topology of transcriptional networks. The outcomes of the research will
lead to a fuller understanding of the genes and gene networks involved in
secondary growth in trees, important to carbon cycling and ecology.
