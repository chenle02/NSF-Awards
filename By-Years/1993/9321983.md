9321983 Tyndall This Americas Program award will support a collaboration between
Timothy Tyndall, Pacific Rim Network (PRN) of Santa Barbara, CA, and the State
Distance Learning University (SDLU) of San Jose, Costa Rica. The mission of the
Pacific Rim Network is to build an electronic bridge linking research and
development resources in the sciences, technologies, education and business
fields on countries around the Pacific basin. Working towards that goal, the
immediate objective of this proposal is to establish the initial cooperative
international site in Costa Rica, with the SDLU serving as a Central American
Hub. The long-term significance of the Pacific Rim Network will be to assist
undeveloped regional areas in the attainment of global networking self-
sufficiency, and to improve the overall Pacific Rim economy by promoting
transnational information and communication sharing unhindered by geographic or
cultural barriers. As a result, the level of scientific knowledge and
technological proficiency in participating countries will improve. ***
