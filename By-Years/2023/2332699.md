With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSI Program), this planning project aims to develop an immersive
virtual engineering laboratory that caters to the needs of students with
disabilities, providing them with a transformative learning experience within an
inclusive framework. In STEM education, engineering focuses on design, problem-
solving, and construction. Preparing students for engineering roles necessitates
a balance between theoretical instruction and practical exploration. However,
traditional engineering laboratories frequently overlook the specific needs of
students with disabilities, limiting their active engagement and learning
outcomes. This challenge is especially evident given the significant number of
students with disabilities in the U.S., the distinct barriers they face in STEM
education, and the notable presence of both Hispanic/Latinx students and those
with disabilities at Florida International University (FIU). To address this
challenge, the research team will collaborate with the Disability Resource
Center, the Center for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Center for Diversity
and Student Success at FIU to develop an immersive virtual engineering
environment that caters to the needs of students with disabilities, providing
them with a transformative learning experience within an inclusive framework. By
incorporating digital twin models and extended reality (XR) technologies, the
study aims to bridge the gap between current teaching pedagogy and student
needs, ultimately enhancing educational accessibility and equity for students
with disabilities. This project aims to overcome the common barriers faced by
students with disabilities by creating an inclusive and immersive learning
environment. This innovative fusion of technology holds the potential to
significantly enhance the learning experience and outcomes of students with
disabilities, enabling students with diverse backgrounds and learning needs to
participate in their STEM education actively and effectively.

This project strives to provide actionable insights and solutions tailored to
the needs of students with disabilities, aiming to enrich their academic
experiences and boost their success in STEM education. By conducting surveys,
ethnographic research, and interviews, the research team will delve into the
unique needs and characteristics of students with disabilities in their STEM
education experience. The creation of an inclusive virtual engineering
laboratory, utilizing digital twin models combined with XR technologies, will
redefine traditional learning methods, opening up novel avenues for student
engagement. This technology-driven approach promises to transform the landscape
of STEM education, empowering students with diverse learning needs to engage
themselves actively and effectively in their engineering courses. The end goal
is to champion inclusivity, elevate educational opportunities, and ensure
academic achievements for students with disabilities. The HSI Program aims to
enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects
supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve
these aims.
