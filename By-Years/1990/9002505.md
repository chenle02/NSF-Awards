A symposium entitled "From Symmetries to Strings: Forty Years of Rochester
Conferences" will be held May 4-5, 1990 at the University of Rochester. The
purpose of this symposium is to review theoretical and experimental developments
in elementary particle physics, and to assess where we stand in this field. The
speakers will be experts from numerous areas of theoretical and experimental
research. At the present moment, there exist many theoretical conjectures
concerning possible physics beyond what has already been seen in the laboratory.
New machines are just starting to produce data which may test some of these
ideas. A symposium to assess where we stand will serve the very useful function
of focussing our thinking as the new data begins to be available.
