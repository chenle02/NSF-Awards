The primary objective of this proposal is to continue paleontological
exploration of cave deposits in the Otavi Mountains of northern Namibia. During
the past year Conroy and colleagues discovered in this area the first Miocene
hominoid known from southern Africa. The fossil has been named Otavipithecus and
it exhibits a number of features which differentiate it from other middle
Miocene hominoids from Eurasia and other areas of Africa. Dating by association
places Otavipithecus between 12 and 14 MYA. A number of other deposits have been
identified in the Otavi region which require systematic exploration. The
discovery of three separate fossil faunas at the Otavi site of Berg Aukas (both
Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene) will allow the investigators to track faunal and,
by inference, paleoecological changes through rime in this part of Africa. The
discovery of Otavipithecus significantly extends the range of hominoids in this
time period. As a result hypotheses which view East Africa and/or Eurasia as the
foci for hominoid evolution may need to be re-evaluated. Indications are that
Miocene Namibia was relatively humid in contrast to the semi-arid conditions of
Oligocene and modern Namibia. The Otavi deposits have great potential for
providing information on vertebrate evolution and paleoclimate and ecological
change in Southern Africa over a span of 16 million years.
