The focus of this research is the preparation of noble-gas and tritium
containing fullerene compounds. NMR studies allow the structural determination
of many of the compounds and the potential for using the compounds as tracers
for geochemical as well as biochemical studies will be probed. The structure and
reactivity of the tritium-containing fullerene will also be studied. With this
renewal award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of Drs.
Martin Saunders and R. James Cross of the Department of Chemistry at Yale
University. The focus of the research involves the preparation of fullerene
compounds containing noble gases. These noble-gas compounds have great potential
for use as tracers in geochemical and biochemical experiments.
