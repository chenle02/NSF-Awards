The chemistry of solid state ternary nitride compounds will be explored, the
structure of the compounds determined, and the electrical and magnetic
properties of new phases measured. Ternary compounds containing an
electropositive element from the alkalai, alkaline earth, or rare earth family
and a transition or post-transition element will be synthesized.
