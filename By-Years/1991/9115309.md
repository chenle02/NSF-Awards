The objective of this US-Poland research project between Dr. Jurg X. Saladin of
the University of Pittsburgh and Drs. W. Nazarewicz, S. Cwick, and Z. Szymanski
of the University of Warsaw is to study nuclei under conditions of extreme
rotational velocities. In the mass 70 to 80 region, the studies will focus on
properties of rotational bands which are characterized by rapid changes as a
function of the number of protons and neutrons and as a function of angular
frequency. The researchers will determine quantities of the moments of inertia,
electromagnetic transition rates, spin alignment, signature splitting and
signature inversion. They will interpret the results of these measurements by
means of cranked shell model calculations, which include Strutinsky averaging
and take into account the effects of the pairing interaction. They will search
for electric molecule transitions in the mass 80 region using an array of mini-
orange electron spectrometers. Monopole transitions depend on the mixing of
bands with different shapes and on the changes in the rms radius. The
researchers will study the decay of superdeformed bands in the rare earth region
into bands of normal deformation using the same measurements. They will also
study the octupole effects in the actinide region. This project in theoretical
nuclear physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge
by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
