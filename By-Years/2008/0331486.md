Mathematical methods have become important tools in analyzing the spread and
control of infectious diseases and in the analysis of alternative interventions
in the case of newly emerging diseases, naturally occurring epidemics of
traditional diseases, and deliberate attacks using biological weapons. Much is
to be gained by extending the mathematical tradition by making use of the
powerful tools of modern computer science. This project is based on the belief
that partnerships among computer scientists, mathematical scientists,
biologists, and epidemiologists can lead to important new contributions to the
usefulness of such methods, and in particular on the belief that opening lines
of communication between computer scientists and mathematicians interested in
problems of epidemiology but coming at them from completely different
perspectives can stimulate important new developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will support the work of postdoctoral fellows at DIMACS, the Center for
Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. The students have
mathematical and computer science backgrounds, and are interested in
epidemiological applications. The effort will focus on control theory models of
virus dynamics, chemostat models describing the competition of several organisms
for a single nutrient, and on influenza modeling. Additionally, they will work
on applying powerful methods of modern data mining to the developing DIMACS
efforts in data cleaning of public health data, biosurveillance, and
bioterrorism sensor location. In the most exploratory part of the project, the
students will participate in work related to other's special interests, with the
mathematicians working on ways to use control theory in biosurveillance and the
computer scientists working on ways to use methods of data mining in flu
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;
