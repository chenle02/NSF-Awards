0922927&lt;br/&gt;Wirth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a variable pressure sample chamber scanning electron microscope (VP-SEM)
equipped with cathodoluminescence (CL) and energy dispersive spectrometers
(EDS). The VP-SEM will support the research and teaching activities of five
principle investigators spanning the Departments of Geology, Biology, Physics
and Environmental Studies. PI and student research topics ranging from
paleoclimate investigations to vertebrate paleontology to igneous and
metamorphic petrology will be facilitated by the capabilities of the requested
instrument for microtextural and semi-quantitative chemical characterization.
Macalester College is an undergraduate institution with a strong track record of
promoting the engagement of students in research. Students trained in modern
microscopy research methods are well prepared for the technical job market where
materials microcharacterization is a critical element. &lt;br/&gt;
