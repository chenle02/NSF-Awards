During the past three years a 3D, interactive, web-based computer graphics
system called The Optics Project on the Web (WebTOP) was developed that helps
students in introductory physics classes and upper-level optics classes learn
optics. WebTOP contains sixteen different modules, and has a scripting feature
that allows the user to record an interactive session and play it back later.
This system was developed under an NSF CCLI proof of concept grant. Faculty
members and students at seven different universities have used it for in-class
demonstrations and for homework assignments. Student evaluations of WebTOP have
shown that it helps students visualize and understand optical phenomena.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project fully develops WebTOP and disseminates
it nationally. The objectives are as follows. (1) To use a team of seven optics
and physics education experts from universities across the nation to develop a
set of web-based tutorials that use WebTOP modules and directed discovery
questions (with detailed solutions) to teach the basic principles of optics. (2)
To give the entire physics and engineering community nationally an opportunity
to adapt WebTOP to their own needs by developing a script editing tool for
WebTOP scripts and by making WebTOP open source. (3) To create three new modules
for WebTOP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a system with nineteen
modules and thirteen tutorials and builds a nationwide set of university users.
