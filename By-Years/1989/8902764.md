The research is to design and build an interactive system for high speed
electrical simulation of digital and analog circuits. Characteristics of the
system are: simple to use, programmable, much faster than highly optimized
simulators, capable of hierarchical and mixed mode simulation, and able to
produce efficient code for parallel processors. Logical simulators have been
greatly speeded up by compiling each circuit into a program to simulate that one
circuit. Still, each kind of simulation requires that a separate circuit
compiler be written and debugged. This research is extending this methodology
from logical to electrical simulation. It is also general, in that it compiles a
pair consisting of a circuit and a conventional interpretive simulator. The
approach uses partial evaluators to do this compilation. Signals are implemented
as real data values that can be assigned to variables, be put in data
structures, and be arguments to signal processing functions. This allows a
signal produced by a simulation to be used as a voltage or current source in a
subsequent or simultaneous simulation. The proposed research is meritorious,
relevant, and the approach is innovative. The prototype work of the P.I. is
promising. Simulation is an important area, and the research will improve the
state of the art in electrical simulation, making a fundamental advance. Results
could be applied to a wide variety of simulation programs and computationally
intensive programs. Professor Weise has already a distinguished record of
achievement in IC design simulation, and should make significant contributions
to the field.
