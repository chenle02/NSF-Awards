To dissipate vibratory energy in structures the coulomb damping or dry friction
can be very effectively used. The friction can also be effectively used to
control sliding in the base isolation devices of a structure during earthquakes.
To extend the earlier studies, the bi- axial sliding and the effect of vertical
acceleration under multicomponent excitations of more realistic multi-degree-of-
freedom structures are necessary. Besides the study of the base isolation
effects of a sliding foundation with Coulomb damping, it is also of interest to
study the possibility of permitting the floor slabs to slide relative to the
supporting frame with the purpose of dissipating energy as well as isolating the
supported secondary systems. The idea of friction isolation and energy
dissipation by using sliding floors is new and innovative. If successful, the
concept could provide a viable alternative design procedure to reduce the
vibratory effects of earthquakes on structures. This project covers only the
essential analytical studies necessary towards gaining a sufficient
understanding to the seismic response characteristics of structures having
sliding floor slabs.
