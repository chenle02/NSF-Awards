Endogenous Opioid Regulation of Synaptic Transmission in the Dentate Gyrus An
important role of endogenous neuropeptide transmitters in brain function is
suggested by their prevalence and diversity. Understanding how these molecules
may normally function as potential neurotransmitters requires that we know what
controls their release, where they act, and what effects they have. We have made
substantial progress in answering these questions for endogenous opioid peptides
in the hippocampus by characterizing the molecular forms of the peptides
present, the distribution of the receptor sites, and the pharmacological effects
of opioids in each of the principal regions of the hippocampus. Further work is
required to define the effects of endogenously- released opioids on hippocampal
neurons. Information obtained from this study will allow us to construct a
detailed description of the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the
hippocampal neural network and provide a model of neuropeptide action in normal
hippocampal physiology associated with learning and memory processes.
