This project is to support US-based scientists to attend the NSF/India
Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) Workshop to be
held in Bangalore, India, December 21-22, 2011. The participants include
students and junior faculty from a cross-section of institutions and a cross-
section of disciplines. The ground-floor participation of these investigators
will help define the field, foster future collaborations, leverage strengths,
and explore mechanisms for joint work. The US team will actively attend the
workshop roundtables, describe their ongoing research, and point the way for
future developments in the field. A final report articulating the essence of the
workshop and the strengths of the collaborating teams will be made.

A consequence of the massive proliferation of computers in all walks of life,
scientific and social, has been the generation of large volumes of multi-
dimensional data. The challenge of extracting actionable information from such
large datasets has spawned the notion of the field Computational and Data-
Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E). For CDS&E to emerge as a viable
scientific discipline, a multi-disciplinary and multi-national approach is
envisioned. With the above in mind, this exploratory workshop in CDS&E aims to
define the field, to address the major problems that it poses, to catalyze new
thinking paradigms and practices, and in general to nurture collaborations among
researchers in this nascent research area. The participation of the US-based
scientists in the workshop will contribute to the development of CDS&E as a new
academic discipline and will serve as a prototype for developing architectures
for new Virtual Institutes.
