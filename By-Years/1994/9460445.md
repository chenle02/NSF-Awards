This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
stable sensors suitable for long-term measurement of dissolved oxygen in
seawater. Measurement of the dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical to
understanding mixing processes and oceanic circulation as well as for the
description of water masses. At present there are no stable sensors suitable for
long-term (multi-year) monitoring of dissolved oxygen. Random Technologies
recognizes the need for stable long-term sensors and is proposing the
development of a reagentless optical oxygen sensor to fill this need. During the
Phase I effort a laboratory version of this dissolved oxygen measurement system
will be demonstrated. Portable prototype instruments for field use will be
developed during Phase II.
