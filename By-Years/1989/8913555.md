This Expedited Award for Novel Research is to support a demonstration experiment
on the advantages of employing an oscillatory, "breathing" mode of convective
cooling of electronic products and devices. Cooling efficiency, heat transfer,
power, vibration, and noise are to be compared for several typical packaging
arrangements and distributions of heat sources within the package, with either
oscillatory or steady cooling. A greater cooling efficiency, if demonstrated for
this concept, would lead to greater packaging density and smaller device and
product volume, a great advantage for electronic products and devices.
