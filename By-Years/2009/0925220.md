"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop a fabrication technique for producing complicated gradient-index
electromagnetic components in the millimeter-wave and terahertz spectral bands.
The approach is to modify existing rapid-prototyping hardware and fabrication
polymers to yield a system capable of producing arbitrary 3D index profiles via
an effective-medium approach. The ability to produce such profiles in these
spectral bands will enable new component designs of significant elegance and
utility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research explores how
effective-medium approaches can be combined with rapid-prototyping to fabricate
gradient-index electromagnetic structures. Novel prototyping materials, design
strategies, and gradient-index components will also be developed in this
project. This effort will contribute to the understanding and engineering of
these structures and provide new ways of thinking about these components, design
strategies, and fabrication methods. In addition, it will lay the groundwork for
further research into fabrication of more complicated electromagnetic components
in these spectral bands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The development of
a practical fabrication method for 3D components in the millimeter-wave and
terahertz bands will impact many applications across the sciences and
engineering---including medical imaging, security screening, astronomy,
manufacturing and process control, as well as a host of communications and radar
applications. The results from this research will be incorporated in a number of
outreach activities including traditional academic courses, seminars for the
academic and industrial communities, multidisciplinary design projects for
undergraduates, and enrichment activities for at-risk students from diverse
backgrounds.
