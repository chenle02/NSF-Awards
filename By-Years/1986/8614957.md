This project develops methods for studying the failure of anchored and
unanchored liquid storage tanks subjected to seismic loads and applies these
methods to prototypical and scaled structures to provide an understanding of
damage mechanisms. Phenomena such as buckling, lift- off, and interaction of the
structure with the contained fluid are being considered. With the use of
supercomputers, understanding of the influence of these factors can be gained
through simulation. The emphasis is placed on determining which phenomena are
crucial to explaining damage. Efforts are also made to correlate the computer
simulations with prototype data, as well as the limited shake table test data
from available sources. This will help to advance the data base for liquid
storage tank design and also to provide a firm basis for incorporating
refinements into existing design codes.
