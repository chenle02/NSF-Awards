This project addresses the important question of whether gas phase reactions
between ammonia and organic acids can lead to enhanced formation of secondary
organic aerosol (SOA) through the formation of amino-organic compounds. A series
of laboratory experiments will be performed to measure and characterize - under
differing temperature and relative humidity regimes - SOA formation rate and
mechanism in the presence of ammonia for a variety of atmospherically relevant
hydrocarbons. This exploratory study could potentially reconcile some important
outstanding issues with respect to SOA formation pathways leading to observed
fine particulate mass concentrations - of especially high relevance as the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency promulgates national ambient air quality
standards for fine particulate matter. The educational component supports a
postdoctoral researcher, graduate student and two undergraduates at the host
institution.
