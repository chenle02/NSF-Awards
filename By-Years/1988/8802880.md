The purpose of this program is to: 1) provide disabled children and adults with
an improved educational experience and a more self-sufficient capability, 2)
provide superlative training for the engineering student who designs, builds and
implements a device to help a person in need; this "real world" experience will
certainly generate great motivation and foster an engineering education with a
unique sense of purpose and pride, 3) provide the engineering school with an
opportunity to perform a unique service to the community, 4) provide the
bioengineering academic community an opportunity to build infrastructure with
the university.
