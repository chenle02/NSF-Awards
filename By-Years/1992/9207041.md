Previous experimental studies and observations from natural crystals indicate
that there is a miscibility gap between ulvospinel and magnetite. The position
and shape of the miscibility gap are poorly understood. Magnetite and magnetite-
ulvospinel minerals re important carriers of permanent rock magnetism. The
location of the miscibility gap for each composition with respect its Curie
Temperature and the investigation o the changes in the magnetic properties
associated with changes in mineralogy due to unmixing, coarsening, and
microstructural development will provide new insights into the links between
exsolution and lock magnetism.
