9423665 Ashley The proposed research involves a molecular systematic study of
the mammalian order Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and their
close relatives the Pholidota (pangolins or scaly anteaters). The relationships
among these taxa and with other mammalian orders remain controversial.
Establishing or refuting the position of the Xenarthra as a basal lineage of
mammals is critical for interpreting the overall pattern of mammalian evolution.
%%% In addition the data will provide important information on the biogeographic
history of the group from its South American origin and dispersal to Central
American and the Antilles. If xenarthrans are closely related to pangolins which
are known from Africa, Asia and Europe and possibly North America it suggests a
testable hypothesis, divergence of these groups that would have predated the
separation of Africa and South America which occurred 85 million years ago. This
would push back considerably the timing of the radiation of eutherian mammals.
