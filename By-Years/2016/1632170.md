backgrounds to meet and discuss the latest research in systems software. USENIX
ATC16 will be held in Denver, CO from June 22-24, 2016 and will consist of 3
days of the expanded ATC technical program. Co-located workshops available for

to write summaries for a later issue of ;login: magazine, will be invited to
sessions to interact with senior members of the research community specifically
interested in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be
strongly encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the
selection process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences is a
valuable and important part of the graduate school experience providing students
