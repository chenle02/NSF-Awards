*** SRI is investigating the properties of human interactions with a graphical
terrain model as they would occur in a crisis situation, with a particular
emphasis on elucidating the process of reference through natural language and
gesture. First, the research team is augmenting existing theories of discourse
salience to account for how entities are introduced through the visual display
in addition to speech, and extending theories of reference resolution by
incorporating mutually constraining effects of gesturing and properties of
linguistic referring expressions. Second, the team is studying how discourse
structure is affected by the structure of the terrain model and of the task
being executed, and how it can be determined through a combination of speech and
gestural cues. Third, they are studying how spatial terms are used in uniquely
identifying referents in a terrain model, particularly with respect to
perspective- relative relational terms. The data used are generated from a set
of wizard-of-oz sessions with an existing multimodal route-planning system. The
results of the research are demonstrated in proof-of-concept extensions to this
system, and are measured by a systematic set of evaluation methods. This
research carries out the first step toward the flexible integration of speech,
gesture, and visual display that will be required by the interactive, multimodal
systems of the future.***
