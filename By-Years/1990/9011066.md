In this project, the P.I.'s will continue numerical and analytical studies of
the propagation and evolution of strong oceanic vortices in the presence of
horizontal and vertical shears, explore mixing by mesoscale vortices and strong
eddies, and examine the influence of vertical mixing driven by surface heat
fluxes on oceanic eddies.
