This project will extend the current capabilities in the Electrical Engineering
laboratories in the areas of automated computer measurements and control.
Hardware and software will be acquired to permit measurements to be made of such
parameters as temperature, strain, the flow of liquids, and the characteristics
of liquids. The system will also allow students to control and interface with a
much wider range of motors, valves, sensors, and a vision system. It will
provide students with a rich environment in which to develop various circuits to
perform relevant tasks in measurement and control. The overall project is
planned so as to equip students to make meaningful contributions in such areas
as manufacturing, chemical process control, and pollution monitoring.
