This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award entitled Fish
Biodiversity Research and Education in Kenya provides a diverse group of US
biology students from Tulane University and nearby historically Black
universities in New Orleans with a program of language and cultural training and
collaborative fish biodiversity research in Kenya. In each of the three award
years, one graduate and three undergraduate students will travel to Kenya for
field and laboratory research with collaborators at the National Museums of
Kenya and the University of Nairobi. Prior to the five-week summer research
experience, students will be trained in biodiversity research methods in the
laboratory of US PI Henry Bart and culture and Kenyan language training at
Tulane during the academic year.

The IRES program will train a cadre of undergraduate and graduate students in
scientific methods and motivate them to pursue academic research careers and
contribute to the U.S. scientific workforce. Participants will gain experience
in all phases of scientific research from developing research questions and data
gathering, to final publication and other forms of dissemination of research
results. The project will leverage information and resources from the
Cypriniformes Tree of Life Project. For the international collaborators, the
project will help to build research capacity and infrastructure in the
Ichthyology Section of the National Museums of Kenya, and will assist the
country?s nascent effort to develop into a regional center for ichthyological
research. Finally, from an institutional perspective, this project will serve as
a model for international research and education programs across the curriculum.
