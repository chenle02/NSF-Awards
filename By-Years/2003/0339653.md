0339653&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project concerns the development of a new Bragg grating-based technology
consisting of optical fibers and integrated optical polymer waveguides. The
proposed sensor system can be used for acoustic emission monitoring and
inspection of large civil structures made of steel and concrete such as bridges,
dams, towers, freeways, and buildings. The hybrid Bragg grating sensor system is
expected to demonstrate high sensitivity to stress waves in a wide frequency
range, from&lt;br/&gt;DC to 2MHz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology
can be extended to include the growing market involved in acoustic emission,
ultrasonic testing, medicalultrasonic imaging, and other NDT equipment testing
technology. A secondary market sector that can utilize the integrated optical
waveguide technology is optical cross connect and fiber optic instrumentation.
