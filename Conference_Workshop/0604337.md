he 2006 Barrett Lectures is a conference in geometric topology which will take
place at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, April 29-May 1, 2006. The
proposal is for partial support of this conference.

The 2006 Barrett Lectures is a conference on a core area of mathematics, which
will bring together researchers from across the country in order to disseminate
scientific knowledge and encourage collaboration. In particular, the conference
will help young researchers gain the experience they need to initiate a solid
research program. The requested funding will be used to cover travel expenses
for graduate students and new Ph.D.s. More information can be found on the
conference homepage http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/
