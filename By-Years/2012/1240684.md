The project is a follow-on to the discovery that there are very young UHP rocks
exposed on islands near the eastern tip of Papua New Guinea (PNG). A major
objective is to use detailed study of this area to better understand how UHP
rocks get to the surface from great depth. Because the rocks are in a
tectonically active region, it can be argued that there is a good chance of
improving models for UHP exhumation because this example is still in its
tectonic context. There is evidence that the process is ongoing. Related to this
objective is the study of the overall tectonic evolution of this area, which is
needed in order to help understand how the UHP rocks got where they are and from
whence they came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this framework, this project
involves a range of studies that can contribute to piecing together the UHP
exhumation history and the tectonic evolution. One large study involves passive
seismic data acquisition to image the crust and mantle beneath the area where
partially exhumed HP/UHP rocks may occur at depth; a large fraction of the
studies involve petrology, geology, mineral physics and geochemistry. In
addition, GPS work and geodynamic modeling are
included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
