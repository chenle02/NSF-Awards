A program for providing ten talented undergraduate students the opportunity to
participate in research projects in various areas of electrical and computer
engineering. The program involves coordinating the efforts of seven schools,
namely, Washington State University (including the WSU-Tri-Cities), University
of Idaho, Montana State University, Gonzaga University, Portland State
University, Seattle University and Walla Walla College, in the recruiting and
selecting of these students. At most, five students will be chosen for
Washington State University (including WSU-Tri-Cities). The students will
participate in on-going research projects in the department, and will generally
be given enough latitude to partially determine the direction of their research.
Research projects include Schottky diode modelling, modelling and parameter
extraction of field effect and bipolar transistors, numerical analysis of
shoaling waves, coded quantization for signal processing and VLSI design of an
encoder. The students will have access to modern laboratories with excellent
equipment support, and up-to-date computing facilities.
