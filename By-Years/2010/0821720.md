This proposal is to acquire a 2D Global Sizing Velocimetry (GSV), which is
essentially a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with a particle sizing system so
that both the flow velocity and the particle size can be measured
simultaneously. The GSV system to be acquired includes a high-power pulse dual
Nd:YAG laser, optics for the laser sheet generation, a high-resolution CCD
camera, a synchronizer, and the software for velocity data processing. In
addition, the mechanical and optical components for global sizing velocimetry
are included to facilitate the measurement of particle size in two-phase flows.
The proposed system is essential to elevating many on-going projects and
inspiring more research proposed.
