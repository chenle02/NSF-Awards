This is a proposal to conduct a wide-ranging program of research on the mid -
and low-latitude ionosphere. The research involves observations to be made with
a small coherent scatter radar at Clemson University and with the Jicamarca
incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and the JULIA radar near Lima, Peru. Topics to be
investigated include midlatitude sporadic E ionization layers, lower
thermospheric winds in the equatorial E region, and the response of the low
latitude ionosphere and plasmasphere to substorms. These topics have overtones
for the National Space Weather initiative as well as for the CEDAR/TIMED project
and several other CEDAR initiatives (Topside, POLITE). The proposal has
experimental and theoretical elements and should result in the development of
new radar hardware, new numerical codes, and an improved and enhanced radar
database.
