9453944 O'Leary, The Nebraska Science Enhancement Project This 48 month project
offers a four-year series of interactive satellite TV sessions on the subject of
water. The Satellite Educational and Environmental Research program already
exists and is one of the ways used in a similar project on radon to reach the
large number of teachers in remote areas of the state. The goal of the project
is to reach 100 teachers and 10,000 students in each year of the program. The
water project is organized around statewide experiments in which teachers and
their students make environmental measurements of water quality and quantity in
their communities. This data extends the Nebraska resource base for water policy
decisions. Community involvement includes presentations by school groups and
community participation in water measurement. The Regional Coalitions of the SSI
assists with recruitment, management of the downlink sites, and dissemination of
resources. This project is an expansion of a pilot conducted during 1993-94.
Cost sharing is estimated at 48%. ***
