Dr. Robert Cummins of the University of Arizona and Dr. David Kirsh of the
University of California, San Diego, are analyzing and comparing two radically
different approaches to the study of cognition and intelligence, the orthodox
"computational" approach, on the one hand, and the "new connectionist" or
parallel distributed processing approach on the other. The orthodox
computational approach takes mental processes to be analogous to the processes
in a programmed digital computer. The connectionist approach understands mental
processes as changes in patterns of activation in a network of simple neuron-
like elements. Drs. Cummins and Kirsh are undertaking a systematic analysis and
comparison of these paradigms in a scientifically and philosophically informed
way. The goals of this project are 1) to compare the research methods and
explanatory goals of the connectionist and computational approach to cognitive
science; 2) to articulate the underlying conception of cognition, intelligence
and mentality that drives exponents of each approach; and 3) to assess the
possible impact on cognitive science of the major shift of resources into
connectionist research that is currently taking place. The investigators will
carry out site visits to major centers of connectionist and orthodox
computational research. They are targeting two specific research areas for
investigation on these visits: speech perception ( a strength of connectionism)
and problem solving (a strength of the orthodox approach).
