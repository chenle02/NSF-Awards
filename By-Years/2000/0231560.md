The standard approach to modeling household intertemporal optimization is to
assign a unique utility function to the entire household, derive household Euler
equations, and then estimate intertemporal elasticities of substitution. This
research explores the use of individual Euler equations for each household
member. The focus is on the identification and estimation of individual Euler
equations when only total household consumption, individual labor supplies,
wages, and interest rates are observed. If successful, the research can inform
several key policy questions, and can potentially rationalize observed changes
in family composition and household labor supply.
