This award will support research on heat equation asymptotics with generalized
boundary conditions. The boundary conditions will be of Atiyah, Patodi, and
Singer type. The research will include a study of the Dolbeault complex for a
Hermitian matrix where the structures are not product near the boundary and the
eta invariant of a manifold with boundary. The research supported by this award
involves aspects of global analysis and spectral geometry. Global analysis
attempts to relate topological properties of a space with analytic properties.
Spectral geometry studies the relationship between the geometry of a space and
invariants of a differential operator defined on the space.
