9630095 Sollitt The objectives of the project are to make breakaway walls, used
in coastal areas subjected to the wind and wave actions of hurricanes,
predictable, safer and functional. This work will improve the understanding of
load-wall-structure interactions and the results will minimize uncertainties in
wall design and construction. Four tasks were identified to accomplish these
objectives and they are: first, to determine the behavior and capacity of wall
panels and connections; second, to predict the response of parent structure to
environmental loads transmitted by wall connections; third, to improve the
ability to quantify environmental loads acting on breakaway walls as well as the
response and modes of failure of walls interacting with these extreme loads; and
fourth, to improve the design and construction processes of breakaway walls by
incorporating knowledge garnered in the three previous tasks and by validating
the models developed with these experimental results. The first two tasks are
currently underway at North Carolina State University (NCSU). The third task
will be undertaken under the present project, and the last task will incorporate
the results of the first three tasks and will be conducted at NCSU. ***
