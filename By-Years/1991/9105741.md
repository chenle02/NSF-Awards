Subduction zone processes involve considerable changes in mass, energy and
conditions of materials as sea floor is subducted to mantle depths. The goal of
this project is to construct numerical models incorporating heat transfer,
induced mantle convection, fluid flow paths, and phase equilibria of minerals
undergoing metamorphism. The model will predict pressure- temperature-time paths
for rocks in the subducting slab and the overlying mantle wedge as a function of
the initial thermal structure, convergence rate, and angle of subduction,
duration of subduction and similar parameters. The model will be tested against
rocks preserved in paleo-subduction zones including the Catalina Schist and
Franciscan complex in California and the Japan and Lesser Antilles subduction
zones. Results are expected to provide improved insight into the processes
occurring at depth in subduction zones and the generation of arc magmas.
