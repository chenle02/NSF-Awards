Restoration of degraded communities is an important tool for basic research as
it provides an acid test of our understanding of ecological processes.
Successful restoration of communities requires a thorough understanding of
successful establishment and persistance of plant species (i.e. their
regeneration niche). Current hypotheses that explain why species may vary in
their ability to colonize and persist in communities are few and have not been
adequately tested. In this study we will analyze and compare important
regeneration niche characteristics of eight species of perennial, prairie forbs
which vary in establishment success in restoration projects. Using degraded
remnant populations of different sizes, density, and dispersion, we will analyze
pollination success, fecundity, predispersal seed predation and herbivory of
each species. We also analyze germination patterns of seeds from the remnants.
Experimental field studies will be used to determine seed longevity in the soil
bank and the effects of disturbance and cover type on seedling emergence and
survivorship. The type of study we propose is essential to understanding
successful establishment and persistance of perennials in complex communities as
well as developing successful restoration and management plans.
