Computational problems have become pervasive in all fields of science where huge
amounts of data have to be processed efficiently. For computationally hard
problems where computing the exact optimum solution is intractable, the next
best option is to design efficient approximation algorithms that find solutions
that are provably close to the optimum. In this project, the PI and the
supported graduate student will design such approximation algorithms based on
the still poorly understood Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy. The
goal is to provide better algorithms for several key problems that are studied
in combinatorial optimization. Practical applications of approximation
algorithms can be found in many areas of science and industry. Moreover, this
proposal includes the integration of research and teaching by means of graduate
courses that cover the Lasserre hierarchy in a manner accessible for graduate
students outside of theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;More
concretely, the goal is to develop approximation algorithms based on the
Lasserre SDP for outstanding unsolved problems like Directed Steiner Tree, Graph
Coloring, Unrelated Machine Scheduling and Unique Games. In particular this
means designing new rounding schemes to extract valid integral solutions and
developing the analytical techniques needed to study their effectiveness. A key
ingredient will be the development of a better understanding of the vector
embeddings for higher moments that are provided by the Lasserre SDP.
