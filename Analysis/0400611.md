Mappings of Finite Distortion

Abstract

Geometric function theory is largely concerned with generalizations of the
theory of analytic functions to higher dimensions. It turns out that the
category of maps with the same geometric and function theoretic properties of
analytic functions are the mappings of bounded distortion, also called
quasiregular mappings, or, if injective, quasiconformal mappings. Both kind of
mappings solve uniformly elliptic partial differential equations in the plane.
Moreover, these mappings preserve the natural Sobolev spaces which arise in the
study of function theory and partial differential equations on subdomains of
Euclidean n-space.

In recent years there has been another well-known theory of mappings whose ideas
have gotten to the core of geometry and analysis, non-linear elasticity theory.
The mappings which naturally occur there are not always quasiregular, but the
governing partial differential equations are the same. This forces us to move
from the classical setting of uniformly elliptic partial differential equations
to degenerate elliptic equations. Usually, however, some control of the
ellipticity bounds will be necessary to achieve concrete results. These often
take the form of integral estimates in some Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces. This is
the theory of mappings of finite distortion.

In this proposal we focus mainly on mappings of finite distortion between
subsets of the Euclidean n-space. We also emphasize the fundamental role of the
Jacobian determinant, which already has led to a very productive study of
mappings of finite distortion. The PI studies together with Haj\l asz, Iwaniec
and Mal\'y, the Jacobian determinant (the pullback of the Riemannian volume
forms) of mappings between Riemannian n-manifolds. This study makes it possible
to discover new phenomena about such mappings. Also in this proposal, we
investigate the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators on Sobolev spaces, one of the
most important tools in analysis.

Geometric function theory has been quite a successful theory, with many diverse
applications. The theory of non-linear elasticity for example was based on
practical problems from mathematics and physics. It is necessary to study non-
linear equations to understand certain physical phenomena such as bifurcation
and phase transition. Our main motivation in the theory of mappings of finite
distortion is to examine degenerate elliptic equations where important
applications lie.
