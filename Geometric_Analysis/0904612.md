We approach quaternionic analysis from the point of view of representation
theory of the conformal group SL(2,H) and its Lie algebra sl(2,H). While some
aspects of representation theory of compact groups were used in quaternionic
analysis before, using representation theory of non-compact reductive Lie groups
is entirely new. With this representation theoretic approach we intend to 1)
Develop split quaternionic analysis which, in particular, will allow us to
understand better a subtle aspect of representation theory such as the
separation of the discrete and continuous series of unitary representations. 2)
Extend the methods of split quaternionic analysis to higher dimensions in the
context of (split) Clifford analysis. This theory will yield new results
relating solutions of the wave equation, representation theory and index theory
of Dirac operators. 3) Study instantons from the point of view of quaternionic
analysis. This approach should lead to deep geometric connections with index
theory of Dirac operators and also to a direct proof of the completeness of the
ADHM construction of instantons. 4) Develop a general theory relating Feynman
integrals, homology and representation theory. This theory should explain why
many integral formulas appearing in quaternionic analysis often have the form of
a Feynman integral taken over various homology cycles, typically non-compact
ones. The PI will collaborate on this project with Igor Frenkel.

Quaternionic analysis can be thought of as a higher dimensional analogue of
complex analysis. It was significantly developed by R.Fueter in 1930's. Since
then quaternionic analysis has generated a lot of interest among mathematicians,
some results were extended from complex to quaternionic analysis, there were
found many applications to physics, but the theory of quaternionic analysis
largely remains underdeveloped. We propose to develop quaternionic analysis from
the point of view of representation theory (a branch of mathematics that studies
symmetries). This approach has already been proven very fruitful and allowed to
push further the parallel with complex analysis and develop a rich theory. It
will provide more insight into the relationship between representation theory,
geometry, quaternionic analysis, physics and PDE's. Along the way we expect to
obtain new results and explicit realizations of representations of reductive Lie
groups.
