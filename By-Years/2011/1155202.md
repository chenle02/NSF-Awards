This is a short term (less than one-year) effort to organize and plan broad US
participation and influence in the QB50 program, an international consortium to
build, launch and fly 50 CubeSats simultaneously. A US Coordination Committee
has been established to lead the effort with widespread representation of
expertise and with strong links to the QB50 program organization. A specific
product of the effort will be a report outlining a US participation plan,
including descriptions of the CubeSats US organizations intend to provide, a
participation packet and guidelines for US institutions, an easy to use
participation program for high schools and colleges that don't have satellite
programs, and policy hurdles and plan for participation in a EU led satellite
program. Broad US community input, interest, and participation will be sought
through a community workshop being conducted as part of this activity.
