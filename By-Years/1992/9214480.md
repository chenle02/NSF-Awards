This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mechanistic electrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-
year continuing grant, Professor Bard and his students will pursue fundamental
investigations of electrode reaction mechanisms, broadly defined. Four specific
electrochemical research thrusts will be pursued, namely (1) electrochemical
studies of bioconjugation, especially the interactions of small molecules with
DNA; (2) studies of the electrochemical and surface properties of fullerene-
modified electrodes; (3) applications of the scanning electrochemical microscope
to the study of fast heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions at
ultramicroelectrodes; and (4) studies of electrochemical reactions in novel
oxidation-stable solvents. %%% This research builds upon results obtained under
Dr. Bard's previous NSF grant, CHE-8901450. In addition to providing fundamental
new insights into mechanisms of heterogeneous electron transfer processes, this
research is of particular relevance to the development of biosensors and to
understanding the electrochemical properties of new materials and reactive
chemical systems.
