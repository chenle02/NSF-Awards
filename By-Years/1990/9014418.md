This project constitutes a portion of a large multi- investigator study
examining the role of the entire heterotrophic community, from bacteria to large
gelatinous zooplankton, in the recycling of primary production and its transport
to depth in the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea. The objectives of this specific
project are to quantify the biomass and consumption rates of the
microzooplankton organisms in the size range of 20-200 um. A variety of
methodologies will be employed. Profiling of the resident populations will be
made several times a day throughout the cruise. Different types of grazing
experiments will be conducted in collaboration with other researchers on the
various prey and predator groups. The project involves two major cruises to
station S off Bermuda which constitutes the Atlantic time-series site for the
JGOFS initiative. The cruises are scheduled for August 1989 and April 1990 to
coincide with productivity minima and maxima, respectively. The systematic
approach of this group project to describe and quantify the flux of primary
production through the epipelagic food-web will provide critical data on how the
composition of the zooplankton community affects the flux rate of organic
material from the euphotic zone.
