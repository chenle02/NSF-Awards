ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 0437961 Title: Interdisciplinary Workshops Linking
River Ecology and Hydrologic Modeling PI: N. LeRoy Poff

This proposal is aimed at developing the knowledge base and technical tools to
help define the ecosystem needs of rivers for freshwater. The resilience and
long-term sustainability of freshwater ecosystems are being severely challenged
by rapid global change, including increasing human demands due to population
growth and, potentially, climate change. River scientists, including ecologists
and hydrologists, urgently need to develop tools to define the hydrological
needs of these globally important ecosystems, both to support their ecosystem
functions and biodiversity, and to provide information critical for their
sustainable management. This proposal will support two workshops to bring
together river ecologists and hydrologic modelers to lay this important
foundation through the processes of synthesizing the hydro-ecological literature
and expert opinion and of hydrologic modeling using a variety of techniques. The
contributions of these workshops will be to seek consensus among international
scientists for ecosystem needs for freshwater, to enhance infrastructure for
research and education by building interdisciplinary networks among ecologists
and hydrologists from around the world, to build future capacity by involving
advanced graduate students and/or post-docs in the workshops, to broadly
disseminate workshop results both on web pages and as primary literature
publications, and to lay the foundation for a more comprehensive, 5-8 year long,
interdisciplinary, international research effort to define river ecosystem needs
on a global scale (GRSP).
