As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal Science Learning program funds innovative research,
approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings. This Exploratory
Pathways project brings together scientists and science curriculum experts with
field station leaders to study informal science learning at biological field
stations. The objective is to understand and evaluate the unique qualities of
field stations as centers of informal and enduring science learning for the non-
science community. There are over 400 field stations and represent a science
communication mechanism that if available to most US citizens. This project is a
collaboration between Texas A&M University and Colorado State University.

Field stations typically engage in informal science learning. While there are
great examples of informal learning through outreach activities at field
stations, little is known about what is happening in the aggregate at these
establishments. This project documents the outreach work of field stations and
explores the connections between how the outreach activities engage learners,
incorporate science topics, and address science learning. By creating an
Outreach Ontology, a multidimensional framework around the outreach activities,
this work provides a valuable resource and reference to informal science
researchers who seek to understand what informal learning projects are
undertaken at field stations, and how these activities fit into the broader
context of informal science learning. This project will help field stations
collaborate on improving informal STEM learning activities by bringing them
together to discuss their efforts and by developing a publicly available,
searchable database detailing their activities. A particular benefit to
advancing informal STEM learning by investigating field stations is the broad
range of people and communities that are involved with and affected by field
station outreach activities.
