The PI investigates various problems arising in quantum and classical
scattering: condensed matter physics and the study of surface states; Hawking
radiation in general relativity; chaotic dynamics in statistical systems. Like a
bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they
exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an
equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves,
recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio
between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality
factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of
the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering
graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design
of high-quality microelectrical systems.

The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called
resonance theory. It investigates natural generalizations of time-harmonic
states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies
of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances
(in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott
--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the
typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts
describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are
the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of
the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic
distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically
deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in
periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-
hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle
resonances in dynamical systems. Natural tools include complex analysis and
Fredholm operator theory; the classical-to-quantum correspondence principle
within the microlocal framework; and partial differential equations techniques
such as multiscale analysis.
