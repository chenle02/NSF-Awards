The Marine Laboratory is a satellite campus of Duke University. Nicholas School
of the Environment, located on the coast of North Carolina near Cape Lookout and
180 miles from the main campus. Its mission is research and education in coastal
oceanography, ecology and policy. Its serves researchers, educators and students
from Duke University and from many North American overseas institutions. Many of
these user institutions have formed formal consortia with Duke University to
advance common goals, e.g., the Marine Science Education Consortium (MESU), the
Duke/University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium (D/UNCOC) and the
NOAA Cooperative Institute of Fisheries Oceanography (CIFO). As a coastal field
station serving a diverse clientele, the DUML has the expectation and obligation
to provide its users with animal care facilities for observational and
experimental studies. These facilities must: 1) comply with the ever more
rigorous USDA Animal Welfare Act and DHHS policies related to the care and use
of laboratory animals. 2) provide the highest quality sea water for the
maintenance of marine biota, and provide sea water variously processed for
research, e.g., ambient, filtered, mixed salinity, heated and chilled. To meet
its obligation, the Marine Laboratory will repair, renovate and modernize its
existing running sea water and animal care infrastructure to the functional
status of a living resources care system. Repair, renovation and modernization
will include the following five elements: 1) four new 25m3 headboxes to gravity
feed particle and gas equilibrated sea water to eight receiving stations in two
separate systems, 2) a covering structure for a 1902 outdoor tank farm, 3)
provision of fast sand filtered and cartridge filtered sea water to two
receiving stations, 4) provision of chilled and heated sea water on a limited
basis to one receiving station, and 5) renovation of all animal care
laboratories to comply with American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care (AAALAC) guidelines, both for vertebrate animals.
