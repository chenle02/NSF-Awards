The research is in two areas: general purpose parallel computing, and models of
neural computation. The first area will investigate the possibility of finding a
standardizing bridging model for parallel computing, at a level intermediate
between the architecture and language levels. Such a standard would insulate the
development of software and hardware and thereby speed the success of the
parallel computing industry. The bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model will be
considered as the prime candidate. The second area of research will further
develop a discrete model of neural computation that is both weak enough that its
constituents are plausibly simulated by human cortex, yet strong enough that
some basic tasks of learning and memory can be implemented on it.
