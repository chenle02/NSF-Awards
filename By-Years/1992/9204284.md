This research will continue investigation into the theory of fault-tolerant
computation. Of particular interest are devices made of a large number of
elementary components each of which can fail independently of the others, with a
certain constant probability. The faults are transient: they chance the local
state but not the local transition rule. A fault-tolerant computer of this kind
must use massive parallelism. The simplest model of a massively parallel
computer is the cellular automation: a homogenous array (of dimension one, two
or higher) of identical, locally communicating finite-state automata. The model
is identical to the interactive particle system in statistical physics. It is an
important object of investigation in statistical physics and theoretical biology
as well as computer science. As the number of components that can fail increases
it does not help to run two computers simultaneously (as it is done now in many
critical situations), comparing their results periodically; indeed, faults will
occur in both of them between comparisons with high probability. In cellular
automata, the self-correction mechanism must be built into the transition rule
of the cells.
