The long term goal of this project is to develop a dynamical&lt;br/&gt;theory
of how neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) generate a&lt;br/&gt;tuned response
to multiple (rather than single) features of a&lt;br/&gt;visual stimulus, and
how these responses are spatially integrated&lt;br/&gt;across the cortex to
generate more global information about a&lt;br/&gt;visual scene. A primary focus
of the work is to extend current&lt;br/&gt;network models of orientation tuning
to incorporate the fact that&lt;br/&gt;V1 cells are also selective for spatial
frequency. This is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the considerable physiological and
psychophysical&lt;br/&gt;evidence suggesting that cortical circuits carry out a
localized&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional Fourier decomposition of a stimulus rather
than&lt;br/&gt;simply performing local edge detection. Optical imaging of
the&lt;br/&gt;surface of cortex has revealed an intricate relationship
between&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of orientation and spatial frequency
preferences&lt;br/&gt;across cortex. How correlations between these two
feature&lt;br/&gt;preference maps is manifested by the local and long-
range&lt;br/&gt;circuitry of V1, and the consequences for the large-
scale&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of V1 is also investigated.&lt;br/&gt; The primary
visual cortex (V1) located at the back of the&lt;br/&gt;brain is the first
cortical area to process visual information&lt;br/&gt;received from the eyes.
One of the classical results regarding&lt;br/&gt;the function of neurons (brain
cells) in V1 is that they analyze&lt;br/&gt;very local features of a visual
image, that is, they carry out&lt;br/&gt;image decomposition. (For example, V1
cells are sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;orientation of an edge representing the
boundary between a light&lt;br/&gt;and dark region of the image. This discovery
by Hubel and Wiesel&lt;br/&gt;led to the Nobel prize in medicine). A very
important question&lt;br/&gt;that follows from this is how our coherent
perception of the&lt;br/&gt;world is reconstructed. Until recently, it was
thought that the&lt;br/&gt;local information from cells in V1 was passed through
higher&lt;br/&gt;order processing stages in the brain where cognition
occurs.&lt;br/&gt;However, it is becoming clear that long-range circuitry within
V1&lt;br/&gt;could itself contribute to the process of reconstruction.
The&lt;br/&gt;basic aim of the proposal is to investigate this process
by&lt;br/&gt;developing a large-scale mathematical model of primary
visual&lt;br/&gt;cortex that incorporates the latest anatomical data regarding
its&lt;br/&gt;internal circuitry. Understanding how early stages in the
visual&lt;br/&gt;brain encode images has important applications to
information&lt;br/&gt;technology (such as the development of artificial vision
systems)&lt;br/&gt;and biotechnology (such as the development of an
artificial&lt;br/&gt;prosthesis for the visually impaired). In the latter case
it&lt;br/&gt;might be possible one day to artificially stimulate
primary&lt;br/&gt;visual cortex to induce a visual sensation, rather like
a&lt;br/&gt;controlled visual hallucination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
