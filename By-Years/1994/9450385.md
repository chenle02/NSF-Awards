9450385 The proposed research would study the contributions of multiplicative,
epistatic, dominant and additive interactions of alleles at different loci to
heterosis using reproductive traits and the domestic chicken, Gallus Domesticus,
as model phenotypes and organisms respectively. The project will also involve
the use of molecular genotype similarity to assess the effect of genetic
distance on the level of heterosis.
