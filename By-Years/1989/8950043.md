A three-week course on gene manipulation will be offered to undergraduate
faculty to familiarize them with genetic engineering techniques. Two bacterial
genes will be cloned in order to demonstrate the mechanics of gene analysis,
manipulation, and sequencing. The content is based on a course previously
offered to advanced undergraduates at the University of Minnesota, but will be
modified to provide the participants with ways of incorporating the material
into the courses they teach at their home institutions. Participants will be
recruited from institutions with large numbers of minority and women students.
These participants, once familiar with the resources and faculty of the
University of Minnesota, may become recruiters, sending high caliber students
from their undergraduate institutions to the Univ. of Minnesota for graduate
study. The university will contribute $3,000 toward the travel costs of minority
participants in the program.
