This research centers on the application of engineering principles to a set of
fundamental problems in cell biology: the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms
used by mammalian cells to sense and respond to their environment. Coordinated
mathematical modeling and experimental approaches will be used to address two
general types of problems in the category of receptor-mediated cell phenomena.
First, a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the
processing (transport/reaction/separation) of receptors and their ligands will
be developed. Efforts in this area will focus on the intracellular processing of
these molecules in endocytosis and the trafficking of these molecules during
antigen presentation. Second, the mechanisms and kinetics of biological signal
transduction, particularly the involvement of receptors in the inositol
trisphosphate/calcium ion signal transduction pathway, will be investigated. An
important aspect of cell function is the ability of cells to sense and respond
to their environment. This communication between cells and their surroundings is
critical to normal cell functioning, to the immune response, and to the action
of pharmacologic agents, and is impaired in many disease states. An ability to
quantitatively understand and manipulate these communication mechanisms is thus
crucial to many areas of modern biotechnology and has application to the
maintenance of cell cultures, the development of new pharmaceuticals, and the
treatment of disease. In this research, engineering principles will be applied
to these fundamental problems in cell biology, with the goal of discovering the
relevant mechanisms and kinetics involved in these communication processes.
