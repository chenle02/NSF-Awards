The research described in this proposal is concerned with the localization of
classical waves (mostly light) in random media. The observation of the light
scattering from a random medium provides a convenient tool for investigating
localization effects. The vector nature of light waves have an important effect
on localization and lead to interesting observable effects. The effects of
absorption, lower dimensionality, geometric effects and the analog of spin orbit
scattering on coherent backscattering are being investigated. The existence of a
mobility edge in the light problem is of interest. The intensity fluctuations
and its correlation functions are under investigation and give interesting
information about the scattering and interference of waves in random media.
Another system being investigated is that of semiclassical (non- degenerate)
electrons at low temperatures in two dimensions. The conductance and
magnetoconductance of this system also shows interesting localization effects.
