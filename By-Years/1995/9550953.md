The Drafting and Design Department is incorporating rapid prototyping as a key
element in the revision of the curriculum. Objectives of this project are: (1)
to modernize the drafting and design technology curricula by providing the
required rapid prototyping laboratory equipment; (2) to establish a rapid
prototyping laboratory for hands-on learning concordant with curriculum
development recommendations for associate degree engineering technology courses;
(3) to implement available distance learning technologies for cost-effective
rapid prototyping laboratory access by other 2-year associate degree programs;
(4) to offer rapid prototyping laboratory access to a regional consortium; and
(5) to provide rapid prototyping laboratory access for the university's project
to implement, integrate, and pilot implement a national model for manufacturing
education. The current basis for design representation is the solid geometric
model. New program outcomes would be enhanced by providing students with the
opportunity to take the next logical step (i.e., from a solid geometric model,
seamlessly and quickly, to an actual prototype of the part to be manufactured).
Students acquire additional knowledge and skills at the design - production
interface, the type of concurrent engineering that is becoming commonplace in
heavily technological advanced manufacturing operations.
