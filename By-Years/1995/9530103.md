9530103 Moore This project will use seismic data collect on and offshore of
southern Hawaii to determine the three-dimensional structure of Kilauea and
Mauna Loa volcanos. Results will contribute to understanding the role of
earthquakes in accommodating stress, and provide better constraints on
historical earthquake data.
