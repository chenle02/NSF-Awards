The importance of formal methods for ensuring extreme high reliability
requirements of safety and mission critical systems is widely known, but mature
formal methods for concurrent and distributed systems are still lacking.
Hierarchical predicate transition nets for system specifications and temporal
logic techniques for analyzing predicate transition nets have recently been
developed. This research furthers previous work with the following objectives:
1) to define an algebraic semantics of hierarchical predicate transition nets in
order to carry out various algebraic transformations; 2) to design a more usable
and powerful specification methodology to facilitate the practical applications
of hierarchical predicate transition nets to realworld systems; 3) to develop a
variety of effective analysis techniques to ensure the correctness of
hierarchical predicate transition net specifications. This research represents a
significant step towards a solid understanding of hierarchical predicate
transition nets and their relationship with other specification methods and will
lay the foundation of a new and effective formal specification and verification
methodology for concurrent and distributed systems based on hierarchical
predicate transition nets.
