Funds are provided for a workshop to bring together the leading researchers and
students on the Isu-Bonin-Marians arc system under the Subduction Factory
Initiative of the MARGINS Program. The purpsose of the workshop is to coordinate
international activities, discuss current and planned research, and present
previous results. It will serve as a forum to discuss the remaining gaps in the
IBM research and where the resources need to be forcused for a complete coverage
and a successful experiment at this "focus site" of MARGINS. The workshop will
be held in Hawaii to allow easier participation by Japanese scientists who are
important collaborators in the IBM and other experiments in the region.
