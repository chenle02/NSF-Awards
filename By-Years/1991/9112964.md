Until the difficulty and tedium of the experimental method is reduced, the
surface forces apparatus will remain a tool in the hands of a few dedicated
specialists rather than a mainstay technique in colloid and interface science.
Fifteen years after its development, researchers continue to measure the
positions, and thereby wavelengths, of the low intensity interference fringes by
eye; a process that takes at least six months of practice to master, as it must
be, if surface separation is to be determined accurately and precisely to within
one angstrom. Even then, the resolution of the measurement is ultimately limited
by the physical abilities and stamina of the researcher. In this proposal, we
request funds to develop a high perfomance imaging and control system for the
surface apparatus that provides for automation of the force measurement with
resolution greater than currently possible. The system will be used in
conjunction with our surface forces apparatus to investigate the structure and
stability of ultrathin organic films.
