Jim Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin in Madison is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his reactivity studies
involving gas phase reactions of bare transition metal atoms (neutral or ionic)
with small alkanes or alkenes, under controlled conditions of initial electronic
state and collision energy. Rate constants and branching ratios will be measured
as a function of temperature. In the case of the metal ion, crossed beams will
be exploited to determine the time scale of reaction with 200 ns resolution
Ultimately, these measurements will be extended to reactions of ligated metal
atoms (MO, MCH3, MCO) and small metal cluster cations. Finally, laser
spectroscopy will be used to determine bond dissociation energies, geometry, and
the electronic and vibrational structure of simple organometallic radicals such
as MCH2, MCH3, and their cations. Saturated hydrocarbon molecules such as
methane and ethane are abundant sources of carbon, but they are relatively
inert. Their chemical reactivities can be significantly enhanced, however, by
catalysts of transition metal atoms. The physical chemistry of this activation
process is not well understood and this research is devoted to improving our
knowledge of the interactions between metal atoms and hydrocarbon molecules.
Results of this research will affect our understanding of solution-phase organo-
metallic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis and surface chemistry. Furthermore,
the data obtained in these investigations will be of use in the development of
theoretical models and techniques for the calculation of interaction potentials
between metals and hydrocarbon molecules.
