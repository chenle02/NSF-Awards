The research planned is directed toward increasing understanding of regulation
of nitrate reductase activity in higher plants. The specific objective of this
project is to analyze, at the molecular level, the flavin domain of corn leaf
nitrate reductase. The recombinant form of this enzyme is produced in a
bacterium. An aspect of this analysis is to generate a vector with an
appropriate gene insert so that both the flavin and cytochrome domains of the
enzyme will be expressed in the bacterium, thus making possible easy production
of large amounts of the enzyme. Plants assimilate the nitrate-nitrogen of soil
and water into their cell materials initially be means of the enzyme nitrate-
reductase. The details of the regulation of the formation of this enzyme are
incomplete, and the aim of this project is to enlarge our understanding of this
significant process.
