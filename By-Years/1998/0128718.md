This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a a dry,
strong, compliant adhesive tape that is removable and reusable. This will be
based on a novel dendritic architecture consisting of a compliant velvet of
micron-diameter carbon fibers, each with a compliant carbon nanotube array on
its tip. Pressed against a surface, each nanotube array will make contact at
multiple points on an atomic scale, resulting in a strong intermolecular (van
der Waals) adhesive force. The Phase I project is expected to accomplish
fabrication of dendritic structures, examination of these structures with
electron microscopy and measurement of adhesive properties to a variety of
surfaces under varying environmental conditions (i.e. air, vacuum, elevated
temperature).

The commercial applications of this project will be in a broad range of
markets, extending from aerospace to consumer electronics.
