This research project aims to study the radiative heating rates of cirrus
clouds, to assess the uncertainty of these estimates due to our present lack of
understanding of cirrus properties and to develop a means for the
parameterization of these radiative heating interactions for use in representing
cirrus clouds in climate models. The methods to be used is: (i) to analyze the
available radiative and microphysical data obtained during the cirrus FIRE-IFO
period, (ii) develop models of the radiative transfer through cirrus clouds
capable of simulating the aircraft observations, (iii) assess the sensitivity of
this transfer to aspects of ice crystal shape, orientation, particle
concentration and size, (iv) compare the theoretical and observed broadband
fluxes and heating rates, and (v) use comparisons along with other data to
formulate and simple model of cloud heating. This work is important because it
will lead to improved parameterization of cirrus clouds in climate models.
