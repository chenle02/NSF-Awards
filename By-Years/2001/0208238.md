This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Control of a
feeding neural circuit in an inscet by taste sensory input and hunger status."
Manduca sexta larvae become host-specific when they feed on solanaceous plants
due to changes in taste receptor responses to a host-specific recognition cue.
Host-specific larvae often starve to death if given food lacking this cue.
Electrophysiological studies are being conducted to examine the integration of
taste receptor physiology and hunger on the feeding circuitry of host-specific
and non-specific larvae.
