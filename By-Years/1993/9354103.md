9354103 Novak About one thousand (1,000) pages of text and graphics form the
Third International Seminar on Misconceptions and Educational Strategies in
Science and Mathematics will be made available on floppy disc, DC-ROM, and on
the Internet. Full Text access is therefore available from conference
proceedings that would otherwise be difficult to search when using a paper copy.
The project will explore the merits and problems of various electronic formats
and distribution systems through a series of evaluations. The findings are
potentially useful to science and mathematics educators, library and information
science professionals and university students. ***
