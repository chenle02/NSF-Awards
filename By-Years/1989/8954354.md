A two week project-oriented workshop on the fundamentals of VLSI design and CAD
tool usage is being conducted. The workshop is directed towards EE faculty with
little experience in VLSI design, EE faculty with expertise in VLSI, but little
familiarity with the design tools available in the academic environment, and CS
faculty with minimal acquaintance with electronics engineering. The course is
equipping 30 faculty members with the resources necessary to conduct
undergraduate course in VLSI to culminate in the fabrication and subsequent test
of student-designed chips. Topics include; an introduction to UNIX, device
behavior, design methodology, design styles and process fundamentals. Lectures
are supplemented by design and simulation laboratory exercises on CAD work
stations. Emphasis is on public domain CAD tools in a UNIX environment.
Fabricated chips are mailed to participants after the end of the workshop. The
participant's institutions are providing the costs of travel for the
participants amounting to about fifteen percent over the budget for the
program.//
