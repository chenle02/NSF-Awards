This award is for partial support of a workshop in the study of phenomena
associated with the fundamental interactions of particles within nucleons in
nuclei. The workshop will bring together experimental and theoretical
practitioners from the fields of nuclear and particle physics interested in
quantum chromodynamics, the science of the strong interactions in nuclear
matter. The meeting will follow up on the 1991 Gordon Conference on the same
subject. Approximately 50-70 physicists from the fields of particle and nuclear
physics are expected to attend.
