Fundamental studies of existence and stability of solutions to a mathematical
model for semiconductor performance will be performed. Globally convergent
Newton/continuation methods will be examined by studying the eigenvalue
structure of the underlying linearizations. Attention will be focused on the
partial differential equations that arise in VLSI chip design. Some aspects of
process simulation diffusion (which occurs in the context of free boundary/flow
problems) will be studied from the standpoint of mathematical modeling.
