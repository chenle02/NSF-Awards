Advanced processing and analysis of seismic and bathymetric data will illuminate
the record of co-seismic slip associated with the great Tohoku earthquake of
2011. This improved structural imaging should increase understanding of
deformation processes, including megasplay behavior, near the toe of the Japan
subduction zone including the tsunami source region(s) for the Tohoku event. A
step-down in the decollment was recognized at an Integrated Ocean Drilling
Program site at the fault and this study will assess the along-strike extent of
that structure. In addition to addressing deformation associated with the recent
earthquake, results will also address accretionary wedge dynamics at a level of
detail not achieved previously, with particular focus on whether sediment
erosion versus underplating is occurring.
