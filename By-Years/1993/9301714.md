This project investigates greedy triangulations and related proximity problems
with a specific concern for the development of efficient algorithms. Topics
under study include: new algorithms for the greedy triangulation in two and
three dimensions; data structures for testing edge-compatibility in higher
dimensional triangulations; of higher dimensional greedy triangulations;
algorithms for near-neighbor enumeration in higher dimensions; and new alternate
triangulation methods for approximating the minimum-weight triangulation. Both
worst-case and algorithms are being explored. The primary concern is with
sequential algorithms in Euclidean space, but parallel algorithms and other
distance metrics may also be investigated. Undergraduate students are involved
in the project.
