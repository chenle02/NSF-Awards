In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Zhiping Zheng of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at University of Arizona will systematically explore the synthesis
of structurally interesting and practically significant lanthanide cluster
complexes. Studies will be carried out using amino acids and amino acid-like
ligands, functionalized carboxylates, and beta-diketonates to control the
hydrolysis of the lanthanide ions and the assembly of high-nuclearity clusters.
The templating effects of anions in the assembly of such species will be
investigated. Functionalized beta-diketonates will be used for the making of
cluster complexes that are potentially useful in biomedical imaging, luminescent
liquid-crystal displays, magneto-optical data storage, and magnetic
refrigeration technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to much
needed synthetic approaches to fundamentally interesting but otherwise
synthetically elusive lanthanide compounds. Discovery of lanthanide-containing
materials with significant technological applications is anticipated. The
research will provide ample opportunities for the education and training of
students, from pre-undergraduate to graduate, including those from groups that
are historically underrepresented in the sciences.
