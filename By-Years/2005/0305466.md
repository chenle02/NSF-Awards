While there are several acceptable algebraic multigrid algorithms for symmetric
positive definite problems (or ones with an M-matrix), there is very little
known that works, much less works robustly, for general nonsymmetric, indefinite
problems. In fact, none of the three basic principles for developing algebraic
multigrid methods apply except under special circumstances. For nonsymmetric,
indefinite problems we will develop principles, algorithms, and serial and
parallel codes that work well with applications when little or no, some, or a
lot of application information is provided to make multiscale and multilevel
solvers robust. Both symbolic and numeric tools will be developed to make
prototyping new algorithms relatively painless. Memory caches will be exploited
portably with little tuning necessary from the users. Two diverse applications
will motivate the new algorithms and software: ocean and flame modeling. The
results should have impact on any area of science or engineering in which
nonsymmetric,&lt;br/&gt;indefinite problems result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the
same time, material from the project can be integrated into a first course in
computational sciences (UKy CS521), which is taken by seniors and graduate
students. Minority students already are half of the PI's research group (half
are female, one is of color). Almost all of the UKy CS grad students are
minority students. Dissemination will be through web sites including
