The Museum of Science will design and produce an exhibition, "Two of Every
Sort", whose aim is to present a scientific basis for the public's understanding
of genser, reproduction and human diversity. Using interactive techniques and
state-of-the-art media technology, the exhibition will debut at the Museum in
Boston, tour science centers in seven other cities and reach an audience of
nearly 2.5 million. The eight museums are members of the Science Museum Exhibit
Collaborative, which has approved "Two of Every Sort" as one of a second round
of shared-cost exhibitions scheduled to appear at each of the member
institutions. "Two of Every Sort" (4,000 square feet) will present introductory
scientific overview, ranging among biology, anthropology, botany and biomedical
technology, to make discussion of these difficult and sensitive matters more
meaningful. The exhibit will offer an unusual opportunity to millions of people
-- families, teachers and youngsters, to consider complex questions in a safe,
friendly learning enviroment.
