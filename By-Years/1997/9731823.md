During the next three summer, the Chemistry Division will support a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, Michigan
State University, coordinated by Dr. Michael W. Rathke. During the 10-week
experience, ten students will investigate the synthesis, modeling and
characterization of materials. The program will be augmented by weekly seminars
on topics in materials and in careers in chemistry and by field trips to Dow
Chemical and Ford Motor Company. At the end of the summer, students will give
oral presentations on their results, as well as participate in a regional poster
session for all the chemistry REU sites in the Michigan-Ohio area.
