A physical properties measurement system for characterizing transport and
complex impedance properties at elevated temperatures will be developed. The
primary function of this instrumentation is to elucidate the magnetic,
electronic, and thermal properties of novel spin- and charge-functional
materials through temperature and magnetic field-dependent measurements of
transport and electromagnetic response. The proposed system will include a
"micro-heater platen" technology to provide for the extended temperature range.
Capabilities of the instrumentation will include AC susceptibility, dc
magnetization, I-V, Hall measurements, thermal conductivity, and complex
impedance in magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla over a temperature range of 4 to 700
K. Together with parallel efforts in materials and devices, this instrumentation
will serve as a vehicle to educate students and post-graduates regarding
transport and electromagnetic response in these materials

In recent years, there has emerged a significant interest in the understanding
and manipulation of charge and spin in a variety of electronic materials. In
many cases, the spin/charge functionality extends well above room temperature.
The instrumentation developed under this proposal will enable the magnetic,
electronic, and thermal properties of novel spin- and charge-functional
materials to be probed through an extensive temperature range. Together with
parallel efforts in materials and devices, it will serve as a vehicle to educate
students and post-graduates regarding transport and electromagnetic response in
these materials.
