9408904 Fornari Funds are provided for a pilot study to collect continuous
underway near bottom gravity measurements from ALVIN, some 6 to 8 m above
seafloor. This work will test whether near bottom gravity measurements can be a
useful tool to investigate shallow crustal structure of young oceanic crust.
