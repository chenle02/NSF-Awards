Computationally simulating complex physical systems in engineering design has
become a common practice. Yet most of today's simulations rely on extensive
numerical computations. Nonlinear physical systems can exhibit extremely complex
behaviors that defy human analysis and pure numerical simulations. The analysis
and design for these systems are limited by the available computational power
and the system complexities. This research project will develop powerful
computer simulation technologies for the analysis and design of nonlinear
control systems. Programmable primitives will be developed for constructing
simulations and synthesizing high-performance controllers. Hybrid computation
will be for integrating symbolic and numerical methods with AI reasoning and
representation techniques in (1) manipulating and visualizing the dynamics of
physical systems based on a phase-space representation, and (2) guiding the
execution of numerical computations. The expected results of this is to expand
the scope of what current numerical simulation programs or state-of-the-art
knowledge-based systems can do solving pressing scientific and engineering
problems.
