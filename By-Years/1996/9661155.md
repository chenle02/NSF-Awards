*** 96-61155 Wisner This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will test a new process for recycling painted automotive thermoplastic
parts. Recycling these products is hampered by residual paint particles in the
recycled material. The new process focuses on 1) segregating the individual
plastics, 2) debonding the paint chemically and removing it, 3) recovering the
thermoplastics, and 4) assuring that the recycled plastics meet the critical
needs of the end user. The goal is to deliver recycled material with properties
very near virgin material at a cost lower than the virgin price. Commercial
applications are expected in various plastics manufacturing operations, such as
automobile bumpers, where high-quality recycled plastics are needed. In large
scale use, plastics recycling could save one-third of all waste materials now
being discarded in landfills. ***
