Plant genome sequence data have been accumulating from three major sources:
whole genome sequencing and assembly (Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, Medicago
truncatula), genome survey sequencing (maize), and expressed sequence tags
(ESTs). This data flow will likely continue, with a focus on complete sequencing
of "reference species", draft sequencing of other selected species, and further
EST and full-length cDNA sequencing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our efforts will aid
in the organization and interpretation of these sequence data through the
development and implementation of integrated databases and analytical tools.
Results of our project will be accessible via the PlantGDB Web site,
http://www.plantgdb.org. Our scientific goals include estimation and
characterization of the plant gene space and the extent and conservation of
alternative splicing in plants. These objectives will in part be pursued by
further development of algorithms and statistical methods for splice site
recognition and gene structure prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
train graduate and undergraduate students in bioinformatics and plant genomics
and encourage their consideration of careers in these fields. The PlantGDB
database and Web site will serve both the research community by integrating data
access and analysis tools and the broader community by providing tutorials.
PlantGDB will also be hosting the Plant Genome Research Outreach Portal, a Web
site providing access to a large number of resources and successful outreach
programs.&lt;br/&gt;
