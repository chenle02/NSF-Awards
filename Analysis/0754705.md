The main objective of this project is to give an in-depth study of the operator-
theoretic nature of the Evans function, one of the principal tools in
contemporary stability theory of travelling waves and wave patterns. We plan to
develop a formalism for the Evans function in the infinite dimensional setting
for an abstract class of equations obtained as bounded perturbations of diagonal
uniformly stable bi-semigroups, including (on the applied side) linearized
parabolic problems in infinite cylinders, and many others. We will derive a new
formula for the Fredholm index of abstract differential operators in terms of
Krein's spectral shift function. We will explore powerful and surprising
connections between Evans functions and the modified Fredholm determinants of
the Birman-Schwinger-type integral operators. This includes a new abstract
formula for the derivative of the modified Fredholm determinant at an
eigenvalue, and its concrete realization for the derivatives of the Jost and
Evans functions used to detect unstable eigenvalues of linearizations along
pulses. In particular, we will carry out the Evans function spectral analysis of
an important applied problem in the theory of combustion waves in one-
dimensional solids.

The topic of this proposal is an interplay of applied theory of complex
dynamical systems and operator spectral theory, the mathematical theory of
equations containing infinitely many parameters. We will study travelling waves,
pulses, fronts, and other patterns potentially describing combustion, wave
propagation, and many other natural phenomena. Our main applied goal is to
develop tools for understanding whether the patterns are stable, that is,
whether their structure is being preserved under small perturbations. Bringing
in this area some ideas from quantum mechanics, we will generalize and utilize
for systems containing infinitely many parameters the concept of the Evans
function, a determinant similar to the Wronskian in the theory of differential
equations. Our main theoretical contribution will be in the proof of unifying
theorems that use the Evans function and describe solvability properties of
equations linearized about the above-mentioned patterns via asymptotic
properties of differential equations containing infinitely many parameters, and
related to stability of the patterns.
