This study will examine the interplay of scientific, ethical, and cultural
judgments in evaluating the restoration of natural and urban environments.
Restoration has become a centerpiece of ecological and urban policy. Yet the
concept of restoration is rife with ambiguities and conflicting interpretations.
The proposed study, conducted by an interdisciplinary team of two philosophers,
an ecologist, a geographer and an urban planner, will examine and compare the
issues raised by natural and urban restoration. The investigators will focus on
three areas where restoration projects are underway or being planned: the Severn
River basin and the Baltimore neighborhoods of Marble Hill and Butcher's Hill.
They will examine the diverse and sometimes conflicting visions of restoration
that underlie these projects and, more broadly, explore the roles of science,
history, and culture in evaluating restoration projects and adjudicating the
conflicts they engender. The investigators will write a coordinated series of
papers, reporting their analysis of restoration issues and their studies of
specific restoration projects. These papers will be submitted to journals of
public, environmental, and urban policy, and collected into an anthology.
