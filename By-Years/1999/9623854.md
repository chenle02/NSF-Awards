A user-callable geometry library in C++ will be developed. The software package
will include documented C++ libraries, a user manual, sample drivers, and sample
data sets. It will be distributed on the Internet and diskette and announced
through conferences and publications. Implementation in C++ will make the
software accessible to the computational geometry community and to an increasing
number of programmers in scientific computing. The library can advance science
and engineering by reducing software development time for its users. The library
is small enough to be completed quickly, yet provide a basis for future
expansion. The project will encompass the four layers identified for geometry
libraries, namely, geometric primitives, algorithms, support environment, and
applications. The support environment will include sample drivers, sample data,
and an interface to Geomview, the visualization software from the Geometry
Center at the University of Minnesota. ***
