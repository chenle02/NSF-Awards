0332892 Yazici The goal of Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) is to reconstruct
spatial maps of the optical properties of tissue from the measurements of
transmitted light based on a forward model of the photon propagation. Due to
diffuse nature of light photons, DOT image reconstruction is a challenging 3D
problem with a relatively large number of unknowns and limited measurements. The
general objective of the proposed project is to develop high resolution and fast
DOT reconstruction algorithms by developing an optimization based iterative
reconstruction scheme that is spatially adaptive given high resolution a priori
anatomical information.

The specific objectives of this small exploratory grant are to 1) investigate
adaptive multigrid/multiscale and domain decomposition methods for the diffuse
optical image reconstruction problem and 2) evaluate, benchmark and optimize
domain decomposition and adaptive multigrid image reconstruction algorithms for
optical absorption tomography with simulated, experimental and in vivo clinical
breast data collected by a novel hybrid MRI and time resolved optical imager.

The proposed method is expected to provide more accurate and high resolution
reconstructions in less time, which would have a major impact on all aspects of
clinical breast cancer management and has the potential to catalyze innovative
advances in other medical imaging and multimodality imaging techniques.
