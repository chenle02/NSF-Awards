This program explores the defect structure of quasicrystals, superconducting
oxides, and amorphous alloys using the technique of atomic pair distribution
function analysis (PDF). The PDF method has been employed primarily for
amorphous solids and liquids and is now being used in the examination of non-
periodic atomic displacements in more ordered solids. The PDF method is refined
further in this research, which examines the statistical noise, lattice
dynamics, and techniques for improved accuracy in the differential anomalous
x-ray scattering experiments. The main focus of the grant is on developing
understanding of defect structure in the above materials, which have high
incidence of atoms which deviate in position from their average sites.
