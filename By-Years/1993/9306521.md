9306521 Bloom In a chilling-sensitive tomato cultivar (Lycopersicon esculentum
Mill. cv. T5), short exposures to 5 degree centigrade rapidly and irreversibly
inhibited root ammonium influx. By contrast, ammonium efflux and nitrate
absorption in this taxon, as well as ammonium and nitrate absorption in a
chilling-tolerant congener (Lycopersicon hirsutum LA1778), recovered immediately
and fully from such exposures. The research would examine the physiology and
genetics of this phenomenon to elucidate the regulation of ammonium transport
and the importance of ammonium transport in the chilling response of tomato. The
physiological experiments would employ ammonium-selective microelectrodes to
localize ammonium absorption in the root and to determine whether resumption of
ammonium influx after a chilling episode requires protein synthesis,
transcription, or new growth. These characteristics should assist in the
identification of root membrane proteins associated with ammonium influx. The
genetic studies would involve the screening of 30 plants a day for chilling-
sensitive ammonium influx using an automated NH4+ analysis system. Segregation
analysis of the chilling-sensitive L. esculentum, the tolerant L. hirsutum, and
L. esculentum x L. hirsutum F1 populations should determine the inheritance of
this trait. Lastly, we would test backcrosses of the F1 hybrids to L. esculentum
that have been selected for chilling-tolerant ammonium influx for their overall
chilling tolerance. A better understanding of plant ammonium absorption is
critical to the study of plant nitrogen relations in specific, and plant
transport processes in general. Moreover, in transferring a specific chilling-
tolerant trait to tomato, we should elucidate the role of below-ground processes
in the chilling response of plants. ***
