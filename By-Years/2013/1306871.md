RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES The objective of this research is to explore
how one can use low-energy collective plasmon excitations of individual
nanotubes to tailor the optical properties of periodically aligned, densely
packed, parallel arrays of carbon nanotubes. The rigorous quantum
electrodynamics approach, developed earlier by the PI for individual nanotubes,
will be used. The approach starts with single-tube band-structure calculations
and allows one to go beyond the ideally-conducting-cylinder and effective-medium
restrictive approximations employed previously by others. INTELLECTUAL MERIT
Mixing surface states with bulk-periodic dielectric properties brings dense,
periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays into the highly demanded broad-band
spectral range of microwave to visible, which can be tuned by adjusting inter-
tube separation, tube diameter and chirality, and by varying dielectric host
material. Clear understanding of the properties of low-energy collective
electronic excitations in periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays and how
individual constituent nanotubes communicate with one another and what it does
to the collective properties of the array, is a natural prerequisite for the
realization of a variety of practical applications ranging from the enhanced
electromagnetic absorption, conversion and rectification of ambient
electromagnetic fields to nano-biosensorics and advanced plasmonic metamaterials
development. BROADER IMPACT This research will result in novel optoelectronic
device concepts for advanced electromagnetic meta-materials engineering for use
in future energy related applications. Increased exposure of under-represented
minority students from NCCU, nation's first state-supported public liberal arts
college for African Americans, to this exciting cutting-edge nanotechnology
research will lead to increased minority participation in graduate studies in
scientific disciplines and in scientific careers in general.
