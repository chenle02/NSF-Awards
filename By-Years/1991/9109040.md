At a general level, it is natural to expect that risks and rewards in the
economy's production processes should vary over the course of economic
fluctuations, and that asset returns should mirror this variation. However, the
mechanism by which asset returns are linked to economic fluctuations is not yet
well understood. The contribution of this project comes from developing
empirically successful economic models of the links between asset returns and
economic fluctuations. Such models are important because: 1) they will help
discriminate between competing theories of business cycles; 2) they are one of
the only ways of rigorously determining whether or not volatility in financial
markets indicate speculative fads or the response of efficient markets to
changes in fundamentals; and 3) successful economic models could improve
portfolio allocation rules. The first part of this project extends a production-
based asset pricing model, that is a model of the physical rates of return of
production processes in the economy. The extension covers empirical tests of
simultaneous variations in the returns on many different assets using several
different techniques and cross- sectional data of asset prices; improvements in
the description of technology; and the explicit study of time aggregation. The
second part of the project involves the calculation of the variation in
conditional moments of discount factors implied by variation in the conditional
moments of asset returns. The results are used to determine whether or not the
behavior of asset returns is due to "fads" or to rational movements in discount
factors.
