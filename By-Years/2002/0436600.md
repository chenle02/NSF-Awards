DMS-0436600&lt;br/&gt;Nitya Kitchloo &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the
PI's research is to study infinite dimensional objects arising in geometry and
topology using the tools of homotopy theory. The PI is currently interested in
infinite dimensional transformation groups like Loop groups and
Symplectomorphism groups. The topology of these groups may be studied via their
proper actions on certain associated spaces. For example, the Symplectormorphism
group of a Symplectic manifold may be studied via its action on the space of
compatible complex structures. A careful analysis of this space allows us to
compute various homological invariants of the Symplectomorphism group, like
homology and homotopy. Similarly, the Loop group may be studied via its action
on the space of connections on a trivial bundle. The orbit structure of these
spaces allows one to decompose the homotopy type of the infinite dimensional
group in terms of compact Lie groups. There are numerous applications of this
decomposition. It may be exploited to understand the topology of other infinite
dimensional objects that admit the Loop group or the Symplectomorphism group as
their structure group. An example of such an object is the Loop space of a
manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, Lie groups have become
increasingly important in mathematics and physics. They may be seen as groups of
symmetries of various geometric objects. While finite dimensional Lie groups are
well understood, the infinite dimensional ones are just beginning to be
understood. Due to their infinite nature, their study is a difficult
task.&lt;br/&gt;I have been successful in developing methods to systematically
decompose these infinite dimensional Lie groups into finite dimensional compact
Lie groups, hence making it possible to study them using standard techniques of
geometry and topology. My current research involves extending these
decomposition methods to other infinite dimensional transformation
groups.&lt;br/&gt;
