Scanning tunneling microscopy is an innovative new method of surface atomic and
electronic structural analysis with subatomic spatial resolution. Structural
imaging and current image spectroscopy with STM will be used to investigate the
effects of dopants on the electronic structure of ZnO varistor materials. The
electronic structure in the depletion lasers near the grain boundaries will be
compared with that in the center of the grains. The structure of the grain
boundary will be probed to determine if grain boundary trapping states are due
to segregated impurities or lattice strain defects. These results will be
compared to existing models of varistor behavior. The impact of this work will
be seen in two fields. As the first demonstration of scanning tunneling
microscopy in ceramics it will illustrate an expanded potential of the
techniques and be the basis of further work in this area. The characterization
of ZnO electronic structure will be useful in refining models of varistor
behavior and guiding future composition modifications.
