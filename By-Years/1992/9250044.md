Illinois State University seeks funds to develop a model mathematics program
for elementary teachers grades K-6, both preservice and inservice, focusing on
the cognitive guided instruction approach to instruction. Teams of experienced
teachers will be selected and prepared in CGI for a year and these teachers will
establish learning environments in their classrooms that reflect current
research findings on how children learn mathematics. Subsequently, these
teachers and new teams will work with preservice teachers in mathematics and
mathematics education required coursework and school-based experiences. The
preservice teachers will be in seminars together with the inservice teachers.
These seminars will address teaching and learning as related to problem solving
with understanding in the topic areas of the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards
of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The preservice teachers will
be studied in the research component of the project as they become new teachers
and are followed by the proposers into their own teaching years throughout the
duration of the project. The College of Education and the Department of
Mathematics are collaborating in the implementation of this program together
with school systems in the area. The contribution of Illinois State University
accounts for 22% of the NSF budget.
