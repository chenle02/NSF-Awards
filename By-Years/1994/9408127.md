9408127 Alber Carbohydrates are a major component of the dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) in natural waters. The purpose of the projected research will be to
examine carbohydrate dynamics in aquatic systems from both a biogeochemical and
a trophodynamic (e.g., microbial loop) perspective. The biogeochemical
perspective involves comparing the carbohydrate composition of various source
materials (terrestrial and aquatic plants, macroalgae, phytoplankton,
zooplankton, bacteria) to determine whether there are biochemically consistent
compositional differences that would be useful indicators of sources of DOC in
natural waters. There has been only a limited amount of work to date on this
question, in large part because of the analytic difficulty of detecting
individual carbohydrates. The proposed work will seek to extend previous studies
on the carbohydrate composition of source material and to test the utility of
using carbohydrate signatures as geochemical tracers by comparing them to
measurements made in field samples. If this approach proves fruitful, it will
improve understanding of the relative contribution of various sources of DOC to
natural waters.
