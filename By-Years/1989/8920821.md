This project will conduct a working on current bridges engineering research
being performed throughout the country. THe objective of the workshop is to
inform all researchers and practitioners of the projects in progress so they may
know what is happening which may be of use to them. It will reduce duplication
and assist in the transfer of knowledge among all parties concerned with bridge
engineering.
