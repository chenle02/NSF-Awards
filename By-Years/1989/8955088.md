This program aims to significantly increase the knowledge and appreciation of,
as well as the enthusiastic interest in, Biological Evolution in 30 Junior and
Senior High School Science Teachers from Utah over three years. This is
particularly important inasmuch as Science is the common denominator of the
emerging world culture, and Evolution is one of the most important scientific
principles. The program will offer a five-unit preparatory course during the
Winter Quarter. This course consists of extensive readings in and discussions of
the original literature from the writings of Charles Darwin and his forerunners
to those of Gergor Mendel to the most recent works on mutations. The climax of
the course is an 11-day field trip during the Spring break to the Galapogos
Islands to relive the experiences of Charles Darwin that were the key to his
developing the concept of Evolution through Natural Selection. The field trip
will be followed up by special reports during the Spring quarter and together
constitute a three-unit sequel course. An amount equivalent to 175.89% of the
NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
