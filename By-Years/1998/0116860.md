Engineering - Other (59)

Through a national engineering education conference, this project is supporting
the formation of a cooperative coalition between community and four-year
colleges, that will result in improved educational opportunities for engineering
students. The conference is being held at Itasca Community College, Grand
Rapids, Minnesota. Teams of high school, two-year and four-year faculty will
work towards developing articulation agreements that will ensure seamless and
successful educational experiences for engineering students. The outcome of this
forum will be the creation of a National Collaboration for Engineering
Education, a partnership that will be instrumental in reversing the current
trend of declining engineering enrollment in the face of increasing need for
engineers. The partnership will also be instrumental in raising the numbers of
students from underrepresented groups who pursue engineering careers.
