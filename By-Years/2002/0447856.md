0447856&lt;br/&gt;Bowen&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides support for the development of improved
sampling devices for recovering multiple, fragile biological and geological
samples from the sea floor using submeribles and remotely operated vehicles.
These suction samplers will allow intact recovery of an array of biological,
bacterial and geological material in uncontaminated tubes, and using a carousel
system with interchangeable samplers, it will be possible to obtain numerous
samples during a single dive or deployment. The tools will become part of the
standard array of instruments available to users of the National Deep
Submergence Facility at WHOI, and they are expected to be of substantial
advantage to scientists using the NDSF facility in their deep-sea research
during 2005 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
