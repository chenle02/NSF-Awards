Mathematics (21) Mathematics placement examinations are widely used in higher
education because adequate preparation is extremely important for student
success in mathematics courses. However, our survey indicates that most
placement testing falls short of its potential value for assessment and learning
due either to the tests themselves or the way in which they are (not) used. In
this project, we are creating a testing system accessible on the Internet that
includes placement tests, practice exams, and online explanations of concepts
and solutions for students who require more assistance. One of the main aims of
this project is to improve the curriculum through assessment. Therefore, we also
plan to use this tool to assess the effectiveness of selected mathematics
courses by administering "exit exams." Such "outcomes-based" assessment is
currently being encouraged by accreditation agencies. Our plan is to do this by
linking placement exams in a given course to the exit exam in its prerequisite
course. We are also making the system available to high school students and
their advisors in order to assess readiness for college level math courses. Such
"Early Placement Tests" have been given to high school sophomores and juniors in
several states across the country for years. The integration of an early
placement test into our system is simply one more piece in a comprehensive
system of placement, assessment and learning to improve curriculum and
instruction.
