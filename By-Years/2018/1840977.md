In this RAPID project, the investigators will collect baseline nutritional,
behavioral, biomarker, and microbiome data on a provisioned group of small-
bodied, nocturnal primates (galagos). The research will advance fundamental
knowledge about primate adaptations and ecology. The project will inform primate
conservation efforts and will provide unique opportunities for student training
and mentoring in primate research at an EPSCoR state institution, including for
students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will establish a research program to
examine diet, nutrition, behavior and microbiome for Otolemur garnettii (n=14,
ages 3-23 years). Research aims will focus on the impact of dietary alteration
on digestibility of nutrients (including protein and fiber); relationships
between food choice, stress hormones and behaviors; and relationships between
gut and oral microbiome, nutrition and welfare; and age-related aspects of well-
being and nutrition. The project will also be able to test hypotheses about
changes in behavior, well-being, and microbiome with a shift to naturalistic
diet and housing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
