This is a mathematical research project on core models and their fine
structure, which is a subfield of set theory that was pioneered by Jensen. Core
models are generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe, L, that arose in
the the study of large cardinal axioms. The field today builds on the
fundamental discoveries of Dodd, Jensen, Martin, Mitchell, Steel and Woodin. The
project is on pure core model theory as well as its interactions with other
areas, such as descriptive set theory and infinitary combinatorics. Several of
the research problems are on combinatorial principles such as Diamond and
Square, which were isolated by Jensen in his work on L. They are among the most
commonly used tools in set theoretic constructions and have applications in
neighboring fields such as model theory and topology. Other research problems
have their origins outside of core model theory. These include open questions
about descriptive set theory, forcing, singular cardinal combinatorics and
cardinal invariants.

The axioms of set theory are the foundation of mathematics. Core model theory
addresses some of the most fundamental questions in set theory in direct and
highly sophisticated ways. Ideas are constantly exchanged between core model
theory and other parts of set theory. The research problems to be addressed in
this project are central in these respects. Some ask for further development of
the basic tools of core model theory, while others are about applications to
neighboring fields.
