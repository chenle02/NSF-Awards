This project will acquire two high-performance clusters with a high-performance
storage subsystem, including servers, workstations, laptops, and PCs for new
labs. One cluster can be dedicated to research that build on a stable system
platform, while the second can be used for disruptive research and experiments.
Each cluster will have 16 nodes, several RAID servers, etc. The proposed
infrastructure will support the PIs in their work in several research areas,
including Grid computing, sensor networks, mobile computing, and visualization.
They also have a number of collaborative projects with units outside the
computer science department. The group will join Planetlab to leverage their
resources in distributed computing research. Addressing broader impacts, the
resources will be available to other researchers at SUNY at Binghamton and will
be used in developing new undergraduate and graduate courses.
