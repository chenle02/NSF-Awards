The Organic Synthesis Program is funding a continuation of the research of Dr.
James A. Marshall. Dr. Marshall will continue his development of new ways to
control the stereochemistry in the synthesis of complex systems. These will
provide the new tools required by the increasing complexity of the compounds
needed by our agriculture and industry. The research will explore the scope of
reactions in which nonracemic vinyloxiranes serve as key intermediates for the
synthesis of subunits found in various polypropionate and related natural
products. The experiments are designed to reveal intrinsic steric preferences
and explore the role of directing groups in these reactions. A variety of
nucleophilic reagents will be tested including nonracemic cuprates and
allylmetallic compounds. By the proper selection of double bond geometry,
epoxide stereochemistry and reagent sterochemistry it should be possible to
exercise considerable control over the formation of multiple stereocenters.
Methodology will also be explored for transforming the products of the foregoing
reactions into natural products and analogs with potential antitumor,
antibiotic, and immunosuppressive properties.
