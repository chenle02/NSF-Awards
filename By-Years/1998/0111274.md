This project examines the definitions of "community" that are mobilized by both
urban neighborhood residents and by police in efforts to implement community
policing. This contemporary reform movement seeks to reduce crime through more
constructive interactions between citizens and the police. However, community
policing assumes that there is a coherent "community" that can be organized in
the name of crime control. In urban neighborhoods, this assumption is
questionable. Specifically, this research will explore four critical tensions
inherent in community politics: tensions of difference, scale, obligation, and
interaction. To try to organize community is to implicitly ask: Who is included
and excluded? At what scale does the group organize? What obligations can
individuals be asked to assume? And how does the community interact with other
agencies of power? This project will study how these questions are addressed in
a neighborhood in Seattle through intensive qualitative research with both
residents and officers. The resident data will include in-depth interviews,
focus group discussions, and observation of community group meetings. The police
data will include ride-alongs and informal interviews with all officers with any
responsibility for the study neighborhoods. Analysis of these data will reveal
the implicit assumptions about community that shape how both residents and
officers interact with one another. It will also reveal how the central tensions
of community organizing are addressed and potentially resolved in these
interactions.
