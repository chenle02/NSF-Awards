Dr. Guild is studying a program of gene expression which is important to the
development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Sequential expression of
the genes in this program is the larval salivary gland is regulated by the
steroid hormone ecdysone and proceeds through a cascade of transcriptional
regulation. The Broad-Complex (BR-C) locus encodes multiple products and acts
early in this cascade to regulate the expression of downstream (late) genes. Dr.
Guild will characterize BR-C products in order to learn how these early genes
communicate with late genes. By taking a genetic approach he should be able to
identify which RNA products serve in this capacity. He will test the idea that
different BR-C products play roles in different but parallel tissue specific
gene expression programs by developing product specific probes for different
BR-C RNAs and proteins. In addition, he will determine whether BR-C products
interact in a direct way with any other loci in the salivary gland cascade by
surveying this polytene genome for bound BR-C products. %%% This proposal is
concerned with the hormone regulated expression of a complicated genetic locus
involved in metamorphosis in Drosophila, a model organism for the study of
developmental genetics.
