The principal investigator works on a broad spectrum of problems in finite model
theory, which is the subject that studies first-order logic and its extensions
on collections of finite structures. He seeks to discover necessary and
sufficient conditions under which logics with fixpoint operators capture
computational complexity classes on collections of finite structures. Moreover ,
he investigates the comparative expressive power of extensions of first-order
logic on collections as finite structures of asymptotic measure equal to one. He
also studies various aspects of logics with fixed finite number of variables,
including algorithms for satisfiability, and asymptotic probabilities of
properties expressible in such logics. Progress on these problems will
strengthen the connections between logic and computation, and enhance the
interaction between logic, computational complexity, and asymptotic
combinatorics. In a different direction, He continues working towards the
development of a structural approximation theory for combinatorial optimization
within the framework of integer programming. The objective of this investigation
is to identify large classes of NP optimization problems possesing approximation
algorithms with performance guarantees.***
