9314897 Chen SLG resolution, Linear resolution with Selection for General logic
programs, is an effective method of query evaluation for deductive databases. It
is upward compatible with Prolog. This project extends SLG resolution into
nonmonotonic reasoning, develops an efficient implementation of SLG resolution,
and integrates it with Prolog. The objective of this effort is to deliver an
integrated system that supports logic programming, deductive queries, and
nonmonotonic reasoning in a seamless manner. The proposed implementation uses
newly developed techniques of incremental maintenance of goal dependencies to
improve its efficiency of deductive query processing. It supports computation of
three valued stable models in nonmonotonic reasoning. It offers constructive
negation for negative goals with constraints or variables. By providing a
uniform programming interface and powerful integrated query answering, the
proposed system minimizes the mismatch between application programming and
knowledge processing and increases the productivity in developing knowledge
based software.
