The design of protocols for cryostorage of living cells requires the
determination of cryoprotectant type and concentration, cooling rate, and final
prequench temperature that prevent the formation of intracellular ice. In this
project, a fundamentally new approach will be taken, involving the development
of a generalized probability model of the incidence of intracellular ice
formation (IIF) during cell freezing. Detailed cryomicroscopic experiments will
be performed on a mammalian germplasm system to (1) establish the existence and
magnitude of the cell supercooling tolerance, (2) develop the mathematical forms
of a probability model for instantaneous and time-dependent IIF, and (3)
determine the parametric effect of cryoprotectants on the supercooling tolerance
and probability of IIF. Concepts from reliability theory will be used to develop
a mathematical model of the probability of IIF and to synthesize various sources
of randomness in cell freezing behavior. A reduced set of experiments will be
performed on a plant cell system to test the universality of the modeling
approach. The model will be used to explore the feasibility of innovative
cooling protocols that could significantly increase cell survival rates. This
project will result in a fundamental step forward in the development of
engineering models of the response of cells to freezing, and in the creation of
new analytical tools with which to design cryopreservation protocols. The
development of the model will have a wide range of cryopreservation
applications: human and animal sperm, oocytes, and embryos; organs and
specialized tissues; plants shoot tips for asexually propagated species; and the
conservation of the germplasm of endangered plant and animal species.
