This research project addresses several areas within symplectic topology and its
interaction with gauge theory, complex geometry, and low-dimensional topology.
Lagrangian morphisms in the symplectic category are viewed as morphisms between
manifolds that are not necessarily symplectomorphic, but their geometric
composition is generically singular. A previous project partially resolves this
problem, with consequences including the construction of invariants for three-
manifolds and knots; the next goal is to fit these invariants into a framework
of higher topological quantum field theories, in particular four-manifold
invariants. Another goal is to extend the existing framework to a refined Fukaya
category, leading to a tool for mirror symmetry proofs. Moreover, the proposal
seeks to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-
topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs.

The research projects described in this proposal concern symplectic geometry,
the geometric structure that lies behind the Hamiltonian formulation of
mechanics. Recent applications of ideas from symplectic geometry include
invariants that help to distinguish one (three or) four-dimensional space from
another. Broader impacts of this project concentrate on promoting women in
mathematics, e.g. by continuing a lecture series by accomplished researchers and
expositors, named after Dorothy Weeks, the first female graduate from the MIT
math department.
