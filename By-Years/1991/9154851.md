This three year teacher enhancement project for secondary (middle school or
high school) teachers includes an exchange component, in which during each
semester of the project one university faculty member and one secondary school
teacher will be selected to co-teach a mathematics class at both the school and
the university level. The university participant will also visit other classes
and work with teachers in the school setting; the school participant will also
work with faculty and take one university mathematics course at the university.
The project also includes a series of summer seminars with the exchange
participants, which will be offered for twenty educators from schools in the
surrounding area. In these three week seminars the participants will experience
the use of innovative teaching materials and methods as they explore topics in
mathematics and will discuss many of the major issues facing mathematics
education today. Follow-up activities for all participants will continue during
each academic year.
