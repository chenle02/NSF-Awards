Professor Wilse G. Robinson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to use picocosecond laser spectroscopic
techniques to probe the structure and dynamics of water as it exists in confined
volumes. Studies will be conducted on interfacial water at the water/air
interface, water in contact with hydrophopic and hydrophilic surfaces, and water
in close proximity to ions. Robinson will also use fluorescence probing
techniques to study water in biological systems including water contained in ion
channels, near membrane walls, and inside reversed micelles. %%% These studies
will provide fundamental insight into the behavior of water, the most important
solvent, in the vicinity of ions, at interfaces between phases, and in
biological systems.
