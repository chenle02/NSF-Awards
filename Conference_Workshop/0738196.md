This proposal for a conference to be held at IAS in the framework of the Special
Year ``New Connections of Representation Theory to Algebraic Geometry and
Physics''.

Recent developments in representation theory, algebraic geometry and quantum
field theory have uncovered strong connections between the following major
branches of research: 1) Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, understood broadly as study of
numerical invariants of representations by methods of algebraic geometry; 2)
geometric Langlands duality program; 3) dualities of quantum field theory such
as $S$-duality and mirror symmetry. In particular, many of the relevant
constructions have, or are expected to have, natural explanations in the
framework of 4-dimensional supersymmetry gauge theory.

The conference will bring together representation theorists, algebraic geometers
and theoretical physicists whose work leads to such connections, with the goal
of advancing each of the subjects, and achieving a deeper understanding of their
roots in gauge theory. The following researchers have agreed to participate in
the workshop: A. Beilinson, A. Braverman, T. Bridgeland, M. Douglas, D.
Gaitsgory, E. Frenkel, A. Kapustin, M. Liu, G. Moore, H. Nakajima, N. Nekrasov,
N. Saulina and E. Witten.

Another important purpose of the conference is dissemination of knowledge
accumulated in each of the above mentioned areas among experts in the
neighboring fields and graduate students. Thus we expect it to contribute to a
synthesis of the new methods in these fields, and to forming a new generation of
researchers.
