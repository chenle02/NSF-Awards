The applied research project builds on the IMD funded "Where are We?" and poses
the following research questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do students perform
significantly better on real-world map tasks after using WAW?&lt;br/&gt;What
specific misconceptions and weaknesses remain widespread among students after
using the materials?&lt;br/&gt;How much improvement in student performance on
map skills tasks would be expected after using the curriculum?&lt;br/&gt;How can
teachers tell whether student learning has occurred?&lt;br/&gt;What is the
relationship between teachers' spatial abilities and the likelihood they would
use the materials?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop quantitative,
reliable field-based assessments of map skills and use them, along with other
instruments, with three populations: elementary students using the materials;
children over the 7-15 age range who do not use the materials; and preservice
elementary teachers. Results from these assessments will be used in a redesign
of the materials.&lt;br/&gt;
