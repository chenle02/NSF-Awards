Of all the mineral phases found in the marine environment, carbonates of
various biological origins have proven to be the richest repository of
paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic information. Two classes of chemical indicators,
stable isotopes and trace elements, have been developed in two principal host
phases, foraminiferal calcite and coral aragonite. As biological systems,
however, foraminifera and reef corals are capable of leaving metabolic imprints
on top of chemical signals which record environmental change. The nature of
these imprints must be understood to accurately reconstruct oceanic conditions
during Earth's history. Over the last several decades, a process framework has
evolved to permit the interpretation of such signals in ancient foraminifera.
The intent of this proposal is to initiate a similar framework for metal
incorporation by corals. 4 fundamental process issues and their effect on metal
(including Cd, Mn, Pb, V, Ba, U) and isotopic precipitation (18O and 13C) will
be addressed in this work: (1) growth rate, (2) species variability, (3) reef
spatial variability, and (4) digenetic influences on thousand year timescales,
taking advantage of existing samples and the ease of cross dating short growth
intervals within specimens from a single reef to form detailed comparisons. This
approach offers many advantages to a difficult and costly culturing study.
Numerous species collected live from Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean sites will
form the sample basis. The diagenesis study component will utilize precisely
dated (U-Th) materials from Barbados to address the feasibility of interpreting
Pleistocene trace metal records in fossil corals.
