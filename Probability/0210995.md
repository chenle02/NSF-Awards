The 24th Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern University,
on October 18-19, 2002. This is a regional meeting with a limited number of
talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the researchers. It has a
strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and other young investigators
to attend and interact with specialists.
