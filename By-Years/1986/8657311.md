This grant provides support to Prof. Nariman Farvardin under the Foundation's
Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program. His research currently centers on
the design and analysis of efficient and easily instrumentable data compression
schemes for application to real- world sources. This work spans the range from
stochastic modeling through detailed bounding and analysis, all the way to
complexity analysis and VLSI design. The PYI Awards program provides research
support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and
engineering faculty. The awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S.
academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and
engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and engineering. This
PYI has made significant contributions to his field of engineering and has
potential to become a leader in academic research and education. The diary note
describes the rigorous selection procedure. A grant award is highly recommended.
Dr. Farvardin has obtained the maximum matching funds, so an award of $62500 is
thus recommended.
