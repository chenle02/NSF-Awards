A grant has been awarded to the University of the Pacific (UOP) under the
direction of Dr. Craig Vierra for the acquisition of a DNA microarray spotter,
and a microarray scanner with software for data collection and analysis.
Projects that will utilize this instrumentation include studies of genes
regulated by basic helix-loop-helix proteins; identification of genes involved
in peroxisome biogenesis in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris;
identification of protein factors involved in the Ah receptor signaling pathway;
identification of novel silk genes in spiders; identification of genes involved
in DNA repair in Drosophila melanogaster; and the involvement of transcription
factors in Caenorhabditis elegans development. The acquisition of DNA microarray
technology for biological research will provide state-of-the-art research
technology at UOP and support a program dedicated to training undergraduates at
the highest level. The acquisition of this equipment will substantially impact
faculty research for many members located in the Biology and Chemistry
Departments and School of Pharmacy, as well as provide invaluable training and
experience for science graduate students and undergraduates at UOP and
California State University, Stanislaus. The equipment will help create a
pedagogical environment to enhance learning for undergraduates seeking advanced
science degrees and vocations in biotechnology.
