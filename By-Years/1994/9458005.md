9458005 Rohrer Specifically, ultrahigh vacuum and ambient pressure scanning
tunneling microscopy will be used together with other surface analysis methods,
atomistic models, and image simulations to study the surface structure of the
molybdenum and vanadium oxides that are used as partial oxidation catalysts. Of
particular interest is the evolution of the surface defect structure during
reduction and oxidation reactions and the interaction of hydrocarbons with the
surface. this award will simultaneously support the Principal Investigator's
efforts to develop multimedia educational tools for use by educators and
students in Materials departments. The goal is to develop interactive programs,
accompanied by explanatory text and graphics, that illustrate fundamental
concepts in Material Science and Engineering (such as crystallography and
diffraction) through graphic simulations. %%% The objective of the research
supported by this award is to determine the surface structure of catalytically
active ceramic materials in order to establish surface structure-property
relationships that can be used for the development of advanced materials. The
Principal Investigator also plans to develop multimedia educational tools for
use by educators and students in materials departments. ***
