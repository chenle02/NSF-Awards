Political observers and scholars have recently expressed concern about the rise
of populist rhetoric on social media, which many consider a threat to democratic
stability and peace. This project will document the prevalence of populist
rhetoric in social media in democracies globally, and determine how this
rhetoric spreads and what are its consequences on the functioning and quality of
democracy. It will produce a new massive dataset on the extent of populism in
political communication on social media for tens of thousands of candidates and
hundreds of parties across about 80 countries. Analyzing these data will allow
researchers to understand whether populism is on the rise across the globe,
where it is most prevalent, how it spreads, and whether it erodes democracy. The
results of the project will contribute to improving our understanding of this
potential threat to democratic stability around the world.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance our understanding of the
spread and consequences of populism in democracies around the world. While it is
broadly understood that populism is on the rise globally, there is little
available data on the use of populist rhetoric by political elites. We overcome
this limitation by building a massive cross-national dataset of all posts from
all major democratic parties in the world on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram,
which constitutes the most comprehensive coverage of online elite rhetoric to
date. To analyze this data, we extend new methods for multilingual text analysis
in order to jointly analyze parties and politicians communicating in dozens of
unique languages. Finally, we employ these new methodological developments to
address critical questions about not just the prevalence of populist rhetoric,
but how it spreads within and across parties, as well as its effects on the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
