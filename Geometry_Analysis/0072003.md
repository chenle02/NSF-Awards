Abstract

Award: DMS-0072003 Principal Investigator: Xianghong Gong

The long term goal of this project is to study holomorphic mappings and real
submanifolds arising in the field of several complex variables. One topic of
proposed research is on the existence of periodic points of reversible and
symplectic holomorphic mappings near an elliptic fixed point of general type and
on the integrability property of holomorphic symplectic mappings via meromorphic
eigenfunctions. Another topic is on the topological and analytic structure of
singular Levi-flat real hypersurfaces in connections with singular complex
hypersurfaces. Other topics include the structure of non-reversible conformal
mappings and their connections with the non-reversibility of real analytic
Hamiltonian systems.

The differential equations dealing with the motion of N masspoints (a model of
the solar system) in the three-dimensional space attracting each other according
to Newton's law form a Hamiltonian system. The periodic orbits of certain area-
preserving mappings corresponds to the periodic motion in the Hamiltonian system
of the restricted three body problem, and the study of the existence of such
periodic orbits goes back at least to the work of Poincare and Birkhoff about a
century ago. Holomorphic symplectic mappings are natural extensions of area-
preserving ones. Such an extension might allow one to apply methods in complex
variables to the study of real Hamiltonian systems. Indeed, recent work on the
existence of non-reversible area-preserving mappings depends on some deep
knowledge of conformal mappings studied extensively in complex analysis.
