Physics (13) This project is developing a set of materials for use in enhancing
instruction in the intermediate Modern Physics course. This course normally
follows the calculus-based introductory course and serves as a transitional
experience between the relatively low level of rigor of the introductory survey
course and the more advanced and specialized upper-division courses taken by
science and engineering students. Based on experience in a pilot project begun
in the spring of 2002, this project is developing, testing, and assessing
materials for interactive teaching, especially those that contribute to
methodologies shown by physics education research to enhance instruction in the
introductory course. These materials include in-class discussion questions, case
studies, and group activities that are being carefully evaluated and correlated
with criteria that assess student learning. The materials are to be commercially
published and also included in a digital library. The broader impact of these
developments include better student performance in the Modern Physics class as
well as increased understanding of concepts of Modern Physics. By offering
packages of materials to instructors, the project enhances faculty development
through the adoption of classroom techniques that have been repeatedly shown to
be superior to traditional teaching methods. Experience shows that this course
plays a significant role attracting and exciting students who are thinking about
careers in physics teaching, and thus a more effective course could have an
impact on K-12 teaching. Finally, test sites include institutions with a large
population of minority physics majors.
