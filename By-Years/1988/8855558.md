Teacher Development Program for High School Chemistry Teachers Designed for
underprepared chemistry teachers in schools of the metropolitan Cleveland area
with primarily minority students, this project offers two residential intensive
two- week workshops in each of three summers. Sixteen participants will be
selected for each of the two workshops the first year, with twenty each in years
two and three. In each year, the first two-week workshop will focus on an in-
depth understanding of basic chemical principles, the role of the laboratory and
problem solving; the second workshop in each year will specialize in organic
chemistry and biochemistry. Throughout the sessions, strong emphasis will be
placed on performing and directing hands-on laboratory work, deepening subject-
matter knowledge, developing effective teaching skills, and bridging classroom
chemistry with research and industry. The latter will be accomplished by
selected site visits to chemical research and industrial facilities located in
the area as well as campus presentations by local visiting scientists. Several
master teachers of high school chemistry will serve as consultants to model
successful practices. Workshop and seminar sessions on eight Saturdays during
each ensuing school year are planned to provide continued assistance, support,
motivation, and a networking scheme to the participants.
