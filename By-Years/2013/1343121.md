Up to 30 students will receive travel grants to attend the 2014 Wireless
Innovation Forum Conference on Communications Technologies and Software Defined
Radio, to be held March 11-13 in Schaumberg, IL. The grants will provide partial
support for travel, housing, and conference attendance. Software-defined radio
technology will become increasingly important as the foundation of wireless
communications, and attendance at the conference will expose students to many
technical and practical aspects of the technology.
