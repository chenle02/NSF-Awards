This grant will support an interactive distance video workshop on Ethics in
Modeling. The purpose of the workshop is to explore the use of this new
technology as a means to focus attention on ethical issues in the development
and use of computer-based decision models for the modeling community that
develops models; the potential users and those who may be affected by the use of
models; and educators and researchers in applied ethics and the disciplines of
modeling: operations research, statistics, management science, and systems
engineering. The workshop will involve individuals at four sites, in the
Netherlands, Massachusetts, Maryland, and New York. One goal of the workshop is
to find out what modes of interaction using this technology will be most
effective. The second research goal is to generate awareness, discussion, and
scholarship on the ethical issues involved in modeling. For this purpose, the
participants will discuss four cases. Each site will have a facilitator, and the
workshop will be videotaped for analysis. Participants will complete pre- and
post- workshop questionnaires. The principal investigators will prepare a report
on the findings.
