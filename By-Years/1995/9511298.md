9511298 Halfter During early embryonic development axonal processes connect the
different parts of the nervous system. One such axonal connection is the visual
pathway that functionally connects the eye with the brain by optic axons. The
cells that generate the optic axons are the ganglion cells of the retina. A
prerequisite for optic axons to reach the brain is to navigate to the optic
disc, a small central segment of the retina that allows the axons to exit the
eye. The mechanisms underlying the navigation of axons to their target, such as
the optic disc, are largely unknown. This grant proposal is aimed at studying
molecules and other factors involved in the navigation of axons during
development. Transplantation experiments will be performed to learn more about
the general mechanisms of axonal guidance in the eye. Biochemical studies are
aimed at identifying molecules that might be important in the formation of
axonal pathways. One such molecule is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This
proteoglycan is present at a time and with a distribution that matches exactly
the appearance and distribution of optic axons suggesting that the component has
a function in the development of this axonal tract. In the present project, the
molecular identity of the proteoglycan and its function in the developing visual
system will be studied. The results of this research will promote a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms that guide neural connections during
development.
