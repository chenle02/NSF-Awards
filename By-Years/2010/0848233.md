Joel Bowman of Emory University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to develop a fully-flexible potential energy
surface for water clusters, based on the highest level of ab initio theory. This
predictive model for water uses the most accurate two-body and three-body
interactions that are obtained and represented using novel mathematical
representations having the property that they are invariant with respect to
permutation of the identical H atoms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader
impacts, the focus is on communicating the importance and excitement of studying
"the most important molecule", water. A one-day "hands-on" workshop on the
computational modeling of water for undergraduates in the Atlanta area is in the
planning stages. Additionally, once it is thoroughly tested, the new water
potential will be made freely available to other researchers through several
publically accesssible websites. It is anticipated that the potential, in
conjunction with experimental results, will be used to resolve some hotly
debated issues concerning the nature of water.
