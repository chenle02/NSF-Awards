The research in this proposal concerns the removing (or resolution of)
singularities of an algebraic variety by birational transformations. This
problem was solved 23 years ago by Hironaka in the case of characteristic zero.
The case of characteristic p &gt; 0 has resisted all attempts since then. This
problem is the focus of this research. In algebraic geometry many of the
geometric objects one studies (varieties) have singularities, i.e. corners or
cusps. It is a very important problem to remove these in certain prescribed
ways. The principal investigator has the first really new idea on this problem
in many years. If he solves this problem or even makes significant headway on
it, it would be a significant advance. One can only wait and see on a problem of
this depth.
