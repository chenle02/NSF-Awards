This project has two primary objectives. The first goal is to facilitate
distance learning by enabling advanced virtual laboratories for deployment in
online degree programs and utilization by co-op students. The second goal is to
provide immersive virtual environments for collaborative learning and team
building in undergraduate engineering education. The virtual environment is
affording flexibility to on-campus students to run experiments outside of
regular class time, thus allowing for a blended laboratory delivery mode.
Students spend a limited time in a laboratory facility to familiarize themselves
with the equipment, materials and procedures and then access an online
laboratory to conduct additional experimental procedures. A key innovation of
this project is the use of multiplayer game engines for developing virtual
laboratory environments for collaborative learning in undergraduate engineering
education.
