The objective of this research is to provide a theoretical and experimental
approach to evaluate the dynamic response of rock bolts to blast loads. The
effects of the frequency and wavelength of excitation and the material
properties of the bolt and its surrounding rock on the dynamic response of the
bolt will be studied to provide better rock stability in tunnels, underground
mines, and man-made caverns.
