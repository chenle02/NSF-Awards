The reaction chemistry of molybdenum sulfide complexes is important in the
chemical processing, required to convert crude oil to refined products. The
process of hydrotreating crude oil to remove sulfur and to upgrade feedstock
product quality uses molybdenum sulfide as a catalyst. The objective of the
proposed project is to develop the hydrogen activating capabilities of cationic
molybdenum complexes for application in the hydrogenolyses of small molecules.
In particular, the reactivity of the molybdenum complexes under a hydrogen
atmosphere will be investigated with substrates such as nitriles, isonitriles,
cyanide ion, dinitrogen, carbon monoxide, and aromatic heterocycles. The
proposed studies are based on promising preliminary results with some of these
molecules. The characterization of synthetic systems which carry out the
reductions of these molecules could provide the basis for the development of
important new catalysts. The work is also significant because it appears to
define fundamentally new reaction chemistry for sulfido and hydrosulfido ligands
in homogeneous systems. The soluble complexes are proposed to provide uniquely
relevant functional models for reactions catalyzed by molybdenum sulfide
surfaces, including the commercially important hydrodesulfurization reactions.
The studies may also provide a basis for understanding mechanistic features of
reductions catalyzed by metallosulfur sites in enzymes.
