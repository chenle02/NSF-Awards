Within a democratic society, risk management policies need to be guided by
public attitudes, perceptions, and preferences. A national survey effort can
play a crucial role in helping decision makers in government and industry
understand and appreciate citizens' views. Toward the objective, the project
will design a prototype for a national survey covering a wide range of risk-
related topics including risk perceptions, comparative evaluations of societal,
technological, environmental, and health risks, and attitudes and opinions about
risk management policies and strategies. The research will address questions
about demographic characteristics, economic status, worldviews, and political
values. The design of the prototype instrument will be the responsibility of
Decision Research with the assistance of personnel from the Survey Research
Center of the University of Maryland and an Advisory Committee. The survey
instrument will be designed to allow researchers to develop and test theories
and models of decision making pertaining to a wide range of societal risk
issues, public policy formulation, and analysis.
