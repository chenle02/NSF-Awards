Professor Ibers of Northwestern University will investigate the synthesis of
soluble metal chalcogenide compounds with support from the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic chemistry Program. These species are of the
type (MxQy)z- where M is a metal and Q is selenium or tellurium. The synthetic
techniques to be employed are varied, but they will center mainly on reactions
of metal compounds with polyselenide or polytelluride species in non-aqueous
solvents or on replacement reactions. Characterization of the resultant products
will be by 77Se and 125Te NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction studies of
single crystals. %%% Simple metal compounds of oxygen and of sulfur that are
soluble are widely known. Much less is known about similar compounds of those
elements lower in the periodic table, selenium and tellurium. The first step in
gaining such knowledge is the preparation of the compounds. Initial studies
suggest that some of these compounds will bear strong similarities to the
corresponding sulfides, but others will represent totally new structural types.
Thus, a broad range of synthetic methods will used in a multi-pronged research
program directed towards uncovering the variety of compounds that con be
prepared from these elements.
