Rowan University is developing, evaluating, disseminating and supporting the
broad adoption of a project-based curriculum to help all computer science
undergraduate students understand and apply classic algorithm design techniques
for solving intractable problems. This novel, award winning curriculum is a
sequence of laboratory projects comprising increasingly sophisticated solvers
for a single intractable problem. To facilitate broad adoption, this award funds
the development of three sets of projects based on intractable problems from
different domains: Satisfiability, Traveling Salesperson and Sequence Alignment.
This project makes a significant contribution to computer science education by
establishing the effectiveness of project-based learning in the study of
algorithm design techniques for intractable problems. The project has the
potential for national adoption, for a direct impact on computer science
educational practices, and for advancing knowledge in the discipline.

To encourage adoption, an extensive faculty guide is being developed and
disseminated. The project funds the attendance of potential adopters at a
training workshop as well as the development of an online community of adopters.
Adopters will have the opportunity to publish and present an experience paper at
a national conference.
