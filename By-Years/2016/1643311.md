This grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW
2016) which will be co-located with the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer
Science, in New York City (USA), July 2016. The Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
is the flagship conference in logic and semantics, and one of the premier
conferences in all of computer science. The purpose of the workshop is to
encourage undergraduate students, women, and underrepresented minorities to
pursue and thrive in research careers both in logic/semantics specifically and
in computer science generally. Funded students will benefit greatly from the
opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social
exchanges that both conferences foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
full or partial support for approximately 8 students to attend the mentoring
workshop and the main conference. The funded students will attend LICS, a top
conference where they will learn about current research problems and interact
with leaders in the field, and the LMW workshop which will focus on mentoring
and career advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue
research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. During distribution
of the travel funds, preference will be given to applicants who are women or
underrepresented minorities.
