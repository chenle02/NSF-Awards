This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Recent Methods in Operator Theory" that will be held on October 15
and 16, 2015, on the campus of the University of Memphis.

This conference is a satellite event to the meeting of the American Mathematical
Society's Southeastern Section that will take place in October 2015. The
conference will focus attention on recent methods and advances in operator
theory via a series of expository lectures on long-standing open problems in
operator theory, state-of-the-art techniques, and important recent contributions
to the field. The goals of the workshop are the following: (1) to disseminate
mainstream trends, state-of-the-art techniques, and recent advances in operator
theory to a large group of female and underrepresented graduate students and
early career mathematicians; (2) to create a social environment among a diverse
level of participants encouraging fruitful discussions of mathematical ideas and
sharing of promising research; and (3) to initiate a network of support among
participants for future research interaction.The conference program provides
ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
