Designing a chemical process is a complex task that requires complex algorithms
and procedures as well as a large body of knowledge acquired through experience.
However, the available computer-based chemical process design software tends to
be analytically-based and does not take advantage of the knowledge of the
designer, nor are most systems capable of explaining to the designer the reasons
that a particular decision was made in the design. The goal of this research is
to create an interactive computer-based design aid for chemical processes that
will reason with partial descriptions; that will be capable of explaining the
factors resulting in a particular decision; that will be able to learn from the
designer; and that will take advantage of the large body of analytical programs
that are already available.
