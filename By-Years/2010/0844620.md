fundamental role in nearly all magnetized plasmas as it enables magnetic energy
to be converted into high speed flows, and thermal energy. It allows the
magnetic field lines to change topology in collisionless plasmas, and it thereby
controls the spatial and temporal evolution of explosive phenomena such as solar
flares, coronal mass ejections, magnetic substorms, and internal disruptions in
fusion devices. Because of its strong impact on the plasma dynamics and because
it occurs in so many varied environments, understanding the physics of magnetic
reconnection is one of the most important topics in plasma physics. Reconnection
often occurs in explosive bursts which on short time scales can release large
amounts of energy. Despite numerous satellite missions dedicated to reconnection
studies on the surface of the sun and in the Earth's magnetotail, and despite
the intense theoretical research on the subject over the past decades, the
trigger mechanism for fast reconnection is still poorly understood.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an experimental exploration of
magnetic reconnection. The plasma environment in the VTF (Versatile Toroidal
Facility) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) provides a unique
opportunity to experimentally study the spontaneous onset of collisionless
reconnection. The controlled experiments in the VTF represent a unique
opportunity to study the importance of 3D effects in the onset of reconnection.
The spontaneous nature of reconnection in the VTF renders the research relevant
to reconnection in astrophysical, geospace, and magnetically confined fusion
experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All theoretical teams will be given full
access to the experimental results, which in principle will allow the testing of
existing theoretical models, provide resolution to controversy, and stimulate
new theoretical developments and understanding of the onset of magnetic
reconnection. Results will be published in the refereed scientific literature.
In addition, a series of lectures on reconnection will be offered to
undergraduate and graduate students at MIT. These lectures will cover the
fundamentals of magnetic reconnection with emphasis on laboratory research
relevant to space physics and astrophysics. The VTF is a large basic plasma
physics device which is operated by graduate and undergraduate students. It is
an ideal facility for students to get immersed in state of the art research
while learning the fundamental principles of plasma physics.
