9452149 Roat Changes recently undertaken in the Washington College Chemistry
curriculum are designed to move students towards the recognition and
understanding of molecular structure through innovative reorganization of
chemistry core course materials and their correlation with meaningful discovery-
based laboratory experiences. When fully implemented this program will reinforce
understanding of molecular structure, and its relationship to chemical
reactivity, using experimental structural analyses made possible through the
extensive use of high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Students
will discover the implications of theoretical and practical aspects of nmr
spectroscopy as it is used to investigate molecular structure in our core
curriculum. Higher levels of sophistication in theory and hands-on
experimentation take place as students continue in the chemistry curriculum.
Chemistry majors undertaking individualized research projects are also
benefitting from availability of a high field nmr spectrometer.
