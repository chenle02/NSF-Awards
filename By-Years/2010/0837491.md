Physics(13) The Department of Physics at Lawrence University, recognizing a need
for greater innovation in the American workplace to arrest the current slippage
in U.S. competitiveness worldwide, is investigating how to teach innovation as
part of the undergraduate physics curriculum. A four-step methodology is being
developed that will be implemented in two learning settings: summer research
participation and two academic-year, laboratory-rich courses. The instructional
steps include: 1) introducing students to innovation, 2) choosing targets for
innovation, 3) moving ideas into action, and 4) testing and revising. With the
expertise and equipment currently available at Lawrence, innovative work is
focusing on the areas of optics and plasma physics. As the project progresses,
course materials, laboratory instruction sets, selected observations and
possible videos are to be developed and disseminated.
