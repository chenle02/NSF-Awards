&lt;br/&gt;Despite numerous studies, it is still unclear how biodiversity
affects ecosystem function. This research will evaluate whether interspecific
effects overshadow intraspecific variation in influencing ecosystem dynamics. A
field experiment being conducted as part of this dissertation has found that
genetic makeup of leaf litter affected components of the carbon and nitrogen
cycles by influencing tannin content, decomposition rate, and nitrogen content.
Low genetic diversity yielded idiosyncratic nutrient cycles that differed
significantly from high diversity treatments. While this project is unique in
its focus on intraspecific, and not interspecific diversity, the implications
need to be considered in relation to interspecific diversity. Specifically, will
the effects of decreased intraspecific diversity be masked by the addition of a
single commonly co-occurring species? To answer this, the PIs propose to
replicate field experiments in the lab with and without the addition of
naturally co-occurring pine litter. By comparing carbon and nitrogen dynamics of
oak litter with and without pine litter, the PIs will be able to assess the
effects of additional species in the community on the ecosystem-level
consequences of reduced intraspecific genetic diversity&lt;br/&gt;
