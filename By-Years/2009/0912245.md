This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to manufacture
and test a novel surface for making label-free protein arrays. Label-free
detection is valued in protein research because alternative methods based on
labels (e.g. fluorescent tags) can cause experimental artifacts. Array formats
are preferred for their efficient throughput and because only miniscule amounts
of sample are required. Commercial label-free array systems require the use of
gold surfaces for array fabrication. Gold has several limitations, including
fragility, a tendency to denature proteins, and limited reusability. This
proposal aims to manufacture a novel "Carbon on Metal" (CoM) substrate for
protein arrays in order to address these limitations.

The broader impacts of this research are to reduce costs and improve the speed
of analysis in proteomics research, clinical diagnostics and the development of
therapeutic antibodies. Now that the human genome project has revealed the
genetic blueprint of humans, biological and medical research is turning its
focus from DNA to the deciphering of protein function. After all, proteins are
the targets of drugs. Since there are ~30,000 human proteins, high throughput,
low-cost methods for determining protein function are urgently needed. In the
same way that DNA microarray technologies accelerated genomics research, CoM
protein arrays would accelerate proteomics research. Established markets for
this platform include basic research, lab-on-a-chip diagnostics, drug discovery;
forensics; detection of bio-terror agents; and food and crop testing. Thus CoM
proteins arrays could potentially have far-reaching impacts.
