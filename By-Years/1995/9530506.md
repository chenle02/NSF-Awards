9530506 Goodman This meeting will bring together researchers in computational
and discrete geometry. The purpose of the meeting is to foster interaction,
centered on geometric questions, between computer scientists and mathematicians.
Such interaction started mainly by a similar conference held in Santa Cruz in
1986. During the ten years since that meeting, researchers in each area have
made substantial contribution to the other. Combinatorial and discrete geometers
have gotten more and more interested in algorithmic and complexity-related
questions, while the computational geometers have used their techniques
successfully to make inroads into problems that had previously seemed
intractable to mathematicians. Both fields have grown as a result of this
interaction. The present meeting will survey much of the progress made during
the past decade, and delineate the areas in which progress is likely to take
place during the coming years. ***
