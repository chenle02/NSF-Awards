9702875 Kim Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is an enabling technology,
opening a new scientific frontier. A fundamental issue is that the conventional
engineering science is not always valid at the micrometer scale. Since human
experience and our educated knowledge may defy proper engineering in microscale,
it is important to lead students to re-construct their body of knowledge and
form a discipline of its own for microengineering. It is my goal in academia to
establish a systematic and effective structure for MEMS education in mechanical
engineering. The effect, I believe, is advancement of mechanical engineering
areas by taking advantage of MEMS technologies and also enrichment of MEMS
research with more balanced expertise available. To reach this goal, we are
establishing a Ph.D. major field in our Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
Department of UCLA. The research plan is to use micron-sized liquid-metal
droplet as another building block for MEMS. It has been shown in my lab that an
array of metal droplets on the order of micrometers can be formed at desired
locations on substrate. With its unique properties, liquid metals can open new
possibilities for MEMS devices. Mercury and low-melting-temperature metal alloys
are being considered. The proposal is directed towards the development of Large-
Scale Integrated Relay (LSIR), which has both the functional superiority of
microrelays and the large-scale integration of semiconductor transistors. Based
on the droplet-based relay cell, which has dramatically simple configuration and
small foot area, an LSIR chip is expected to contain 10 K to 1 M calls of
bistable relay on it. A high performance, low density LSIR will be developed for
signal multiplexing and a high density device for non-volatile, radiation-hard
memory to be integrated with CMOS chips. The scale effects and surface physics
studied in the MEMS courses described in the education plan will play a critical
role in understanding the behavior of the droplets. It is an objective of the
proposal that the information obtained from the research, such as microscale
phenomena of droplets and fabrication techniques, be incorporated into MEMS
courses. ***
