The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using discarded
vehicle tires for producing marketable forms of carbon. The project consists of
developing a predictive model of physical and chemical changes that occur during
carbonization, use of the model to suggest modifications in processing the
tires, monitoring of carbonization itself and use of data obtained to refine
starting conditions and monitoring procedures. This is a Phase I award made in
accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR). The project deals with an approach to pollution prevention by use of
discarded materials as sources of useful materials. If proven feasible, this
concept would reduce pollution associated with deterioration of discarded rubber
products and eliminate the potential for ignition of accumulations of used tires
which during combustion result in emissions of air pollutants.
