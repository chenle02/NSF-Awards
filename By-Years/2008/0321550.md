Homing endonucleases are enzymes that are encoded by mobile DNA elements, and
are found in all kingdoms of life. They initiate the transfer of these elements
within a population and between species by catalyzing double-strand breaks
within the host genome. The goal of this project is to engineer homing
endonucleases with novel functions that harness the extreme target specificity
of these proteins. The PI-SceI homing endonuclease recognizes a single target
site within the 13 million base-pair yeast genome. One objective of this
research is to modify PI-SceI to create altered specificity endonucleases that
recognize different target sites. This will be done by coupling rational-design,
based on the X-ray crystal structure of the PI-SceI/DNA complex, with a
combinatorial genetic selection strategy. Another aim is to elucidate how
altered specificity occurs in nature by analyzing PI-SceI analogues from other
yeast strains. This will reveal how the specificity determinants of homing
endonucleases evolve over time. The project will also involve introducing caged
ligands into PI-SceI in order to generate novel artificial enzymes whose
endonucleolytic activities can be triggered in response to ultraviolet
irradiation. These variants will permit the temporal and spatial regulation of
the enzymatic activity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: An important
benefit of the described projects will be that they will form the basis for the
training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in scientific research.
The availability of PI-SceI and of novel site-specific endonucleases that target
specific genomic sequences will facilitate the study of DNA repair in complex
organisms and provide the molecular tools required for gene targeting methods.
Moreover, the photoactivated homing endonuclease that will be developed may
become an important commercial technology.
