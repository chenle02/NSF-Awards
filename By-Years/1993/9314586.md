9314586 Eberli This award will support a high-resolution multichannel seismic
survey across the western margin of Great Bahama Bank and correlation of this
data with newly available industry-collected data in the deep water regions
surrounding Bahamas Bank. The primary objective is to determine the three
dimensional anatomy of the sedimentary sequences and to develop a comprehensive
sequence stratigraphic model for this carbonate sedimentation system. Ground
truth will be provided by two boreholes positioned on the shallow portions of
the bank, and additional drilling which has been proposed to the Ocean Drilling
Program in the off-bank regions. Data from the present project will be used in
siting the ODP holes. Data acquisition will be undertaken from the R.V. Lone
Star which is operated by Rice University. ***
