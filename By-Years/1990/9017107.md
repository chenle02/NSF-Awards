This high-resolution transmission electron microscope offers 0.18 nanometer
point resolution in a side-entry stage configuration and also accommodates a
large solid angle x-ray detector. It will be housed in the new Materials Science
Center of the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, and will
create new opportunities and enhance the activities in several major research
areas including fundamental studies of rapid solidification, high-resolution
imaging of geological materials, low-temperature and high-temperature
superconducting materials development, metallizations on gallium-arsenide,
supported metal catalysts, ultrafine ceramic particles and membranes,
crystallization of structural glass ceramics, and radiation damage in materials
for fusion systems and plasma-source ion implantation processing.
