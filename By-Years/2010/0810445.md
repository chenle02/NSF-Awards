This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of a technology whose success will result in novel, ultra-low power,
reflective displays that will be an environmentally friendly replacement for
flat screen LCD displays in TVs, computers and mobile devices. The simple, yet
ingenious, concept of this proposal transforms existing electrowetting displays
from having to consume power in an 'ON' state, to consuming no power in either
the 'ON' or an 'OFF' state. Layers of colored oil and water are sandwiched
between two electrowetting surfaces. One surface is subdivided by hydrophilic
barriers into sub-pixels. A stable 'OFF' state occurs when the light-absorbing
oil layer covers the entire pixel. When that surface is made hydrophilic by
electrowetting, the oil beads up, touches the other surface and transitions
there. On that other surface the oil is confined to a single sub-pixel covering
25% or less of the total pixel, creating a 75% transmitting, stable 'ON' state.
This simple, yet highly innovative, patent pending arrangement should result in
reflective displays that 10 msec switching speed, 100% color conversion, sun
light readability, and zero power consumption in either the 'on' or 'off' state.

If successful this type of electrowetting reflective displays have the
potential to impact several important facets of the $100 billion a year display
market. Their predicted high reflectivity, ambient light readability, use of low
cost materials and ultra-low power consumption make them potentially very well
suited to e-ink applications such as the rapidly growing electronic shelf label
market that is forecast to grow to about $1 billion by 2012. Other anticipated
performance advantages, such as the 10msec anticipated switching speed, low
switching power, 100% color conversion and sun light readability, make them
contenders to replace LCD displays in the $20 billion mobile display market. The
displays may find use in portable computers, helping provide the possible
broader social benefits of more affordable, and more environmentally friendly,
portable computers.
