This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include an investigation of polarization
phenomena in electronuclear coincidence reactions. The exploitation of spin
observables allows exploration of small amplitudes and subtle interference
effects and addresses fundamental questions of this research are the study of
the quark wavefunctions of the proton and a highly sensitive test of a
fundamental symmetry-time reversal invariance.
