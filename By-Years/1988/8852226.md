A community college is acquiring an atomic absorption spectrometer for use in
beginning chemisty as well as in continuing education. Local industrial firms
are supplying samples that can be used for analysis giving the students an
opportunity to learn chemistry on items with which they are particularly
familiar. One manufacturing plant is a circuit board plating plant and does
extensive metal analysis and the other is involved in working with a Vermiculite
used in animal feed. Both provide opportunities for interesting student
involvement and a challenging opportunity for the students. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
