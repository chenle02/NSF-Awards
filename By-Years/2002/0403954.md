The objective of this research is to develop a high-volume chemical synthesis of
single-walled nanotubular molecules with uniform but tunable dimensions and
properties. The approach is a two-stage chemical synthesis. In the first stage,
C60 molecules add in a diastereoselective syn fashion across large, phenyl
substituted acenes to produce cyclacene (i.e., cyclic acene) molecules with
variable diameters. Cyclacene molecules map directly onto zig-zag carbon
nanotubes. In the second stage, the cyclacenes are iteratively oligomerized to
form single-walled nanotubular molecules with variable lengths. &lt;br/&gt;This
research is important because it offers a means to prepare uniform batches of
single-walled nanotubular molecules. While single-walled carbon nanotubes hold
great promise in a variety of technological applications including chemical and
biological sensors, efficient energy storage (e.g., gas and battery
applications), nanoscale electronics (e.g., one-dimensional quantum wires in
nanocircuitry; nanotransistors), nanoscale electromechanical systems (i.e.,
NEMS), novel actuators, multifunctional materials (e.g., lightweight, high
strength, energy efficient, electrically conducting, etc.) and advanced
instrumentation (e.g., AFM, STM and CFM probe tips), current carbon nanotube
fabrication techniques produce a myriad of different nanotubes possessing
different lengths, diameters, shapes and properties. The absence of uniform
batches of carbon nanotubes hinders the development of these important
technologies. Additionally, the single-walled nanotubular molecules to be
prepared in this high-volume chemical synthesis should be amenable to facile
chemical functionalization. Appropriately functionalized single-walled
nanotubular molecules can selectively bind one agent (chemical or biological) in
the presence of others, thereby improving and expanding their application as
chemical and biological sensors. &lt;br/&gt;
