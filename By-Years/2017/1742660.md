The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies primarily
in the enhancement of vaccine safety and efficacy. The project could potentially
accelerate the development of safer and more cost-effective vaccines, and help
transcend the current "safety-vs-efficacy" paradigm of current vaccine additive
research. Given the escalating interest in immunomodulatory biologics from
pharmaceutical companies, it is anticipated that these antibodies could enter
the market at an opportune time from both regulatory and process development
perspectives. Additionally, as the role of antibodies is becoming more fully
elucidated in the field of immune-engineering, this antibody coating technology
could also enhance treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

This I-Corps project aims to explore the use of host (human) derived proteins as
safe vaccine additives. Antibodies coat pathogens during the body's immune
response to an infection, and these proteins may be able to enhance the
immunogenicity of nanoparticulate or inactivated pathogen vaccines. Antibodies
immobilized on the particles' surface would remain bound. Any non-immobilized,
soluble antibody in the formulation should be recognized as host protein and
consequently non-immunogenic, eliminating any off-target inflammatory effects
such as those caused by soluble pathogen-derived vaccine additives.
