The expression, regulation and function of various forms of the extracellular
matrix molecule, tenascin, will be studied. Tenascin appears to be a molecule
important to cellular migration in the developing nervous system, but its role
is poorly understood. Molecular probes will be used for in situ hybridization to
tissue sections and neural cultures to study the cellular expression of tenascin
variants. Possible regulation of tenascin expression by peptide growth factors
will be studied by Northern blot analysis. Effects on cell proliferation,
migration and differentiation will be studied by time-lapse videomicroscopy in
cells cultured with tenascin variants, antibodies to tenascin, deglycosylated
tenascin and peptides that block tenascin binding.
