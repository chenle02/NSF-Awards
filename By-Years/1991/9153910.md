The New York City Board of Education has requested support to mount a project
with two broad educational goals: (a) to improve problem solving and
communication skills in 7th through 9th grade students and (b) to improve the
skills of preservice and inservice teachers in integrating technology into the
curriculum. Activities intended to lead to the realization of these goals
include: (a) development of microcomputer based laboratory and teleconferencing
in 10 area schools; (b) site visits, and teleconferences for teacher
enhancement; (c) training to 5 college classes in use of project materials and
involvement in teleconferences with the schools sites; (d) a conference to
develop and implement an action plan for the improvement of science instruction
at all grade levels during the third year.
