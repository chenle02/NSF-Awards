As society increasingly relies on distributed applications, it is ever more
important that these applications tolerate partial failures. However, many users
and developers are unwilling to sustain the costs in resources and performance
that one pays today for building reliable applications. This research seeks to
resolve the tension between the need for fault-tolerance and the costs
traditionally associated with it. A new low-overhead approach to fault-
tolerance, called lightweight fault-tolerance (LiFT), is investigated. The ideas
at the core of LiFT are (1) to determine the information necessary to reproduce
during recovery each non- deterministic event in a process execution, and (2) to
guarantee that this information is available during recovery by efficiently
replicating it in the volatile memory of a sufficient number of processes. LiFT
has two main goals: (1) the development of low-overhead fault-tolerance
techniques that encompass applications in which communication is through
message-passing, shared memory, or any combination of the two. (2) the
development of recovery protocols that guarantee at the same time good
performance during failure-free executions, fast recovery, and fault-
containment.
