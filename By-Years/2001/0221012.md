Award is for a seismic stratigraphic mapping and piston coring project to
determine the age, configuration and paleoceanographic significance of the
sedimentary sequences on J Anomaly Ridge and Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. These
ridges are ideally located to record any evidence for strong boundary currents
dating to the early Paleogene. Existing data show that the ridge system is
draped by sedimentary sequences that record development of the boundary current
during the Oligocene and Neogene, and suggest that deposition of Paleocene-
Eocene sequences may have also been influenced by currents. If strong Deep
Western Boundary Current or related northward flow occurred in the North
Atlantic prior to the onset of extensive Antarctic glaciation in the early
Oligocene, it likely affected deposition of sediment on the J Anomaly Ridge and
Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. The seismic stratigraphic mapping and piston
coring will test the hypothesis that the sediment sequences deposited on these
ridges record strong overturning circulation in the North Atlantic prior to the
onset of Antarctic glaciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
