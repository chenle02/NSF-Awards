Jan Labanowski is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to enhance the development of an Information Resource for
Computational Chemistry. This grant is made within the Information
Infrastructure and Technical Applications (IITA) portion of the High Performance
Computing and Communications (HPCC) strategic research area. This resource
facilitates the communication and collaboration of research scientists in the
area of computational chemistry throughout the world. The Computational
Chemistry Listserver is an important research infrastructure tool for over 2250
subscribers in 50 countries. The catalytic support provided through this grant
will enable Labanowski to carry out a number of innovative experiments which
will result in a better moderated, fully-archived listserver. Software will be
adapted or developed to handle the administration and supervision of the service
in a distributed environment, and to provide improved access to the message
archives. The Internet is having a tremendous impact on the field of
computational chemisty. The sharing of new ideas in a global community is now
possible on a daily interactive basis. Scientists can now engage in long
distance electronic collaborations on a full time basis. The Computational
Chemistry Listserver provides a vital communication infrastructure for the
global community of computational chemists who wish to share theoretical and
computational ideas, algorithms, and software.
