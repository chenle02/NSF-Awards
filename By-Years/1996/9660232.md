*** 9660232 Wright This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
test a low-cost approach to developing DNA-based diagnostic tests. Molecular
diagnostics are now used in medicine to detect genetic disorders, cancers, and
infectious diseases. However, high costs of development associated with
expensive gene discovery and gene sequencing efforts preclude many lower-value
applications. In particular, custom uses in agriculture, food processing, and
environmental biology are economically unfeasible. The approach outlined here
alleviates this problem. It circumvents the need for gene discovery and
extensive DNA sequencing, and instead uses DNA marker technologies as a rapid
and inexpensive means to find unique base pair sequences that are either linked
to, or diagnostic for, a trait or genotype of interest. Polymorphic DNA
fragments genetically linked to desirable genes are partially sequenced to
identify underlying base pair variation. In turn, that variation is used to
design a diagnostic test employing the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique
and sequence specific primers that will amplify the diagnostic DNA sequence if
it is present in a test sample. The Phase I effort is designed to test the
feasibility of the concept. It will do so by developing two such tests; one
designed to measure the purity of hybrid seed, and a second designed to screen
cattle for a trait affecting meat quality. If successful, the proposed research
will broaden the use of DNA-based diagnostics in agriculture, food processing,
environmental biology, and related fields. Specifically, these molecular tools
hold promise for use in: (1) plant and animal breeding to improve the
effectiveness with which desirable traits are combined and moved through
breeding programs; (2) quality testing of agricultural and food products to
ensure genetic identity and safety; and (3) biodiversity conservation to help
protect and restore populations of threatened and endangered species. ***
