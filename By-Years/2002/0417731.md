With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of San Diego will acquire a 500 MHz
NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on
a) the characterization of hunter-killer peptide structures in the presence of
membrane mimics; b) elucidation of solution structures of modified nucleic acids
and their complexes with DNA binding ligands; c) characterization of self-
assembled structures governed by hydrogen bond selectivities; d) structural
characterization of theophylline-binding RNA aptamers with altered
selectivities; and e) synthesis and structural characterization of pyrrole-based
ligands and their metal-binding complexes.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
