This project will examine the fundamental physics of magnetic reconnection under
realistic conditions such as at Earth's magnetopause. The project will derive
expressions for the scaling of the rate of reconnection as a function of the
shear flow speed. It will use both fluid and kinetic simulations to test the
results of the scaling model and will compare the signatures of reconnection to
in situ satellite data. The project will incorporate the effects of shear flow
on the recently derived coupling function for the interaction of the solar wind
with the magnetosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals are oriented
toward increasing the number of women and minorities in participation in science
in general and space and plasma science in particular. Particular emphasis will
be placed on activities that may encourage students from lower socio-economic
conditions to become involved with science. The project will include the
creation of outreach movies about space weather that will utilize the Tomchin
Planetarium at West Virginia University.
