A new technique for depositing refractory metal coating in ceramics or
semiconductors is suggested. The process is based upon liquid precursor which
could be coated on semiconductor wafers using the same techniques which are
currently used for liquid resist coatings. After baking, the liquid precursor is
reduced to a refractory metal coating in hydrogen. Unlike metallization
techniques which involve sputtering or CVD, the process takes place entirely at
atmospheric pressure, potentially reducing the complexity and cost of
metallization. Also, larger, complex surfaces can be coated potentially more
easily than is possible by vacuum processes.
