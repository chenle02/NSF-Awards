Loosely coupled distributed systems are those in which nodes can join, leave, or
fail at high rates without centralized control and network connections or
topology can be highly unstable. Examples include self-organizing overlay
networks, mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), and sensor networks. This proposal
seeks to address issues in supporting key searching in these dynamic systems.
Keyword searching is an extremely effective utility for many higher-level
distributed services, such as information retrieval in overlay networks and
habitat monitoring for sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks
to build a distributed keyword searching framework that achieves a desirable
level of system scalability, search speed, content staleness, and quality of
search. The heart of the proposed design is a distributed data structure called
a summary index, which maintains gradually less accurate search index for
content farther away to achieve scalability. This project contains three main
thrusts: 1. creating a robust "summary index"-based keyword searching framework
for loosely coupled distributed systems, 2. examining the design of various
system components and studying the tradeoffs among performance metrics, and 3.
incorporating system integration and application studies. &lt;br/&gt;
