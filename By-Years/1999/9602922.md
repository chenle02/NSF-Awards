Organic individuality has been an important problem in evolutionary and
developmental biology for over one hundred years. Theories of evolution usually
take for granted that its subjects are individuals (whose characteristics vary),
while developmental biology tries to explain how individuals come to have their
most characteristic properties. But what does it mean to be an `individual,` and
how are individuals in biology--individual organisms, cells, or DNA molecules--
different from individual entities in, say, chemistry, quantum mechanics, or
sociology? The PI will use the Fifth International Congress of Systemic and
Evolutionary Biology, to be held in Budapest, Hungary, August 17-24, 1996, as an
occasion to gather a group of philosophers working on this theme. They would
prepare papers for presentation at the conference and meet among themselves and
with others present to initiate inquiry into the nature of organic
individualism.
