The study will test the Boyle model that vertical rearrangement of nutrients in
the ocean through time can explain the glacial/interglacial CO2 changes in the
atmosphere. This will be accomplished through the reconstruction of bathymetric
distribution of nutrients in the northwest tropical Pacific Ocean over the past
25 K years and comparison of a 150 K years long record of mid-depth nutrient
content of the Pacific with atmospheric CO2 record in Vostock ice core. The
study will also verify the deglacial C-13 minimum that occurred in mid depth
levels of the subtropical Pacific.
