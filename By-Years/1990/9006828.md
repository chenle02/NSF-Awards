Prolactin is a hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland. It plays an
important role in reproduction, growth and development, and in osmoregulation in
animals. In the teleost fish, tilapia, there are two forms of prolactin both of
which appear to play a central role in osmoregulation. Dr Grau will continue to
characterize these forms of prolactin in the teleost fish and will focus on
those factors that control their release from the pituitary gland.
