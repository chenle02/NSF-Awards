This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist comparing
household energy use in two comparable communities: a small city in Sweden and
one in Minnesota. The investigator will reside for six months in each town to
gather quantitative and qualitative information through participant observation,
community-wide surveys, and in-depth interviews with household members and
utility company personnel, government officials, and other public and private
officials. The research will update and extend a study done by the investigator
in 1980-82 which showed that technology was more influential than behavioral
values in causing Sweden's lower per capita energy demand. The hypothesis is
that behavioral variables such as concern for the environment as well as rising
energy prices will have increased the importance of behavioral causes of energy
conservation. This project is important because energy conservation can not be
achieved by technical means alone. Understanding how households manage their
energy consumption is a key factor in reducing the U.S.' historically high
expenditures on energy consumption. Comparative case studies such as this one
will provide crucial in-depth understanding of why people make the energy use
decisions.
