Equipment needed to implement a course in nuclear chemistry has been recently
acquired by the Chemistry Department at James Madison University. An alpha
spectrometer, a gamma spectrometer, and an analyser system were among the items
included. The availability of this system provides chemistry majors (and
minors), pre-medical, and pre-engineering students with training in modern
nuclear measuring techniques involving pulse height measurements for alpha and
gamma particle spectrometry. Along with teaching basic concepts, the use of
nuclear counting equipment for neutron activation analysis, environmental
monitoring, medical applications and selected applications of technical and
social merit is included.
