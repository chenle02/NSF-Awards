The Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), recognizing that the body of
knowledge taught in our undergraduate studies curricula does not reflect
required linkages of science, technology and social science content, proposes to
develop and implement a new undergraduate curriculum entitled `Culture, Science
and Technology.` During the past two years, a Faculty Steering Committee has
developed a structure for the new curriculum and has identified courses meeting
the educational objectives in the degree programs. The Steering Committee also
proposed innovative student support systems including learning communities,
collaborative learning and supplemental instruction to assist our diverse
student body to be successful in preparing for careers in science, math and
technology. To implement the proposed curriculum, a group of faculty will
identify common themes, curricular materials, and pedagogical methods (based on
prior innovations in science, math and technology) that will enhance students'
understanding of the interactive and complex relationship between culture and
technology. CCP anticipates enrolling 3,400 students and training 150 faculty
over the proposed three- year developmental period. The College is making a
major in-kind contribution to the development of the curriculum and is committed
to the program's continuation at the close of the funding period, as well as
extensive evaluation and dissemination of results. Due to the size of CCP and
diversity of our student body, our proposed curriculum would serve as a model
for two-year schools struggling to develop a curriculum involving a systematic
study of the natural sciences, related technology and their interrelationship
with a changing society.
