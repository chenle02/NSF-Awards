9526814 Rundle This research is to study the non-linear physical properties of
earthquake occurrence. A variety of recent as well as older observations
indicate that clustering in space and time is a fundamental property of
seismicity observations. Because forecasting of earthquakes has been based on
temporal regularity (for example, seismic gaps), the nature of the space-time
clustering of earthquakes must be understood before any meaningful forecasts can
be made. Earthquake clustering is due to non-linear effects and interactions
between fault segments, and these factors must be understood. This work will
test a variety of nonlinear models and simulations that are known to produce
clustering in space and time through comparison with actual seismic data. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
