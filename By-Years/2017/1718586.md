The task of designing modern hardware that is impervious to any and every
security attack is almost impossible to achieve. It is extremely hard to ensure
that these complex, multi-billion transistor systems are functionally correct,
let alone secure. Thus, it should not be surprising that there are a large and
growing number of attacks that target hardware vulnerabilities. The state of the
art for hardware design security relies heavily on functional verification,
manual inspection, and code review to identify security vulnerabilities. This
labor-intensive process does not scale, it significantly reduces productivity,
and provides no guarantee that a security flaw will be identified. Continuing
with the status quo will undoubtedly leave hardware designs susceptible to
attacks manifested through hardware, firmware, and software vulnerabilities.
This project develops a property driven approach to hardware security, which
enables automatic verification of security properties on a hardware design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project encompasses three major research goals:
creating expressive security property languages, building comprehensive models
that analyze the security of a hardware design, and generating tools that can
verify security properties in an efficient and scalable manner. The
investigators address these challenges by developing models that enable the
specification of a wide variety of security properties. The project builds a
novel security property specification languages leveraging these models, and
develops new techniques that enable the verification of these properties using
existing formal solvers, simulation environments, and emulation platforms.
Finally, they address the usability of this property driven approach by
verifying security properties on different hardware designs.
