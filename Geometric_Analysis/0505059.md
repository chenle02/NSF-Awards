Abstract

Award: DMS-0505059 Principal Investigator: Sean T. Paul

This proposal aims to relate the stability of a complex projective variety to
intrinsic geometric analysis on the variety. Often, the PI is concerned with the
small time asymptotics of complicated rational energy integrals over the variety
under study. This idea was initiated by the PI in his dissertation. The energies
arise in connection with the problem of establishing the 0th order apriori
estimate for solutions to the Monge Ampere equation.

Broadly speaking, there are two ways to mathematically approach, or model, a
given problem: continuously, or discretely. Traditionally, these are quite
seperate approaches. Analysis (differential equations in particular) is the time
honoured subject in the continuous domain, combinatorics (the study of
enumerating a finite amount of data) is the hallmark of the discrete approach.
In this proposal these two methods come together-the PI will explore the
question of how the solution to an equation from analysis might be obtained by a
purely finite (but large) collection of data. The equation appeared in
Einsteins' theory of Gravitation, whereas the finite set of data arose in the
mathematics of the 1800's, and is related to the theory of computer vision.
