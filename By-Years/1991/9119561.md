This study is a comparative anatomical study of the bowfin fishes and their
close relatives. The group, named Amiiformes, contains only a single living
species, and several dozen extinct (fossil) species in rocks dating as far back
as 150 million years before present. (The living species, Amia calva, is called
a "living fossil" by many paleontologists and zoologists.) An integrative
approach, looking at embryology (with the living species), paleontology, and
comparative skeletal anatomy is used. A search will be made to identify
specialized morphological features unique to subgroups within Amiformes which
suggest close relationship among the species of those subgroups. This study may
be able to show that Amia is an important model for a better understanding of
vertebrate embryology and anatomy. The majority of the funds will be used for
preparation of fossil and living material, education (funding a 1-year
postdoctoral position) and publication of the results in widely read scientific
journals.
