0321085&lt;br/&gt;Judex&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-MRI proposal requests funds to
purchase a high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanner (uCT), which will
serve as a resource to enhance the research and education links between a
significant number of interdisciplinary faculty from the departments of
Anatomical Sciences, Anthropology, Biomedical Engineering, Brookhaven National
Laboratories, Chemistry and Material Sciences (all affiliated with the Program
in Biomedical Engineering). While micro-computed tomography has been available
for several years, the newly developed scanner has the ability to scan in-vivo,
permitting longitudinal studies to examine how tissues grow or adapt to new
functional challenges. Further, due to its cone beam technology, the higher
scanning speeds and extremely high resolutions will allow scientists to address
unique research questions beyond the scope of current equipment. This scanner
also possesses a significantly larger scanning chamber than previous generations
of uCT scanners, thus allowing full three-dimensional reconstructions of organs
and tissues without the need to compromise valuable specimens.
