This one-year project, which contains strong components in both mathematics
content and methodology, will facilitate the use of computers in middle and high
school classrooms. Under the direction of the Principal Investigator, ten
superior secondary school mathematics teachers will provide an inservice
training program to sixty middle and high school mathematics teachers from Utah,
southern Idaho, and western Wyoming. During an intensive two-week summer
session, these ten teacher-leaders will offer a total of five courses in the
structure of the number system, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics,
and discrete mathematics. These courses will combine instruction in mathematics
content with preparation in the use of materials that employ the microcomputer
as a teaching tool. During the academic year, the participants will be visited
by the PI and will communicate with each other via an existing computer network
that contains hundreds of computer-based classroom activities. The project will
demonstrate a cost-effective method of conducting inservice programs through the
use of teacher-leaders as instructors. The participants' schools will provide
computers, modems, and other support for the computer network, and Weber State
College will contribute an amount equal to 10% of the NSF award.
