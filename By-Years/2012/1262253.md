****Technical Abstract**** This project seeks to pursue two important topics of
spin caloritronics and Skyrmion materials in experimental condensed matter
physics. In spin caloritronics, one exploits the interaction between heat
transport and the charge/spin degree of freedom of electrons. Of those, spin
Seebeck effect (SSE) is one of the few methods that can generate a pure spin
current without a charge current, hence of great importance. New experiments
have been proposed to capture the intrinsic SSE in both the transverse and the
longitudinal configurations, with in-plane and out-of-plane temperature gradient
respectively, in metals as well as insulators, and the development of suitable
spin current detectors. Skyrmion materials are special solids without the
inversion symmetry and with the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interaction, resulting a helical ground state, and more interestingly, a novel
Skyrmion spin structure. Epitaxial Skyrmion thin films, with attributes
unattainable in single crystals or polycrystalline materials, will be exploited
to study the topological Hall effect, spintronic effects due to the Berry phase,
motion of Skyrmion lattice by spin-polarized current, and the Nernst effect in
Skyrmion materials. Graduate students, post-docs, and undergraduate students,
including women, will be involved in the research.

****Non-Technical Abstract**** This project seeks to pursue two new and
important topics of spin caloritronics and Skyrmion materials in Condensed
Matter Physics. In spin caloritronics, one exploits heat flows to generate a
spin current without an electric charge current. A pure current enables new
spintronic phenomena but generates much less heat. Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is
one of the few newly realized methods that can generate a pure spin current. New
experiments have been designed to capture intrinsic SSE in different measuring
configurations, to identify materials that can detect a pure spin current, and
to separate SSE from other extraneous effects. In common magnets, including
refrigerator magnets, the small magnetic moments are aligned. In some new
magnets, known as the Skyrmion materials, the magnetic moments are not aligned
but form an intricate double-twist structure with unique properties for
exploration and exploitation. Skyrmion thin films will be used to pursue new
physical effects, which may be exploited for new device applications that may
benefit existing data storage technology or may even enable new technologies.
