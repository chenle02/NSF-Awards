For the past eight years, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) has provided
developing countries with the Journal of Climate and Monthly Weather Review. The
program has been extremely successful in providing background materials for the
scientists in those countries so that they can be part of the international
policy dialogue on environmental issues. As a matter of national policy, the
United States is committed to build the scientific infrastructure of the
developing nations. As a result, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA)'s Office of Global Programs, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA)'s Office of Earth Science and the National Science
Foundation have continued to provide the support for this significant endeavor.
The support has enabled the AMS to provide these two important journals to 175
organizations.
