This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of a thermal
ionization source mass spectrometer that will be operated by the geoscience
departments of the Research Triangle Universities (University of North Carolina,
Duke University and North Carolina State University). The institutions have
jointly committed the necessary remaining funds for this acquisition. The new
instrument will be part of the analytical facilities of a Triangle Universities
consortium for microanalysis, and will be used primarily for uranium-lead,
rubidium-strontium and samarium-neodymium isotopic analyses leading to
interpretations of oceanic sediments, marine carbonate stratigraphy, the modern
terrestrial sedimentary environment, and the structure and evolution of the
continental lithosphere.
