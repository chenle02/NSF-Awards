Current railway rehabilitation methods ignore the problem of soft, variable
subgrades. Thus, miniature concrete piles will be constructed of self-cementing
type C fly ash at varying depths and spacing intervals. Varying depth allows for
variation in soils and loading conditions; varying spacing removes "bumps" at
crossings and bridges by providing for gradual changes in lateral gradation. The
piles will be installed in connecting pairs, thus keeping ties over the pile
caps as trackage "walks." Phase I research includes: the testing and
installation of minipiles on a pilot track section; a physical modeling program
to evaluate element interactions; testing and evaluation of Type C fly ash mix
designs with and without admixtures; as well as installation procedures; and
estimated cost-benefit ratios.
