This project involves supporting students to attend the IEEE Communications
Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh, and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks
(SECON 2011) to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah in June 2011. SECON is a premier
conference in the areas of sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networking, serving as a
meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as
practitioners in diverse fields of wireless communications and networking. This
project supports travel to the conference for US based Ph.D. students who might
not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons. Students will be exposed
to the conference, a technical forum that is critical for their professional
maturity and development. Students will also be involved in various activities
and work as volunteers to support these activities, increasing their level of
involvement and connection to the conference and the research community. The
recipients will be chosen based on an open competition and preference will be
given to students from underrepresented groups.
