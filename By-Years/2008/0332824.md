Magnetic Shape Memory Behavior in New Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work represents a high priority in understanding the magneto-mechanical
response of a very promising ferromagnetic shape memory alloy system. The focus
is on CoNiAl alloys that undergo shape change associated with applied magnetic
fields. Ferromagnetic shape memory alloys undergo rearrangement of the
martensitic variant structure under an applied magnetic field which could
produce few percent strains. They have advantages over traditional shape memory
alloys because of their faster response time, and the CoNiAl has higher strength
compared to other ferromagnetic shape memory materials. The experiments include
measurement of magnetization versus applied magnetic field for two specific
compositions of CoNiAl alloys, the establishment of easy and hard axis of
magnetization with testing of several crystal orientations, and the magnetic
field induced strain measurements as a function of applied stress. The
mechanical response of the CoNiAl alloys will be also evaluated via temperature
cycling under stress and observation of the shape memory behavior. The work will
have impact in design of new materials and their modeling, and potential
applications in various engineering devices such as actuators. The project will
provide an opportunity to train a graduate student as well as undergraduate
students in understanding the fundamental concepts in transforming materials,
ferromagnetism and shape memory behavior. &lt;br/&gt;
