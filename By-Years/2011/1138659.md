NSF: RAPID: Collaborative Research: Using Lessons from the Disaster in Japan to
Develop Communications for Emergency
Situations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During disasters, the
telecommunication infrastructure are usually heavily damaged or overloaded,
which leads to serious disruptions in the warning and rescue operations.
Similarly, part of the Japanese cellular Early Earthquake Warning (EEW) system
were damaged during the March 11th earthquake and tsunami. This collaborative
project proposes to study the disruption of emergency communications during the
last disaster in Japan and investigate corresponding solutions. In particular,
the project has the following three integrated objectives: 1) To study the
cellular EEW system of Japan and its use in the March 11th earthquake in Japan;
2) To study the communication problems that were encountered leading to
disruptions in warning and rescue operations; and 3) To explore tower-less
phone-to-phone direct communication mode that can make the cellular phone
communications much more resilient during disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project supports collection of data about communication disruptions in Japan;
treatment of such data to better understand the impact of telecommunication
failures; and finally, solutions how to enhance the cellular system with ad hoc
communications. The project is a close collaboration among PIs inthe US, their
collaborators in Japanese universities and cellular service providers in Japan.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project will lead to a deeper
understanding of tradeoffs among robustness, simplicity, scalability, self-
organization and adaptivity in designing a cellular emergency broadcast system
for USA and beyond. The results of this project will have a direct and practical
impact on developing an effective emergency warning system using the latest
communication devices.
