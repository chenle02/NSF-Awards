In many engineering products, the shape of a design can have considerable
affect on performance. The performance of dams, transmission towers, fillets,
aircraft, and automobiles are all affected by their geometric shape. Shape
optimal design can be applied to any structures for which a mathematical model
exists. The basic approach in shape optimal design is to choose a set of design
variables that defines the shape of the structure. Changes in the geometric
structure can then be related via changes in the finite-element mesh to changes
in the design variables. The Principal Investigators propose to develop a new
approach for shape optimization of structures. The design variables will be
represented as fictitious loads on the structure. The displacements produced by
these fictitious loads are added to the finite-element mesh to obtain a new
shape. This new approach is computationally superior to the standard approaches
and allows the possibility of physical interpretation of optimality criteria for
a class of problems. This research is a joint research project with Subramaniam
Rajan at Arizona State University who is being funded separately under grant
DMC-8614205.
