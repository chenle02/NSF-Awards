The Fifteenth International Conference on X-Ray and Inner- Shell Processes will
be held in Knoxville, Tennessee, July 9-13, 1990. Topics will include
absorption, emission and scattering of X-rays; photoelectron and Auger electron
studies; higher order processes; innershell hole decay; processes involving
highly charged ions; applications to solid state and surface phenomena and
plasma physics (as well as applications in atomic physics); applications of
synchrotron radiation techniques, advanced apparatus and techniques; and
theoretical advances in atomic structure and transitions, scattering,
Bremsstrahlung, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamic effects. Attending
scientists will be drawn from various disciplines and from applied and
development work. Conference proceedings will be published.
