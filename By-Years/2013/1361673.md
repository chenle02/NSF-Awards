A homogeneous space is a geometric object that manifests a continuous family of
symmetries. Dynamics of flows on homogeneous spaces are related to many natural
problems in number theory and geometry. Traditionally, the homogeneous spaces of
interest in most studies have finite volume. However, it has recently been
discovered that the dynamics on homogeneous spaces of infinite volume also arise
in many natural problems such as Apollonian circle packings and in building
efficient networks. This proposal will investigate this rich
topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with dynamics on infinite
homogeneous spaces, which turns out to yield quite a rich theory and has several
deep and striking applications. The proposed study involves new interactions
between hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups, ergodic theory, and number theory.
Investigating this new territory requires many new ideas both from geometry and
dynamics, and opens up new interactions between these fields.
