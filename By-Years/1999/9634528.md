9634528 Novak This grant is directed torward finding more direct methods of
synthesizing useful polymers from inexpensive, new monomers. Specifically, the
PI will focus on the synthesis of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), PVOH derivatives,
and poly(vinyl amine) (PVAm) derivatives from enols and enamines, respectively.
One goal of this work is the conversion of acetaldehyde to PVOH, which de facto,
is the synthesis of PVOH from ethylene and oxygen. The synthetic approach
involves circumventing inherent thermodynamic limitations by approaching
conundrums from a kinetic perspective. From this vantage point, many
thermodynamic problems can be transformed into competitive rate problems, and
hence, remedied through chemistry (e.g., catalysis, conditions, etc.). In the
context of this proposal, enols (e.g., vinyl alcohol, and its substituted
derivatives) will be rapidly generated under meta-stable conditions and
polymerized at a rate faster than they can tautomerize to the more
thermodynamically stable aldehyde. Alternative enols will also be generated by
the catalytic isomerization of allyl alcohol derivatives to the corresponding
enols using homogeneous Rh(I), Ir(I), and Ru(II) catalysts. %%% Synthesis of
important polymers from common and inexpensive sources, in particular on
synthesis of water-soluble polymers used in applications ranging from
pharmaceuticals to low VOC paints. ***
