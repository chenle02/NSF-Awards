The principal investigator will study two problems in manifolds of nonpositive
curvature as well as two problems involving homogeneous spaces and Blaschke
manifolds. More specifically these problems concern the symmetry of
solvmanifolds, geometric measure theoretic characterizations of Hadamard
manifolds, constancy of eigenvalues, and Blaschke manifolds whose holonomy group
is exceptional. The surface of a two-holed inner tube is an example of a
manifold which may have nonpositive curvature. These have their higher-
dimensional analogues. A foliation of one of these is a collection of lower-
dimensional surfaces stacked together which fill up the manifold. The holonomy
group is a measure of the twisting and shearing of such leaves as they sweep
through their ambient manifolds. The principal investigator will study deep
questions concerning holonomy on specialized sorts of manifolds.
