A computerized classroom is being developed to serve primarily Calculus, but
also Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. PCs are being networked to a
file server with several selections of software. Innovative materials have been
developed and there has been considerable experience using these materials and
modern software. Through this grant, these two formats are combined to bring a
hands-on computer environment to the classroom. Students are now able to explore
mathematics at a level of depth and excitement not before possible.
