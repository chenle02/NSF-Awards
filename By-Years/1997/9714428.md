9714428 Jaillet This award is to support the Triennial Symposium on
Transportation Analysis (TRISTAN). The Symposium brings together leading
researchers from around the world working on mathematical and algorithmic
aspects of transportation systems analysis, with an emphasis on logistics,
vehicle routing, common carrier operations, and traffic operations. The
Symposium serves as an important forum for the presentation and exchange of
research ideas in transportation science, and is expected to spur the
formulation of major research directions in the field.
