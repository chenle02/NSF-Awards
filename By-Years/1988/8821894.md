The purpose of this engineering research is to establish the fundamental
engineering basis for ion implantation on the surface of high molecular weight
polyethylene to significantly alter it's surface properties. This process has
great potential for reducing the surface wear on plastic surfaces and in
particular on prosthetic devices. This new process will reduce wear, increase
surface life, and reduce friction during use. Useful applications for this
process include; joint replacement and cartilage reinforcement or replacement.
