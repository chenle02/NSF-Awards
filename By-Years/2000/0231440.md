The objective of the project is to develop a PC and Web based interactive
"Systems and Controls" E-Book to address multidisciplinary curricular needs in
Electrical, Mechanical, and Aerospace Engineering, and Mathematics. This E-book
supports undergraduate controls curriculum classes such as differential
equations, microprocessors, linear algebra, and senior design. It enables
multidisciplinary curricular integration via case studies, and bridges theory
and practice by using realistic design problems and capstone projects. It also
enhances student learning through interactive modeling/simulation in MATLAB with
3D animation, interactive problems containing real-time solutions, case studies,
and interactive multimedia topical lectures. It provides an enriched interactive
learning experience which facilitates conveying fundamental/advanced concepts,
asynchronous learning, and different teaching and learning styles. Multiple test
sites, university and industrial partners, publishers, and an assessment
specialist contribute to the development of this E-book.
