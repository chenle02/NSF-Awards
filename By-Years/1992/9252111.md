The objectives of this proposal are to increase the conceptual understanding of
students in introductory algebra and calculus- based physics courses, and to
make clearer at an earlier stage the connection between the scientific method
and the physics lab. This is being accomplished by introduction of Workshop
Physics and microcomputer-based laboratory curricula. Five Macintosh LC's
provide the heart of the new physics lab, and a host of probes interfaced with
the computers allows the students to gather and reduce data for further
analysis. Students learn almost all of their physics from these labs,
effectively eliminating lectures.
