The purpose of this proposal is to develop cross-sectional and longitudinal
models of science education from an indicator system perspective and explore the
policy implications of those models. The proposed research will be carried out
in three phases taking approximately three years. In Year 1, newly released
NELS: files and other relevant data sets such as the IEA science data for the
United States and LSAY will be obtained and evaluated for their utility in the
development of a science education policy guidance system. In addition,
technical modeling issues will be address.
