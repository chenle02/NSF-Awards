The extraction of three-dimensional information from two- dimensional views is
an important aspect of the inspection of manufactured products. The
determination of the quality of the product often depends on accurate three-
dimensional information. Depth information is especially important in the
inspection of nominally-smooth surfaces for defects. %%% This research intends
to determine the three-dimensional structure of a nominally-smooth surface from
a sequence of images acquired from a single point of view, where in each image,
the object is illuminated by collimated light emanating from a unique direction.
