This award supports the establishment of the "Midwest Dynamical Systems Program
Group." Sixteen mathematicians specializing in dynamical systems and the study
of chaos, from Northwestern University, the University of Minnesota, and the
University of Cincinnati, will continue their group activities while partially
supported by this five-year award. Participant support costs of the Midwest
Dynamical Systems Conference, which has run biannually since 1970, will be
partially offset. Support for two graduate students, a postdoc, and compatible
computer equipment are also included in the award. The mathematicians involved
have a long history of close interaction and this award will help strengthen
their ties.
