This award will fund an LC with Mass Spectrometer and Diode Array Detector. This
instrument will support research and undergraduate training in the laboratories
of two chemistry and two biology faculty. These include studies of the ability
of natural products to scavenge reactive oxygen species, studies of sporulation
signals in Steptomyces, and the mechanism of environmental effects on turtle sex
determination. It will also be incorporated into a variety of sciences courses,
and non-science majors will benefit from a proposed Forensic Science course.
There is currently no such equipment available at Hofstra University,
necessitating trips to SUNY at Stony Brook. Hofstra University is an
undergraduate and masters degree granting institution with a diverse student
body.
