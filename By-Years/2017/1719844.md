This award will support a two-and-one-half day workshop celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering.
In the 20 years that the Partnership has existed, it has funded over 200
Principal Investigators for research on a wide range of topics including high
energy density plasmas, low temperature plasmas, astrophysical and space
plasmas, plasma based accelerators, etc. The Partnership has funded the research
of many students and postdocs, some of whom have gone on to become Principal
Investigators of NSF and DOE awards in their own right. All current and former
Principal Investigators, as well as several current and former program officers
at NSF and DOE who have had significant roles in creating, organizing, and
managing the Partnership were invited to attend. The expected attendance is
about 100 researchers as well as representatives of NSF, DOE, and other federal
government agencies involved in supporting plasma science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop attendees will discuss the
scientific achievements supported by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma
Science and Engineering over the past 20 years, as well as the future of the
field of basic plasma physics and its applications. The workshop will include a
session discussing the history of the Partnership, 26 invited scientific talks,
a poster session with 28 poster presentations, and two panel discussions. This
award is being co-funded by the Division of Physics, the Division of
Astronomical Sciences, the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, and
the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.
