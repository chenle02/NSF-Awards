9361602 Robinson This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
the general area of analytical chemical instrumentation and specifically in the
subfield of thermal detectors. Pyroelectric thermal detectors traditionally are
based on inorganic ferroelectric single crystals or ferroelectric organic
polymer films which are oriented in an electric field. In this Phase I study
pyroelectric films will be prepared by fluorination of self assembled monolayers
(SAM) of long chain alkylthiols on gold surfaces. Dipolar SAMs are expected to
be stable, robust and pyroelectric. Pyroelectric coefficients and figures of
merit will be determined as a function of alkylthiol chain length and degree of
fluorination. If SAMs can be made with pyroelectric properties better than
currently used materials, Phase II studies will be directed towards fabricating
a prototype pyroelectric device. %%% Pyroelectric detectors based on fluorinated
SAMs are expected to be compact, low cost, and capable of being integrated with
an amplifier onto a single silicon chip and operated at room temperature. The
low thermal mass and low dielectric constant of a free-standing monolayer should
make its sensitivity and response time better than current polymer pyroelectric
materials. ***
