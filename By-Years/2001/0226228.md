This NSDL Collections project is aggregating the many science and mathematics
education resources developed through Federal funding, to make them easily and
meaningfully accessible by teachers, parents, and students. It is also laying
the groundwork for ensuring that future resource and materials development
adheres to standard metadata schema and tagging practices, on which efficient
and relevant search, navigation, and access to content rests. Specific
activities include: i) creating metadata for legacy collections as well as new
digital content via a content management system; ii) systematically reviewing
Federally-supported web sites to identify resources not yet part of the NSDL;
iii) building awareness among grantees of the value of compliance with emerging
metadata standards and best metadata tagging practices; iv) developing a
portfolio of collection access tools including personalization; and v) working
with grantees to secure rights to archive mathematics and science education
digital resources so they are not lost at the end of a grant period. The project
team is working closely with the NSDL Core Integration effort to ensure
interoperability with other NSDL collections and services. Federal agency
programs that are the initial focus of this project include the NSF's various
instructional and materials development programs and related efforts housed
within the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education and the
Division of Undergraduate Education, and the Department of Education's Regional
Laboratories and the Eisenhower Consortia. Progress on this project is also
being shared with the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the
Science.gov Alliance.
