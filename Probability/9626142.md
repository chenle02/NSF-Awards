9626142 Li, Xue-Mei ABSTRACT The aim of this proposal is to study stochastic
flows on manifolds, including their existence, geometric properties and
applications to the study of partial differential equations, non-linear
equations, Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise and the geometry and
topology of the underlying space. One of the objects to study, which will be a
useful tool in many directions, is the affine connection associated to a
stochastic differential equation. This connection provides the geometrical
structure to obtain good estimates for the derivative flow of stochastic
differential equations. Those structures arising from degenerate systems are
particularly investigated: there are problems of definition and of the existence
of singularities. Although the main work is on finite dimensional systems
infinite dimensional ones are also considered. Bismut type formulae and
integration by parts formulae on path spaces connected to the above are also
examined. On a more directly geometrical level the concepts of spectral
positivity for curvatures are considered together with its consequences for the
geometry of the manifold. Stochastic flows are typically solutions of stochastic
differential equations (equations perturbed by white noise). Properties of
stochastic flows including the stability and invariance are particularly
interesting when considered together with the geometry of the underlying spaces.
The techniques described in the proposal are used to study nonlinear equations
including the blow ups and regularities of the solutions. The investigator also
examines properties of local martingales, which finds its applications in
mathematical finance.
