This award provides one-half the funds necessary to purchase the hardware
components necessary to assemble extraction systems for obtaining hydrogen and
oxygen samples from silicate rocks and minerals for isotope analysis.
Construction of the extraction lines and their operation will be performed in
the Department of Geology at Oregon State University, which will assume
responsibility for the remaining costs of the project. The hydrogen and oxygen
gas samples obtained from the new extraction lines will be analyzed in a mass
spectrometer available in the School of Oceanography at Oregon State University.
The isotope data are essential to characterize and understand large magma and
hydrothermal systems in the continental crust.
