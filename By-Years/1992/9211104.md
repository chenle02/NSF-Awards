It has recently become possible to solve quantum reactive scattering problems
within their full three-dimensional context for three-atom systems with modest
numbers of energetically-open initial-and-final quantum states. While a high
level of accuracy has been achieved for a few simple systems, there remain major
impediments to the extension of these methods to the vast majority of
interesting chemical reactions. The basic theoretical and computational issues
are easily characterized on a qualitative level. First, the complexity and
computational intensity of current methods even for simple three-atom systems
challenge current generations of high-performance computers. Second, as one
moves beyond these simple chemical reactions, the complexity of the calculations
increases tremendously because the number of open initial-and-final quantum
states increases by orders of magnitude. For this reason such problems are
currently beyond the realm of consideration for even the most optimistic of
researchers. This research will focus on developments that will provide steps
towards solving such problems on massively parallel computers.
