Data management has become a core function of computing,
strongly&lt;br/&gt;influencing not only performance but also energy consumption,
program&lt;br/&gt;security, fault tolerance, and other program properties. While
many&lt;br/&gt;programs use a large amount of data, they do not access all data
at&lt;br/&gt;all times. Hence, data adaptation can improve cache efficiency
by&lt;br/&gt;identifying and compacting precisely those data required at a
given&lt;br/&gt;point of computation. Such fine-grained and dynamic data
management&lt;br/&gt;may significantly alleviate the bottleneck on communication
and&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the control of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
studies fine-grained data adaptation through a&lt;br/&gt;compiler-based
approach. It develops three compiler-assisted&lt;br/&gt;techniques. First,
program monitoring analyzes selected data; then,&lt;br/&gt;locality analysis
identifies their group locality; and finally, data&lt;br/&gt;transformation
changes their layout while maintaining program&lt;br/&gt;correctness using run-
time data maps. The new system improves cache&lt;br/&gt;optimization for data-
intensive applications on conventional machines&lt;br/&gt;and memory management
for general-purpose programs on embedded&lt;br/&gt;devices. In parallel to
research, the investigator develops&lt;br/&gt;data-analysis tools to support
teaching of memory issues in computer&lt;br/&gt;organization, compiler, and
programming courses. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;also develops an advanced course
that focuses on memory optimization&lt;br/&gt;techniques at all system
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
