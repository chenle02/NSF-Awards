Paul Yang will work on three central problems in geometric analysis. The first
of these involves investigating which functions on the sphere are Gaussian
curvature functions of metrics conformally equivalent to the standard metric.
The second is to find out to what extent the universal cover of certain surfaces
of negative curvature resembles the ball. In the final question the objective is
to study the analytic and geometric nature of regions which give reliable data
when used as sampling regions. The Nirenberg problem concerning characterizing
Gaussian curvature functions is a delicate one in view of the necessary
condition observed by Kazdan and Warner. Yang will focus his efforts on an
investigation of functions admitting only two critical points. In the context of
the uniformization problem Yang will investigate the conjecture that the
universal cover of a Kahler manifold of negative sectional curvature is
biholomorphically equivalent to a bounded domain in complex n-space. The Pompieu
problem will be reformulated in terms of the existence of an infinite sequence
of eigenfunctions to two dual systems of overdetermined boundary conditions.
