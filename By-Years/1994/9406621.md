9406621 Christopher Ruff/ Catherine Rafferty This dissertation project is an
innovative application of imaging techniques from radiographs to the dynamics
and comparisons of joint mechanics of different living and fossil primates.
There is substantial evidence that trabecular bone in the subarticular regions
of joints respond to alterations in the mechanical environment. By becoming
oriented in the direction of the major stresses existing, the boney struts and
plates will act to minimize the bending stresses, as one example. This project
will examine external and subarticular joint structure in relation to body size
and locomotion in a number of primate and other mammalian species, and the
results will be applied to the study of osteological specimens of subfossil
lemurs in museum collections. Joint surface area and volume will be estimated
from external measurements, and the mass, density and distribution of
subarticular trabecular bone will be derived using image analysis of the
radiographs. The project will also result in the expert and specialized training
of a new professional. ***
