This Research in Undergraduate Instittuions (RUI) award is to continue and
complete research on simulation methodologies for real-time surgical training in
collaboration with the NSF sponsored Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Interactive Computer Graphics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
The research will address constructing theoretical and experimental models which
will focus on the design and validation of a simulation model for the human knee
joint with special attention paid to modeling the meniscus. Knee geometry will
be reconstructed from NMR scans of an actual human knee. Soft tissues will be
modeled using a new particle-based computer- simulation modeling technique that
is particularly well suited to real-time modeling of soft biological tissues.
These models will be utilized for the teaching of arthoscopic surgical
techniques. The Principal Investigator is well qualified to conduct this
research. The Program Manager recommends Williams College be awarded $30,000 for
one (1) year. The award includes $5,000 to provide support for one undergraduate
research assistant from the "Funding for Support of Women, Minority, and
Disabled Engineering Research Assistants" program.
