The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a novel printed circuit board (PCB) laser micromachining
processes. Conventional PCB manufacturing processes utilize wet chemical etching
and electroless deposition. These conventional processes require the use of many
hazardous chemicals, heated etching baths, and multiple washing cycles requiring
excessive water use. The proposed miniaturized PCBs can be used in space-
constrained electronics devices such as mobile, wearable, and implantable
medical devices to make them lighter and more compact, creating additional room
for a battery at reduce cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
focused on the development of novel low-cost printed circuit board (PCB)
manufacturing technology that produces PCBs with higher wiring density than
conventional PCB, reducing the PCB size. The proposed PCB manufacturing
technology uses laser-micromachining, a chemical-free process that eliminates
the use of harsh chemicals and reduces water and electricity
consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
