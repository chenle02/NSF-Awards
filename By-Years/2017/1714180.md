Abstract: This research addresses the growing need for new techniques in
controlled sensing and information fusion with social sensors. Social sensors
learn from and interact with each other over a social network to estimate an
underlying state - the process is called social learning. The aim of this
research is to develop mathematical models, algorithms and analysis for
controlled sensing and information fusion with social learning. Controlled
sensing with social learning is a first step towards constructing generative
feedback models and algorithms in the data science of social networks. Similar
formulations arise in multi-agent signal processing problems where automated
decision makers interact to achieve a sensing goal. The research transcends
classical statistical signal processing (which deals with extracting signals
from noisy measurements) to address the deeper issue of how multi-agent decision
systems and signal processing algorithms interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objectives of this research fall under two inter-related themes: Bayesian social
learning where quickest change detection and controlled fusion are considered;
and interactive sensing in large scale networks where adaptive estimation of
degree distribution dynamics, infection dynamics and posterior Cramer Rao bounds
are considered. The research involves the interplay of Bayesian social learning,
stochastic control and mean field dynamics. The key unifying themes underpinning
this research are statistical signal processing and controlled sensing. Social
learning involves myopic decision making by individual agents; while controlled
sensing involves stochastic control over a time horizon. This interaction
between myopic social sensors (local decision makers) and a non-myopic
controller (global decision maker) results in unusual behavior. The scientific
innovation of this research stems from advancing deep results in Bayesian
estimation, stochastic optimization, weak convergence analysis, and lattice
programming.
