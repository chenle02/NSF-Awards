Senescence of whole plants and of plant organs os moderately well understood
physiologically. The PI will begin a nine-month program away from the home
institution with a three- month internship at a leading center for physiological
and ecological research (Carnegie Institute of Washington and Stanford
University"s Department of Biological Sciences), learning senescence physiology,
measuring nitrogen movement within and out of senescing plants, and
investigating the consequences of two kinds of experimentally induced leaf
senescence on plant productivity. The short-term productivity measurements will
expose the PI to current techniques for measuring light, photosynthesis, and
respiration. Next, the PI will spend six months at a field station in Costa
Rica, where the Pi will use the knowledge and techniques acquired at Carnegie to
conduct field experiments. The target organisms will be evergreen perennial, a
group of plants that is crucial to the design of sustainable agricultural
systems and to the understanding of tropical forest dynamics. If successful,
this research will enable scientists to accelerate or delay plant senescence by
manipulating light and soul nutrients.
