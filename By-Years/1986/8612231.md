This project provides partial support of the Third International Symposium on
Density Stratified Flow. Density stratified flows occur in a very broad range of
flow situations, from hydraulics to oceanography and meteorology, whose
complexity makes predictions and analysis very difficult. A symposium to assess
the current international state of the art is planned.
