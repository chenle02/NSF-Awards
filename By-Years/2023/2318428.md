The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology that can produce large torque without gear systems and
with a higher efficiency than existing systems. From drills (small) to
escalators (large), most high-torque products require gear systems to amplify
the torque given the maximum capacity because the size of the product cannot be
increased or decreased indefinitely. However, it is known that gear systems
reduce efficiency by as much as 80%. Also, due to irregular loading utility, it
experiences vibration and counter torque affecting the motor's life. Moreover,
mobile systems requiring huge input power mostly rely on fossil fuels that
pollute the environment. The proposed technology is anticipated to affect the
electric motor market, especially high torque motors, and it will provide
opportunities to form new markets that have not been explored due to the limited
efficiency of motors.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a sustainable torque
generator which is developed by utilizing multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes
that can generate huge gyroscopic torque. However, since the torque generated by
the Control Moment Gyroscopes is uncoordinated, singular, and non-permanent, it
is difficult to make the Control Moment Gyroscopes a motor system that can
generate torque in a constant direction. Nevertheless, by optimizing the
configuration of multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes with this mechanism and
developing the proprietary control algorithm, this solution can produce large
torque without gear systems with higher efficiency than existing systems. This
project will challenge the usage of the conventional motor and engine system and
establish the benefits of a new gyroscopic effect-driven gearless torque
generator.
