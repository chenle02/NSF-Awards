The problem addressed by this project is that many students do not have an
opportunity to conduct sophisticated ecological research when they are juniors
and seniors. The solution to this problem is to develop a program in modern
ecology at the upper-division level emphasizing molecular approaches to
investigating ecological questions. Students participating in this project are
taking a new course in molecular ecology and are conducting substantive
independent research in this area. They are using the techniques of molecular
biology to answer questions about the role of genetic heterozygosity in
metabolic adaptations, the role of heat shock proteins in the seasonal
acclimatization of fish, the role of paternity in population biology of frogs,
and various other ecological issues. This program includes a component designed
to increase the number of women and minorities in ecology. By working directly
with the Philadelphia High School Academies, the principal investigator is
recruiting additional women and minorities. Upon completion of this program
undergraduates will be conducting molecular ecology research at an advanced
level.
