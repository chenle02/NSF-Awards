The research is to study vertical coupling in the wintertime polar regions
between the stratosphere and mesosphere and to investigate the mechanisms
leading to significant disturbances of the polar wintertime mesosphere during
strong baroclinic conditions in the stratosphere. The project will explore and
study these baroclinic structures in detail by utilizing global temperature
measurements of the stratosphere and mesosphere from satellite observations
combined with extensive ground-based observations. Furthermore, empirical and
numerical models will be employed to reproduce the observed phenomena and
develop a more complete physical understanding of the vertical coupling,
planetary wave activity, and mechanistic processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ground-based measurements will include Rayleigh LIDAR measurements from
Greenland and hydroxyl temperatures from interferometric measurements in Arctic
and Antarctic. In addition to the atmospheric observations, the PIs will combine
their observations with atmospheric community models such as the Whole-
Atmosphere Climate Community Model (WACCM).
