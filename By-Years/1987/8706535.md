The Natural Hazards Information Center plays a vital role in the dissemination
of natural hazards information in the United States. The Center will continue to
disseminate hazards research information to potential users--administrators,
technologists, and scientists. The Center will publish the Natural Hazards
Observer six times a year, continue its publication series, and hold its annual
workshop involving users and producers of hazards research. The Center will
provide information on a day-to-day basis in response to requests. The
preparation and evaluation of materials and assistance to other groups in the
development of new programs and information will complete the Center's
responsibilities. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing lines of
communication with groups not previously active in the hazards field to increase
their awareness and to stimulate efforts to mitigate hazard impacts on their own
facilities.
