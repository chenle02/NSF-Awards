The purpose of this project is to provide partial support for the 2019 Dynamics
Days conference to be held January 4-6, 2019, on the campus of Northwestern
University and at the Hilton Orrington Hotel in Evanston, Illinois. Dynamics
Days is an annual conference on nonlinear dynamics and its applications. It has
established itself as a premier conference for promoting new collaborations in
applied math and nonlinear science; it has been hosted at rotating sites in the
US for nearly 40 years (since 1982). Due to the broad applicability of nonlinear
dynamics, the conference is highly interdisciplinary, including areas such as
physics, engineering, mathematics, biology, and computer science. This year, the
focus of the conference will be on six themes: neuroscience, complex fluids,
data-driven &amp; machine learning methods, nonlinear materials, complex
networks, and human/biological systems. The main goals of the conference are to
gather leading researchers with young investigators and students to promote
cross fertilization and dissemination of ideas, and to engage students. The
conference webpage is http://ddays2019.northwestern.edu/. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The conference will have 16 invited speakers and a similar number of
contributed talks, as well as short "flash" presentations and poster sessions.
No parallel sessions will take place; all attendees are expected to attend all
talks in order to promote discussion across application fields. Support provided
by the NSF will be used primarily to offer scholarships to allow participation
of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.
Participants from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to
attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
