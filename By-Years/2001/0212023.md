&lt;br/&gt;0212023&lt;br/&gt;Rohlf&lt;br/&gt;Ordinary statistical methods cannot
be used to study variation or correlations among species because the fundamental
assumption of independence of observations is violated due to the pattern of
similarity expected as a result of their common evolutionary history. This
project is concerned with the development and evaluation of special statistical
methods that can be used to take this dependence into account. Work is proposed
on generalized least-squares models, mixed effects models, generalized linear
models (using extensions for non-independent data), and generalizations for the
analysis of multivariate data (especially for suites of shape variables obtained
from geometric morphometric studies). Generalizations to models of reticulated
evolution and geographic sampling will also be investigated. These methods will
be applied to several data sets in order to evaluate their usefulness in
practice.&lt;br/&gt;Support for a graduate student is included in the project,
along with enhancements to software programs that the Principal Investigator has
made available for many years to the science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
