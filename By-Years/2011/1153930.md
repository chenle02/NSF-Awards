Refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) in the ocean has long been recognized
as highly resistant to removal. It has a mean lifetime in the ocean of thousands
of years, so it is generally thought of as a recalcitrant pool that is
transported mostly conservatively with the thermohaline circulation. But unlike
RDOC in the present-day ocean, this vast reservoir has been implicated by
paleoceanographic research as a relatively rapid-turnover carbon source/sink
involved in past climate changes. Accordingly, the RDOC reservoir in ancient
oceans must at times have been much larger than today, and that large reservoir
must have been rapidly mobilized to release its carbon to the atmosphere. There
is a clear need to understand how RDOC source and sink processes operate in the
modern ocean in order to understand its potential role in past or future
oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a researcher at the Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami hopes to
fill knowledge gaps in the RDOC-climate connection. Inasmuch as mapping of its
global distribution was accomplished only within the past few years, few solid
facts about processes controlling the RDOC pool have been established. One
particularly important RDOC sink is in the northern North Pacific. The PI
believes that RDOC carried in bottom waters from the Southern Ocean to the far
north is conserved, but once in the vicinity of Pacific Deep Water formation
there is a rather abrupt loss of carbon. His immediate goal in this project is
to characterize the RDOC sink in the North Pacific, an objective that is one
part of the larger goal of understanding the role of ocean RDOC in global
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed studies of the
modern ocean carbon cycle will give us new insights on the role of marine DOC in
Earth's past and future climates. The topic of this research is also closely
related to the principal investigator's current leadership responsibilities in
helping to implement the new U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan.
