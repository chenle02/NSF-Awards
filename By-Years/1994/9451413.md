9451413 Werner Spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
integrate previously separate disciplines. Therefore, this project allows
undergraduate students to synthesize their studies in Geography, Biology, and
Environmental Studies using the spatial data and methods available in GIS to
model environmental problems. The project permits faculty to demonstrate a wide
range of analyses, and enhances learning by allowing the students to implement
the principles of spatial analyses and experiment with algorithms and input
parameters. This project also integrates our curricula, enabling students to
link data, projects, and methodology among such disciplines as geography,
biology, and environmental studies.
