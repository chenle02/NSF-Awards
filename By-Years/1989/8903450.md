A group of institutes, centers, and universities throughout the country will
sponsor a summer school in Santa Fe, New Mexico during the four-week period June
5-30, 1989. The goal of the summer school is to provide graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows with an introduction to the study of "complex" behavior in
mathematical, physical, and living systems. The emphasis of the school will be
on developing techniques for measuring and analyzing complex behavior, and
applying these techniques to the study of specific systems. Subjects to be
covered include nonlinear dynamics, computational and algorithmic complexity,
disordered systems, neural nets and computational neurobiology, chemical
oscillators, lattice gases, pattern formulation in biological systems, and
design of parallel-processing algorithms. The four-week school will consist of
approximately nine short courses together with seminars, computer workshops, and
experimental labs supplementing the lectures. The first three weeks will be
organized around formal lectures, and the final "Research Week" will be devoted
primarily to research on projects suggested by the lecturers. The material
presented at the school is intended to be accessible to advanced students with
graduate-level training in the mathematical, physical, biological, or
information sciences and a strong mathematical background.
