Abstract ATM-9731089 Gutzler, David S. University of New Mexico Title:
Observations and Modeling of Large-Scale Controls on Summer Rainfall in
Southwest North America The broad goals of the proposal are to characterize
interannual summer precipitation anomalies in the southwestern United States in
order to guide future prediction effort. Observational data along with the CCM3
model output will be analyzed. A control run of CCM3 with the SST fixed will be
examined for realistic monsoon simulation across the southwest USA. If the
simulation is not realistic, sensitivity experiments for artificial topographic
relief will be conducted. Water being very important over this region, any new
insights into the mechanisms that modulate summer rainfall in the southwest USA
will have important social benefits.
