9522265 Maurer This project is to enhance the quality of undergraduate courses
by incorporating new research in hardware design, and design automation
software. Three new courses will be introduced, and a fourth is being planned.
Three existing undergraduate hardware courses will be revised to included new
information on the use of design tools, and design automation theory. The first
objective is to teach students how to use design tools, while the second is to
teach students how to actively participate in the development of new tools. The
final products will be a set of course outlines with detailed guidelines and
design-oriented exercises; a set of laboratory manuals providing exercises in
creating complex designs and making modifications to existing designs; a set of
complex designs to be used either as examples or as the basis for exercises in
design modifications; a set of highly sophisticated and completely integrated
design tools that will carry the student from the initial inception of an idea
through to its implementation; and a set of new textbooks aimed at the problems
of design and the use of design automation. Results will be made available
through scholarly publications, Internet newsgroups and anonymous FTP, and
through a series of summer workshops. ***
