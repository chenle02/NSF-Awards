Computer-based monitoring of the workplace is a fairly recent phenomenon about
which little is known. This study investigates how computer-based monitoring is
currently operating and how it affects the work process and the quality of work
life for employees. The study also focusses on the economic justification for
computer-based monitoring. The research is conducted as a multi-site case study
of four firms in Tucson, Arizona that use computer-based monitoring. Data is
collected through observation, structured interviews, and questionnaires over
the course of one year.
