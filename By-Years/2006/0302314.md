This project is developing rapid prototyping and time-compression techniques in
a 'design for manufacturing' program for technicians. Tasks include developing
and expanding nine course modules, offering workshops for faculty, providing
technical and research experiences for students, and developing laboratory and
computer-aided design tools. A unique feature of this project is its application
to the entertainment industry, with additional applications in the
biomedical/biotechnology fields. A strong information technology component
includes the sharing of design code and files over the internet between the
laboratories at the three institutions. The project is serving community
college, university, and high school vocational technical students.
