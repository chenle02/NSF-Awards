This is an Institutional Infrastructure proposal to build a GPU cluster to
support research in data-parallel code development and optimization, as well as
research applications, in three scientific domains, namely, seismology, biology
and astrophysics. These goals build on a close collaboration with an expert team
in GPU computing from computer science. The proposed cluster will serve not only
as an invaluable resource for computation, but will also aid cross-fostering of
techniques and concepts between disciplines and will be used to stimulate
collaboration and synergistic research activity in a wide range of
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though domain scientists are increasingly
dependent on computation to achieve their research goals, most are not experts
in parallel programming or GPU architectures. The difficulty of parallel
programming for GPU clusters is an impediment to scientific progress. In order
to relieve scientists of the burdens of parallel programming, computer
scientists at Princeton have developed systems for automatically parallelizing
programs for GPU. Building on this success, the PIs plan to extend these
techniques to GPU clusters and work closely with the seismologists, biologists
and astrophysicists to accelerate the pace of science.
