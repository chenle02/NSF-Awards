This project is concerned with the development of numerical methods for
elliptic and for time dependent partial differential equations by domain
decomposition techniques. The partial differential equations model flows in
porous media and flows of an incompressible and viscous fluid. Particular
attention will be paid to the parallelization of domain decomposition
algorithms.
