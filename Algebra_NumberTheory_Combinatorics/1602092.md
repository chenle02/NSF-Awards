The Langlands Program is a mathematical framework that unifies questions in many
different areas of mathematics, especially number theory and linear algebra. The
traditional arithmetic Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty
years, and this research has resulted in significant applications to solving
classical Diophantine equations, for example, the proof of Fermat's last
theorem. The geometric Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under
rapid development thanks to powerful tools from algebraic geometry. In this
project, the investigator will explore connections between these two different
facets of the Langlands program by applying geometric methods to study
arithmetic problems.

In more detail, this is a project to study the geometric Langlands program and
its applications to arithmetic geometry. The investigator will apply his results
on the geometric Satake correspondence for p-adic groups and the p-adic Riemann-
Hilbert correspondence to investigate the mod p and p-adic geometry of Shimura
varieties. The investigator will also explore the relations between residues
that appear in the theory of automorphic forms and the topology of spaces of
rational maps.
