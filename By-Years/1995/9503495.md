Word.Document.6 ; 9503495 Sekreta This award supports a 24-month Science and
Technology Agency of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Ellen Sekreta. During
her fellowship, Dr. Sekreta will be resident at the National Institute of
Materials and Chemical Research (NIMCR) at Tsukuba. In conjunction with Drs. M.
Sato and T. Sako of the Department of Chemical Systems at NIMCR, Dr. Sekreta
will study innovative chemical systems that have practical applications with
regard to energy conservation and the environment. The proposed work is part of
a more extensive project probing aspects of cluster reactions as well as
separation technologies using supercritical fluids. As a postdoctoral fellow,
Dr. Sekreta will have the opportunity to become familiar with research
techniques and equipment at the NIMCR while contributing to the overall research
effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its
exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international
collaboration. *** Oh +' 0 D h S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n ( @ d
