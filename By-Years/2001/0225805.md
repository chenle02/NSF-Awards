0228508&lt;br/&gt;Ayres&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work is to combine
high-resolution Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)-based imaging that has been
achieved for biological specimens with a novel approach to SPM-based
nanomanipulation to yield a significant new approach for direct nanobiological
investigations. To achieve efficient and reliable manipulation in a micro/nano
environment, capabilities of sensing, processing and actuation in dynamic
interactions are essential. Using the proposed approach, signals that would
normally be projected as an SPM image are acquired and essential information is
extracted for subsequent use as the sensing component within a feedback control
loop formulation. The control loop is used to accurately steer the probe's tip
along a prescribed trajectory. The feedback loop formulation involves landmark
recognition and dynamic pattern matching through adaptive learning. With this
capability, the tip is able to return to and stay centered on a specific site by
recognizing the way the site feels to the probe tip. Except for high-level
commands, the human operator can be eliminated from the operation and the full
potential of this instrument with inherently sub-nanometer resolution can be
utilized.
