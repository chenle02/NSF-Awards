This research project investigates novel vibration control techniques based on
the concept of shaping structural eigenvectors to achieve desirable vibration or
acoustic response. There are two primary motivating factors of this project one
is that passive and semi-active methods do not suffer from the high energy
requirements and lower stability margins of active methods, and the other is
that eigenvectors which are shaped in a desirable manner provide improved
response for response for a wide range of excitations. The field of vibration
control has a great deal of attention during the last 15 years and much of it
has been directed toward active vibration control. Most research, however, has
focused on, (a) active methods which try to alternate the vibration (by damping
or cancellation) without regard for power required, (b)passive methods which
attempt to maximize a structure's damping, or (c) an intelligent combination of
the two. This research shows that eigenstructure assignment methods, which do
not focus on either of those approaches, can be very effective in vibration
control under a wide range of conditions, and that eigenstructure assignment can
work in concert with conventional vibration control methods for better
performance with reduced power costs.
