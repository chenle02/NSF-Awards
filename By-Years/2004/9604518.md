9604518 Bowes Dr. Bowes has worked on the mechanisms of carbon fixation during
photosynthesis for many years. His work has recently moved into a new area, and
the laboratory is now using molecular analysis of gene expression in addition to
biochemical analyses. Adding to the three basic types of carbon fixation
mechanisms, Dr. Bowes now adds another one. His group detected plants which show
inducible aspects of C4 metabolism without expressing the
morphological/anatomical characteristics of this pathway. The work proposed
promises to provide an integration of molecular, evolutionary and physiological
aspects of the new pathway. The group will isolate the transcripts for key
enzymes of the pathway, place them into an evolutionary context and study the
biochemical characteristics of these enzymes. The focus is on the differences in
activity regulation that can be expected to distinguish the enzymes that are
expressed when the plants are in different fixation modes.
