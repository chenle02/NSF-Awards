A novel parallel computer architecture for speeding up large-scale discrete
event simulation problems is investigated. In contrast to existing machines that
require the programmer or compiler to perform data dependence analysis at
compile time, the VIRTUAL TIME MACHINE (VTM) performs this task at runtime. In
particular, the VTM hardware automatically detects and recovers from violations
of data independence constraints as they occur. A sophisticated memory system
that is addressed using both a spatial and a temporal coordinate is used to
efficiently implement this mechanism. Dynamic load balancing/scheduling policies
are used to minimize the frequency of dependency errors.
