This project continues work on the topic of the application of cell state space
theory to nonlinear dynamic mechanical systems. A technique has been developed,
using cell state space theory which appears to be capable of addressing the
global behavior issue for nonlinear dynamic systems (i.e., determine how the
equilibrium states and periodic solutions evolve as the system parameters
change). This particular project will refine and extend the cell state space
method to a broader class of nonlinear systems. Finally, efficient computer
codes for cell mapping methods will be developed for general use by the
scientific and engineering community.
