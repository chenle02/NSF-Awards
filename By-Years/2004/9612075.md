Profs. T. Branson, P. Jorgensen, and F. Radulescu will host an NSF/CBMS
conference on "Spectral Problems in Geometry and Arithmetic" at the University
of Iowa August 18-22, 1997, featuring Prof. Peter Sarnak (Princeton University)
as principal speaker. The conference is aimed at making accessible to
researchers, potential researchers, and graduate students in the region
important and exciting current work on the spectral theory of Laplacians and
Hecke operators, the Selberg and Ramanujan conjectures, as well as applications
to quantum chaos and other physical issues. Prof. Sarnak is an internationally
recognized expert on these topics. Despite their importance, the topics of the
conference are sufficiently new and background-intensive that special efforts
are needed to broaden the pool of researchers able to understand and work on
them. For example, these topics are seldom reached in graduate coursework at all
but the most elite universities. The organizers plan to draw on extensive
contacts developed over recent years by the University of Iowa to ensure the
broadest possible participation.
