9730079 Nielsen One of the primary reasons that geologists study basaltic lavas
is their utility as probes of mantle and crustal processes. However, those very
processes we wish to study erase the evidence of processes that are active
earlier in the history of the magmatic system. One means by which magmas can be
preserved is as melt inclusions and chemical zoning in crystals formed as the
system evolves. Ideally, each inclusion represents a "snapshot" of the liquid
trapped by the growth of the host crystal, preserving the character of
intermediate steps in the formation of a suite of magmas. The goal of this
research is to use information from melt inclusions from lavas sampled from
areas on and near the East Pacific Rise characterized by different levels of
magma flux, and from lavas erupted from volcanic centers near but not actually
on the axis of the spreading center (off axis seamounts). This information will
help us to evaluate the magnitude of the compositional heterogeneity in the
mantle and of mantle versus crustal processes, and to better constrain models of
how the mantle melts.
