This award supports foundational research into the concept of randomness in
mathematical structures. While the use of randomness in computer science is
ubiquitous, many important computational and algorithmic problems remain to be
studied using this foundational concept. Despite the complexity of many
theoretic as well as practical modern algorithms, randomness is frequently able
to remedy the worst-case examples focusing on the average case examples and
randomized algorithms which make use of local information. This includes such
intensively studied problems as the so-called Travelling Salesperson problem, by
concentrating on geometric versions where efficient algorithms are feasible. An
important aspect of the project is the involvement of students in the research,
which is expected to have a broad impact on mathematics and on computer science
beyond the theoretical foundations of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
special focus of this project is to identify problems that involve random walks
on graphs and digraphs. Based on significant recent progress, a thorough
investigation of so-called hashing schemes will be undertaken, examining search
algorithms on graphs that employ only local information. The classical random
walk is a prime example of such an algorithm. The current available analysis for
preferential attachment graphs, which are connected to random models of the
world-wide web, will be extended to more general models of graphs. A statistical
test has been devised for detecting bias in a sample claiming to be from the
steady state of a Markov chain. Another line of research is on-line purchasing
problems. In such problems, the edges of a graph are given random costs and are
presented sequentially and they must be selected or rejected. The accepted edges
are used to build a structure, and the goal is to build this structure as
economically as possible.
