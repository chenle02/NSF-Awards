The OSU Campus Chemical Instrument Center will purchase a Fourier transform
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for use in structural analysis and
mechanistic studies of proteins and enzymes (for example, alpha-lactalbumin, 14
kDa; sulfite reductase, 24 kDa; ribonuclease H, 17 kDa; high potential iron
protein, 9.5 kDa; adenylate kinase, 21.7 kDa; phospholipase A2, 14 kDa;
catalytic domain of leader peptidase, 28 kDa; and flavodoxin, 16 kDa) and some
synthetic polypeptides from immunogenic and long range electron-transfer
studies.
