Title: Positive and nonnegative curvature on bundles

ABSTRACT:

In recent research, the PI developed tools for studying the following two
general problems in Riemannian geometry: (1) For which vector bundles does the
total space admit a complete Riemannian metric with nonnegative sectional
curvature? (2) For which sphere bundles does the total space admit a Riemannian
metric with positive curvature? The PI plans to use these tools to find new
examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems. In particular, the PI plans to
construct metrics of nonnegative curvature on holomorphic vector bundles over
complex projective space, and determine whether Einstein- Hermitian connections
can appear as the connections in the normal bundles of their souls. Also, the PI
intends to study nonnegatively curved metrics on trivial vector bundles over
spheres. This problem is related to the Hopf conjecture, or more specifically to
the question: how large is the family of nonnegatively curved metrics on the
product of two spheres? The PI will work with undergraduate students studying
the metrics on such products obtained by re-scaling the product metric by a
compact Lie group which acts by isometries. Finally, the PI proposes to find
obstructions to metrics of nonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres
with prescribed soul metrics.

The question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to
Riemannian geometry. Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction on
the way in which an object curves about in space. All known examples come from
compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable tools in
diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other disciplines in
which simplification is achieved through symmetry. The search for new examples
of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a long history, yet
very few constructions are known. Since his tools represent a construction which
is substantially different form known methods, the PI believes they deserve
further study.
