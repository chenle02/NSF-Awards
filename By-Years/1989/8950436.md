Infrared spectroscopy is one of the oldest and most important instrumental
methods for identifying unknown substances. In recent years there has been a
breakthrough in the instrumentation available for measuring infrared spectra.
Using modern computer technology, it is now possible to obtain spectra from
samples which were previously difficult or impossible to analyze due to their
weak absorbance or limited quantity. The new experimental methods which the FT-
IR spectrometer make possible for the first time. This instrument allows use to
carry out rate studies for fast reactions and facilitates the conversion of the
organic and inorganic chemistry labs to micro scale. The instrument also serves
as an example of the power of using computers in data collection and digitized
library searching, and provides students with hands-on experience working with
the type of instrumentation that they are likely to encounter in their future
work. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
