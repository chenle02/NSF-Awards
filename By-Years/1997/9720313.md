This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
Initiative. A group of nine senior investigators will study spatial competence,
and its emergence over time, at the cognitive, computational, and neural levels.
Topics to be studied include how people form spatial representations; how people
communicate about spatial information using external symbol systems such as
maps, diagrams, graphs, and linguistic descriptions; the role of the educational
input received in American schools in supporting spatial learning; the optimal
computational model of spatial learning; and, evidence of neural plasticity for
spatial learning, based on both neuroanatomical study and neuropsychological
evaluation. The common purpose of this group of related research endeavors is to
examine the nature of environmentally-sensitive growth in spatial competence and
how spatial learning can be maximized in the American population. Innovations
for educational practice and educational software resulting from our research
will be evaluated with the help of collaborating teachers.
