The recent Exxon Valdez oil spill has come at a critical period in the life
history of both cultured and wild populations of the pink salmon in Alaska
waters. The fish are at the fry stage in their development when they are coming
downstream into the coastal waters naturally, or are about to be released from
the coastal hatcheries. Dr. Nevissi, Dr. Quinn and graduate student Roger Peters
will investigate the short-term response of salmon fry to the hydrocarbons in
the coastal waters, and will establish a controlled experiment of fry tagging in
polluted and pristine waters to look at the long term effects of the spill on
migration behavior/success. The proposed research will focus on the levels of
hydrocarbon exposure by the salmon juveniles; alterations in the migratory
routes following the spill; and rates-of-return changes in the salmon that are
exposed to hydrocarbons.
