Abstract

Understanding Socialization and Adolescent Development in Multi-cultural
Contexts

Andrew Supple

Communities in the southeastern United States have experienced rapid increases
in proportions of foreign-born individuals over the last decade. Demographic
changes have been especially dramatic in No. Carolina and Georgia, two states
among the top ten in terms of percentage increases in foreign-born populations
during the 1990s. Changes in the demographic composition of local communities in
these states have created an acute need for a sound knowledge base regarding the
socialization influences and outcomes in these populations. Moreover, community
leaders, outreach service providers, and educators will need reliable data and
culturally relevant theoretical frameworks to disseminate knowledge about
socialization processes among children and adolescents from immigrant families.
The purpose of this project is to create a multidisciplinary and cross-
institutional research team from three universities in the southeastern United
States through a series of workshops. The workshops are designed to develop a
strategic plan for research on the socialization of children and adolescents in
immigrant families.
