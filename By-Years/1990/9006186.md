The effects of quantum fluctuations on nonlinear dynamical processes are
studied. These include the quantum manifestation of the fractal dissociation
boundary of a driven spin system, the localized states of hydrogen and resonance
fluorescence in a three-level atom. The relationship between quantum and
classical mechanics is investigated using semiclassical and quantum mechanics,
the Husimi and generalized Husimi representation and by varying a fluctuation
parameter. Finally, the mechanism underlying the classical and "quantum fractal"
boundary and lifetime distributions in studied using Cantor sets in phase space.
