Abstract 9423489 Lyons This is a project to investigate how energy from the
solar wind enters Earth's magnetosphere. The rate of energy transfer is
controlled by the electric field along the separatrix, which is the boundary
between open and closed magnetic field lines at the surface of the
magnetosphere. For this study, ground-based observations will be used to measure
the rate of reconnection of magnetic field lines across the separatrix. Both the
motion of the separatrix and the flow of plasma across it must be measured
simultaneously. The investigators will measure these quantities using radar and
optical techniques with a time resolution sufficient to resolve changes
associated with the growth and expansion phases of auroral substorms. The
results will be used to test models of plasma convection in the magnetosphere
and to evaluate the accuracy of reconnection theories. The variation in
reconnection rate associated with auroral substorms and dayside transient
effects will also be studied. ***
