*** 9561217 Wang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop and demonstrate a process to synthesis open-ended buckytubes and
intercalate them with lithium to be used as new electrode materials for lithium
batteries. All experiments reported to date have shown that buckytubes produced
in inert gas arcs are capped at the ends. The firm has demonstrated that sharp,
open-ended nanotubes with empty interiors can be synthesized in a hydrogen arc
discharge. The availability of open-ended buckytubes makes it possible to fill
the tubes and fabricate completely new one-dimensional materials with
unprecedented, novel properties such as conducting or semiconducting "quantum
wires", ultra-short wavelength optical waveguides, nanofibers with the highest
tensile strength etc. In this Phase I program, the process for synthesis of
open-ended buckytubes will be perfected through a systematic investigation, and
the open-ended buckytubes with strong electron affinity will be intercalated
with lithium to produce electrode materials with a higher ratio of carbon to
lithium than can be obtained with current graphite. This could be extremely
important to high performance, low cost, and very safe rechargeable lithium
supplies and storage systems. ***
