The U.S. west coast is subject to significant risk of very large earthquakes,
and heavily populated Southern California is particularly vulnerable owing to
its proximity to the San Andreas Fault. The linkage of this fault system through
the Salton Sea region is poorly understood, in part because the structure
beneath the Salton Sea has not been defined. The project, conducted in
conjunction with a deployment of on-land seismic stations, will address that
problem by deploying an array of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) on the floor of
the Salton Sea, and conducting a complementary multi channel seismic survey
aimed at imaging the structure beneath the Salton Trough. Improved understanding
of the Earthquake hazard in this region has direct societal benefit. The project
will also contribute to science education in California, and support the Ph.D.
research of a young female graduate student at UCLA.
