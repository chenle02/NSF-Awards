New applications of visible and ultraviolet spectrophotometry are being
introduced into the laboratories of the following chemistry courses: General
Chemistry, Instrumental Methods, Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic
Chemistry, and Spectroscopic Methods.For the General Chemistry laboratory low-
cost, single beam visible spectrophotometers are being interfaced to Macintosh
computers currently being used for other applications in the laboratory. The
resulting computer controlled spectrophotometer is giving students the
capability to record visible spectra on a routine basis. Experiments are being
introduced involving visible spectrophotometry in quantitative analysis, in the
study of reaction kinetics, and in the study of transition metal complexes.For
the upper level chemistry laboratories a high resolution, double-beam
spectrophotometer is being used in experiments involving quantitative analysis,
ultraviolet spectra of organic compounds, the study of reaction Kinetics, the
study of coordination complexes, and the study of vibrational and rotational
fine structure of molecular spectra.
