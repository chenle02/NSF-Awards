Microstructural features of metal and semiconductor alloys such as the cells and
dendrites formed by directional solidification play important roles in setting
the mechanical and electrical properties of the product materials. This project
deals with combined theoretical and experimental effort aimed at quantifying the
mechanisms for pattern formation in thin-film directional solidification, a
simplified form of an important materials process. Theoretical analysis and
detailed numerical calculations will be used to examine the transitions involved
with wavelength selection in cellular growth. Theories based on the existence of
a quintessential mechanism for wavelength selection caused by the singular
effects of a small surface energy will be explored by asymptotic analysis and
numerical calculation. The hypothesis that a collection of cells is continually
undergoing chaotic dynamical changes will be explored by cellular dynamics
calculations by a new numerical method for accurately simulating the interaction
of large microstructural patterns. Experimental measurements of thin-film
solidification for an organic alloy gathered by video imaging and digitally
processed will give quantitative data on cellular shape and wavelength as a
function of time. Direct comparison between these experiments and calculations
for a quasi-three-dimensional model that accounts for non-idealities in the
experiment will give a quantitative test of the theory.
