The University of New Mexico, Department of Physics and Astronomy will initiate
an REU summer program. This program will concentrate on experimental research in
areas of particular expertise within this Department. These areas are Optics,
Condensed Matter, High-Energy Physics, and Astrophysics. Student research
projects include work with femtosecond lasers, CCD development silicon
microstrip particle detectors, optical fibers, superfluid 4He, polymers,
granular materials, single molecule imaging, and interstellar gases. Every
attempt will be made to provide closure on projects for each student so that the
student will gain a sense of accomplishment from the experience. The summer
school will provide training in machine shop and electronics techniques, as well
as experience in oral presentations. Students who are members of groups under-
represented in physics will be particularly encouraged to apply. The students
will live together in University apartments, and spend weekends together on a
variety of expeditions.
