This is a project to develop and extend support for multithreaded computation on
superscalar processors. The intention is to provide high processor utilization
despite increasing memory latency. In simultaneous multithreading, multiple
independent threads will issue instructions to a superscalar processor's
functional units in a single cycle. The objective of this project is to fully
define the low-level architecture for simultaneous multithreading, including
scheduling, register architecture, pipeline design, and speculative execution.
The project is developing compiler and operating systems support for
multithreaded execution on the new processor architecture. A primary goal is to
maximize multiple thread performance without increasing single thread latency.
Most measurements are from detailed simulations, using simulators and compilers
provided by industrial partners.
