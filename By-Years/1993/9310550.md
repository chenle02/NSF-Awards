This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on alkane functionalization by Dr. Dean M. Roddick of the
Chemistry Department, University of Wyoming. Iridium complexes of
(fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands will be surveyed for catalytic cycloalkane
dehydrogenation activity and, in some cases, the mechanism of the reaction will
be determined. New iridum complexes containing weakly coordinating ligands and
new ruthenium hydride compounds will by synthesized and examined for alkane
activation reactivity. Because of the stability of (fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands
in acidic and in oxidizing conditions, the possibility of C-H activation
followed by hydrogen scavenging, olefin oxidation or direct metal-alkyl
oxidations will be investigated. The suitability of this class of compounds for
catalytic aldehyde and alcohol decarbonylation will also be tested. %%% The
fluoronated alkylphosphine group which is attached to the metal withdraws
electronic charge from the vicinity of the metal but, unlike other groups which
can also accomplish this, is resistant to thermal or oxidative degradation.
Because of this stability, the compounds synthesized have potential for
practical use in the design of reagents and catalysts to functionalize alkanes.
Petroleum and natural gas technology would be influenced by a successful
outcome.
