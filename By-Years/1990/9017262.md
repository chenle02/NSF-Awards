This award provides funds to the University of Nebraska for funding of a
facility that provides advanced mass spectrometric techniques through
collaborations with researchers at Nebraska and at other institutions. One of
several approaches to mass spectrometry (MS), tandem MS provides high resolution
measurements of compounds with the high molecular weights typical of proteins,
nucleic acids and other biopolymers. Efforts sponsored by this award will focus
on improving techniques for analysis of variety of proteins, carbohydrates and
other natural products using the tandem instrument; a variety of collaborative
research projects will be initiated or continued, and training activities at the
pre- and post doctoral level will continue. Mass spectrometry plays an
increasingly important role in the structural analysis of biomolecules.
Information about protein sequence and structure, including naturally occurring
modifications of proteins, and similar kinds of information about
polysaccharides and other branched chain polymers are obtained with great
difficulty by other techniques. Because of the considerable expense of
acquisition and operation of tandem MS instruments, this type of mass
spectrometric analysis is not routinely available at most research institutions.
The Nebraska facility is one of only several in the country that provide
researchers at numerous institutions with access to the kind of skilled mass
spectrometry needed in many areas of modern biological research.
