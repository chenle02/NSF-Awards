Ongoing projects take advantage of this laboratory's long experience with
Neurospora biology and genetics. The projects concern mutational and epigenetic
gene silencing, developmental events in the ascus, meiotic drive, and the
delineation of species. Most of the experiments center on the sexual phase of
the life cycle and exploit features of Neurospora that make it advantageous for
investigations that cannot be readily carried out with yeast. Examples include
the following: (1) Genetics and programming of ascus development. The expression
and sites of action of genes known to affect the sexual phase will be examined
using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Microscopic studies will continue on the
effect of unpaired DNA in silencing genes that are expressed in the sexual
phase.. (2) The reproductive genetics and biology of N. tetrasperma. Ascus
development in this species is reprogrammed to produce self-fertile
heterokaryotic products. Crossing over is abolished between the mating type
locus and the centromere and recombination is also blocked over most of the
mating-type chromosome. The genetic basis of the block is being studied, and
modes of ascus programming are being examined in 4-spored species of other
genera. (3) Cryptic drive elements in N. tetrasperma. In 8-spored asci,
ascospores with sensitive nuclei are killed in crosses that are heterozygous for
a Spore-killer meiotic drive element (Sk). Sensitive nuclei survive, however, if
they are enclosed in the same ascospore with a killer nucleus. Because N.
tetrasperma normally has two types of nuclei in each heterokaryotic ascospore,
Sk elements may be present even though they are not apparent. Experiments with
strains from natural populations will examine this possibility. (4) A locus-
specific mutator. Crosses involving a particular allele of the eas gene in N.
crassa produce progeny that are mutated at a specific unlinked locus. The
behavior suggests that a duplicate copy of the target gene is linked to the eas
mutation, resulting in RIP (repeat induced point mutation). This hypothesis is
being tested using crosses homozygous for a mutant that is deficient in
RIP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This laboratory has long been devoted to developing
Neurospora as a model organism. Model organisms are great assets to science, for
the insights gained from them can be used to guide and often accelerate studies
of other related but less well-understood organisms. The vast store of genetic
and biological information to which the laboratory has contributed makes
Neurospora an ideal reference organism with which to compare other filamentous
fungi, including plant and animal pathogens, commercially important species, and
innumerable ecologically important forms. &lt;br/&gt;
