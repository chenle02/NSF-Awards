This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address a method of
reducing energy waste in large buildings. The company proposes to demonstrate
the feasibility of a novel, ultra-efficient power distribution system. In Phase
I, the company will design a prototype, and in Phase II, the system will be
demonstrated. The Phase I effort includes an evaluation of the distribution
system?s costs, performance, and efficiency at both the component and system
levels. The results will be compared to representative, conventional power
systems. This work is anticipated to show a significant improvement in energy
efficiency compared to conventional technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this research are (1) a significant improvement in energy
efficiency of the commercial sector through reduction of energy transmission and
distribution losses in large buildings, resulting in (2) a reduction of
greenhouse gas emission. A preliminary estimate of the total energy savings in a
single building with 1 MW of installed power is over 60 MWh per year. This is
the equivalent of saving more than 30 tonnes of coal from being burned every
year (per building), or preventing more than 60 tonnes of CO2 from being
released into the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;
