Kucharz DMS 95-03138 This award supports the research of Professors W. Kucharz
to work in real algebraic geometry. In particular he will study real algebraic
morphisms and vector bundles on real algebraic varieties. There will be
particular emphasis on methods to explicitly calculate invariants using
techniques from intersection theory and K-theory. This research is in the field
of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems
that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the
plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses
methods not only from algebpa, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
