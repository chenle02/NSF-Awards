This project develops methods and tools for identifying and profiling malware
source code from public software archives. The project is motivated by the
following insight: software archives, like GitHub, host a surprisingly large
number of publicly-accessible malware repositories, where a "malware repository"
refers to repositories that provide the source-code for compiling a working
malware binary (effectively the malware author's software project). This
constitutes a huge missed opportunity: GitHub alone has more than 32 million
public repositories and there are many similar software platforms. The projectâ€™s
novelties are: (a) novel methods to extract and profile malware source code
effectively and at scale, and (b) the largest annotated malware source code
database. Ultimately, the project provides a key building block for fighting
malware: security research could greatly benefit from an extensive database of
malware source code, which is currently unavailable. The project's broader
significance and importance are it can help build a preventive system against
malware. This capability enables an early detector of malware and its creation
within the hacker ecosystem, which can provide critical insights into the
activities of the hackers in advance, and possibly before an infection or an
attack takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical point of view, the
project develops methods to: (a) systematically mine these repositories, and (b)
study and profile the malware and the related hacking ecosystem. Preliminary
research has identified more than 7000 GitHub malware source code repositories
and many highly-collaborative communities with hundreds of malware authors. A
key novelty is that repositories are described with a comprehensive set of
features along three dimensions: (a) metadata, such as title and description,
(b) the source code and its structure, and (c) the social context, which
captures the interactions among authors and repositories. The second key novelty
is algorithmic, as the project develops new approaches and also evaluates and
adapts: (a) state of the art data-mining techniques, such as word embedding, (b)
code-specific profiling techniques, and (c) techniques for the describing the
interactions of authors, such as a novel recursive tensor
decomposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
