This award supports a three-day workshop at the FLASH center in Chicago on
visualization and analysis for astrophysics simulation codes, focused primarily
around the yt package. The workshop covers various aspects of yt, including
introductory material, advanced usage and mechanisms for community involvement.
Expected outcomes of the workshop include instruction on how to speed up
analysis and visualization of astrophysical simulations; expansion of the user
and developer base of yt, encouraging further development and support of new
codes; and nurturing collaborations between computational astrophysicists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this workshop include the dissemination
of educational curricula related to the commonly-used yt analysis toolkit and a
specific activity on public outreach and education through scientific
visualization. Extensive curricula and worked examples will be made available
online and will provide a resource for new users and early stage researchers to
learn how to utilize this package and decrease the time necessary to learn a new
system and productively analyze data.
