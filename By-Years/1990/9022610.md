In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, Professor Lubman and his students will study the
fragmentation of ions subjected to laser photoexcitation. By adjusting the
wavelength of the light, varying amounts of energy will be imparted to the
molecules, thus allowing selected sets of bonds to break. The long term goal is
to develop methods which will allow differential detection of similar
biomolecules. %%% In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Chemistry Division, Lubman's group will investigate the
competitive kinetics of gas phase ion fragmentation permitted by near-threshold
photoexcitation. In a collisionless environment, internal redistribution of
absorbed energy allows selected subsets of bonds to break. While one cannot
target breaking of specific bonds, it is hoped that characteristic sets of bonds
can be kinetically preferred for particular excitation conditions.
