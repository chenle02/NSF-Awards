The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile information systems
by using autonomous and distributed sensor networks: hundreds of small sensors,
equipped with limited memory and actuation capabilities will autonomously
organize themselves and move to track a source and convey information about its
location to a human user, and to the rest of the team. Such distributed active
sensor networks are pervasive computing systems, well-suited for tasks in
extreme environments, especially when the environmental model and the task
specifications are uncertain and the system has to adapt to it.

To create active sensor networks capable of such applications, a fundamental
goal of this research is to develop a science base for distributed sensor
network control and information gathering and coordination. This is a
considerable challenge, which we propose to meet by the synergistic integration
of the following directions of work: (1) new ideas for communication in sensor
networks; (2) new ideas for developing adaptive active control and coordination
in sensor networks; (3) new ideas for information gathering and aggregation in
sensor networks; and (4) experiments grounded on realistic scenarios that
measure empirically the performance and scalability of the proposed
communication and control algorithms.

More specifically, the central challenges for this proposed work are focused on
developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of scalable network protocols
that (1) guarantee message delivery; (2) are fault tolerant; (3) maximize the
network lifetime; and (4) are adaptive to the environment and to the task.
