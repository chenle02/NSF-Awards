Abstract

During the FY12-13 academic year, sixteen (16) K-12 science and mathematics
teachers participate as Fellows of the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator
Fellowship program in various directorates/offices across the National Science
Foundation (NSF). The fellowship program is a congressionally-mandated program
under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). NSF participates in
this program through a grant to the Triangle Coalition (TC) that assists DOE
with the management of the program.

The objectives of the program are to: (1) provide outstanding STEM teachers the
opportunity to bring to Congress and appropriate branches of the federal
government the insights, extensive knowledge, and practical experience of
classroom teachers; (2) increase the understanding, communication, and
cooperation between Congress and Federal agencies; (3) increase the
understanding, communication and cooperation between the Federal government and
the science, technology and mathematics education community; and (4) gain
insights and an understanding of national educational issues which can then be
transferred back to the classroom. While at NSF, the Fellows gain general as
well as discipline-specific knowledge based on their placement within
Foundation.

During the 11-month fellowship, Fellows engage in a wide range of STEM
experiences, work-related tasks, and activities organized by their host sponsor
and the Triangle Coalition. These Fellows also have access to a wealth of
experiences provided by NSF and other federal and education agencies in the
greater Washington, DC area. In FY12-13, the Fellows represent 13 states and
Washington, DC (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana,
Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, and
Virginia).

Other agencies participating in the program include NASA, NOAA, and DOE.
