This research is aimed at supporting interaction with large databases that
include handwritten documents. The objective is to advance understanding of
methodologies for interactively querying large document databases. Examples of
such documents include medical and insurance information systems into which
volumes of paper records have been scanned, government security systems, and
electronic historical document collections, such as the collections created by
the Model Editions Partnership. An existing, high-performance handwritten
recognition algorithm will be adapted to the research problem. The questions to
be addressed include: Which global, word-level training objective functions
result in better performance? Which character class confidence measures result
in better system performance? And, which character-based, word level confidence
estimators results in better system performance? Experiments will focus on
comparison of different methodologies for training; of different objective
functions, optimization criteria, and optimization methodologies; and of
different methods of estimating character confidence.
