This award will support a MARGINS post-doctoral fellowship to examine how
ubducted sediments affect fluid pressure, fluid flow patterns and frictional
properties within subduction zones. This project will address two fundamental
questions about the role of sediments in subduction zones: 1) how are diagenetic
fluid sources partitioned between opal and smectite dewatering on the Costa Rica
margin (and therefore how deep in the subduction zone is most of the fluid
produced), and 2) how do along-strike variations in heat flow and sediment
composition affect the patterns of diagenetic fluid sources, fluid pressures,
fluid flow, and possibly the updip limit of seismicity within the subduction
zone?
