Govindaraju, Venugopal SUNY at Buffalo

This SGER builds on discoveries made in IIS- 0 535038 and explores altogether
new functionalities for the International Digital Sanskrit Library Integration
project. The International Digital Sanskrit Library Integration project is
createing a globally distributed, internet-based, digital library in Sanskrit,
one of the world's richest culture bearing languages. This project will explore
new feasibilities and functionalities associated with automatic OCR technologies
for segmenting and structuring Sanskrit and other foreign language non-Roman
script documents, including Arabic and Persian. The resulting integrated
information system helps to overcome obstacles to internet research and study on
scripts of particulary complexity and difficulty.
