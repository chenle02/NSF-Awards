PI Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 20 years ago it was discovered that the
tip of the giant branch in some galactic globular clusters is populated by stars
which show wide variations in C, N, and O abundances. Subsequently less strong,
but still real, variations in Na, Al and Mg were detected among the same stars.
The goal of this project is to determine the variations of abundances of
elements in metal poor stars, concentrating first on globular clusters, as a
function of luminosity and evolutionary state. Our ability to explain and
reproduce such variations is a stringent test of our understanding of many
aspects of stellar evolution as well as of the early chemical history of the
Galaxy. It is a test we sometimes fail. &lt;br/&gt; In previous work
anticorrelated variations of O and Na were found in the globular cluster M71.
Furthermore large anticorrelated variations in CH and CN also were found
contrary to predictions by stellar evolution theory. The present project will
continue and expand this work to more metal poor globular clusters, where the
distinction between star-to-star abundance variations arising from dredge up
versus primordial variations should be clearer. In addition, the study will
extend to more metal poor clusters the work on the CH and CN bands to as low a
luminosity as possible. In a related major program the abundance distributions
and scatter among the most metal poor stars in the Galaxy, those with [Fe/H]
=.3.0 dex, are being studied.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
