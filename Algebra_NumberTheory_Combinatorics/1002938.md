RUI: Triangulations, Set Intersections, Fair Division, and Voting (DMS -
1002938)

The investigator's prior work has introduced methods from combinatorial topology
and discrete geometry to the study of fair division questions and voting
problems. The current project will support the the development of the
mathematics behinds these tools and the solution of several combinatorial
questions that have been motivated by his prior work, including: (1) the study
of triangulations of cubes and simplotopes, (2) the further development of
combinatorial fixed point theorems and constructive solutions, and (3) the
development of set intersection theorems and associated applications in social
choice theory and fair division. This project will also support the active
participation of undergraduates in this research.

Informally speaking, a "fair division" problem asks: how can we divide a set of
goods among parties in such a way that each can be satisfied according to some
notion of fairness. Social choice theory asks: how does a society make a group
choice (e.g., in an election) in a way that best aggregates the preferences of
all the individuals? Questions of fairness and social choice are of interest to
political scientists, economists, and game theorists, and motivate interesting
mathematical questions. The space of preferences and the preference sets of each
person are often naturally geometric sets (e.g., convex, connected, polyhedral),
and the desired solution is often at the intersection of such sets. This project
aims to prove mathematical theorems (e.g., about set intersections and
triangulations of polyhedra) that have direct bearing on important problems in
the social sciences involving voting and fairness.
