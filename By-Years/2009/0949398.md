0949398&lt;br/&gt;Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for amino acid racemization
thermochronology and plant pigment analyses, a gamma spectrometer for 210Pb and
137Cs dating of recent sediments and calculation of sedimentation rates, and a
microwave digestion system and freeze drier for sample preparation. The
equipment will support PI research in Quaternary paleoclimatology, quantitative
geomorphology, aquatic ecology and watershed hydrology at the Institute of
Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado. PI
environmental change research has immediate relevance to our understanding of
global and regional climate dynamics and the impacts of climate change on
ecosystems. The equipment will support student research training, and active PI
outreach efforts to the local K-12 community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
