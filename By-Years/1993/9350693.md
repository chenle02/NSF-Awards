Renovation of the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum This project establishes a
Statistical Computing and Dynamic Graphics Laboratory to support the renovation
of the undergraduate statistics curriculum. The laboratory equipment includes
workstations for student use and for classroom demonstrations, as well as
specialized software. The proposed laboratory would support the introduction of
two new courses, Statistical Computing and Exploratory Data Analysis with
Dynamic Graphics. In addition, the laboratory would make possible the
modernization of a number of upper division course offerings through the
incorporation of recently developed computer-intensive statistical methods.
These methods have significantly changed the practice of statistics, and should
be a central part of a contemporary statistics curriculum.
