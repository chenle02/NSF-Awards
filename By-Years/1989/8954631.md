While elementary school teachers want their students to be better mathematical
thinkers, their own teaching styles too often inhibit reflection and
interpretation. The goal of the proposed project is to generate more and better
mathematical discourse in elementary classrooms by helping teachers talk
mathematics with their students. Over the course of this eighteen month project,
Technical Education Research Centers will work with mathematicians, mathematics
educators, and 10-12 teachers from several school districts to identify the
difficulties teachers experience in discussing mathematics. A core group of
teachers and TERC staff will collaborate to develop, implement and reflect on
effective models of mathematical discourse. By the end of the project, they will
have: developed, implemented, and documented, promising approaches to supporting
substantive mathematical discussions in elementary classrooms; analyzed the
results of these approaches on teacher development and student/teacher
discourse; captured classroom episodes of mathematical discourse on videotape;
and developed recommendations for constructing teacher training materials.
