This three-year award supports cooperative research in operator K-theory and
representation of p-adic groups between Paul Baum and Nigel Higson, Pennsylvania
State University, and Roger Plymen from the University of Manchester in the
United Kingdom. The objective of this project is to determine the validity of
the Baum-Connes conjecture using the case of semi-simple, p-adic algebraic
groups. The investigators will also explore the conjecture's relationship to
index theory for Euclidean buildings and to Kutsko's conjecture for semi-simple,
p-adic groups. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the
K-theory of C* algebras associated with p-adic groups. By bringing together
results from the number theory, analysis, topology and group representation
theory, K-theory provides an adequate framework for expressing and unifying
results in these fields. This project will benefit by combining Baum and
Higson's geometric viewpoint and experience on K-theory and index theory with
Plymen's work on representational theory and algebraic (p-adic) groups.
