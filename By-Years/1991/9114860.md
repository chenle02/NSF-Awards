This award will support collaborative research between James Serrin, University
of Minnesota, and Patrizia Pucci, University of Modena, Italy. The proposed
program deals with existence, uniqueness, symmetry, asymptotic and boundary
behavior of solutions of linear and quasilinear second order equations or
systems of equations of elliptic and parabolic type, and with problems in fluid
dynamics. Specific problems to be investigated include the existence and
uniqueness of ground state solutions for general equations of variational or
non-variational type; behavior of solutions of quasilinear equations or systems
of equations of elliptic and parabolic type; properties of fundamental
solutions, Harnack inequalities and boundary behavior of solutions of linear
elliptic-parabolic equations; symmetry properties of solutions of linear and
quasilinear second order equations; and structure of one- dimensional solutions
of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed collaboration will make an
important contribution to nonlinear analysis.
