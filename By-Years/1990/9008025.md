The new generation of large telescopes will require large diffraction gratings
in their spectrographs. These gratings will need to be significantly larger than
those currently available. The limiting factor in ruling large gratings is the
lifetime of the ruling diamond, which depends on the coating deposited on the
blank for the ruling. This award will support a program of research by a very
well respected company, that is experienced in ruling gratings for astronomical
use, into new coatings for the next generation of diffraction gratings.
