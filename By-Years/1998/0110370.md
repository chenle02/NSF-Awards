This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will continue
development of a new electrochromic device based on self-assembly of organic
nanomaterials. Phase I used these materials to create laboratory scale devices.
Precise control of the material composition at the nanometer (nm) scale,
combined with the thin layers deposited (40 nm thick), allowed switching speeds
of 25-50 milliseconds for the first time, which are nearly fast enough for
display applications. Further, it was found that these materials, fabricated in
the solid state, could be switched by applying only 1.0 volt. Phase II will
focus on optimizing device performance, developing tri-state and multi-color
devices, and evaluating performance under environmental conditions necessary for
commercial product development.

Markets for the technology are very large and range from automotive self-dimming
rear-view mirrors to smart windows for residential and commercial buildings,
smart glasses, and display products. Phase III is planned for manufacturing
scale-up and will be conducted in an industrial partnership.
