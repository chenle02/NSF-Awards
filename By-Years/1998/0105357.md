Physiological and molecular studies of the diageotropica (dgt) mutant of tomato
have demonstrated that plants have a single gene that is involved in regulating
many different aspects of growth, development, and responses to environment,
including lateral root initiation, stem growth, leaf and vascular tissue
differentiation, fruit development, and responses to gravity and light. All of
these processes are controlled by the plant hormone auxin and dgt mutant plants
exhibit reduced sensitivity to auxin. This project will complete the map-based
cloning of the Dgt gene and begin characterization of it's function. Using
similarities with the Arabidopsis genome that was recently completely sequenced,
we have used molecular markers to pinpoint the location of the Dgt gene to a
single 15 Kb region of DNA. We plan to completely sequence this region of the
genome and use comparisons between normal and mutant genes as well as repair of
mutant plants with the intact gene to confirm the identity of the Dgt gene.
Characterization of the DGT gene product following sequencing will have a large
impact on our understanding of the interaction of other hormones with auxin in
regulating environmental and developmental responses. In addition, this research
will explore the potential for the use of similar DNA regions between
Arabidopsis and tomato to clone genes and provide validation for using the
information emerging from the Arabidopsis genome project for studies of other
plant species.
