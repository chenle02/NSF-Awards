Young U.S. scientists and students will participate in the Scientific Assemblies
of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA); the
International Association of Geodesy (IAG); and the International Association of
Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). These Assemblies will provide an opportunity for
scientists across the globe in the disciplines covered by each Assembly to
exchange information on the most recent scientific accomplishments of recent
research; to identify needs and priorities for future research; and to develop a
basis for working relationships to plan and conduct research to meet these
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IAGA covers scientific areas such as
paleomagnetism, rock magnetism, planetary magnetism, and electromagnetic
induction; aeronomy of the middle atmosphere, ionosphere, mesosphere, and Polar
atmosphere; magnetospheric processes; solar winds; and geomagnetic
observatories, including development of models, data and indices. The IAG
promotes development of a reference frame for a range of geosciences
applications; geodesy and geodynamics; monitoring the gravity field and rotation
of the Earth, the deformation of the Earth surface including ocean and ice,
interaction with the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), especially with
respect to positioning and remote sensing of land, oceanic and atmospheric
processes and features. The IAHS covers such areas as surface and ground water;
water quality; water resources; snow and ice hydrology; interactions between the
atmosphere, soil and vegetation; and continental erosion. Specific topics of
interest at this Assembly are the ecohydrology of surface and groundwater
dependent ecosystems; sustainability of groundwater in stressed aquifers; and
integrated approaches to surface and groundwater resources.
