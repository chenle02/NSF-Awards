The History of Science Society (HSS) and the Society for the History of
Technology (SHOT) are undertaking a joint study of their fields. Under this
grant, an eight-member planning committee, co-chaired by Professor Frederic L.
Holmes of Yale University and Professor Bruce Sinclair of Georgia Institute of
Technology will organize a "Critical Problems Conference" devoted to examining
the principal problems, research frontiers, and areas of opportunity for
research, applications and teaching in the history of science and technology.
Professor Holmes and Professor Sinclair are, respectively, former presidents of
HSS and SHOT. The conference will be held in conjunction with the 1991 joint
meeting of the two societies scheduled for Madison, Wisconsin. The sessions will
address issues organized around five categories of topics: subjects (physics,
transportation, biology, manufacturing, etc.), periods (early modern, 19th,
20th), methodologies (internalist, contextual, etc.), historiography, and
applications. The goals of this study will mesh with and be reinforced by a
coordinate demographic study of the practitioners of the two fields.
