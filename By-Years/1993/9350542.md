93-50542 Cohen The self-study/planning grant of the Dade County Public Schools
will build upon the Science, Mathematics, Computer Education and Environmental
Task Force Report conducted by key Dade County stakeholders. The DCPS will
assess student access to mathematics and science programs, teacher
qualifications, adequacy of resources, and learning opportunities for students.
Task force members will visit schools and review individual school improvement
plans. This information will be consolidated with stakeholder data to formulate
a comprehensive mathematics and science education reform plan that enhances and
refines the Task Force Report. ***
