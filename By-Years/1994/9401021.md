9401021 Ambler This award provides support for the establishment of the Design
Technologies Laboratory, or DesignLab. The laboratory will stimulate
experimental research in technologies fundamental to building design support
tools. Many such design support technologies are inherently nonprocedural and
ill-suited to von Neumann uni-processor architectures. Efficient implementation
strategies demand parallel and distributed computing environments with large
shared memories and/or ultra high-speed interconnections. The requested
equipment includes a 16-processor SGI Challenge and a very high speed network.
The research topics to be explored include intelligent information databases for
multimedia and 3D drawings; computer vision, modeling and visualization;
declarative design specification languages; collaborative multi- agent design;
meta-languages for defining reasoning systems; implementation strategies for
non-procedural design technologies; and applied design technologies.
