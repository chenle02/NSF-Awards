Scientists are increasingly called upon to explain their research to the public,
to elected officials and to members of the media. Giving presentations to a
general audience requires skills that are different from those required to give
a scientific presentation. Three workshops will be organized each year at
scientific conferences in 2017 and 2018 to provide scientists with the
opportunity to learn how to communicate with the public and other general
audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following workshops will be
organized at the February 2017 Aquatic Sciences Meeting run by the Association
for the Science of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and the February 2018 Ocean
Sciences Meeting run by ASLO and two other oceanographic
societies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Video workshop that provides guidance in
making short videos explaining science to lay public audiences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Science communication workshop that provides small-
group, hands-on sessions where participants will be given guidance in improved
communication skills to use during presentations to the public, elected
officials, and members of the media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Interdisciplinary
presentation workshop where a few selected oral presentations will be critiqued
in front of an audience that includes the
presenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the aquatic sciences community are
increasing interested in learning how to improve their communication skills,
create effective videos and present their work to the public. This effort will
encourage the wider dissemination of information about NSF-supported research to
the public and other audiences.
