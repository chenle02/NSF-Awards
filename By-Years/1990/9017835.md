The tectonic history of the Canada Basin is poorly understood and the Mesozoic
history of the Arctic margin of Alaska & NW Canada is critical to this problem.
Magnetic data from the oceanic crust of Canada Basin are ambiguous and cannot
distinguish between (1) anticlockwise oroclinal rotation of the northern margin
of Alaska away from the Canadian Arctic Islands about a pole of rotation new the
MacKenzie delta, and (2) a major left-lateral transform fault to permit the
southerly migration of northern Alaska. The two models predict different
structural regimes for the eastern Brooks Range, MacKenzie delta, and Black
River-Oglivie Mountains regions during the Mesozoic this project will address
the problem by structural and kinematic studies along the Porcupine River fault
system and adjacent areas. Spatial variations in the geometry of superposed
structures will be documented from Precambrian through Cenozoic rocks, and ages
of deformation all be established from stratigraphic and igneous intrusion
relationships. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the
tectonic evolution of the Canada Basin and the adjacent Arctic region, and will
also have relevance to oil exploration in the area.
