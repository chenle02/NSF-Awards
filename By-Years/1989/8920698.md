Nerve cells fire electrical impulses by the movement of charged ions through
the cell membrane. This ionic current flows through specialized protein channels
which may be restricted to a specific type of ion e.g. sodium, potassium or
calcium. The amount of current carried by a particular ion and the time it
occurs during the nerve impulse are important factors in determining normal
function of the nervous system. Since many types of ionic channels and subtypes
of channels exist in nature, it is essential to understand their diversity and
the ways in which each channel is regulated. One possible new type of channel,
carrying the "J-current", has been discovered in the lobster. This current is
particularly sensitive to the presence of calcium, which may act as a regulator
of channel activity. Studying the J-current is important because it is similar
to ionic currents found in mammalian brain. The specific aims of this research
are: (1) to identify the ion which is responsible for carrying the J-current,
(2) to study its relationship to other ionic currents e.g. potassium current,
(3) to analyze the effect of certain drugs on the J-current and (4) to determine
its physiological role. The data collected by this research may provide insight
into the evolution of ionic channels and the function of ionic channels in
higher organisms.
