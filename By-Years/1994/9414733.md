Abstract ATM-9414733 Baker, Paul A. Duke University Title: SGER: Paleoclimatic
Research in Lake Titicaca This award is in support of a Small Grant for
Exploratory Research (SGER). Lake Titicaca (Peru/Bolivia) may contain the most
important sedimentary record of Quaternary climatic change in tropical South
America. Previous paleoclimatic studies in the lake have only involved analysis
of shallow-water cores. This is because the recovery of sediments from central,
portions of the lake is a major undertaking, involving a sufficiently large
vessel for the rough sea conditions of the lake. Extensive seismic reflection
profiling should also be done as part of this study as an aid to core site
selection and as a means for identification of hiatuses and sedimentary facies.
Prior to requesting funds for a major expedition to Lake Titicaca, it is
appropriate and prudent to make personal contact with government officials and
scientists in Peru and Bolivia to ensure the success of future research efforts.
This award supports travel to Peru and Bolivia in order to: (1) contact
government officials to obtain assurances that research cruises will be
approved; (2) communicate personally with South American scientific colleagues
to ensure that they will be properly involved in this research; and (3)
determine the availability of technical facilities and supplies.
