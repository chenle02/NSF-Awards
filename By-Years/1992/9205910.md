In this project, the PI will collaborate with PI's from two other institutions
to carry out measurements of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), F-11 and F-12, from
water samples collected on three separate legs of a hydrographic cruise along
32|S in the Pacific from Chile to Australia as part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). This line is referred
as WOCE line P-6. This particular project will focus specifically on the central
portion between Easter Island and New Zealand. Data will be used to study
ventilation and circulation of the upper water column, especially the Antarctic
Intermediate Water. This work will also provide calibration of gas phase F-11
and F-12 standards used by all CFC laboratories for the WHP.
