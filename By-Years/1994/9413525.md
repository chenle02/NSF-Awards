This acquisition will enable the university to upgrade and expand its research,
practice, and research training in formulation, modeling, and implementation of
problems in industrial mathematics. This equipment enables the senior personnel
on this project to continue contributing to the advancement in the state-of-the-
art tools used by industrial mathematicians. The department will augment its
course offerings by developing a new, one-year graduate course teaching students
through hands-on experience how to work with natural and social scientists,
engineers, managers, and business people to develop more complete and accurate
models for materials, manufacturing processes, marketing, distribution, and
product performance.
