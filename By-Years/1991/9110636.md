H-infinity theory has been widely accepted for robust control system design to
cope with the inaccurate description of the mathematical models. However, there
exist very few identification techniques which are compatible with current
robust control design methodologies. The problem of system identification in
H-infinity is thus formulated to obtain an identified system model with explicit
upper bound on identification error in H-infinity norm based on experimental
information (noisy data). This proposal aims to develop control oriented
identification techniques in H-infinity framework for linear time-invariant
systems. The proposed research will focus on following issues: 1. Establish
practical noise models which fit the H-infinity framework; 2. Investigate the
role of linear algorithms in system identification; 3. Develop robustly
convergent identification algorithms for different noise models with priori
upper bounds for identification error in H-infinity norm; 4. Optimize the
performance of robustly convergent identification algorithms; 5. Study system
identification in H-infinity based on experimental noisy time response data. The
ultimate goal of this proposal is to update identification techniques so that
they are compatible with modern robust control methodologies.
