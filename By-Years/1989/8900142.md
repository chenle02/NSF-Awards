In this project, the P.I. will continue studies of wintertime air- sea
interaction processes over the Gulf Stream. Data were collected during the
winter season from January to March, 1986, as part of an interdisciplinary
project called the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE). Measurements of
heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes were made simultaneously with measurements
of ocean temperature structure. Specific objectives of this project will be: 1.
investigate variability in air-sea interaction over the entire period; 2. Study
the heat budget of the Gulf Stream during strong wintertime atmospheric cooling
events; 3. Adapt the Oey model from the shelf region to include the Gulf Stream;
and, 4. Complete the intercomparison of data obtained from the NOAA P-3 and the
NCAR Electra aircraft during an intercomparison flight.
