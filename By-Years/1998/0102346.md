Funds from this award will be used to help students and other
junior&lt;br/&gt;investigators to participate in the Quark Matter 2001
Conference, to&lt;br/&gt;be held January 14-20, 2001. With the recent
commencement of&lt;br/&gt;data-taking at the newly commissioned Relativistic
Heavy Ion&lt;br/&gt;Collider (RHIC), this conference will be a very timely
milestone&lt;br/&gt;marking first results in the search for the quark-gluon
plasma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
