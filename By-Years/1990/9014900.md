Relativistic electron acceleration is a common characteristic of many quasi-
stellar objects and active galactic nuclei. Relativistic protons must be
accelerated as well, but almost no work has been done to investigate the limits
on the abundance of these particles, nor on the consequences of their collision
with ambient gas. This work, by a major partner in the University of Minnesota's
infrared astronomy effort, represents an exploration of these questions, funded
under NSF's Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.
