9458367 Zachos Funds are provided for a NYI award to James Zachos of the
University of California at Santa Cruz. Over the next five years his research
will center on defining and comparing changes in the planetary temperature
gradient(with emphasis on tropical temperatures) during two suspected episodes
of greenhouse warming, the early Pliocene (~4 Ma) and early Eocene (~55 Ma).
These observations will be used to evaluated competing models of past global
warming. Dr. Zachos has developed and taught courses at the graduate and
undergraduate levels. His teaching priorities during the course of this award
are to: restructure the Earth Sciences curriculum, and improve undergraduate
interest and enrollment in Earth Sciences.
