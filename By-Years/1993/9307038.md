9307038 Philbrick Underwater pollination (hydrophily) is one of the most
enigmatic pollination systems in flowering plants. Hydrophily requires the
abandonment or modification of a suite of characters intimately tied to the dry,
aerial flowering condition, and represents a shift in floral biology with
profound consequences for flower and pollen morphology. The mechanical and
biochemical modifications entailed in achieving wettability (underwater release
and capture of pollen) raise significant adaptive obstacles not encountered
during evolutionary shifts from one aerial pollination system to another. The
goals of Dr. Philbrick's project are to probe questions concerning the evolution
of water pollination using the genus Callitriche as an experimental system.
Callitriche is the most appropriate group to conduct these studies because it is
the only genus of angiosperms that includes both aerial and underwater
pollination systems. Phylogenetic analysis using morphological and new DNA
characters will provide an understanding of the direction of change in floral
and pollen features across the species in the genus, and thereby help determine
models of change in adaptation to underwater pollination. %%% Underwater
pollination is one of the more bizarre adaptations found in certain groups of
flowering plants. Dr. Philbrick is studying this phenomenon in an explicit
phylogenetic framework for the ca. 50 species of the genus Callitriche that
includes both underwater and aerial pollination systems. The direction of change
in floral and pollen features can be determined, and in turn this knowledge will
allow analysis of cellular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for new floral
structure.
