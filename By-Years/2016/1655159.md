By the end of 2016, over one-third of the federal appeals court bench was made
up of women and over one-fifth were racial minorities. These figures stand in
stark contrast to forty years earlier when the same appellate courts counted
just one woman and three minority judges on active service. This study uses
social science theories and methods to examine how this historic demographic
transformation of the federal bench affects deliberations, opinion writing, and
organizational practices on the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals. These findings
will offer new and important insights on the intermediate appellate courts that
serve a vital role in the administration of justice in the federal court system.

Data are collected from published judicial opinions of the U.S. Courts of
Appeals, biographical materials, and publicly available transcribed oral
arguments, to test competing perspectives from social science theories about the
effects of diversity on judicial decision making. One set of theories focuses on
the way in which differing perspectives of individuals linked to race and gender
affect small group decision making. Another set of theories predicts that
interactions during oral argument and subsequent citations to opinions will
reflect on societal processes that generalize stereotypes about gender, race,
status, and power. Finally, theories on gender and racial identity predict that
women and minority judges will bring new approaches to oral argument,
collaboration, and opinion drafting. To test these various expectations, this
study leverages recent advances in linguistic software and automated methods of
content analysis to produce a novel dataset of opinion content and extend an
existing public resource, the Multi-User Database of U.S. Courts of Appeals
Decisions.
