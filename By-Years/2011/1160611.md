This project concerns the collisions of atoms, molecules, and electrons, with an
eye towards calculating the cross sections and relative branching ratios of
different processes that might occur. These processes primarily include
dissociation. Such calculations are generally complicated because one must
include the effects of not only bound states but also states with free
electrons. Potential degeneracies also complicate the analysis. In this research
project, the group aims to use modern ab initio techniques in order to explore
the flow of energy in such atomic/molecular systems and to elucidate the
mechanisms that underlie the interactions between their different components. As
such, this work will involve studies of dissociative recombination, the
excitation of molecules by high-energy photon impact, and photodetachment of
polyatomic systems. This also includes predicting angular distributions from
fixed-in-space molecules with extensions to the process of radiative attachment.

This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. This research
will enhance infrastructure for research and education. Moreover, the group
maintains a strong collaboration with international partners, in particular the
experimental and theory groups in Sweden, the TSR in Germany, and with
theoreticians at the Universite de Havre, France.
