9353935 Cummings The complex tectonic evolution of the Pacific Northwest and the
associated volcanic activity provides an ideal setting for the study of
volcanism. This program utilizes a field-oriented workshop format to investigate
volcanic processes and examine the methods by which investigations in volcanic
terrains are conducted. During the workshop, five theses are addressed: 1)
volcanism and tectonic setting, 2) physical volcanology, 3) volcaniclastic
sedimentation, 4) volcanic hazards, and 5) volcanism and resources. These themes
are examined through hands-on investigations at carefully selected field sites
throughout Oregon. The follow-up program encourages networking among
participants and program staff and the use and modification of materials
developed during the workshop in classroom settings. The program is designed for
faculty from community colleges and primarily undergraduate, four-year degree
granting colleges and universities. ***
