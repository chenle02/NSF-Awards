This grant will support theoretical research into the geometric and control
problems of grasping non-rigid and compliant objects. Related control problems
will also be studied, such as task planning, non-holonomic motion planning,
representation of compliance uncertainty, and decomposition of tasks into
homogeneous subtasks such as grasping, re-grasping, and finger gaiting. The
research is likely to integrate combinatorial task-planning algorithms with
motion planning based on differentiable manifold theory. Experimental
verification of promising algorithms is also planned.
