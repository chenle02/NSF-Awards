A research program is proposed on the application of the theory of variational
enequalitites in equilibrium problems arising in transportation theory and
economics. It is hoped that this approach will simplify the theory of
equilibrium and will induce more effective algorithms for computing equilibria
of large scale systems. Three specific projects are proposed. The first project
addressed equilibria in traffic networks. A travel demand is associated with
each origin-destination pair of modes of a netowrk. A travel cost is assigned to
each link of the network. In the equilibrium traffic pattern, no user will be
ablle to decrease his travel cost by altering his travel decisions. This can be
characterized by a mathematical conidition in a form of variational inequality.
The principal investigator will establish existence of equilibrium taffic
patterns under weak assumptions, and will develop conceptual algorithms for
finding such equilibria. The second project aims at developing a new approach
for the study of general economic equilibrium, based on the theory of
variational inequalitites. The main idea is to show that Walrasian equilibria
can be obtained as solutions to a variational inequality, in an approporiate
space.
