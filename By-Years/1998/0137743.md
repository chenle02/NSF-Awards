Title: ADVANCE Fellows: Aspect Oriented Framework for Software Development

Project Proposed:

This proposal, applying aspect-oriented (AO) approach, aims at building a
framework design to open software systems in a systematic way that factors into
the initial design the capacity to evolve, be extended, and be adaptive to
future changes. The work will employ the Dynamic Weaver Framework (DWF) under
development by the Concurrent Programming Research group lead by the PI. This
framework allows for a separation of software system aspects from the system
components, providing a systematic well-defined structure to open the software
system to enable evolution, extendibility, and adaptation. Motivated by the
increased complexity resulting from adding more basic software components, this
research addresses the following for AO software systems:

Modeling Supporting lifecycle development with End-to-End automation
Experimenting with more real-life applications, with current case tools
supporting the model, and with on-demand system re-modularization

Aspect-oriented software development is an approach that cuts across functional
components to present different views of software products. It supports and
enhances software evolution by focusing on separation of concern issues,
particularly to distributed systems.

Results from this work are expected to demonstrate slower degradation in
component cohesiveness, and improvements in maintainability and evolution
capacity of systems that require inter-component dependencies and communication.
