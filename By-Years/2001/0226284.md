This NSDL Collections project is aggregating mathematical software critical to
the learning of school mathematics, including software for handheld devices,
small interactive web-based tools such as applets, and other small modules based
on software application packages. Specific activities include cataloging the
math tools so that teachers, students and other users can easily find which ones
fit their needs; presenting the tools using content strand portals for grades
K-7 and course subject portals for grades 8-Calculus; and offering services to
help teachers and students learn to utilize the technology through such means as
integration into the Math Forum's Problems of the Week, facilitation of
discussion groups, and provision of manufacturer assistance. In addition a
special sub-collection of reviewed and relevant mathematics education research
on the use of technology in learning mathematics is being developed. The
benefits of these mathematics tools are being promoted through the Math Forum's
large and active community. Metadata describing the tools in the collection is
being shared to the larger NSDL via the Open Archives Initiative protocols.
Development collaborators include personnel from SRI, Key Curriculum Press,
Texas Instruments, the Shodor Foundation, and Utah State. The impact of this
collection is very broad, offering much needed support for teachers' use of math
tools and feedback for developers producing those software tools.
