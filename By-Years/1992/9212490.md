The major use of this equipment will be for the development of a novel drug
delivery system comprised of microencapsulated liposomes and designed to produce
devices that deliver drugs in either a pulsatile fashion, or in response to an
external trigger. Liposomes, the major component of the proposed drug delivery
device, range in size from 20 to 3500 nanometers. They are lamellar particles
consisting of highly ordered concentric phospholipid bilayers, and require a
high speed centrifuge to be separated from solutions in which they are
suspended. This equipment is capable of separating micron and submicron sized
particles by sedimentation at high g values, and would, therefore, be very
useful in both the preparation of the liposomes and the monitoring of the
delivery profile from the drug delivery devices.
