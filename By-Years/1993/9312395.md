9312398 Dean The project will address problems in building integrated planning
and learning systems for applications in mobile robotics, such as errand
running, surveillance, target following, and searching for objects of a
specified type. These applications require robots to work under uncertainty,
complexity, and time pressure. Solutions to the associated control problems
require efficient algorithms for directing movement and sensing to acquire
information about the environment.
