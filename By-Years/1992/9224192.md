This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the camp
facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of Greenland as part of
the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order to investigate how atmospheric
trace elements are deposited on the ice and what kind of changes they undergo as
they are being incorporated into the ice. An understanding of such processes is
necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data that can be
recovered from ice cores. While significant progress has been made recently in
extracting and analyzing ice cores, progress in understanding the air to snow
transfer process for reactive chemical species has lagged behind. The goal of
this project is to determine the atmosphere to snow transfer function for
chemical species whose deposition is reversible, i.e. ones that can move from
the snow back into the atmosphere to be removed or redeposited elsewhere. The
two species to be investigated are hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. Based on
measurements of their concentration in the free atmosphere, in the air within
the snow, as well as in snow, and ice, a transfer model will be developed.
Concurrent laboratory studies will be done to determine and constrain model
parameters such as chemical equilibrium coefficients and mass transfer
coefficients. The model will be generalized to other reactive species, such as
nitric acid, and organic acids.
