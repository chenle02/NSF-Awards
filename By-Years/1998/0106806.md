0106806 Zeitler Large rivers are an important element in the geodynamic -
evolution of orogens, as they define base level for drainage and removal of
considerable material. However, at spatial scales consistent with crustal
tectonics, it is difficult to decipher the incision histories of major rivers
because the erosion they facilitate removes most of the direct evidence. Helium
dating of apatite has the potential to provide timing information of river
incision in orogenic areas. This project will examine the Indus River incision
history as it crosses the Nanga Parbat metamorphic massif in Pakistan. Results
will be useful in testing theories of tectonics and topography of the Himalaya.
