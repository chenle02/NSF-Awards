The movement of water from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf of Mexico is one of the
largest sources of northward heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean. While in the
Gulf of Mexico, some water is diverted eastward through the Florida Straits and
forms the beginning of the Gulf Stream while some may be diverted into the Loop
Current Eddy. Therefore, the Loop Current has a strong influence on the Gulf
circulation and on Florida Current transports. Therefore, the variability of the
Loop Current has a broad impact on the meteorological and oceanographic
conditions within the Gulf of Mexico. The aim of this study is to provide
predictability of the Loop Current between the Yucatan and the Florida Straits.
Using field data analysis, theoretical and analytical models as well as results
from the numerical circulation models MICOM and HYCOM, they plan to address
several key issues including the eddy fluxes and their variability across the
Antilles passages, the dynamical structure and the stability properties of the
Caribbean Current, how different forcings affect the variability of the
Caribbean Basin and the Loop Current.
