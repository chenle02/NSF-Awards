Professor Weisshaar is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
for investigations of the spectroscopy and dynamics of small gas phase species
containing transition metal atoms. Little is currently known experimentally
about the electronic structure of such molecules, nor is there much existing
information on how reactant electronic structure controls chemical reactivity in
simple transition metal systems. Laser vaporization of metal targets permits the
formation of molecular beams for the study of the chemistry of gas phase metal
species without the complications of attached solvent molecules. Resonantly-
enhanced two photon ionization is used to investigate the spectroscopy and
structure of transition metal dimers, trimers, oxides, and ligated atoms. These
same techniques are used to prepare transition metal ions and characterize the
resulting internal state distributions for subsequent dynamical studies as a
function of initial ion internal state. Other dynamical studies include
investigations of dissociative autoionization in metal dimers and time-resolved
probing of molecules absorbed on small metal clusters.
