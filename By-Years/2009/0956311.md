Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims at improving system level fault
tolerance for high end computing systems by exploring the use of system
monitoring data based models in "(1) a methodology for making informed decisions
as to which parts of the system need to be fortified, at what time, and to what
extent, and? building ?(2) a framework to reconfigure the system to meet user-
specified resiliency requirements."
