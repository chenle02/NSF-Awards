Dr. George A. O'Doherty has been awarded a postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. O'Doherty's doctoral degree was from Ohio State University under the
supervision of Professor Leo Paquette. Dr. O'Doherty intends to continue his
research at Stanford University with Professor Barry Trost. In his postdoctoral
research Dr. O'Doherty will learn about the use of organometallic reagents in
organic synthesis. This will help him towards a career goal of developing novel
synthetic organic reactions based on odd electron organometallic reagents and
using them for the construction of large ring compounds. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
