The purpose of this award is to provide travel support for graduate students
and a limited number of invited speakers to participate in a special session on
nonlinear dynamics and predictability in climate and hydrology. The session is
being held as part of the American Geophysical Union's Spring Meeting. The role
of nonlinear dynamical processes in geophysical systems has been recognized as
one of the key issues which must be understood if we are to improve, or
determine the limits of, predictability of these complex and coupled systems.
Participants in this session will not only review current knowledge, but also
will identify future directions for research.
