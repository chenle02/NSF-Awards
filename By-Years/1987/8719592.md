In recent years economists have devoted considerable attention to the normative
properties of alternative compensation arrangements. Among the arrangements
discussed have been deferred payment schemes, efficiency wages, piece rates, and
tournaments. The optimality properties of the various arrangements derives from
the postulated incentive effects that each arrangement is thought to have. Yet,
surprisingly there has been very little effort made to empirically test whether
hypothesized incentive effects of compensation arrangements actually exist. The
proposal consists of two broadly related, but independent projects that begin to
remedy this deficiency. The first will involve an empirical test of tournament
theory using data available from golf tournaments. Data for this project will be
assembled from published sources. The second project will focus on the impact of
sick leave policies on teacher absenteeism. This project will examine whether
variations in sick leave policies across school districts affect teacher
absentee rates, and whether this in turn influences academic performance of
students. Much of the data will be independently collected in a survey of 700
school districts in New York.
