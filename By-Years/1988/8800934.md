The development of molecular biology and digital computers has enabled
biologists to reconstruct evolutionary history (phylogenies) with greatly
improved accuracy and precision. Moreover, by studying morphological,
behavioral, ecological and physiological characteristics of species with a
reliable phylogeny as a backdrop, one can come to understand the processes that
determined their evolution. The proposed research is a reconstruction of the
evolutionary history of North American woodpeckers based on computer analysis of
molecular data. The woodpeckers have undergone rapid evolution in North America
resulting in many species with varying and complex adaptations. In addition, the
geographic distribution of the many species is similar to that of many other
groups of North American animals and plants; these common patterns result from
the history of episodic glaciation during the Pleistocene Ice Age. This study
will serve as a model for understanding that complex geological epoch that is so
important to the formation of the fauna and flora of the United States.
