This project develops a computer-based interactive digital signal processing
laboratory where students design and implement various digital filters in real
time. The project required acquisition of computer worksttions and digital
signal processing hardware and software. This laboratory experience gives the
students "hands-on" experience with real-time digital filter implementation.
This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
