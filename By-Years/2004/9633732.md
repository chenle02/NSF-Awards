9633732 Buck The tectonic force available to drive rifting is estimated to be as
much as an order of magnitude below the yield strength of intact lithosphere
according to standard models. Detailed numerical models of rifting will be
developed that include dike instrusion with the aim of expaining the first-order
features of continental rifts and rifted margins with the simplest possible
self-consistent models will be used to explore the time evolution of
lithospheric strength, subsidence, and surface deformation in rift zones, under
different assumptions of magma supply and rifting rates. ***
