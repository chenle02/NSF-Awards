This project addresses questions regarding the chemical processing in fog of
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are known to be toxic.
Specifically: Is there a possibility that fog processing of PAHs could transform
them to oxidized compounds (oxy-PAHs) or particles? Might some of the oxy-PAHs
be toxic? If so, these compounds might also represent a potential health threat
if they are inhaled in a foggy environment. The approach consists of field
determination of phase distributions of PAHs and oxy-PAHs throughout smog-fog-
smog (SFS) cycles near Fresno, CA and/or at Louisiana State University.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include new perspectives on the cycling of
PAHs in atmospheric waters, which are of interest to a broad range of
scientists. Graduate students from underrepresented groups are being trained
through their participation in the project. Also participating is a faculty
member from Prairie View A&amp;M University, a Historically Black College-
University institution. Research results are being incorporated into
undergraduate courses taught by the principal investigator.&lt;br/&gt;
