9319329 Cook This award is made under the program for Small Grants for
Exploratory Reserch (SGER). The southern Himalayan Mountains in Nepal are
strongly affected by the Asian monsoon. Yet, virtually no dendroclimatic
research as been conducted there for the purpose of reconstructing past
monsoonal activity, even though there are numerous native tree species there
that ar likely to produce climatically-sensitive tree-ring chronologies. This
project is designed to critically evaluate the regional dendroclimatic potential
and establish tree-ring sites in two diverse regions affected differentially by
the monsoon.
