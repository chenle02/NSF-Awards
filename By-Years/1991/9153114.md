Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) involves the injection of a small sample
(microliters) into a flowing stream. The flow path is defined by modules that
permit sample and reagent mixing and detection by a wide range of techniques.
FIA will be used in Instrumental Analysis and other courses to illustrate sample
preparation, derivatization or reaction of the analyte, its detection, and the
processing of results. The required apparatus is simple, relatively low cost,
and can easily be adapted to demonstrate ion selective electrodes,
spectrophotometry, solvent extraction, dialysis, kinetic methods including the
use of enzymes (soluble and immobilized), and immunoassay. Because the sample
volumes are small, the reagent requirements are modest and relatively
inexpensive. The grantee will match the NSF contribution to this project.
