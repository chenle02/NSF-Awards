The PI will investigate a number of problems, using homotopy aspects of
arithmetic geometry, that may be thought of as generalizations of the period-
index problem for the Brauer group, the u-invariant problem for quadratic forms,
and the Hasse principle for a quadratic form over a number field. The project
will focus on the interaction of field arithmetic and the complexity of
algebraic structures, such as quadratic forms, Brauer groups, linear algebraic
groups and homogeneous varieties. The project represents a set of techniques and
experiments designed to capitalize on the new topological perspective in the
study of algebraic structures. It will aim to support and further the
interactions of these areas with arithmetic algebraic geometry, algebraic
topology and the algebraic geometry of stacks and moduli.

The relevance of these topics, rooted in algebra within pure mathematics, is
exhibited by their connections to a wide range of other subjects in recent
years. Besides their many ties to other branches of mathematics, the algebraic
structures at the core of this proposal have also found applications within
diverse areas from theoretical physics to wireless communications. The research
component of this project will seek to capitalize on and enrich our
understanding of the many connections to other areas of study in order to gain
more leverage in understanding these fundamental and important algebraic
structures. The project's outreach components include funding conferences aimed
at establishing a community inclusive of graduate students and young
researchers, undergraduate colloquium aimed at increasing interest in
mathematics, and facilitating a mentoring program for high school students in
northeast Georgia interested in mathematics. It will also pursue strategies
towards improving the mentoring and retention of graduate students in
mathematics.
