The principal investigators undertake research in the convergence of the random
vortex method for solving the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. They
concentrate on time discretization, dependence on viscosity, and flow in a half-
plane. In addition,they propose calculations of turbulent flow past a sphere.
Vortex methods are techniques for computing fluid flows; such problems arise
often in science and engineering. Three-dimensional flows are common in real
problems, but difficult to compute. This research extends the theory of two-
dimensional vortex methods and applies them to a touchstone three-dimensional
problem.
