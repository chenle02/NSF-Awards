This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a multiple scanned-head Critical Dimension Atomic Force
Microscope (CD-AFM) with high throughput as a CD metrology tool. Phase I will
develop key design innovations for commercial in-line production quality control
in: (a) multiple scanned CD-AFM heads, each dedicated to scanning one site; and
(b) a modular, high-performance head design that enables greatly reduced move-
acquire-measure (MAM) time.

The principal commercial application is to replace CD Scanning Electron
Microscopes (CD-SEMs) as the semiconductor industry's primary CD metrology tool
for in-line production quality control. Other applications are seen in
micromanipulators for microelectronics, including mask repair, and in biology.
