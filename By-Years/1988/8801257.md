A prototype position and orientation sensor (POSE) has been found to measure
position and orientation of a robot end effector with a linear accuracy of 10-3
inches and a rotational accuracy of 0.5 milliradians, respectively. In this
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase II project further
research focuses on (1) measurement and correction of backlash in robot joints
and (2) automatic recali-bration of the robot to fixtures in its work space. The
sensor has (1) a hollowed-out-cube base fixture with two collimated light beam
projectors and a light-sensitive semiconductor device on each of three faces,
(2) a light reflective fixture mounted on the robot hand, and (3) a computer for
date processing. The POSE technology has potential for higher manufacturing
productivity through increased precision in robotic manipulation and decreased
time to "teach" and "reteach" robot tasks.
