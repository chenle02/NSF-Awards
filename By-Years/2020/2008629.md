Advances in semiconductor technology have enabled sophisticated computing
systems to be integrated in small form-factor devices that are widely used in
not only in computers, but in consumer electronics such as cellphones and have
enabled a host of applications, such as the internet-of-things, wearable
electronics, portable medical devices, etc. The integration of multiple
computing and storage units in a single semiconductor device necessitates the
scaling of networking science, typically developed for constraints between
computers (such as the internet), down to a single-chip level, in order to
enable efficient communication between on-chip elements. This enables data-
center-like operation on an individual chip populated with hundreds of
processing elements, with computation capabilities that are equivalent to a
network of computers, but with much improved portability, cost-effectiveness and
energy-efficiency. Such advancements are important to maintain US leadership of
the computing, networking and semiconductor industries, as well as improving the
connectivity of national human resources and the physical
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates computing system,
VLSI, antenna design and networking principles for the integration of a novel
Through-Silicon-Via-Antenna (TVSA)-based wireless network system into
semiconductor devices packaged in the form factor of heterogeneous multi-die
integration. The proposed wireless network for multi-die systems aims to create
a scalable, reliable, and efficient network interconnect for current and
emerging industry-standard multi-die processors. Through-Silicon-Via-Antennas
are highly suited for on-chip wireless communication at minuscule footprints.
This project focuses on the following tasks: (a) design and characterization of
on-package TSVA; (b) wireless propagation modelling and channel characterization
for multi-die systems using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) prototyping testbed;
and (c) interconnect network system design by considering routing, latency, and
throughput via cycle-accurate system-level
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
