This project will understand the sources of severe mid-latitude ionospheric
weather during the coming solar minimum period. In particular, the PI will study
the role of electrodynamics and plasma physics in controlling the character of
traveling ionospheric disturbances. In addition, he will determine whether
plasma physical processes can amplify small disturbances seeded in the
ionosphere by atmospheric waves to the extent indicated by observation of the
most violent mid-latitude events. The investigators will both coordinate the
activities of a number of US scientists and carry out crucial investigations
using the largest remote sensing radar, near Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Graduate
students, undergraduate students, entry-level professionals, and senior
scientists will all participate in this CEDAR project, and use the yearly
meeting to coordinate experiments, as well as analyze the interpret the data.
