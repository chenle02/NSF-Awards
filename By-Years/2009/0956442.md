In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his
research group will investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in (1) beryllium
clusters containing 3 - 30 Be atoms, and (2) the interactions between beryllium
oxide (BeO) and rare gas atoms (helium, neon and argon). The ultimate aim of
these studies is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of
bonding that are not well-characterized in terms of conventional models, and to
advance our understanding of bonding when clusters grow from a few atoms in size
to large systems that approach bulk metal behavior. The BeO rare gas studies
will address intriguing theoretical results that predict unusually strong bonds
involving normally inert rare gas elements. A variety of experimental tools will
be employed, including photodetachment spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence,
resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity ring-down
spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from these studies will help
chemists to develop a deeper understanding of bonding that encompasses the
traditional models of bonding as well as the unusual interactions that are one
of the themes of the present study. The research will provide the graduate and
undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich
experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods. A collaboration
will be established with Spelman College, to expand the research experience to
students from a historically Black women's college.
