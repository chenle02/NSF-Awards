9522886 Floudas This award addresses the integration of chemical process design
and control. The design of a process determines the properties of variable
interaction, disturbance rejection, and set-point tracking, which comprise its
inherent controllability. Process design synthesis unusually seeks the process
that extremizes some economic objective without consideration of
controllability. The goal of this research is to study ald develop a systematic
approach for the interaction of design and control that will take into account
dynamic models of the chemical process. In particular, the research will focus
on (1) the study of a new optimization-based framework that can address
nonlinear problems with continuous and integer variables in the presence of both
differential and algebraic constraints, (2) the development of new methods for
the interaction of design and control that will address the issues of model
uncertainties and disturbances during operation for steady state and dynamic
performance, and (3) the application of the new framework for the interaction of
design and control to distillation column synthesis, reactor-separator-recycle
systems, and batch distillation columns. If successful, this research will
provide new insights on the design of chemical process facilities that could
yield improved output, reduced production cost, and reduced environmental
impact.
