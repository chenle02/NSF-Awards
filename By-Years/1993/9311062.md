9311062 Fainman The goal of this proposal is to conduct basic research towards
development of the polarization sensitive optical elements for passive switching
fabric interconnection networks and for packaging of manufacturable
optoelectronic systems. We propose to employ the approach of computer generated
hologram (CGH) design of diffractive optical elements that possess two different
impulse responses for two orthogonal polarizations. To obtain the dual impulse
response functionality we will use two surface relief microstructures in
birefringent material assembled face to face. The fabrication of these elements
will leverage from the advances in the microelectronics technology using E beam
lithography, photolithography, ion beam etching, ion implantation, etc. The
objectives of this proposal include modelling, design, fabrication and testing
of multilevel phase polarization sensitive diffractive optical elements built of
naturally birefringent materials as well as of artificially birefringent
materials obtained with form birefringence. In addition to the optoelectronic
systems applications, the proposed research advance the basic science and
engineering in such areas as vector optical wave diffraction on quantized multi
level phase birefringent boundaries and microstructures, and microfabrication of
CGH using deposition and ion implantation techniques. ***
