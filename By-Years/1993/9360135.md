9360135 Lee Due to the effectiveness of fibrous materials in suppressing
radiative energy transport, they are widely used for thermal insulation in many
engineering systems, such as the space shuttle thermal protection tiles, liners
of combustion engines, flexible heat shields in reentry vehicles, etc. Of
particular interest is the fabric insulation which consists of fiber bundles
woven into a matrix formation. The woven fabric is a high-strength composite
particularly suited for applications at elevated temperatures. Continual
improvement in the insulation capacity of fabric composites is needed in order
to accommodate the increasingly severe thermal environments of future aerospace
and combustion systems. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop
analytical models for the design and performance optimization of fabric
composites. Phase 1 focuses on the modeling and characterization of the
radiative properties of the constituent fiber bundles, whereas the model for
predicting radiative heat transfer will be developed in Phase 2. These models
are powerful design tools which can be used to determine the composition,
engineer the radiative properties, and optimize the thermal performance of
fabric composites in a cost-effective manner.
