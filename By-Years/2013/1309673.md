&lt;br/&gt;Technical Part: This project will investigate and develop a new
dynamic tissue engineering scaffold, harnessing state of the art knowledge in
optical wave-front engineering, which will be able to produce diverse force
types. The work will focus on producing scaffolds that can generate engineered
spatiotemporal mechanical forces using near infrared irradiation. The three-
pronged strategy that will be used in the fabrication of this dynamic scaffold
system consists of (i) localized heating enabled by patterned illumination, (ii)
an enlarged surface area resulting from pixelated post topography fabricated by
imprinting technology, and (iii) an engineered comb-like porous structure with
CNT reinforcement. This dynamic cell-seeding niche can provide physical forces
varying in time and space to mimic some aspects of embryogenesis in a manner not
previously possible. It will provide a platform for studying the effect of
mechanical forces on cell fate. For this study, the effect of mechanical forces
on the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells along a hepatocyte lineage
will be investigated for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical
Part: The proposed new dynamic scaffold, harnessing state of the art knowledge
in optical wave front engineering, will be able to deliver diverse forces to
living cells. It will help to improve our knowledge of the role that mechanical
forces play on tissue development and regeneration, thus facilitating controlled
stem cell differentiation into specific tissues and organs. The platform can be
extended for multiple cell type seeding in spatially predefined regions to
facilitate stem cell differentiation. Applying fundamental knowledge of
materials synthesis, mechanical characterization, and optical manipulation to
life science and health will broaden the appeal of materials science and
engineering to the diverse UC Merced student constituency that includes large
Hispanic and Hmong populations. The grassroots outreach will include (i) a
concerted effort to recruit nationally for underrepresented students by
providing summer internship opportunities and encouraging participation in this
research through independent study or a Materials Capstone Design course, and
(ii) graduate students as well as faculty members giving public lectures and
interactive presentations.
