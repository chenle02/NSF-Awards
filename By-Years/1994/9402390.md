Natural Language and Robot Planning, Part 2: An Empirical Approach This project
uses a robot which has incomplete knowledge of its environment and must acquire
additional knowledge through sensors to carry out human commands, allowing the
exploration of issues in robotic planning and control and natural language
interaction with an active agent. The speaker giving the directions is provided
with a three-dimensional graphic display that provides knowledge of how the
robot is positioned within the building and how it is responding to the
commands. The approach to developing the human- robot system will be to have
humans work in pairs, with each acting as the robot in turn. In this way, the
syntactic and semantic aspects of the way humans react in this situation and
their interaction with the situation pragmatics can be studied. Naturally, the
directions given depend upon and will be interpreted within the context of the
robot at a given time, so the task is designed to provide a concrete laboratory
for the study of the problems of context which are difficult enough to raise
important issues but easy enough to expect insights.
