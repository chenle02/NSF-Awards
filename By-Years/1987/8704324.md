Positronium is the positron-electron bound state. The structure of positronium
is governed almost completely by QED; strong and weak corrections are small
compared to electrodynamic effects. Positromium is also accessible to high
precision experiments. Thus positronium is an ideal laboratory for studying QED
and the bound state formalism in quantum field theory. The main quantities of
physical interest in positronium are energy levels and decay rates. Several
energy level splittings of n=1 and n=2 states have been measured with
uncertainties on the order of a few MHz. Present theoretical evaluations of
these splittings agree with experiment, with terms of order m(alpha)6 = 18.7 MHz
still uncalculated. The n=1 spin-singlet and spin triplet decay rates have also
been measured. The spin-triplet rate is several standard deviations away from
the present theoretical value. There is an evident need to extend the
theoretical calculations of energy levels and decay rates in positronium by
another power of alpha. It is proposed to calculate some of these corrections
and to make progress on the calculation of others. In particular it is planned
to complete the calculation of n=1 and n=2 positronium energy levels through
order m(alpha)6. Comparison of experiment and theory at this level will provide
a detailed test of the bound state formalism and of QED.
