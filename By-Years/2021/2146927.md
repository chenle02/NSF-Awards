This project aims to understand how video games communicate mental health
narratives. It will provide insight into how digital technologies and new media
are re-defining knowledge about and experiences of mental health. This study
will support health care professionals, players and scholars understanding of
the relationship between technology and mental health. It will broaden mental
health discussions to include new spaces structured by digital technology and
storytelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research project
aims to: (1) explore how mental health is represented and conveyed as meaningful
within video games; (2) understand whether and how stories about mental health
are taken up, received, and interpreted by those who engage with these games;
and (3) articulate how narratives and storytelling may act as sites of power,
inequality, and resistance within video game and mental health spaces. Using
qualitative interviews and observations with people who play video games, in
addition to critical analyses of video game texts, this study will examine how
individualsâ€™ understanding of and relationship to mental health shape and are
shaped by video game narratives and experiences. This study will contribute to
broadened understandings of how everyday interactions with digital technologies
participate in knowledge production, specifically around health and mental
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
