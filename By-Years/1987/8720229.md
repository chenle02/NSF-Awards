This award will provide funds for technical assistance and for equipment useful
in structural analysis of various proteins and nucleic acids. The equipment
items include computational tools useful for the analysis and interpretation of
data obtained through X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, and other
instruments useful in the preparation of samples for analysis by these
techniques. The group of investigators who will benefit from the award include
internationally known experts in use of these techniques of structural analysis
and other, equally respected biologists whose research will benefit greatly from
collaboration with the structural experts. The development and application of
2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to the study of the
structure and function of biological macromolecules is currently one of the most
exiting areas of biological research. In recent years, rapid progress has been
made in the development of computational tools that allow these techniques to be
applied to a variety of molecules rather than, as previously, to the few
molecules most amenable to such analysis. The simultaneous development of
molecular genetic and other, biochemical techniques have also increased the
variety and sophistication of the structural questions that can be approached
with these techniques. The equipment and technical assistance provided by this
award will enable a group of outstanding molecular geneticists to collaborate
and to instruct each other in the use of the most recent advances.
