The dynamic storage and loss moduli of polymer solutions will be measured using
an extremely sensitive resonator instrument which has been constructed in the
principal investigator's laboratory. For dilute polymer solutions, the intrinsic
moduli will be obtained by concentration extrapolation of measured moduli; these
moduli reflect the molecular relaxation processes of the polymer chain. Linear,
star, and cyclic random- coil polymers of matched molecular weights will be
studied in dilute solutions; polymers in solvents with varying thermodynamic
quality or specific solvent-polymer interactions; polymer with side chains which
modify their molecular flexibility; block copolymers where the blocks can be
preferentially solvated; polyelectrolytes; and polymers which undergo reversible
transformations of structural conformation. In addition, a systematic study will
be undertaken with respect to modification of chain relaxations caused by
initial chain interactions at low concentrations where chains just begin to
overlap. For all well- characterized polymers will be used so that the results
will be suitable for testing theoretical predications and for comparisons to
complementary experiments.
