The proposal is for an exploratory project to investigate deployment of sensor
networks in areas with little to no existing physical infrastructure (power or
communications) for the purpose of monitoring the ecosystem. Island areas, such
as the Bay Islands of Honduras, are the target environments. Crisis areas will
also be explored for pilot and test zones. This proposal attacks an area of
advanced cyberinfrastructure applied to environmental problems.

The goal of the project is two-fold. The first goal of the project is to assess
possible field sites and to create one or two small pilot tests to explore
unsolved problems in sensor networking. Second is to create a taxonomy of
challenging networking-in-the field problems - to answer the questions: what are
the existing commercial technologies, what are the emerging technologies
(research prototypes), and where the gaps are in the capability.
