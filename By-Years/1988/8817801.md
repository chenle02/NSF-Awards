The Ocean Studies Board (OSB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will
continue to provide guidance on major ocean science policy issues to the Federal
agencies involved in ocean sciences, including the National Science Foundation.
Over the next year the OSB will address a series of issues relevant to NSF ocean
science programs. These will include ocean data management, especially questions
related to classifi- cation of data; long-term climate change and effects of
air-sea inter- action; comparison of in situ research and that done via remote
sensing; global effects of marine pollution and oceanic waste disposal; interna-
tional cooperation in oceanographic research and freedom of access; eco- nomic
worth of the oceans, including fisheries and aquaculture; the coastal zone and
land-sea interaction; and human resources. The Board will continue to serve as
the U.S. National Committee for the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research.
The OSB will coordinate its activities closely with other Academy Boards and
Committees, especially the Com- mittees on Global Change and on Atmospheric
Sciences and Climate.
