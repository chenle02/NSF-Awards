Novel electronic materials of nanometer thicknesses are greatly needed for
improved performance in a variety of technologically advanced fields including
microelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, and chemical sensors. The leap
into controlling thin film quality and composition at an atomic scale requires a
novel process and a fundamental understanding of the surface reaction chemistry.
This proposal focuses on developing an atomic layer deposition process using a
partially ionized gas chemistry, implementing state-of-the-art surface
analytical techniques to characterize the surface reactions, and integrating
these materials into microelectronic devices to test the electronic performance.
The success of this research will provide optimized processing of depositing
ultra-thin electronic materials, and lay the foundation of future generations of
faster microelectronic devices.

Research outcome will be integrated into three courses developed by the
principle investigator at UCLA to maximize the impact of the research, i.e., an
undergraduate course entitled Semiconductor Manufacturing Laboratory, a
graduate/undergraduate course on Surface and Interface Engineering, and a
graduate course on Principles of Plasma Processing. Two female graduate students
in the Department of Chemical Engineering will be supported under this program
to pursue their Ph.D. studies. Senior research projects and summer positions
will be offered to undergraduate students at UCLA, especially women, to work on
spectroscopic data collection and analysis outlined in the proposed research and
to help their long term career development in academia or industry. Summer
internships will also be offered to high school girls through the outreach
activities established by the principle investigator to promote the interest of
female students in pursuing Science and Engineering when they enter colleges.
