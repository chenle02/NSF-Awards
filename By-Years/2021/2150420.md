This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The Summer Program Advancing Techniques in the Applied
Learning of Statistics (SPATIAL-Stats) at American University, in Washington, DC
is an 8-week summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program hosting
6 students to work collaboratively on research problems in statistics and
applied mathematics. The program is designed to raise the level of mathematical
and statistical understanding for undergraduate students and engage them in
creative activities, thereby keeping them in the mathematics and statistics
pipeline. Students will learn how to conduct scientific research for publication
and how to effectively communicate mathematics and statistics research to a
general audience. The program focuses on diversifying the mathematical sciences
to allow for different views and experiences to help solve world problems.
Specifically, the program aims to address the shortage of underrepresented
mathematical and statistical scientists by strengthening studentsâ€™ mathematical
foundations to enable higher aspirations in STEM fields.

The research goal will be accomplished first by providing students with
intensive 3-week lectures in the fields of statistics and mathematics, focusing
on both computer skills as well as theoretical foundations. The students will
then spend the remainder of the program actively engaged in research on one of
three projects which cover topics including Riordan Arrays, random walks and
trees, and the effects of spatial correlation on empirical likelihood. Students
will continue to be mentored after the conclusion of the summer program to
support the presentation of their work at national conferences as well as
submission of a peer-reviewed journal article. Students will also participate in
networking activities to meet leading researchers across the country. The
program will run in conjunction with the Summer Program in Research and Learning
(SPIRAL), and together these students will participate in field trips to local
research agencies and industry to discover applications of mathematical and
statistical research. Students participating in SPATIAL-Stats will interact with
other students with different racial/ethnic backgrounds with the intention of
understanding the importance of excellence and diversity in STEM.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
