This work addresses key open questions about semantic relatedness (SR) measures,
a family of algorithms used throughout computer science and related fields that
help computers replicate human assessments of the relatedness between two
concepts. Decades of research and development have transformed SR measures into
a critical component of a wide swath of intelligent technologies in areas
ranging from information retrieval to human-computer interaction to spatial
computing. However, despite the importance and ubiquity of SR, researchers have
only recently begun to examine it from a human-centered perspective. These
human-centered studies have problematized key assumptions underlying the entire
SR literature, e.g. that people from all cultural contexts agree on a single
relatedness value between any two concepts. This project addresses long-overdue
open questions in the SR literature that will move the field towards a more
human-centered approach to SR. To do so, this research will collect datasets of
relatedness judgments, mine patterns in Wikipedia and other content, perform
statistical analyses, create and evaluate algorithms, develop software, and
conduct large-scale user studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, this research will
complete four threads of work that redefine semantic relatedness to address
human-centered concerns raised in the SR literature: (1) investigate the role of
culture in SR and use these results to redefine SR to incorporate cultural
context, (2) study SR among the low-notability concepts that are critical to end
users but entirely ignored by the SR literature, (3) address the need for SR
measures that explain their relatedness estimates to users, and (4) develop more
robust human-centered SR evaluation procedures and support their adoption
through easy-to-use software. Second, this research will develop new conceptual
representations for SR measures that accommodate differing cultural perspectives
and create compact contextual SR models that empower applications with tractable
human-centered SR algorithms. Finally, the research will demonstrate the power
of human-centered SR approaches through their application in improved
recommender systems, enhanced Wikipedia reader experiences, and novel
information discovery tools.
