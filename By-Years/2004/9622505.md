9622505 Diaz This workshop will evaluate the capability of the meteorological
observing networks of the Americas to address the following World Climate
Research Programme (WCRP) questions: Is the climate warming? Is the hydrologic
cycle changing? Is the atmospheric circulation changing? Is the climate becoming
more variable or extreme? While meteorological observing networks are equipped
to monitor weather, most are not designed to address questions of climate,
including baselines, measurement uncertainty, and model validation. This
workshop is designed to bring together the appropriate members of the weather
monitoring and climate research communities in the Americas in order to identify
the needs for a climate monitoring system. These needs include observational,
data management, and data distribution aspects (including the identification of
the critical climate variables to be included in such a system). This workshop
will contribute to the effort of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)
community in evaluating the observational needs for a global integrated climate
observing system. This workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for the
directors of national meteorological services and climate researchers to
evaluate the current state of the weather data collection systems and their
capacity to contribute to future climate research in the Americas. This workshop
is being co-sponsored by three organizations: the Global Climate Observing
System (GCOS) Program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
National Oceanographic committee of Chile, and the National Science Foundation
(NSF) on behalf of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
(IAI). The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global
change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas. The National
Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency designated by the White House
to carry out U.S. resp onsibilities within the IAI. ***
