Assimilation of sulfate-S is a central event in plant metabolism and the
formation of organosulfur compounds such as amino acids, cofactors, and
sulfolipid by the plant. The research planned is focused on sulfate activation
that takes place on the inner mitochrondrial membrane of Euglena and the
presumed, subsequent transfer of activated S in some form to the chloroplast. A
critical assessment of sulfite's involvement in sulfolipid formation is another
focus of this research. The flow of sulfur compounds from mitochondria to
chloroplasts is an important part of understanding the origin of chloroplast
components during plastid development. The metabolic intermediates involved in
conversion of assimilated sulfate into the variety of S-containing compounds
characteristic of plant biomass are, in significant details, unclear; the
research planned is directed at understanding the extent to which sulfite is an
actual intermediate in such conversions, and at enlarging the understanding of
how a key enzyme involved in sulfate reduction functions in cysteine
biosynthesis. This flow of sulfur is an important aspect of plastid development
in plant growth.
