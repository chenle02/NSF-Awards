Science approved by the NSF and the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq).
Under this plan and for the purposes of the STI, the area of physics will be
coordinated by the Department of Energy. This transfer will help to support
research visits and exchanges of physicists to U.S. and Brazilian national
laboratories.
