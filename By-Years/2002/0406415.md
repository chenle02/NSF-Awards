The goal of this research project is to develop new software tools and
applications for scalable display systems. These primary focus is on methods
that coordinate multiple displays, multiple users, and multiple applications to
enable true display-centric computing. For coordinating multiple displays, the
project will develop dynamic feedback to build adaptive layered multi-resolution
display systems and to study how to achieve integrated, continuous calibration
capable of delivering high-quality information display. For coordinating
multiple users, software tools that manage information display intelligently and
securely for seamless exchange of visual information will be developed. For
coordinating multiple applications, the project will study how to design an
adaptive infrastructure that enables multiple applications to share a scalable
display efficiently.
