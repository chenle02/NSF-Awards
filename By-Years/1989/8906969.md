The work of Kevin Burgess is supported by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry
Program. Burgess, an assistant professor of chemistry at Rice University, is
studying the catalysis of hydroboration reactions by rhodium catalysts. The non-
catalyzed hydroboration reaction has had a major impact on oprganic synthesis;
the catalyzed process will make the next major improvement in the utility of the
chemistry. Burgess will utilize chiral rhodium complexes to install chirality
into the hydroboration process. Mechanistic studies, as well as general
examination of the scope and limitation of the developing technology, will be a
major emphasis of this new program. This proposal outlines plans to develop
rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration reactions for routine use in preparative organic
chemistry. Asymmetric hydroborations mediated by various homochiral rhodium-
phosphine complexes will be examined for substrates which include
unfunctionalized and functionalized prochiral alkenes and a range of chiral
allylic/homoallylic compounds. Mechanistic studies performed in parallel with
these general synthetic probes will be used to identify ways to better
understand the basic chemistry involved as well as to find methods for changing
and improving the technology.
