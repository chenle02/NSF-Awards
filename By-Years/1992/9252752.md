The Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program, Inc. (CPEP) Summer Program at Trinity
College offers a five-week program which integrates instruction in the sciences,
mathematics, computer applications, guidance and career counseling and language
arts/study skills. Each year forty underrepresented minority rising eighth and
ninth grade students take grade appropriate courses and participate on field
trips. The program employs a hands-on approach to mathematics and science
education. Learning experiences are designed to involve students actively in
science inquiry and mathematics as an integral aspect of investigation.
Professionals from the science, engineering and mathematics community serve as
role models and mentors.
