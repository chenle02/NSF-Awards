0326107 Diebold This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University in the City of New York provides instrumentation to significantly
improve the geophysical survey capabilities of the research vessel Maurice
Ewing, an NSF-owned ship operated by LDEO as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specifically, support is
recommended in for ten multichannel seismic reflection streamer sections, a
Linux computer cluster for onboard seismic data processing, a RAID data storage
system, refitting ten MCS streamer depth controllers with compasses, two DLT
tape drives, multibeam sonar spares and water temperature sensors, a shore-based
software license for training and quality control, an expendable
bathythermograph controller with launcher, a color printer, and a passive
acoustic cetacean monitoring system. The instrumentation supported here will
improve survey capabilities and upgrade reliability of R/V Ewing for conducting
geophysical and oceanographic research programs. These improvements will be of
substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
during 2003 and future years. ***
