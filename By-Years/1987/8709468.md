This is a ROW (Research Opportunities for Women) award. Thermal conductivity
studies are used to investigate imperfections. Their application to this highly
anisotropic material, mercurous halide crystals, has the potential for giving
detailed information about 3-phonon zone boundary interactions and their
frequency dependence, and could be used to test more specific theories than the
ones currently used and sufficient for more isotropic solids.
