ABSTRACT OPP-9614038 RASTETTER MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY The goal of this
project is to quantify and to improve understanding of changes in carbon storage
in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems. The balance between canopy and soil carbon
cycling processes, and the interactions between them and soil moisture, will
help determine whether the Arctic develops as an important sink or source for
carbon. This project will focus specifically on modelling canopy carbon and
water exchange, and synthesize information gathered in experimental components
of existing programs. A hierarchy of models will be employed that will produce
robust regional models of canopy carbon and energy exchange, derived from
validated process-based models. The project will integrate information collected
from Toolik Lake LTER site, make linkages that will facilitate the construction
of simpler and coarsely-scaled models of canopy proecess, and third, create
suitably scaled representations of canopy process for use by other regional
modelling efforts.
