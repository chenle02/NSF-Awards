This workshop will bring together leading researchers from relevant academic,
commerical, and practice-oriented communities to explore fundamental issues
concerning the emergence of radically new developments in learning technology
and its applications in higher education. Developments in online instruction and
technology-based innovation in classroom interactions are changing how academics
think about teaching and learning. An example is the recent emergence of MOOCs
(Massive Open Online Courses), where the primary focus is on delivery of
educational experiences through the Web to global audiences. Digital
technologies are also changing teaching in face-to-face settings, with
experiments at many institutions in flipped classroom approaches and blended
instructional methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to
generate a rough 5 - 10 year prioritized research agenda for technology-based
teaching/learning approaches that are effective and feasible to scale. There are
very deep issues to be explored in the new educational techniques, issues which
must be explored if such techniques are not to be pursued blindly. This workshop
will help lead the way to understanding the developing online educational
practices in the light of research into their effectiveness. The hope is that a
framework will be produced that will lead to research that facilitates the
development of high quality, economically-feasible, educational practices with
these new and still emerging technologies.
