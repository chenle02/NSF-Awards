This REU Site award to the Chicago Botanic Garden, located in Glencoe, IL, will
support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during each summer of
2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools
with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be
trained in the program. This award aims to increase the number of people working
in botany-related professions, which is necessary for addressing current
conservation challenges. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many
will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of
the program will be done through a standardized survey and students will be
tracked after the program to determine their career
paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program has three primary goals: (1) provide
research experiences that deliver foundational knowledge and skills for a career
in plant conservation, (2) inspire new researchers while engaging with audiences
within and beyond the scientific community, and (3) provide students and mentors
with skills and experiences that nurture productive and empowering
relationships. Prospective students apply through a web-based portal developed
specifically for this program. Research takes place at the Chicago Botanic
Gardenâ€™s Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation Science and Action and nearby
field sites. Projects range from investigating the use of native plants as lawn
alternatives, to understanding urban plant diversity, and determining the
genetic diversity of plant collections and its role in restoration. Students
will be provided with extensive professional development. Weekly 3-hour sessions
will develop skills in field-biology, data analysis and visualization, and
conservation genetics, as well as workshops that will provide guidance on
applying to graduate school, science communication, ethics, and more. The
program culminates in a symposium where participants present research posters,
and an informal event in which student-produced videos are presented. More

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
