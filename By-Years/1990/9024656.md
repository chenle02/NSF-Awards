The sixth Intentional Conference on Boundary Element Technology (BETECH 92) will
be held at the University of New Mexico, May 27-29, 1992. Recent theoretical and
computational developments have transformed the BEM from a purely research
technique into an efficient tool for engineering design. The Conference will
provide an international forum for boundary element researchers, code
developers, and industrial users. The proceedings of the conference will provide
an important reference in the applications of boundary element method.
