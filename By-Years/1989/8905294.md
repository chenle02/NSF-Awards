Funds are requested for support for the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Northwest
Regional Developmental Biology Conference to be held April 13-15, 1989 at Friday
Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington. Historically, this meeting
has attracted developmental biologists from the Pacific Northwest region of the
United States, as well as from Western Canada. The topics covered at the
platform sessions are: Gene Expression in Development, Control of
Differentiation, Cell Lineages and Morphogenesis, Gametes and Fertilization and
Neuronal Development. A major purpose for this meeting has been to provide an
educational experience for young scientists. The small size, informal
atmosphere, and physical isolation promote communication among graduate
students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty members. It also provides an
excellent forum for junior members to present their work. %%% The conference has
presented an educational opportunity to junior participants noted above that is
not available to them at their individual institutions and also allows
scientists within the region at all levels to communicate with each other.
