This program will develop a computational algorithm to calculate the coupled
energy and hydrodynamic equations for domains with changing boundary conditions
such as those experienced in problems involving solidification, deposition, and
dissolution. The new algorithm will attempt to combine the features of the
boundary integral method with the spectral element method to achieve high
accuracy and efficiency while remaining sufficiently flexible to handle the
changing geometries. Two formulations will be treated: One involving very slow
flow using the Stokes approximation and employing the boundary integral method
alone, and the second involving natural convection using the Navier-Stokes
equations and the combined boundary element-spectral element approach. With the
successful conclusion of this project, the tools will be available to study the
most general convective heat transfer processes for evolving systems. This
ability will lead to a better understanding of such phenomena as solidification,
dissolution, etching, and corrosion.
