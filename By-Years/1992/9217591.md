The conference will be a two and one-half day event to address the progress that
has been made in the Central and Eastern United States toward the reduction of
the earthquake threat. A key focus will be on future needs for research, i.e., a
research agenda for the remaining decade of the 90s and beyond. In advance of
the conference, monographs will be developed addressing the state-of-the-art
technology in five technical areas of hazard assessment, the built environment
and research, preparedness, response and recovery, and social and economical
losses. In addition, paper and poster sessions will be held to address
individual works and needs in these five areas, and a set of proceedings will be
published containing approximately 150 papers on the subjects. The conference
will be held in a manner that emphasizes discussion and interaction among
seismologists, engineers, emergency managers, social scientists, and planners.
The conference will be held in Memphis, Tennessee on May 2-5, 1993.
