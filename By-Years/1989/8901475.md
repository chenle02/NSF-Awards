This project studies several problems in the algebraic theory of quadratic
forms and the structure of finite-dimensional division algebras over arbitrary
fields. These problems are studied using the tools of Galois theory and Galois
cohomology. This research concerns the theory of quadratic forms which is a
study of the solutions of homogeneous second degree polynomials, or
equivalently, the study of the geometry of spaces possessing a symmetric inner
product. The project outlined concerns some of the most important problems in
the area of quadratic forms.
