9629805 Mohan Power Quality has lately become a major concern to the electric
utility industry due to increasing number of nonlinear loads, simultaneously
with loads which are sensitive to voltage waveform distortions, sags and swells,
and the electro-magnetic interference (EMI). There are numerous examples of
momentary voltage dips resulting in tripping of motor drives, nonlinear loads
causing lamp flicker, and so on. Many of these problems can be eliminated by
fast acting static var compensators and active filters. But their cost and a
lack of adequate performance have limited their application. The objective of
the proposed research is to develop a novel all- active hybrid converter
arrangement for solving Power Quality problems, initially for medium
distribution voltages such as 4.16 kV and 7.2 kV, which excels in the areas of
efficiency, cost, performance and EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference), without
sacrificing reliability. ***
