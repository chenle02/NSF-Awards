The basic mechanism by which anionic and nonionic surface-active agents such as
Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and ethoxylated alcohols remove oily soils during
low-temperature processes is investigated. Videomicroscopy studies at Rice using
a recently developed experimental technique will reveal the nature of the
dynamic behavior which takes place when a detergent solution contacts oil under
various conditions. Experiments at Shell Development Company using radioactive
tracers will determine the degree of soil removal from small samples of fabric
for the same detergents and oils and for the same conditions of temperatures,
water hardness, and pH. A variety of pure surface-active compounds are used in
these experiments including mixtures of negatively charged and uncharged
detergents and oils and fatty compounds of the types found in typical laundry
soils. Diffusion path theory will be used to provide a fundamental understanding
of the results in terms of the equilibrium phase behavior of the various
systems. A key objective is to be able to predict when various types of
microemulsions or liquid crystals form between the original detergent solution
and oil and when spontaneous emulsification and related interfacial instabilites
occur during the solubilization process.
