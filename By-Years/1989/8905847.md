This project represents a three-part research effort. Most of the effort will
be directed toward formulating a derivative of the CENTURY soil organic matter
model that will run for tropical dry forest. The investigators will also examine
several potential field sites in northeast Brazil to select the most appropriate
site for later field experimental research. Finally, the research team will
conduct preliminary field measurements that will enable them to parameterize
CENTURY and decide upon and initialize a fire model. The research group is
excellent as are the institutional accommodations at both Colorado State
University and Oregon State University. International arrangements with
Brazilian scientists are well taken care of. It is expected that this project
will yield results important to fundamental ecology as well as to the management
of dry tropical forests.
