The research contained in this proposal utilizes the surface proteins of
Tetrahymena thermophila to determine the mechanisms involved in environmental
regulation of surface protein mRNA stability. The ciliated protozoan,
Tetrahymena thermophila is being used as a model system because it contains a
family of surface protein genes (serotype genes) whose expression is dependent
on incubation temperature. The major mechanism controlling Tetrahymena serotype
expression is a dramatic temperature-dependent change in mRNA stability.
Preliminary evidence indicates that cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors
could mediate this change in mRNA half-life. We will use a recently developed
Tetrahymena transformation vector and in vivo and in vitro mutagenesis schemes
to identify these elements and factors. How cis and trans-acting elements
interact to regulate the ultimate appearance of gene products is still largely a
mystery. These experiments should illuminate one such mechanism.***//
