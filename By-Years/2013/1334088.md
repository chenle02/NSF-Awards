The research objective of this project is to study fundamental interactions
between graphene and self-assembling DNA towards a new manufacturing platform
that can create custom-designed graphene nanostructures. DNA origami (paper-
folding) structures of arbitrarily designed sizes and shapes will be
hierarchically assembled and will be explored as templates/masks to define
graphene nano-geometry using top-down fabrication methods. This research will
investigate DNA assembly kinetics and non-covalent chemistry at the DNA-graphene
interface. The effects of edge chemistry and graphene geometry on the electro-
optical properties of resulting nanostructures will be assessed. Theoretical
modeling and numerical computation will be performed to guide experiment.

The outcome of this research will generate new scalable nanofabrication
strategies for custom-designed graphene and other electronic materials, which
cannot be manufactured otherwise in a high-throughput, massively parallel
fashion. The bottom-up approach will demonstrate unprecedented sub-10-nm
features of arbitrary geometries, while exploiting the repeatability and
scalability of conventional top-down methods. This program will integrate the
research efforts with educational and outreach activities designed to advance
the public understanding of biomolecular nanomanufacturing. These activities
will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to learn and
conduct cutting-edge science and engineering in a multidisciplinary environment,
and increase participation of women and underrepresented minority students.
