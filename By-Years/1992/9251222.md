This project involves upper division molecular biology students in growing,
maintaining and then investigating transfected mammalian tissue cultures. The
equipment includes: a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge, a Labconco Safety
Cabinet and a VWR carbon dioxide incubator. Students work in small groups with
the assignment of transfecting a cloning vector containing the ETn gene into
murine plasmacytoma P3 cells and then identifying the insertion sites. The
course involves considerable student independent work and the use of a variety
of techniques.
