The "ionosphere" is the electrically charged region of the upper atmosphere
above about 85 km altitude that is produced by the ionizing action of solar
ultraviolet and X rays of wavelength shorter than about 100 angstroms. The
ionosphere is important for communications in that it reflects radio and radar
wavelengths longer than a few meters wavelength, and scatters and refracts
shorter wavelengths. Much interference in both long and short wavelength radio
communication, and for ground to satellite communcation, is produced by waves
and irregularities in the ionosphere. This award is directed to studies of the
ionosphere, and especially of the mechanisms giving rise to ionospheric
irregularities, both at equatorial regions and at high latitudes.
