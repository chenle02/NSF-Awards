A summer school on "Current Trends in Symplectic Topology" will be held at the
CRM (Centre de Recherches Mathematiques) in Montreal from July 1-12, 2019.
Symplectic topology is a rapidly developing branch of geometry that has seen
phenomenal growth in the last twenty years. The school is intended to provide
access to this subject to a diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers. The school will consist of minicourses by leading researchers in
the field, exercise sessions, selected talks by young researchers, and an open
problems panel to identify central directions for future research. The grant
will provide funding to enable US-based graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers to participate in the summer school. This will improve the US
workforce by providing training in important cutting-edge research
topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major themes to be covered in the summer
school are the dichotomy between rigidity and flexibility; the Fukaya category
and homological mirror symmetry; Hamiltonian dynamics, capacities, and spectral
invariants; symplectic field theory, its variants, and applications; and
foundational properties of moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves. Although there
have been some recent specialized conferences on individual topics in the above
list, the summer school is unique in synthesizing these different aspects of
symplectic topology into an overview accessible to young
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
