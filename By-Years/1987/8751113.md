Students bring many misconceptions to high school science classes. This project
will focus on misconception within physics, specifically mechanics, and on how
the use of computers can help correct many of these faulty views. In particular,
the project will develop a series of software modules using unique
characteristics of computers, such as their interactive, adaptive, and graphic
capabilites, to address previously documented misconceptions. The project's
modules will be based on a generative model of student learning and will contain
computer activities, such as real-time data collection, simulations, and problem
solving exercises, for both students and teachers. The software for the modules
will be programmed to work with commercially available laboratory interfacing
equipment. Activities are divided into five phases: (1) the design of modules
and development of prototypes; (2) the review and revision of the modules; (3)
evaluation of materials in high school physics and university science education
classes; (4) revisions based on evaluations; and (5) dissemination through
regional and national workshops, teacher development programs, and COMDUIT's
national channels. Attempts are being made to overcome student misconceptions
which have been identified through research in teaching and learning. This
project will continue this important work, using the approach of instruction
through the use of the microcomputer and appropriate software. It will increase
the knowledge base on effective ways for more successful learning of physics.
