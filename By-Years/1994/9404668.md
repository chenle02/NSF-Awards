9404668 Phillips This Americas Program award will fund travel and related
expenses on a research project in the area of polymeric materials. The
collaborators are Professors Paul Phillips, University of Tennessee, Francisco
Medellin-Rodriguez, University of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and Dr. J.S. Lin, of
Oak Ridge National Laboratories. In-situ studies of secondary crystallization in
a series of aromatic polyesters will be carried out, with the goal of
understanding the molecular features that control crystallization and other
properties of this important series of commercial polymers. Earlier studies have
not produced a well-defined molecular mechanism for the secondary
crystallization process. This proposal will consider a new possible mechanism,
based on experimental observations from previous studies. Much of the
experimental work will be carried out at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, which
is making its small-angle X-ray scattering research facilities available to Dr.
Medellin. Other components of the research will be carried out at the University
of Tennessee and at the University of San Luis Potosi. ***
