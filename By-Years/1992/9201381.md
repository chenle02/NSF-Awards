This proposal requests support for a one-day symposium entitled: Environmental
Sex Determination in Reptiles: Patterns and Processes to be held at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in Vancouver, British Columbia, in
December, 1992. The symposium consists of two sections: 1. Evolution and Ecology
of TSD, and 2. Hormonal and Molecular Mechanisms of TSD. Twelve speakers will
present their latest research on TSD in reptiles ranging from evolutionary and
ecological theory to molecular and hormonal mechanisms. Each of the invited
participants has made significant contributions in this field and will present a
concise review of their latest findings. The proceeding of the symposium will be
published in the American Zoologist and funds are also requested to partly
defray these additional costs.
