A new laboratory course will be developed that will address the use of
microcomputers in instrumentation, emphasizing the coupling between computers
and instrumentation. The syllabus will cover the channels of communication
between a microcomputer and instrumentation, a variety of interfaces, matching
laboratory signals to interfaces and complete system design. The new equipment
will also be used to complement and upgrade the instrumentation available for
current analog and digital electronics courses.
