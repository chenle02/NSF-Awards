Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaplan &lt;br/&gt;0109122
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to estimate the contribution of
dissolved organic matter (DOM) in transport to the support of stream ecosystem
metabolism. The specific objective of this project is to estimate the mass flux
of DOM (e.g., the rate of flux from the water column to the streambed), to
represent this as the sum of fluxes from several lability classes, and to
characterize the respective concentration and uptake length coefficient of DOM
in each lability class. Uptake length converts easily to mass transfer
coefficient or turnover rate through scaling relationships involving depth and
water velocity. Quantifying the uptake of natural DOM in the stream is analogous
to describing the uptake (or spiraling) of phosphorus or ammonium, but is
complicated by the diversity of natural DOM (i.e. it consists of an array of
compounds of varying lability), and the fact that isotopically-labeled natural
DOM is not available. This project will use 13C-labeled DOM generated by growing
plants in a 13C atmosphere. The longitudinal uptake of 13C -DOm will be resolved
into multiple uptake lengths (corresponding to multiple lability classes),
estimated as the sum of exponential-curves. In addition, the uptake kinetics of
natural (12C) DOM in laboratory bioreactors will be compared to those of the
labeled 13C-DOM, and this comparison will be used to scale the results of the
13C-DOM injection, to appropriately describe the uptake of natural DOM in the
stream.&lt;br/&gt;
