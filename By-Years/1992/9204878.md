The Department of Mathematics at the University of Southern California will
purchase multiprocessing computation servers which will be dedicated to support
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: simulating biological neural
networks, computing homological invariants of moduli space, interacting particle
systems as models of catalytic surface reactions, nonparametric estimation of
probability distributions from incomplete data.
