9520611 Mazer The focus of the proposed research is to better understand
competition for reproduction among plants. Plants that produce flowers will
compete because ultimately there are many more pollen grains produced than there
are flowers to be fertilized. The experiments proposed will focus on the
competition that occurs after pollination. One consequence of competition during
this phase is that some individuals may father more seeds in the next generation
than other individuals. Are there differences among plants in this ability? What
influences how well a plant's pollen performs during this phase? The
investigators will examine elements of the environment and of the plant itself
to determine: 1) how these factors influence a plant's success during the post-
pollination phase; 2) the number of seeds fathered following competition; 3)
pollen performance on burned and unburned habitats; and 4) success by plants
competing for flowers with varying morphologies. Flowering plants may have
invaded so many niches in the world because of their ability to remove inferior
genes through the type of competition described above. Thus this research may
have important implications for all flowering plants. Moreover, the research may
yield information useful in applied fields, as understanding of pollen
competition could be applied to improvements in crop species.
