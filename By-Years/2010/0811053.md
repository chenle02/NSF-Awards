This award is for a collaborative research and development undertaking between
the University of Stanford and the University of Alabama towards the feasibility
of a high pressure gas phase detector using enriched Xenon for the detection of
neutrino-less double beta decay. Research and Development is to proceed within
the broader EXO collaboration to advance detection with liquid Xenon by the
introduction of tagging and to a high pressure gas phase using Xe with low
background. The proponents envision applying tagging with Barium for the liquid
detector to drastically reduce the radioactive background and allow an
unambiguous measurement of unprecedented sensitivity. This work will be mainly
carried out by the University of Stanford group. The developments of the gaseous
detector are not as advanced as the liquid case and the group from the
University of Alabama will be exploring the characteristics of such a detector.
It is expected that at completion of this project, there will be results to
guide the detector development and technology selection for the ton-class of
neutrino less double beta decay experiments for the Deep Underground Science
&amp; Engineering Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
