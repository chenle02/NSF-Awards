This research will generate the most comprehensive analysis of relationships and
evolutionary history ever attempted for a group of vertebrates from its origins
to the present. New morphological characters, new fossils, and DNA sequences
from both the nucleus and mitochondria for all living species in the order
Crocodylia will help to determine how the approximately 150 known crocodylian
species (including fossils) are related and resolve relationships that are
currently controversial or even unknown. These results will also help to compare
patterns of molecular and anatomical evolution and explore the reasons molecules
and fossils sometimes support different timing estimates, providing results that
can be applied to other groups of organisms. They will also be critical to
conservation efforts for crocodylians, all of which are threatened or
endangered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is truly interdisciplinary,
integrating expertise from two established crocodylian researchers (a
morphologist/paleontologist and a molecular evolutionary biologist). This
approach will extend to both graduate and undergraduate education, with students
being exchanged between the respective programs so that different aspects of the
research can be experienced first hand. These programs will produce a crop of
well-rounded, well-trained young scientists from both the earth and life
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
