This project will analyze stable isotopes and trace elements in bivalves
collected from vent sites on the East Pacific Rise. Potential tracers of water
temperture (Sr, Mg, F) and fluid chemistry (metals) will be analyzed by ion
microprobe, with 18O analyzed by mass spectrometry, and compared with water
samples collected in time-series studies nearby. Partition coefficients will be
evaluated, and radiometric dating will be used to determine growth rates. The
goal is to determine the utility of bivalves as a record of temperture and fluid
chemistry variations on decade to century time scales at mid-ocean ridge
hydrothermal systems. If successful, this will provide a tool to asses temporal
variability of venting, and to estimate the hydrothermal component of
geochemical fluxes.
