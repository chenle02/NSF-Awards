This theoretical/numerical modeling effort is aimed at exploring the behavior of
retrograde fluids, and those exhibiting negative non-linearities, in various
steady flow configurations which occur either in laboratory experiments designed
to define fluid characteristics, or power plant cycles designed to take
advantage of these properties. The results of the modelling will be useful both
in design of experiments to provide more definitive data on the behavior of
these unusual fluids, as well as engineering possibilities to design Rankine
cycle power systems with significantly lower losses from shock and condensation
effects.
