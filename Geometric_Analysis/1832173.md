This National Science Foundation award provides support to the conference "The
topology and geometry of low-dimensional manifolds" to be be held July 12-15,
2018 at the University of Texas, Austin. The conference will focus on recent
developments in areas of mathematics known as three and four-manifold topology.
It will promote discoveries and collaborations in low dimensional topology and
related fields. For wider and longer term benefit notes from the research talks
will be posted on the conference website making them accessible to researchers
around the world. This award will provide support to graduate student and junior
mathematicians to attend the conference and gain expertise in this dynamic and
fast moving field of mathematics. This conference aims to bring together leading
researchers and early career mathematicians working in low-dimensional topology
and its connections with symplectic and contact geometry. There have been many
advances in our understanding of three- and four-manifolds in the last decade
due in large part to a convergence of many varied and exciting ideas; from new
invariants, such as Monopole Homology and Involutive Floer homology, to subtle
connections with symplectic and contact topology. The conference will bring
people working with diverse approaches together to share ideas and foster
collaborations. More information can be found at the conference website

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
