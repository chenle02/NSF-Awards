Electric drives, which are composed of electric machines supplied by power
electronic converters, are an integral part of high-performance and high-
efficiency electromechanical systems used in manufacturing automation and many
industrial processes, as well as in consumer products and transportation
systems. The increased performance and energy efficiency of processes and
products that utilize electric drives combined with the steadily decreasing cost
of power and micro electronics promise to accelerate the use of these systems.
Consequently, the demand for engineering graduates familiar with electric drives
is sure to grow. Motivated, in part, by this demand the university has moved to
strengthen this area of undergraduate study. This project implements an Electric
Machinery and Drives Laboratory (EMDL). This facility is a multipurpose
educational laboratory for examining fundamental principles of electric
machinery in a junior-level course and the analysis and design of electric
drives in a senior-level course. The equipment used in the EMDL includes
fractional horsepower electric machines, power electronic converters,
microcmmputers, and data acquisition systems. Juniors using the EMDL are able to
use an innovative "Field Observer" to visualize the magnetic fields within
operating machines and study the transient response of machines experimentally
and using PSPICE simulation. Seniors using the EMDL are able to study the
operation of electric drives and experiment with new control strategies.
