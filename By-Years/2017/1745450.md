NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Many current commercial products such as giant
magnetoresistive sensors that are used in magnetic random-access memory and
magnetic hard drives are based on the interactions of magnetic forces between
multiple materials. A better understanding of these interactions may also allow
for the development of future spintronic devices. This project explores the
unique interfacial phenomena found in complex oxide structures in order to
design artificially-layered materials with tailored magnetic properties.
Outreach activities include supporting the University of California at Davis
Community College Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Transfer Day
which targets educationally disadvantaged and underrepresented groups from
Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement programs across Northern California.
A parallel and equally important impact of this project is the training of young
scientists and engineers in a field that lies at the intersection of traditional
disciplines of Materials Science and Engineering, Physics, and Electrical
Engineering. Graduates typically find employment in the information technology
sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This goal of this project is to
develop a fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena in complex oxide
heterostructures to design artificially-layered material with tailored magnetic
properties. The incorporation of these materials in next generation spintronic
and orbitronic devices has the potential for significant improvements in device
speed and energy efficiency, which may transform the information storage and
technology sectors. This work utilizes laser-assisted growth to control
interfacial properties with atomic layer precision in combination with
sophisticated techniques for characterizing their structural, chemical, and
functional properties over multiple length scales. In addition, geometric
confinement effects as these materials are patterned to nanoscale dimensions are
investigated. These results enable the development of predictive models of the
emergent interfacial properties at dimensions relevant for device applications.
Additional education activities include the training of undergraduate and
graduate students in state-of-the-art tools, including synchrotron radiation and
neutron scattering-based characterization techniques at U.S. national
laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
