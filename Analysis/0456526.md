The Principal Investigator will perform research in the theory of dynamical
systems, mainly low-dimensional (both smooth and continuous). He will apply
analytical, topological and combinatorial tools in order to investigate real and
complex systems. A substantial part of the project is aimed at providing bridges
between real and complex, one- and two-dimensional dynamics. Investigation of a
class of branched coverings of the plane will be continued. Semigroups of affine
maps will be investigated from the point of view of ergodic theory. For other
systems attractors, periodic orbits, rotation sets and topological entropy will
be in the center of attention.

For almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Economy
and other sciences one can make a mathematical model that can be regarded as a
dynamical system. Sometimes the study of this system is extremely difficult, but
quite often it can be reduced to the study of a much simpler, low dimensional
one. This project is devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of
these types of systems from the mathematical point of view. The results that can
be obtained are usually much stronger than in the general case and often lead to
much deeper understanding of the original systems.
