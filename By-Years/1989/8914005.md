The objective of this proposal is a feasibility study on developing a design
optimization model for construction. The study will consist of two parts,
namely, the modeling and the decision tool. In the modeling part, elements which
constitute appropriate optimization models will be identified. These models have
to be able to represent several design goals which can be considered as
subproblems of the overall design objective, the minimization of construction
cost.
