The workshop will bring together key stakeholder from academia, industry and
government with the charge of identifying the best ways to leverage public
biofoundries to accelerate engineering biology, towards applications in
biomanufacturing and other means to accelerate the bioeconomy and technology
translation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road to achieving a bio-based economy is
transitioning from a concept to a tangible reality and it is acknowledged that
public bio-foundries would have a role in enabling the technology that would
drive such an economy. This proposal describes activities that are timely for
the rapid acceleration of the commercialization of biotechnology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end result of the workshop should be a report
summarizing the workshop proceedings along with a set of recommendations for
future coordination and collaboration between investigators and public
biofoundries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
