Many tropical trees are long-lived, thus long term data are critical to document
and understand the dynamics of tropical forests. Understanding tropical forest
dynamics is becoming even more important because of the large role tropical
forests play in global carbon cycling and because of the potential impact of
climate change on these ecosystems. The Barro Colorado Island Forest Dynamics
Project has conducted 6 censuses of a 50 ha plot over a 25 year period,
generating data that have provided unique insights into forest dynamics and
community ecology. This project will conduct a seventh 5-year census of the 50
ha plot, adding to the longest running large scale study of tropical forest
dynamics. The intellectual merit of the project comes from the value of the long
term data set, the insights it will provide into tropical forest dynamics, and
its use in testing an array of hypotheses related to tropical forest diversity.
The data from these censuses constitute an important broader impact because they
are publicly available to scientists for non-commercial use. An ongoing
international collaboration and student training are additional broader impacts.
