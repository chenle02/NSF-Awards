This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
problem of measuring scour depth around bridge foundations under flood
conditions. Flood-borne debris collecting around bridge piers forms bird's nests
that aggravate scour by creating excess turbulence and preventing conventional
scour detection techniques. The Pneumatic Scour Detection System (PSDS)addresses
both problems of measuring scour through a bird's nest of debris and
withstanding the ravages of flood-borne debris. This technique is based on the
differential resistance to airflow through a vertical array of porous filters
made of sintered brass. The array of filters are sealed into the wall of a probe
used as a probe and battered through the bird's nest into the river bottom
adjacent to the pier like a large nail. Shallow filters are exposed to water,
and deeper filters are exposed to competent soil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2002
National Bridge Inventory lists 22, 414 scour-critical bridges, many with bird's
nests of debris. Flood-borne debris masks the river bottom surrounding the pier,
making ineffective all currently available scour detection instrumentation, such
as sonar depth sounders, ground-penetrating radar, and precludes visual
inspection, limiting the bridge engineers ability to determine the safety of the
bridge during flood events. The PSDS probe is permanently installed adjacent to
scour-critical piers with the multiple pneumatic hoses bundled at the top of the
probe for easy connection to an off-site portable pressure measurement
instrument when flood events are in progress or anticipated. Once installed, the
bridge engineers have available real-time information of the scour conditions at
the pier, enabling them to close the bridge to traffic when dangerous conditions
develop. Additionally, yearly monitoring of the scour&lt;br/&gt;conditions
provides the bridge engineer the knowledge of depth of scour and is then able to
schedule remediation before pier movement occurs, keeping maintenance costs to a
minimum.
