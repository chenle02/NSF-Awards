The focus of this project is the encapsulation of metal complexes in zeolites
and molecular sieves; three applications will be stressed. 1) New zeolites and
molecular sieves will be synthesized by means of a recently developed procedure
in which the metal complexes act as templates during zeolite crystalli- zation.
2) New catalysts with potential application in catalytic cracking will be
prepared by modification of rare earth zeolites with fluorine. These catalysts
are much more active in dehydration, dealkylaltion and disproportionation
reactions. 3) Zeolite-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents will be
prepared and optimized. %%% Dr. Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr. of the University of
Texas at Dallas is supported as a Presidential Young Investigator by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to study the
chemistry of zeolites and molecular sieves. These materials are used in large
quantities in industry as drying agents and as catalyst supports. The new
materials with encapsulated metals which will be synthesized may have
application as catalysts in the petroleum industry and as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) contrast agents.
