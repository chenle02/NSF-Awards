9601792 Browning A scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with high
resolution Z-contrast imaging capabilities will be acquired by the University of
Illinois at Chicago. Users of the instrument span a range of disciplines in both
the physical and life sciences at the university and at other academic
institutions and industrial laboratories in the Chicago area. The instrument
will support research in a variety of material systems including
superconductors, semiconductors, ceramics, metals, polymers, high- temperature
materials, and biomaterials. %%% The atomic resolution microscope incorporates
technology developed in the last few years. This will be a unique research
facility in the Chicago area and one of a few comparable facilities in the
country. ***
