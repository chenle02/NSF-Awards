9625979 Nagarajaiah This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for
Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research" competition. The work
centers on the development of variable stiffness structural systems using a
novel semi active continuous variable stiffness (SACVS) device which varies the
structural stiffness and frequency continuously and smoothly, without inducing
impulsive forces and maintaining nonresonant state under seismic and wind
excitation. The main objectives of the project are: to characterize the non-
linear dynamics of the combined linear structure and nonlinear-SACVS device by
developing analytical models and calibrating these models experimentally; to
develop control algorithms based on intelligent control strategies such as
neural networks; to perform shake table testing of the SAVCS device in a
structural system; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the SACVS system by
comparing its controlled and uncontrolled response, and as compared to a fully
active system. Results from this research will contribute to the development of
innovative semi-active continuous variable stiffness systems and their
application to structural control which will require less power to operate and
will overcome limitations of existing control systems. ***
