An important theme in mathematics is to find finite descriptions for objects
that a priori contain an infinite amount of information. For example, an
infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a
simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of
dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be
possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their
rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems
by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of
researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously
unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics,
and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these
structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications
to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in
settings or technical details.

The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical
and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The
general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a
problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of
a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants.
This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical
objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted
more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered
injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of
surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring
actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear
algebra. These are three examples of variants of the recently well-studied "FI-
modules," which offer new technical challenges and open the door to new
paradigms of "representation stability."
