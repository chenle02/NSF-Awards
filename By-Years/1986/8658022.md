Hamilton's major accomplishment, as part of his doctoral thesis, was to show the
consistency of the model of a type I supernova, exploding from an accreting
white dwarf, with the observed x-rays of the supernova remnant, caused by a
shock moving into a plasma consisting of heavy elements rather than hydrogen.
His planned studies include both supernovae and galaxy clustering, radiation
processes and hydrodynamics. Hamilton is a promising young theoretician working
on supernovae and the clustering of galaxies. Supernovae are the most energetic
explosions of stars, thought to create the elements of which the Earth is
composed. The blast wave from the explosion causes x-rays observed by
satellites. Hamilton produced the first detailed explanation of the x-rays from
one major kind of supernova remnant, substantiating thereby the models for the
supernova and for its production of the elements. Hamilton is also interested in
problems of cosmology, specifically the manner in which galaxies are clumped in
space. He is an expert on both radiation processes and hydrodynamics.
