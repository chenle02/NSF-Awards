The objective of this research is to estimate the numerical convergence rate of
three key climate elements of hydrological and energy cycles, and to thereby
quantify the error of numerical approximations at different resolutions. The
three elements are: i)vertical fluxes of water vapor between the atmosphere and
ocean, ii) horizontal fluxes of water vapor in boundary layer jets, and iii)
sensitivity of fractional cloud cover to model resolution. The methodology will
be to use a telescoping, variable resolution global model that is capable of
locally resolving far more structure than are other uniform resolution climate
models. The vertical boundary layer resolution will be selectively enhanced to
study item (i) and the horizontal resolution will be locally enhanced to
explicitly resolve mesoscale structures to study items (ii) and (iii). The study
is important because it seeks to better understand water vapor transports
between the oceans and atmosphere, a key component of the global water cycle.
