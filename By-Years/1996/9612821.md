The PI will investigate the plasma electrodynamics of the low-latitude E region.
He will accomplish this by making comprehensive measurements of basic plasma
parameters needed to evaluate existing models of the equatorial electrojet and
low-latitude ionosphere. These measurements will include incoherent scatter (IS)
spectral measurements of the ionospheric region, and semi-coherent backscatter
radar measurements to complement the IS measurements. The lack of plasma
parameters and electric field measurements has slowed progress in understanding
low-latitude E-region electrodynamics. The PI will use two radars in a series of
coordinated experiments: (1) the ALTAIR, a fully steerable IS radar located in
Kwajalein, to obtain the first high-resolution, IS spectral measurements of the
low-latitude E region; and (2) the FAR, a portable, frequency-agile radar, to
measure backscatter from type-2 irregularities in the equatorial electrojet and
the 150 km echoes. In sum, this research is essential for understanding the
coupling processes occurring in different geographical regions, and between
plasma and neutral gas in different altitude regions.
