9321330 Eloranta The objective of this research is the remote measurement of
cloud particles. The University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar
(HSRL) will be used to measure the extinction profile and the dependence of
lidar signal strength on the angular field of view of the receiver. As the field
of view is increased, multiply scattered photons provide a larger fraction of
the lidar return. The variation of multiple scattering with field of view is
strongly dependent on particle size. Algorithms will be developed to infer
particle size from this dependence. Results will be tested by comparison with
airborne insitu measurements.
