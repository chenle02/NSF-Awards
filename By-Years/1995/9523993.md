ABSTRACT Eric J. Beckman Alan J. Russell University of Pittsburgh CTS-9523993
Purification of proteins from cell broth is usually a multi-step process
involving filtration and chromatographic steps. From a process standpoint,
particularly with regards to throughput, it would be advantageous to apply
liquid-liquid extraction to protein purification, yet lack of selectivity and
product recovery difficulties preclude this on a large scale. In a number of
publications spanning the last ten years, Hatton and colleagues, as well as
others, have shown that surfactants can be employed to extract proteins from
buffer to an organic phase, generally through manipulation of the
physicochemical properties of the aqueous phase (pH, ionic strength, etc.).
Previously, reverse micellar extraction of proteins has been demonstrated in
only a few conventional liquid alkanes such as hexane and isooctane.
