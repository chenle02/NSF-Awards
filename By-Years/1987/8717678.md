Water movements comprising "wave exposure" are an important characteristic of
wave-swept rocky shores. Although biological sconsequenses of exposure have been
intensively studied, the detailed mechanism through which exposure affects
biological processes has received less attention. Here it is proposed to study
one important and little understood aspect of water motion, the transport in the
nearshore region of the larvae of bottom-dwelling species on wave-swept, rocky
coasts. The following questions are asked: 1. How are larvae affected by flow on
a scale of millimeters to centimeters? These flows may have important
consequences for the release as well as the retention and settlement of larvae.
2. What predictable, larger-scale flows transport larvae offshore, and what
flows bring them back? 3. What are the direction(s) and time course(s) of larval
transport in the nearshore? 4. How do the behaviors of larvae affect their
transport? Experiments will be conducted on the wave-swept, rocky coast of
Central California.
