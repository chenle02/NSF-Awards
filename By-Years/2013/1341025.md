Advanced modern scholarly and scientific research increasingly requires the use
of a high-performance networks and related services. Building such a utility
service across a legacy campus network encounters significant challenges
difficulties due to inadequate existing components, complex security provisions,
poor reliability, high latency, and lack of ease-of-use. In response to this
burgeoning need, the Campus Advanced Research Network Environment (CARNE)
project is creating a scalable, incrementally deployable scienceDMZ-based
infrastructure for an unencumbered high-performance network with low-latency
paths and software defined networking for flexibility. The perimeter of the
network has appropriate security and access control policies and performance and
monitoring facilities. Contributions from this research are transformative and
include the design of an infrastructure for: ease of use; zero packet loss;
testing and measurement of security and performance using Bro - a locally
enhanced intrusion detections system - and PerfSONAR; separating science from
security policy and control; and improving agility and flexibility while
reducing network management overhead. Monitoring of the infrastructure will
allow traces, statistics, and analysis that document the use of the network by a
large clientele of scholars and scientists.  The broader impact of the proposed
high-bandwidth infrastructure is in providing a road map to enhance scholarly
research and education throughout universities. Better connectivity will enhance
advanced discovery classes as well as promote teaching and learning.
Universities can leverage this infrastructure in their active outreach to many
schools, community colleges, and surrounding communities.  CARNE will reach out
to vulnerable populations, which will benefit socio-economically by having
direct access to research deliverables developed at the University of Illinois.
