CTS-9708190 Darsh Wasan Illinois Institute of Technology This proposal request a
travel grant to cover expenses for ten speakers from the U.S. to participate in
the 9th International Conference on Interfacial and Colloid Science (9ICSCS) to
be held on July 6-12, 1997 at Sofia University, Bulgaria. This conference is one
of a series of important world wide forums for the fundamental and technological
applications of colloidal dispersions, capillarity, self-assembled matter,
surfactants, and polymers, interfacial dynamics at liquid/gas, liquid/liquid,
liquid/solid and liquid/solid/gas interfaces, biocolloid and biointerface,
environmental engineering, etc. Previous conferences have been held in Adelaide,
Australia (1994), Copmiegne, France (1991), Hakone, Japan (1988), Potsdam, NY,
USA (1985), etc.
