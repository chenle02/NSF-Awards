9624452 Thouless An objective of this CAREER development award is to establish a
research program in structural adhesives. The proposed research will combine
experimental and theoretical aspects in a micro-mechanical approach to
understanding the mechanical behavior of adhesive joints. The research will
provide a fundamental and unified understanding of the strength of adhesive
joints and it will also address the critical need in the automotive industry to
understand how to optimize the energy-absorbing capacity of adhesively bonded
structures. The educational plan involves establishing multi-disciplinary
courses in which physics based aspects of materials science are combined with
traditional mechanics aspects for the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. ***
