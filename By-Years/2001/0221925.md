Genetically-determined, intentional elimination of specific cells, programmed
cell death (PCD), is indispensable for the growth, development and survival of
multicellular organisms. In plants, PCD is an integral part of many aspects of
development and responses to infectious agents/pathogens. Despite the essential
nature of PCD, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the mechanistic details
and molecular components controlling PCD in both plants and animals. A model
system to study plant PCD, using Arabidopsis thaliana and a purified fungal
toxin, fumonisin B1, was developed during the Principal Investigator's tenure as
an NSF postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Fred Ausubel's laboratory (Massachusetts
General Hospital). This Research Starter Award supports her independent career
as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska. Dr. Stone will continue to
pursue a classical genetics approach of identifying Arabidopsis thaliana mutants
defective in fumonisin B1-induced PCD. Identification of the genes responsible
for this mutant phenotype will aid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms
regulating PCD in plants. Our results are likely to advance our basic
understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of PCD in plant growth,
development, and response to pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
