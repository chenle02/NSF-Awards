This joint research program between Dr. Jacques Pankove, University of Colorado
at Boulder, and Dr. Han Daxing, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing, is designed to investigate light-induced degradation of
hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a phenomemon which scientists believe is the
major stumbling block to further development of hydrogenated amorphous silicon
solar cells. Such research is important in the continuing search for improved
semiconductor technology. In this project, Dr. Han will measure
photoconductivity spectra after various stages of light soaking and annealing.
The same samples will then be tested at the University of Colorado to determine
the luminescence characteristics. Results will be discussed during reciprocal
visits. This will enable the two scientists to carry out coordinated experiments
on the same samples subjected to similar treatment, an approach which will be
carried out for the first time in these experiments. This project takes
advantage of superior facilities and capabilities on the part of both scientists
and is an international collaboration of great promise to both countries.
