This award supports the research in analytic number theory of Professor Julia
Mueller of Fordham University. Dr. Mueller will be conducting studies in
diophantine approximation over both function fields and number fields. In the
number-field case, she hopes to reformulate Siegel's conjecture so that all the
parameters will be invariant under the special linear group, and thereby to get
much more precise statements on the relationship between the coefficients and
the number of solutions of the equations under consideration. The field of
analytic number theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the
techniques of analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit,
originating in calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the
discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic number
theorists such as Professor Mueller, the field has had a new rebirth.
