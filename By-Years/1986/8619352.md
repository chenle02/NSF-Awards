This award is in support of a program of field measurements of Columbia Glacier,
Alaska, to establish the relationships by which basal water pressure and volume
of water accumulated at the bed influence the basal sliding velocity of the
glacier. Columbia glacier is grounded well below sea level in a fjord;recently
it began retreating rapidly while calving icebergs at an increased rate into
Prince William Sound. It provides a unique opportunity to study the
relationships between fast glacier flow and subglacier water. Dr. Kamb and his
colleagues will measure subglacial water pressure in bore holes drilled to the
bottom of the glacier, and to correlate variations in water pressure with
variations in surface velocity. Surface velocity, water balance, and
meteorological observations will be made simultaneously by Dr. Mark F. Meier and
his colleagues (companion proposal DPP
