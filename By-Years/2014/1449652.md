Development of crop plants that can withstand drought and salt stresses is at
the forefront of plant science-based scientific endeavors. Genetic modification-
based approaches have shown the potential to develop such plants, however,
inherent complications and lack of wide spread acceptability of GMO foods hinder
advancement. A transformative idea would be to regulate environmental stress
responses in crop plants by applying fertilizer-like small compounds. In this
proposal, the team has developed a series of potentially valuable agrichemicals
that should help with drought tolerance, so there could be very substantial
commercial potential for the products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his team
have isolated dozens of small compounds targeting the functional domain of a
well characterized scaffold protein RACK1A in the model plant Arabidopsis. One
of the compounds- SD29 has shown to confer drought/salt stress resistance in the
model plant Arabidopsis. In addition preliminary studies have shown that it
protects under other stress conditions as well. Another compound developed can
enable crop plants to maintain photosynthesis even under environmental stresses
like drought/salt stresses. Considering the global climate change and effort to
increase biomass for biofuel production, the proposed chemical compounds have
great potential to contribute in many economic and environmental fronts. The
successful demonstration of this new RACK1 inhibitors chemical provides safe and
effective protection against damage to crops in drought/salty conditions.
