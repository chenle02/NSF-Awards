The acquisition of a state-of-the-art Image Analysis System has strengthened the
Metallurgical Engineering program at Lafayette College by allowing the
collection, quantification, and analysis of data obtained from a magnified
optical image of materials under investigation, with applications in a variety
of engineering and scientific fields. The system is used in undergraduate
laboratory exercises in metallurgical engineering, in an interdisciplinary
course in analytical methods, and in undergraduate Honors projects in science
and engineering. This project improves undergraduate education in science and
engineering, particularly in the areas of computer acquisition of experimental
data and the statistical analysis of data.
