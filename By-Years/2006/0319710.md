This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to build a
three-dimensional (3D) depth extracting laparoscope that will provide real-time
3D imagery to assist the surgeon. Laparoscopic surgery is performed about 1.8
million times per year. It benefits the patient with reduced trauma and hospital
stays and has lower procedure costs due to quicker recovery. However,
laparoscopic procedures take an additional 20 percent longer when compared to
standard open procedures. This is primarily due to the difficulty in visualizing
the operational area. This project will provide the surgeons with a 3D
visualization tool that will allow them to visualize and immerse themselves
similarly to traditional open cut surgery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and
instrumentation.
