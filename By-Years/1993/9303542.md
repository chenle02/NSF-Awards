This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of Kentucky. His Ph.D.
research was in plant virology. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Clegg at University of
California at Riverside. The proposed research entitled "CaMV-mediated reverse
transcription and encapsidation of heterologous plant RNAs" will broaden the
training of the Fellow into molecular evolution.
