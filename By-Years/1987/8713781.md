The total ozone abundance over Antarctica has decreased dramatically during the
austral spring seasons of the past decade. Total ozone abundances observed in
October, 1986 were only about half as large as those obtained in the late 1960's
and early 1970's. Ozone plays an essential role in the Earth's ecology because
of its absorption of ultraviolet radiation. A great deal of recent research has
been directed towards understanding the cause of the change in the Antarctic
ozone layer. Ground-based visible absorption spectroscopy will be used to
measure the stratospheric column abundances of ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and
clorine dioxide (OClO). This will provide a means of simultaneously measuring
the ozone change and the abundances of both reactive nitrogen and reactive
chlorine species. Possible correlations between simultaneous measurements of the
three constituents are of particular value in distinguishing between proposed
mechanisms of the ozone depletion. Such measurements can be carried out by using
the direct light from the sun or moon (thus providing information on the diurnal
variations of these species) or by measuring the scattered light from the zenith
sky. The planned research consists of an extended series of visible absorption
measurements at McMurdo Station during August, September, and October, 1987.
