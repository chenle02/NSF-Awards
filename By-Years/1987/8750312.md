A laboratory with four Sun Microsystems 3/110L microcomputers and peripherals
will be integrated into the three course sequence in VLSI design. After a course
in semiconductor materials, the students will be introduced to VLSI circuit
design using modern workstations. As part of the laboratory, the students will
design a circuit which will be fabricated at a foundry. Finally, the students
will test their designs using automated test equipment.
