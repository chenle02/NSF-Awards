This research will study public perceptions of possible global climate change.
The goals of the study are to examine the relative importance of changes in
temperature and precipitation and in air pollution for feelings of physical
discomfort, for concerns about the greenhouse effect, and for individuals'
willingness to pay new taxes to prevent certain environmental changes from
becoming reality. The study will use a factorial survey design where respondents
are presented with several hypothetical micro-climate scenarios. The research
will take place in the Los Angeles area. The study will contribute to our
understanding of public perceptions of changes in climate and the environment,
of the public's concern over the greenhouse effect, and of the price it is
willing to pay to prevent certain environmental changes from taking place. The
study will provide very valuable information that can inform the current debate
about the greenhouse effect and the potential increase in mean temperature.
