This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
evaluate a prototype for a novel energy storage system using Pneumatic Energy
Storage with Staged Hydraulic Conversion (PES with SHC). This storage system
will combine compressed air energy storage with a hydraulic system to maximize
energy storage efficiencies.

This work, if successful, will enable mid-range energy storage for use with
renewable energy sources such as wind energy.
