As time spent on design becomes an increasingly significant fraction of the
cost of digital system design, concurrent hardware and software development
through codesign becomes increasingly important. Also, emerging field
programmable logic technologies permit digital system codesigners to easily
migrate system functionality between software and hardware during the design
process. Yet few codesign tools exist currently, and among those there is often
an inverse relation between usability and functionality. They lack interfaces
that fit with designers' ways of working, or they do not integrate with existing
frameworks for chip and program development. We propose to recruit five students
from Spelman College, Jackson State University, and Tuskegee University, all
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and provide them with
support, mentoring, and advising as they pursue courses of study leasing to the
PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Auburn University,
investigating topics in hardware-software codesign interface and tool
development. We can significantly increase not only the supply of codesign
specialists but also the nation's supply of African American computer scientists
by guiding students in investigations of topics in hardware-software codesign
tool and interface development: language development, graphical user interfaces,
algorithms for automatic migration of functionality, inter-tool frameworks, and
formal methods for codesign.
