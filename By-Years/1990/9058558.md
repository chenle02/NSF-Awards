The goal of this research is to develop the tools by which the impact of part
design on manufacturing assembly can be fundamentally understood and continually
improved. To this end, three objectives will be investigated: (1) develop the
physics of part mating, with application to part design for flexible
manufacturing assembly; (2) develop a measurement tool (dexterity) which would
be applied to models of the workholding and handling aspects of the
manufacturing process, analyze handling devices and synthesize assembly systems;
and (3) experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of dexterity as a common
measure of part feature design and manufacturing assembly tasks.
