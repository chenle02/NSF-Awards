Computational simulations and research will be conducted on strongly correlated
electronic systems. Examples of these systems include high temperature
superconductors, heavy Fermion materials and magnetic materials. Quantum Monte
Carlo techniques will be combined with methods of statistical inference to allow
us to simulate the dynamical response of these systems. In addition, methods
which combine quantum Monte Carlo and analytical techniques will be employed.
One objective of the research is to calculate experimentally and theoretically
relevant properties of model systems more accurately than heretofore possible.
Another objective is to explore the non-perturbative regions of these models in
order to predict new physical phenomena. %%% Strongly correlated many-body
systems such as high temperature superconductors and magnetic metals are not
amenable to the usual theoretical techniques such as perturbation theory.
Consequently, because of the absence of analytical methods computational
simulations become increasingly important to understand the physics involved
with these systems. This grant will conduct simulations using a variety of
techniques in order to assess the techniques and to gain insight into the
underlying physics for sample strongly correlated systems.
