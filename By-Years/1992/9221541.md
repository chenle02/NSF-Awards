This action covers three separate tasks for improving the annual Survey of
Industrial Research and Development conducted for NSF by the Bureau of the
Census. Task I is the selection of a new survey sample, Task II is the design,
development, and implementation of new survey processing software, and Task III
is a follow-up telephone survey of nonrespondents to the 1991 survey round which
will provide a more complete understanding of the reasons for nonresponse. NSF
and Census staff have previously identified these areas for improvement. Under
authority granted by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, NSF collects
and disseminates descriptive economic statistics, as well as other pertinent
information, about scientific and technological resource utilization and
activities. Data collected by the Survey of Research and Development in
Industry, when used alone or in combination with data obtained through other NSF
statistical and analytical activities, provides policy makers with an overview
of R&D funding and performance in the United States. The current survey is being
conducted under interagency agreement SRS 92-09661.
