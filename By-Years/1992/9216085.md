This support will allow access for each research and teaching to an important
collection of more than 14,400 vascular plants from North America, northern
South America and the Galapagos. Many of the plants were collected during
surveys of the American west (Grand Canyon) and the southeast, and the important
vouchers for studies of the ecology and feeding behavior of mammals that were
the subject of those surveys. The plants from the Galapagos are a rare
international resource. Incorporation of this collection into the main Herbarium
at the Tulane University will enhance research and teaching activities in
botanical disciplines.
