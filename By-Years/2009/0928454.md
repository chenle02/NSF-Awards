During the last five years, Savannah State University embarked on its most
comprehensive program to date to strengthen science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) education at the University through the implementation of the
Minority Access for Graduate Education and Careers (MAGEC-STEM) program. The
program focused on increased enrollment and enhanced teaching and student
support services. The new MAGEC-STEM Plus Program will further strengthen the
culture of STEM excellence at the University by expanding and deepening our
outreach, teaching, and mentoring activities through the following three
objectives: 1) Curricular Development, Revision and Enhancement Reform, 2)
Expanding Pathways for Undergraduate Recruitment, Enrichment, Retention and
Research Experience, and 3) Strengthening the Faculty Development Activities.
The program results will be disseminated widely to the community through SSU and
program websites and presentations at regional and national/scientific meetings
and publications in scientific journals. This program will advance the mission
of the University through its provision of high quality degree programs in STEM
disciplines that increase the participation of African Americans in higher
education.
