This award will support the methodological training of a cultural
anthropologist in spatial autocorrelation methods. This training will be applied
to an analysis of intersocietal variation in adult male stature. Various
theories explaining male stature as the result of infant stress will be tested
with cross-cultural data. This methodological training activity is important
because it will increase the quantitative sophistication of cultural
anthropology, a field that has been lacking quantitative skills. The research to
be done will also help understand cross-national variation in stature, which has
practical implications for policies which may affect growth.
