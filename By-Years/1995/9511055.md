The sense of smell in mammals generally develops faster than the other senses,
and newborn animals often show responses to odors before hearing or vision are
fully developed. Many senses, including smell, are extremely dependent on early
experience to develop properly. It is not clear how the chemosensory experience
of smell occurs before birth to provide that necessary early experience. This
project uses anatomical techniques to examine the olfactory system during
development, and how anatomical changes occur when various techniques are used
to block odors. Mechanisms for such changes could include sensory deprivation,
deprivation of neural activity, or trophic factors. The novel approach here of
odor restriction allows a direct comparison to results from nose occlusion,
which is the technique usually used. These studies will have an impact on both
chemosensory and developmental neuroscience, and the strong involvement of
undergraduates will have an impact on their careers.
