III-V heterostructure device research for future advanced communications systems
is proposed. A two-prong strategy will be pursued. Evolutionary devices with
sufficiently well established operating principles on InP are targeted.
Considerable technological work is needed before the outstanding electronic
properties of InP-based semiconductors is correctly exploited. Our strategy
relies on bandgap engineering, careful introduction of strain, and monolayer
epitaxial growth. Revolutionary devices will also be investigated with the goal
of synthesizing an entirely new class of "smarter" electronic devices with
enhanced functionality. To this aim, we are studying quantum effects in reduced
dimensionality heterostructures. Our guiding principle is the strong analogy
between photons in guided-wave optics and electrons in one-dimensional (1D)
quantized structures. Our technological effort will be centered around the
fabrication of ballistic quantum wires and coupled quantum wires which are a
test-bed for studying new electron interactions in constricted geometries.
