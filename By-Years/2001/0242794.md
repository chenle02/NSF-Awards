The Spartan Camera is being built by Michigan State University for use on the
2.5 m SOAR telescope in Chile. The Spartan camera will consist of a matrix of
four 2048x2048 detectors covering a field of 5' x 5' at a resolution of 0.16 arc
seconds (or half that field with 0.08 arc second resolution). The Spartan camera
under construction now will only consist of a half-populated detector matrix (2
detectors), with only one of the detectors being science-grade. The requested
grant will be used for partially-matching funds to acquire two more science-
grade detectors for the camera. The majority of the funding for these detectors
will come from the Brazilian SOAR partner. The Spartan camera, once completed
and installed on the SOAR telescope, will enable a variety of near-IR scientific
imaging of targets ranging from Galactic to high-redshift objects. The SOAR
instrument has a broad impact to the astronomical community, as it is a
collaboration between a wide range of U.S. and foreign institutions.
