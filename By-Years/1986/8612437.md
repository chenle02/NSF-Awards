Under the UIG Program, the university proposes industrial instructional
enrichment in robotics and manufacturing systems. Two existing robotics and
manufacturing-oriented courses have been selected as the basis for industrial
enrichment and curriculum development. Two industries have indicated their
intent to participate with the university to develop the instructional materials
and optimize the telecommunicational approaches. The industrial enrichment
emphasizes the practical design and application robots. Specific applications
are aircraft and electronic assembly. The extensive facilities of the North
Texas closed TV educational system is to be incorporated into the program to
transmit to the classroom from the off-campus sites. Other telecommunication
options, such as picture telephone, are to be incorporated.
