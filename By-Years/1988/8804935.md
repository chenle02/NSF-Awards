The Institute of Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(IES-REU) program will immerse eight students in a highly interactive, research-
oriented environment. The program will expose students to the whole context of
research, not just to the procedures of a particular discipline. The philosophy
of the program has four themes: (1) science is a community activity; (2) a
variety of strategies is available to attack scientific problems; (3) all
research has a theoretical context; and (4) all research has a social context.
The students will generate hypotheses, select methods and develop research
designs in collaboration with a mentor. The project options will focus on both
terrestrial and aquatic systems, and provide exposure to a variety of trophic
levels. The program is designed so that students will interact with each other,
the staff of the Education Program, other scientists and students at IES, and
visitors and speakers from the academic and public policy arenas. In this way
the philosophical themes of the program will be woven into each student's
experience. The program will conclude with a day-long symposium given by the
student researchers. An IES Occasional Publication will also be prepared
incorporating the students' final reports.
