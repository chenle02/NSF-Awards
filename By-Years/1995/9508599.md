9508599 Tu An International Conference on Chemical Beam Epitaxy is being held
to address current topics in materials growth and characterization including
several contemporary topics on epitaxy of increasing importance, namely:
Epitaxy, Chemical Precursors; Characterization of films and interfaces. There
are also a number of sessions dealing with physics and device aspects with a
strong emphasis on fundamental processes. Additionally there will be an
opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities,
research institutions, and industry. It is expected that top scientists in the
field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to
discuss and delineate the critical scientific issues in this research area, and
to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them. %%%
An evaluation of the progress and status of Chemical Beam Epitaxy and related
processing, and especially critical materials research issues in epitaxy,
processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and circuit
fabrication along with current assessments of the most important contemporary
research issues in this field will be of great value to the understanding and
enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of electronics and
photonics. ***
