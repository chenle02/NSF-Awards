This award provides funds to the Natural Sciences Division at Pepperdine
University to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The Site
will enhance an already active program of undergraduate research in biology by
teaching students the common elements of the research process and increasing
their appreciation for the diversity of biological subdisciplines. In addition,
the program provides a mechanism whereby students from traditionally under-
represented groups in science will have the opportunity to experience biological
research. The experience will begin with a research orientation workshop at the
Catalina Marine Sciences Center during which students will be immersed in the
research process (literature review, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis
testing) and introduced to the uses and limitations of specific research tools
and techniques. Holding the workshop in this remote location will insure that
students are isolated from their normal routines, enabling them to devote their
full attention to learning the common elements of the research process. After
the orientation workshop, students will pursue individual research projects
under the direction of faculty in either ecology, cellular biochemistry, or
neurobiology. All research projects will be designed to provide students with
insight into how scientists formulated research questions, design experiments,
collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific
community. Over the course of the summer, visiting scientists will hold special
research seminars in each research areas, giving students an opportunity to
discuss their own data with other scientists. Each research group will hold
weekly literature seminars to discuss current journal articles pertaining to
their research interests. The program will conclude with a student research
symposium in early August.
