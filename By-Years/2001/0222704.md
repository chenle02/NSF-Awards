Crownpoint Institute of Technology seeks to broaden the current curriculum with
increased emphasis on the quality of its instructional and outreach programs in
STEM. The outcome of the project will be a comprehensive study and potential
impact assessment of how increased investment in STEM can attract more Navajo
students into these fields of study, identification of professional needs of
faculty, as well as how these actions will potentially effect the economic
status and quality of life of the peoples of the Navajo
Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the project are to increase
STEM resources to allow faculty to encourage and mentor students in scientific
study and research, and to develop avenues for students to return to their
homelands and help their own people, thus completing the circle of their
journey.&lt;br/&gt;
