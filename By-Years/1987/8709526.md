Although the disciplines of immunobiology and parasitology have always been
closely aligned, only within the last 20 years have parasitologists started to
address fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms of immune interaction
between parasites and their hosts. Mammals, in particular mice, rats, non.human
primates and humans, have predominated as the host systems of choice for
immunoparasitological studies, and the resulting research has produced many
basic discoveries new to the immunological world. However, the successful
integration of these two disciplines has come only through the recognition ofthe
potential for creating new information from investigating the immunology of
parasite-host systems, and a willingness of both immunologists and
parasitologists to collaborate actively in their research efforts. The purpose
of the symposium, "Phylogeny of Immune Defense Mechanisms in Parasitic
Infections," is to encourage an expansion of this collaborative interaction
between comparative immunologists working with a diversity of animal species,
from mammals to invertebrates, and immunoparasitologists investigating similar
host species. Invited speakers will review the current knowledge of parasite
immunity in hosts representing a variety of animal phyla, will compare and
contrast responses of a variety of hosts to different parasites, and identify
areas and questions in need of further study. Although the symposium is oriented
primarily towards individuals with interests in immunobiology and/or
parasitology, it should have broad appeal to those interested in invertebrate
biology, cell biology, and biochemistry since many of the immunoparasitological
problems to be discussed are amenable to interdisciplinary approaches. Student
interaction will be strongly encouraged through a contributed paper session
following the theme of the symposium.
