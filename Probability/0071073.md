This project is centered on connections between long range dependence and heavy
tails. The primary application areas are data networks, finance, actuarial
research and industrial engineering. The project includes a consideration of
statistical issues related to detection of long range dependence, self-
similarity and multifractality as well as fundamental issues of basic concepts
being inadequately defined. For instance, long range dependence is often defined
in terms of correlations but these may be either undefined due to the presence
of heavy tails or for non-Gaussian processes rather uninformative. Our society
is a fast moving and changing one, with ever increasing amounts of information
being moved from one end of the country to the other. Dramatic technological and
scientific advances are, often, day-to-day phenomena. The stock market is very
volatile. The Internet and other communication networks are susceptible to
overloads and delays and because of their crucial role in our economic and
public life, one needs to be concerned with their performance. Appropriate
models are required to make sense of these wildly oscillating processes. This
project is centered on models appropriate to understanding and controlling these
phenomena-- models with heavy tails and/or long range dependence.
