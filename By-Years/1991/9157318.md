Studies will be focused on two areas. In one area, Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance (EPR) will be used to probe protein interactions in engineering (i.e.
manufacturing) environments. Protein folding, aggregation, and conformational
dynamics will be studied. In the other area, EPR measurement of free-radical
reactions in supercritical fluids will provide fundamental information on
supercritical fluid solvent effects.
