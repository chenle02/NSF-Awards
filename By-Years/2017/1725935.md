An award is made to Brown University to build a new animal flight and
aeromechanics wind tunnel. In addition to facilitating conventional aerodynamic
experiments, the wind tunnel will be configured for testing of birds, bats, and
other flying and gliding animals and will enable new insights into animal flight
and bio-inspired flight robotics. The wind tunnel facility will be made
available to researchers interested in animal flight, fluid mechanics and
related topics throughout and outside the US. Researchers from diverse
communities including major research universities, undergraduate teaching
colleges, and private and public institutions, will be encouraged to participate
in research programs using the new wind tunnel and its associated
instrumentation. Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate
students will receive training that uses the wind tunnel facility. The facility
will be used to host multi-university workshops and symposia on biological
aerodynamics and control, and in the use of advanced measurement
diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists at Brown are leaders in the study
of biological flight and have pioneered many experiments in this field. With the
development of advanced diagnostics - high-speed videography, particle image
velocimetry, animal-mounted data logging and transmission, etc. - animal flight
research has become an area of intense research among biologists, bio-inspired
roboticists, and other scientists and engineers. These groups use advanced
diagnostic tools to better understand the kinematics, mechanics and dynamics of
biological flight and diverse aspects of flight physiology; the results of these
studies shed light on the ecology and evolution of life on the wing, and inspire
novel engineering designs. The new wind tunnel will permit animal flight
scientists throughout and beyond the US to work with a diversity of animal
subjects and to employ sophisticated experimental techniques in the study of
biomechanics, animal flight and bio-inspired robotics, and will facilitate
ongoing and new collaborations among students and faculty. It will enable
advanced measurement of kinematics and dynamics of animal fight, muscle
function, echolocation, sensing and control during flight. In addition to
biological testing, the wind tunnel will be used by a broad and diverse
community of researchers in engineering fluid mechanics and aerodynamics
research, allowing for transformative experiments in fundamental fluid
mechanics, aerodynamics, fluid-structure interactions and energy systems.
