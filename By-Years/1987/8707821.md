The formation of a deposit or film on the surface of heat exchange devices
reduces the rate of heat transfer and, correspondingly, the efficiency. The
negative impact of the fouling amounts to billions of dollars per year. To
control fouling, its root causes must be understood. The present proposal seeks
to understand the causes of biofouling. The relationship between biofilm
thickness, pressure drop, and heat transfer in a circular tube will be
investigated. The use of sensors to detect the degree of fouling will be
explored.
