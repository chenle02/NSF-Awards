Lengsfeld&lt;br/&gt;0433810&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was an
unsolicited submission. This proposal aims to develop a new methodology to
prepare gene therapy vectors by an electrostatic co-extrusion (ECE) process.
This process would make it possible to encapsulate DNA using charge-neutral
bilayers, potentially reducing the cytotoxicity of the vectors and improving the
bioavailability of the DNA by not having a strong attachment of lipid to the
DNA. Importantly, the encapsulation would be performed with very little loss of
DNA, giving ECE a major advantage over pressure extrusion or other liposome
preparation methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this research are
to: (1) demonstrate the ability of electrostatic co-extrusion to efficiently
encapsulate naked plasmid DNA, DNA condensates, and siRNA within bilayers of
varied lipid composition, (2) characterize vectors created by electrostatic co-
extrusion to classical techniques through the assessment of homogeneity and
range in size, zeta potential, and DNA content, (3) quantify and optimize DNase
resistance, serum stability, and in vitro transfection rates of vectors produced
by electrostatic co-extrusion, and (4) investigate approaches that would allow
this technique to be scaled up for bulk manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;
