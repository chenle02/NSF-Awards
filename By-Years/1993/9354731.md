9354731 Thiel Molecular biology and biochemistry are the basis for biotechnology
which is radically changing medicine, forensics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture,
and agricultural products. This project, therefore, systematically integrates
biotechnology into the undergraduate biology curriculum; and will educate all
biology students, including future biology and science teachers, in the concepts
and techniques of biotechnology. Implementation will require major revision of a
two-semester introductory biology course, as well as undergraduate genetics and
biochemistry. Key concepts are introduced early in the curriculum, are
reinforced and expanded slowly as the student advances, and are taught in
different contexts relevant to a specific discipline. Students also work in
teams, share information and cooperate in solving problems. It is also expected
that this type of integrated program will be useful to others, in particular
departments and institutions that plan to offer a technologically relevant
education.
