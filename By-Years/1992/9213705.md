The goal of this research and development project is to promote the basic
understanding of both the instability behavior and the material failure
characters of J-stiffened composite panels manufactured by newly developed
stitching and resin film infusion technique. In general, analytical solutions
cannot be obtained for the large deflections associated with postbuckled
structures. In order to predict stiffened panel behavior after initial buckling
and the ultimate compressive strength of stiffeners, semiemprical techniques
have to be utilized. Failure of composite stiffened panels due to stiffener/web
separation is a common mode of failure in the postbuckling range. It is
extremely difficult to predict this failure, even by using rather sophisticated
analysis methods. In addition, due to the use of advance composite materials,
two types of damage propagation must be considered: 1)delaminations in laminates
under compressive loading; 2) through-the-thickness cracks in laminate in
tension.
