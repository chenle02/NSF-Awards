This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
remote radio frequency (RF) measurements for critical monitoring of fuel
pipelines for failures. This novel application of RF measurements uses the pipe
as a RF transmission line, and antennas launch radar pulses that travel inside
the pipe, without disturbing the transported fluid. Pulses reflect-off
obstructions/breaches in the pipe and are measured by distributed low-cost GPS
receivers to locate the fault.

The outcome of this research will lead to a marketable product, which when
implemented by pipeline corporations, can save millions of dollars annually in
pipeline spills and advert potential loss of life and property. Further, the
development of this technology supports the current US homeland security
initiative to protect valuable assets against overt acts of vandalism and/or
terrorism.
