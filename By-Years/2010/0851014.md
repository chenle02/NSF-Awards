This project uses laboratory economics experiments to explore the relationship
between one?s birth order and risk preferences as well as the relationship
between risk preferences and risk-taking behavior outside of the laboratory. The
research team will collect demographic information on family structure and
participation in certain risky behaviors including heavy alcohol use, cigarette
smoking, marijuana use, and unprotected sexual activity. The research will
explore if risk preferences vary between respondents of different birth orders
as well as the strength of the relationship between risk preferences measured in
the laboratory and risk-taking behavior in a natural
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these experiments have significant
policy implications. Risky teenage behavior costs society billions of dollars
every year in current and future medical costs, law enforcement costs, and lost
productivity. Recognizing factors that may lead to substance use initiation and
escalation during the teenage years or certain subpopulations that may be at
greater risk for early initiation of risky behavior has important implications
for the design of successful prevention and treatment programs. &lt;br/&gt;
