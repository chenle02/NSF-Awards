This grant provides matching funds for a preparative ultracentrifuge and three
rotors to be primarily used for research by Dr. Vijayakumar in his studies of a
unique transposon discovered in Streptococcus pneumoniae that is able to induce
conjugation in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The equipment will
be shared with several other investigators in the Department of Botany and
Microbiology and be used occasionally in a course on advanced microbial genetics
that is being developed.
