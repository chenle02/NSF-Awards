This project provides thirty scholarships to academically talented financial
needy sophomore students majoring in electrical, civil and industrial
engineering. Students are selected based on grade point average and strength of
essays and recommendation letters. The motivations of the student and career
goals are also important factors.

The project centers on building a community of engineering scholars using
faculty mentors and other support mechanisms. The engineering Student Work
Employment office plays a significant role by coordinating efforts with partners
in industries and government for summer internship opportunities, career
placement and seminar development, which are designed to enhance career or
higher education placement. Faculty members in the students' disciplines mentor
the scholars throughout the duration of the program. The mentorship program is
expected to be a major component of the project, building students' confidence
and enhancing students' learning. Professional development is also an important
part of the program, where students attend professional meetings or professional
development workshops.
