9400019 Narum This award to the Independent Colleges Office makes possible a
series of seminars and workshops on undergraduate science facilities. The goals
are to: 1) equip institutional teams from predominantly undergraduate
institutions to prepare competitive proposals to the NSF, and to other funding
agencies, public and private, for their science facilities modernization
projects; and 2) support the process of facilities modernization, so that the
science, mathematics and engineering programs for undergraduate students on
those campuses are strengthened. With full participation from the United Negro
College Fund, this series of workshops and seminars also seeks to incorporate
the needs of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, thus paying attention
to scientific workforce diversity issues. This project is important since it
seeks to include small colleges into the mainstream of rebuilding their research
and research training infrastructure. This is of great significance to this
country since these are the institutions from which a high percentage of
Americans emerge and go on to become our scientists and engineers.
