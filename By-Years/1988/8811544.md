Lead, lanthanum, zirconate, and titanate, in a broad range of compositions,
combine to form a transparent ferroelectric ceramic referred to as PLZT. the
optical transparency and electrooptic properties of PLZT materials make them
useful for a variety of electronic devices and advantageous over competing
technologies. They have yet to be used on a large commercial scale due to high
operating voltages required for switching. The approach taken in this research
is to use a PLZT target to sputter deposit onto a transparent substrate while
controlling the variables of substrate temperature, substrate bias, target
composition, and chamber pressure. By varying these factors, the end result is a
transparent ferroelectric ceramic with certain intrinsic stress, morphology, and
grain structure which ultimately affect the threshold of the switching voltage.
The PLZT thin films that will result have application in electrooptic devices
for spatial light modulators, image storage devices reflective displays,
filters, and linear gate arrays.
