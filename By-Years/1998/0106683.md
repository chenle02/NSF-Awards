Brown &lt;br/&gt;0106683 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic studies of Earth's solid
inner core indicate that the inner core &lt;br/&gt;is elastically anisotropic
and inhomogeneous, and that the apparent axis &lt;br/&gt;of inner core
anisotropy may rotate differentially from Earth's mantle. In &lt;br/&gt;order to
fully interpret these data, information is needed on shear wave
&lt;br/&gt;propagation through dense, high-pressure metals, particularly iron.
For &lt;br/&gt;most candidate lower mantle constituents the bulk moduli, as
functions of &lt;br/&gt;pressure, are reasonably well constrained by experiment;
less, however, is &lt;br/&gt;known about the behavior of the shear modulus.
Efforts to understand both &lt;br/&gt;radial and lateral variation of seismic
velocities in the lower mantle are &lt;br/&gt;limited by the remaining
uncertainty in the pressure and temperature &lt;br/&gt;dependence of the shear
elastic constants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the technique of Impulsive
Stimulated Scattering, interfacial waves &lt;br/&gt;can be generated between the
suface of an opaque sample in the &lt;br/&gt;high-pressure diamond-anvil cell
and the surrounding pressure medium. The &lt;br/&gt;velocities of these waves,
which are particularly sensitive to the shear &lt;br/&gt;elastic constants, are
then determined. Specific goals &lt;br/&gt;include: (1) determination of full
tensorial elastic and thermal &lt;br/&gt;properties of iron, iron alloys, and
other metals at high pressures and &lt;br/&gt;(2) determination of isotropic
elastic shear moduli at very high pressure &lt;br/&gt;of synthesized,
polycrystalline, lower mantle phases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
