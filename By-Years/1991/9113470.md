Human dermal fibroblasts constitute a suitable system to study growth
regulation. These cells alternate between states of proliferation and quiescence
under the control of growth factors, hormones, and extracellular matrix proteins
elaborated by the fibroblasts. Complex interconnected pathways transmit these
extracellular signals to growth processes in the cell. The objective of this
proposal is to elucidate this signal transduction network. A mutant cell type
derived from benign dermal tumors, keloids, will be used to help unravel the
regulatory network. The keloid mutation modifies growth regulation by phorbol
esters, prostaglandins and transforming growth factor beta, substances that may
act as positive or negative effectors of growth. Signal transduction pathways of
these regulators are incompletely understood; however, several important
intracellular messengers have been implicated. Methods to be used include
measurements of prostaglandin synthesis, prostaglandin receptors, and
intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, Ca2+ and inositol phosphates after
exposure of normal and keloid cells to effectors that differentially regulate
DNA synthesis in these cell types. The temporal pattern of signal transduction
intermediates in normal and keloid cells should reveal the signalling pathways
of these regulators and may clarify the complex interactions that coordinate and
modulate growth-associated activities. Three minority graduate students will
participate in the research with three researchers in the Microbiology
Department at Meharry Medical College.
