The research investigates the specific aspects of algal food quality that
affect feeding and fecundity of herbivores. While the physiological condition of
the algae is a critical factor influencing ingestion rates and reproduction,
biochemical components of the algae are frequently not characterized or
controlled. To test the hypothesis that the major cellular constituents of algae
vary with different limiting resources (N,P, Si, light), the PIs will assess
patterns of biochemical components over a range of growth rates in three species
of algae grown in continuous cultures, under various resource limitations. To
test whether algal biochemical composition affects the feeding and reproductive
rates of herbivores, the PIs will measure fecundity of Daphnia pulicaria with
the various diets. To assess if seasonal variation in lipid production reflects
changes in the quality of phytoplankton, the PIs will monitor seasonal
fluctuations of lipids in algae and zooplankton in three lakes across a trophic
gradient. Food quality in aquatic ecosystems is highly dynamic. The aim is to
identify the general patterns of accommodation of algae and herbivores to the
variable resource base.
