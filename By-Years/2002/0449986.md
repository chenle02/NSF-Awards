CAREER: THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF EXTRASOLAR PLANETS

ABSTRACT

AST 0449986 Gregory Laughlin

Dr. Gregory Laughlin, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will
undertake a theoretical and observational program to better understand the
properties of planets around other stars. He will develop techniques to mine
existing databases, in order to identify chemically abundant, nearby stars that
are likely to harbor these so-called "extrasolar planets". Following that,
spectroscopic observations will be undertaken to confirm the chemical abundances
of the stars. Short-term and long-term radial velocity monitoring of the stars
will then allow for the detection of planets. Finally, refined modeling of the
properties of the planets will follow.

As part of his CAREER related efforts, Dr. Laughlin will integrate his research
with public education by means of an exploration driven interface for a
distributed computer network. This will allow the public to not only process
data, but also to investigate the properties of hypothetical planetary systems
by comparing them to actual data. The research will also involve undergraduate
and graduate students.
