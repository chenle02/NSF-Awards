With the rise of modern science in the 16th and 17th centuries, both scientists
themselves and the general public have turned to science to provide solutions to
the problems which confront us. Sir Francis Bacon, the most famous of the early
propagandists for science wrote of a scientific utopia, a "New Atlantis" in
which men and women, freed from sickness, ignorance, and the need to do hard
physical labor, could engage in intellectual pursuits deemed appropriate for our
stature, somewhere between the animals and the angels. This ideology has
permeated the scientific tradition. It's contemporary manifestation can be seen
in the eugenic movements and genetic engineering--i.e. the drive to use science
and technology to create the perfect human. Human genetic research has
discovered the genes which cause a number of human disorders while reproductive
technologies like prenatal testing, in vitro fertilization or fetal therapy
allow a mother to strive for the perfect child. Dr. Rothschild, under this
research grant, is examining the historical and conceptual framework which
underpins eugenics and genetic engineering. She is tracing a secularized belief
in human perfectibility, linked to beliefs in science and the idea of progress.
These beliefs in both science and human perfectibility developed from a 17th and
18th century ideal to becoming an integral part of 19th and 20th century
evolutionary and eugenic ideology. During this grant, Dr. Rothschild is
developing the framework and the idea of the "perfect man" that emerges from it.
This will form the foundation of her study of the relationship of the "perfect
child"--the modern image of human perfectibility--and the new reproductive
technologies that are shaping the image and making it possible. By focussing on
human perfectibility and its interplay with science and technology in both
historical and contemporary context, this research brings to light an important
by neglected element in the growing debates on the meaning and impact of the new
reproductive technologies for procreative norms and choices.
