An Engineering Research Equipment award will allow the purchase of a pulsed
holographic Ruby laser for a three-dimensional focused Schlieren systems. The
development of this research equipment will further research in the area of
shock-boundary layer and shock- vortex interactions ongoing at the
investigator's institution. These interactions occur at the high velocities
encountered in rapid flight, and play a role in the design of high-speed
aerospace vehicles.
