This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program suppports
research jointly directed by Professors S. P. McManus and J. M. Harris, at the
University of Alabama at Huntsville. This experimental work is directed at
evaluating theories of solvent effects on ionic reactions of organic chemicals
in solution. Since the large majority of chemical reactions used in the
laboratory and in the chemical industry are carried out in the solution phase,
this work is important for maximizing yields of chemical processes and for
optimizing reaction conditions. Specifically, the solvatochromic theory of
Kamlet, Taft, and coworkers and the empirical approach to reactivity developed
by Swain and others will be tested and compared by studying reactions with known
solvation requirements. Application of rate data to the equations proposed by
Kamlet-Taft and by Swain will be used to assess the success of these methods to
treat rate data for a variety of reaction types. This will be the first
independent experimental program aimed at evaluation of these two solvation
theories.
