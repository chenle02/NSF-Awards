The research work will concern mathematical and numerical aspects of
semiconductor manufacturing, specifically to work on problems of microstructural
reliability, including aspects of electromigration and chemical mechanical
polishing. The work will be combination of mathematical modeling to produce
reasonable physical models, complete with appropriate boundary conditions and
internal dynamics, and numerical algorithms, in part relying on algorithms for
surface evolution and elliptic solvers in irregular domains. The goal will be
numerical simulations and comparisons with experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
L. Borucki from Motorola Corporation will take this Senior Research Fellowship
in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California- Berkeley. This
GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
