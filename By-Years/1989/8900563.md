This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the
discipline of chemistry and the subfield of photochemistry. For a three year
period, beginning April 1989, nine (9) undergraduate students will spend ten
(10) weeks engaged in basic research with eight (8) faculty members in the
Center for Photochemical Sciences at Bowling Green State University. A unique
feature of this REU site is its close coupling of industry (Mead Imaging) and
academia (Bowling Green), thereby providing an opportunity for undergraduate
students to sense what research careers can provide. Research projects thus
range from investigating the fundamental physics of the absorption or emission
of radiation to describing the chemical and biological changes in a tumor cell
caused by light absorption by a photosensitizing molecule. American industry
depends heavily on the photochemical sciences. Photography, xerography,
solventless printing, and the manufacture of photovoltaic cells are four
examples of the many technological applications of photochemical science that
can be cited.
