A novel but technologically demonstrated Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) is
applied to 630 nm observations. These observations bring the order-of-magnitude
sensitivity required to untangle the long-standing mystery of the thermospheric
dynamics producing the midnight temperature maximum (MTM). The Fabry-Perot is
first fielded at the Arecibo Observatory to simultaneously apply the nested
diagnostics of the incoherent scatter radar and all-sky imaging to resolution of
the MTM dynamical source. Subsequently, the instrument is moved to Argentina to
fill a gap in the growing chain of optical instruments for aeronomy research in
South America.
