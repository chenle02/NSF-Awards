9550126 Wilson This project provides funds for part of one staff member and some
other expenses to bring together stakeholders in Maine's efforts to incorporate
global change education in schools. The central thrust of the grant is to
capitalize on the concern for environment issues in Maine and assure that global
change concepts will be part of the ongoing restructuring and curriculum
revision. Under this grant, the project team will determine the current state of
environmental education in the state, examine how the state frameworks and
national Goals 200 can be supported by this initiative, develop an agenda for
environmental education, recommend an advocate for environmental education, and
heighten awareness. Cost sharing other than waiving indirect costs are not
included.
