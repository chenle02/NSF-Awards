9311888 Petrosian The primary goal of this project is to understand the energy
release and particle acceleration mechanisms in solar flares. It is believed
that the source of energy of flares is the current carrying magnetic field and
that the bulk of this energy goes into the acceleration of particles. Most
direct information on these processes comes from microwave, hard X-ray and
gamma-ray observations of the impulsive phase of flares, and it is through
comparison of these observations with theoretical results that insight can be
gained into this important problem. In the theoretical aspect of this project
the goal is to improve the treatment of the acceleration process and unify it
with the transport and radiative aspects. The model results will be compared
with spectral data from solar flares obtained by several spacecraft. The results
from this project will not only be important in the understanding of the flare
problem, but will be useful in other areas of high energy astrophysics, such as
magnetospheric phenomena around planets and compact stars and in the nuclei of
active galaxies. ***
