This renewal aims to develop sensitive and selective chemical sensors for
potential applications in environmental monitoring, automated manufacturing
processes and medical monitoring. The collaborative project involves two PI's,
one at the University of New Mexico, and the other at Sandia National
Laboratories, in an effort to synthesize and characterize new thin films with
molecular recognition capabilities. Three different synthetic approaches will be
explored: (i) Zeolite-glass microcomposites; (ii) thin-films with template
controlled porosity; and (iii) surface crystallized channel structures. This
work is part of the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative, and
it is jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials
Research.
