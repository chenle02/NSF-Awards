This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Prem K. Goel of Ohio
State University and Professor Chandra M. Gulati, University of Wollongong,
Australia. This research is to develop a mathematical model and mathematically
optimal solutions to decision making problems involving more than one decision
maker. The goal is to develop the optimal decision stopping strategy in which
rewards to participants of stopping decision-making outweigh the utility to be
achieved from continued negotiation. The project represents excellent
collaboration between the world-class statistics community in Australia and the
Goel work in applications of statistics and probability theory to real-world
negotiations. This is important fundamental work in the foundations of
statistics, as well as having potential for major advances in understanding and
improving team decision-making.
