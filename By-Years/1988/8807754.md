This project will consist of the modification of solid surfaces by alkali metal
overlayers. The project focuses on investigating the electronic promotion of
surface chemical reactions and the modifications of the electronic structure of
several technologically important semiconductors by alkali overlayers.
Experimentally, the project is based on the well proven technique of
photoemission spectroscopy using the soft x-ray spectrum provided by the new
high brilliance 1 GeV electron storage ring at the Synchrotron Radiation Center
of the University of Wisconsin.
