This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment consists of workstations, printers and an array processor. The
equipment will be used in several projects including stability and bifurcation
problems in fluid dynamics, exchange of stabilities in conservative systems, and
numerical computation and simulation of large-scale collective effects in
neutral networks.
