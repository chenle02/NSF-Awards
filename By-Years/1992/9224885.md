This project will examine the relationship between mother's schooling and child
rearing styles in Mitontic, a rapidly modernizing rural highland Maya community
in Chiapas, Mexico. In particular, researchers will examine the proposition that
mother's schooling affects social identity, parental investment strategies, and
conceptions of personal development and interpersonal relations creating great
differences in the environments infants experience. This project will provide a
detailed account of early individual development in a sample of 25 Mayan infants
and explore their mother's child care style as a function of sociocultural
conditions (especially mother's schooling and cultural conceptions of child
rearing) and a child's individual characteristics (e.g., gender, health, and
birth order). In addition to intensive ethnographic research on child rearing
practices in Mitontic, mother-infant interaction will be videotaped on a
bimonthly schedule and biweekly interviews with the mothers will be conducted
from birth onwards in a longitudinal study of the first two years of life.
