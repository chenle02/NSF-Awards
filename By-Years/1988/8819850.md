The proposed research is to study a variety of quasiperiodic, hierarchical and
complex systems with competing lengths, with main emphasis being the study of
various transitions which occur in these systems. The concepts and tools of
nonlinear dynamics will be used in understanding and characterizing the exotic
behavior underlying these transitions. The major areas of investigation are:
understanding and characterizing the long range order in spin systems such as
quasiperiodic Fibonacci chains, Thue-Morse chains, hierarchical spin systems
with ultrametric topology; spin, electron and phonon systems exhibiting cascades
of transitions with fractal phase boundaries and quasiperiodic transitions to
chaos in discrete maps.
