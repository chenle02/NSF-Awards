The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program
provides support to design, implement, study and assess efforts to increase the
numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research.
This project at Howard University provides a strategic approach to infuse
courses and research with interactive, human-centered computing elements to
engage and excite students about computer science with the goal to increase the
number of computer science graduates. Undergraduate students are involved in
this project as researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year pilot project
seeks to redesign the Introduction to Game Design course and Introduction to
Human-Computer Interaction course in the computer science undergraduate
curriculum with learning modules in mixed reality, including virtual reality and
augmented reality; along with user experience design and fundamentals of human-
computer interaction. These courses will give students exposure to interactive
computing elements using active, project-based learning. The project will study
the efficacy of this intervention using qualitative and quantitative measures.
The project will be guided by formative and summative
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Division of
Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
