Embedded databases are ubiquitous, though that fact may not be widely-
recognized. Every smart phone has many embedded databases, which implies that
billions of people worldwide carry dozens of databases in their phones/pockets
every day. Many of these databases are powered by data processing technology
that has not kept up with the pace with which the underling hardware in phones
have evolved. As a result, data processing is slow, and consumes more energy
than needed. The focus of this proposal is on developing new data processing
technology for mobile devices that targets a 10X efficiency and performance
improvements. The aims of the project go beyond more efficient data processing
on phones to also include more efficient processing in embedded environments,
which also includes databases running on laptops. Thus, the project aims for a
broad impact on database across a spectrum of mobile
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical contributions of this project are in
recognizing that modern hardware, even at the ?low-end? which includes mobile
phones and laptops, now have multiple processing cores, relatively large amounts
of memory, and flash storage. There is a critical need for a new class of
embedded data processing systems that can work efficiently, and effectively on
such modern mobile platforms. This project aims to build a system, called
Hustle, to address this need. The project will design, develop and implement a
range of data processing methods, which include predicate-based concurrency
control mechanisms, query processing methods that inherently expose and exploit
opportunities for intra and inter-operator parallelism, and query optimization
methods that target embedded settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
