Professor Roger Leblanc of the University of Miami is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to utilize a two-dimensional
combinatorial chemistry technique to produce novel bioactive surfaces. The idea
is to utilize engineered peptide lipids spread at an air/water interface. In
project one, it is considered that if enough combinations of these species are
present, there should on average be aligned peptide sections that mimic active
sites of actual enzymes. The first target is Acetylcholinesterase. In the second
project, the aggregation of beta-amyloid in two dimensions will be explored. New
molecules that act as beta-sheet breakers will be sought. A third project is to
study peptide-capped fluorescent quantum dots as possible optical biosensors.
Monolayer techniques, FTIR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy will be used in the studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
lies in the areas of molecular recognition, signaling and biosensors. Studying
amyloid protein aggregation and understanding its precise mechanism will enable
rational design of beta-sheet breakers that are putative drugs for preventing
Alzheimer's disease. Many of the applications of nanoparticles have been held
back due to stability issues in aqueous environments, and the approaches here
could serve to lengthen lifetimes and ruggedness of designed particles. In
addition, underrepresented minority students are included within summer
experiences at this Hispanic Serving Institute.&lt;br/&gt;
