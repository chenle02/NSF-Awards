This award will support Professor Lithwick of Northwestern University to further
develop novel techniques that combine analytical formulae with statistical
techniques to independently measure important physical and orbital properties of
Kepler planets from their Transit Timing Variations (TTV). These results will be
used to answer questions such as how planet density and orbital parameters
depend on spacing, multiplicity, orbital period, metallicity, etc. These results
will enable more detailed theoretical studies to understand how systems with
multiple Earth to Neptune sized planets in orbits closer than Mercury's are
formed. The principal tool will be N-body simulations of the build up of planets
by accretion in which damping by a gas disk is indirectly accounted for. The
procedure will be guided where possible by analytical theory, and the resulting
distributions of planet and orbital properties will be constrained by Kepler
TTV's. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work to be carried out under this award will
provide measurements the mass and orbital properties of a large number of
planetary systems. The PI will then be able to model the formation of these
systems to better understand why our own planetary system is so different from
the vast majority discovered with Kepler. In his approach to an integrated
research and education plan, Professor Lithwick will take advantage of the broad
appeal of exoplanets to develop and introduce computer modeling into the science
curriculum at Chicago-area high schools. He will primarily develop and share
tools and curriculum materials through workshops for high school teachers, who
will then work with student doing independent projects involving computer
modeling of exoplanets. The PI will consult with the teacher-student teams and
visit each school. He will also organize a one-day symposium for students to
present their results.
