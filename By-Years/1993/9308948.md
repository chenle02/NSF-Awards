9308948 Murphy The goal of this research project is to understand how passive
and active constraints contribute to the control of the motion of the knee. A
mathematical model based on geometric parameters will be developed and used to
determine the roles of the different components of the knee in the kinematics.
The model will also be used to determine the significance of the geometry of the
joint and how the geometry affects movement. The model that will be developed
could be important in formulating rehabilitation programs, for determining the
response of the knee to clinical procedures, and for improving the design and
implantation of joint prostheses. ***
