*** ABSTRACT 9661475 Kostrzewski This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a unique anticounterfeiting method based on optical
correlation techniques whose large number of degrees of freedom will ensure
extremely high confidence. The proposed methodology uses high density phase
encoded labels with 10^30 code possibilities and is an extension of existing
optical correlation technology for label verification. Using phase encoding for
label verification poses a significant challenge because labels may be presented
for verification with unpredictable scale, shift, and rotation. During Phase I,
research will be conducted to develop scale, translation, and rotation invariant
phase codes together with a flexible reading/processing head that will allow
unrestricted placement of labels during the verification process. Scanning or
replicating of phase labels will be impossible because of the high optical
density of the phase information. An additional feature of the proposed phase
encoded labeling is its compatibility with a variety of substrates, including
thin foil and plastic in both reflection and transmission modes of operation.
Research conducted during Phase I will develop a new tool to fight counterfeit
crime. Phase encoded labeling can applied to many security applications like
limited access security, ID cards, credit card verification, product label
verification systems, and medical records. The production cost of such labels
will be in the range of just a few cents per label. ***
