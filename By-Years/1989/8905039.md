Emphasis on the interplay between partial differential equations and the theory
of several complex variables will be the main theme of this mathematical
research project. Work will be done on the study of regularity and existence of
solutions of differential equations which reflect the boundary behavior of
holomorphic mappings, on local and global embedding theorems for Cauchy-Riemann
manifolds, studies of holomorphic functions with smooth boundary values and on
the structure of hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. This work, much of it
continuing, leads to the study of geometrical objects such as local and global
invariants of manifolds with boundary, foliations by complex varieties and
envelopes of holomorphy. The most pressing problem at this time is that of
obtaining Holder estimates for solutions of the d-bar Neumann problem for weakly
pseudoconvex domains of finite type and the corresponding estimates for the
corresponding operator on CR manifolds. A major step was taken in this direction
recently when the estimates were established in two complex dimensions. The
generalization to higher dimensions has received considerable attention, but no
breakthrough has yet appeared. Work will proceed by first considering domains in
three or more dimensions whose Levi form has at most one degenerate eigenvalue
and then moving to those where the form is diagonalizable. Another line of
investigation will pursue questions concerned with linear differential operators
having simple and double characteristics. The object of this work is to
determine conditions on overdetermined systems which imply that the operator is
hypoelliptic. The terminology means simply that the solution of any
inhomogeneous equation is at least as smooth as that of the inhomogeneous part
of the equation.
