The PI plans to study the tropical convective systems and their impact on the
forcing of tropospheric and mesospheric circulation patterns by utilizing
satellite data bases in conjunction with data obtained from wind profiles. She
will also examine the relationships between satellite derived measurements of
atmospheric water vapor and vertical wind profiles measured by the radars in the
tropics in order to provide insight into the dynamics of vertical energy fluxes
which couple the energy from the source regions to other heights. She also plans
to obtain the statistics of cloud composites associated with convection in order
to force a model of an atmosphere on a rotating sphere to establish the mode
structures in the wind field that will be present in the troposphere,
stratosphere, and mesosphere. The model-generated mode structures will be
compared with the radar observed mesospheric structures of the diurnal tide,
quasi two-day wave, and other longer period wave motions. Additionally, the PI
plans to gain expertise in two other atmospheric radar probing techniques, the
MF/HF radar and the 1 GHz boundary layer radar.
