The project will support rapid follow-up observations of gamma ray bursts using
the U.S. Air Force's Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope on Maui.
The PI will use an auxiliary camera (the AEOS Burst Camera, or ABC) mounted on
the rapidly-slewing AEOS telescope to provide timely (1-5 min) follow-up
observations of bursts detected with, for example, NASA's Swift satellite. ABC
was constructed by the principal investigator as part of a previous award, and
the current award will provide the opportunity for a graduate student to make
use of the camera for thesis work, and also includes participation by an
undergraduate student.
