0218634&lt;br/&gt;Ghiorso&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Information Technology
Research Program grant supports the development of a distributed computing
infrastructure in computational petrology. The computational model calls for the
development of highly optimized and rigorously tested server code that will be
built to perform basic level phase property/stability calculations. This code
will be published as an Application Programming Interface (API) and distributed
via a CORBA IDL to client machines on the Internet. Remote users will access the
server in one of two ways: either as remote procedure calls from user written
clients, or by downloading clients developed in conjunction with the server code
effort that are designed to solve specific problems. Clients will be written to
address the needs of both the research and the teaching community. Extensive
documentation and tutorials will be produced.
