Alfven wave chaos is examined in two related studies. The first effort examines
the driven Burgers equation, which has only one kind of shock wave, and is
easier to solve than the more complex DLNSB equation. Using this equation it is
possible to examine the essential dependencies of the onset of chaos on the
number of harmonics and their growth rates. The second problem explores the
analytic and numerical properties of oblique Alfven shock trains via the driven
Korteweg- deVries-Burgers equation.
