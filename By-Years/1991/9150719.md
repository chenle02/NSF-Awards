This project adds a laboratory component to a successful pilot program in
mathematical and computer literacy, expands this program to large scale use, and
evaluates this program. The pilot program is an effort to find an appropriate
place for mathematics and computer science within a core curriculum, a set of
general education courses required of all students. One goal of the program is
to attract undecided students, particularly woman and minorities, to the fields
of mathematics and computer science. Another goal is to guarantee that those
students who do not pursue a scientific career will be sufficiently
sophisticated to make intelligent judgements about computer-related issues. The
approach used in the program is a principles-based one, but avoids attempting a
broad survey of the field. Instead, it uses a hands-on approach to focus on
sentential logic, its relation to everyday reasoning and language, and its
application to the design of digital circuits. It also focuses on an extremely
small subset of Pascal, chosen to teach the significance of iteration and the
software engineering principle of solving complicated problems by combining
solutions to simpler ones.The project involves the design, development, piloting
and evaluation of a digital logic lab component to be added to the current
course. The project also supports five faculty development seminars for
instructors both inside and outside of CUNY to disseminate the experience of the
pilot program in order to encourage large scale use. In addition, the project
involves a broad assessment of the impact of the pilot program on students
performance in more advanced classes.
