The Conference "Beyond Uniform Hyperbolicity" will take place in Provo, Utah
from June 5 to June 16, 2017. This will be the eighth such conference, and first
in the United States since 2006. As with the previous conferences on the
subject, the planned workshop will focus on disseminating new results and
training researchers. This conference will host from 100 to 120 participants.
Leading researchers investigating smooth dynamical systems, promising junior
researchers, and graduate students will participate. There will be mini-courses
and a small number of invited talks which will allow ample time for informal
collaboration.

The conference will focus on the global qualitative study (topological and
ergodic) of differentiable dynamical systems. Topics related to hyperbolicity
include partial hyperbolicity, nonuniform hyperbolicity, singular hyperbolicity,
Lyapunov exponents, dimension, and statistical properties. The conference will
also investigate global and semi-local dynamics. Other topics include
connections to hyperbolicity such as symbolic extensions, interval dynamics,
foliations, actions of discrete groups on manifolds, and holomorphic systems.
