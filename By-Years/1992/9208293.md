The objective of this research is to produce efficient and effective FPGA
partitioning and placement tools that are capable of simultaneously meeting a
number of objectives subject to several design requirements in order to achieve
optimal system performance. Dr. Saab has developed two algorithmic methodologies
for the solution of large-scale combinatorial problems with several constraints.
These two general techniques are: Stochastic Evolution which is a probabilistic
algorithm, and the Limited Exhaustive Search Strategy which is a strict descent
iterative algorithm. Initial experimentation with these two techniques is quite
encouraging and optimal solutions are achieved in certain applications. The goal
is to use these two general optimization techniques to obtain effective and
efficient FPGA partitioning and placement tools. This research will also
investigate other approaches for partitioning and placement such as genetic
algorithms, neural nets, and tabu search, and can potentially stimulate the use
of Stochastic Evolution and the Limited Exhaustive Search Strategy for the
solutions of many large and difficult engineering problems. FPGA design tools
are immediate consequences of this effort.
