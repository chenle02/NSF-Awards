The development of advanced computer architectures for Discrete Relaxation
Algorithm (DRA), a general computational technique for enforcing consistency in
a consistent labeling problem, is being carried out. This research focuses on
developing an optimal parallel algorithm and architecture for DRA and embedding
the DRA in backtracking. Implementations of the optimal algorithms on a fine-
grained, massively parallel computer architecture in VLSI (very large scale
integrated) is being carried out. Various heuristic strategies for speeding up
tree searches are being developed.
