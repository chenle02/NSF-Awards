The Maryland Undergraduate Mathematics Enhancement Program II (MUMEP II) is a
coalition of community college, 4-year college, and university undergraduate
mathematics teaching faculty in the general region of Maryland, the District of
Columbia, and Virginia, organized around a two-year faculty enhancement program
for 32 participants during each of the years 1996 and 1997. In July 1996 a one-
week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Chaotic Dynamics and in July 1997
a one-week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Fractal Geometry. A pair of
day-long follow-up seminars will take place during the academic year following
each workshop. The primary goals of MUMEP II are: 1) to present new visual
mathematical topics to faculty from institutions in the region and to use
graphics calculators and computer graphics to enhance understanding of the new
visual mathematical topics; 2) to relate the new visual mathematics topics to
existing undergraduate mathematics courses wherever reasonable; 3) to promote
communication and collaboration among faculty in the area's institutions. In
addition, special teacher preparation activities are planned to engage faculty
who teach significant numbers of pre- service teachers. In particular, the
project's recruiting efforts will look for opportunities to involve such
faculty, and workshop activities will showcase lessons that can be incorporated
in mathematics classes taken by prospective teachers and in school mathematics
classes as well. All materials prepared for or during a workshop or seminar will
be disseminated during the session or shortly thereafter. Under the guidance of
members of an Advisory Board, evaluation of the program will be facilitated
through daily and summary questionnaires.
