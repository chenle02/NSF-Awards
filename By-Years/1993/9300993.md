This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida in the purchase of a
quantum chemical visualization system. Specific areas of research include: 1)
Time-dependent methods for scattering, reactions, and the dynamical evolution of
molecular properties, 2) Semi-empirical treatment of extremely large molecules
such as neurotoxins, including solvent effects via self-consistent reaction
fields, 3) Novel applications and enhancements of density functional theory for
prediction of properties of ultra-thin (quasi-molecular) films, 4) Predictive
calculation of polymer structures for synthesis to realize large conductivities
and possible superconductivity, 5) Development of methods, algorithms and
software to visualize, rapidly and effectively, the data obtained in the above
projects. %%% The computer hardware and software in the quntum mechanical
visualization systems allows one to simulate interactions that take place in
molecules in a real laboratory environment and to present these interactions in
a visual manner.
