SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics This project is a
series of Interdisciplinary Conference in Applied Mathematics conducted by the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The conferences are
designed to bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who are
developing and applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms. An
important feature of this series is the inclusion of focused, interdisciplinary,
academic/industry workshops in which mathematical and computational scientists
from academia can interact with mathematicians, computational scientists,
engineers, and scientists in industry on specific areas and problems of interest
to industry. The primary objective of the conferences is to initiate new
interaction among the creators and users of mathematics and thereby contribute
to the understanding of mathematics and encourage its application to problems of
society. A second objective is to encourage the participation of students,
women, and minority groups in this interaction.
