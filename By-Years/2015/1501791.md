As the western United States experiences continuing drought conditions,
irrigation efficiency and water conservation are more critical than ever before,
creating a need for irrigation technicians with state-of-the-art skills. To
address this need, Modesto Junior College (MJC) will implement an Agriculture
Irrigation Technology program. The project will increase the number, and improve
the preparation and technical expertise of irrigation technicians and designers
who are prepared to improve agriculture water management, increase irrigation
delivery system efficiency, and enhance on-farm water conservation. Three
specific objectives support the goal of the program: 1) Develop and deliver
standardized curriculum that advances the efficient design and use of irrigation
systems and can be replicated at other institutions; 2) Create a pipeline of
skilled, certified technicians that meet current conservation, efficiency and
water management regulations; and 3) Increase recruitment and success rates for
underrepresented students in agricultural science technical programs.

Specific activities will include development of a new associate degree, an
Irrigation Technology Summer Institute to increase the recruitment and retention
of typically underrepresented students in this field, on-site student advising,
hands-on experience with state-of-the-art technology, and industry internships.
A new curriculum will combine a strong foundation in science, including critical
components of plant science, soil science, hydrology, and meteorology with
cutting edge technology that enables workers to accurately put water when and
where it is needed. This program is contributing to the improvement of student
learning and preparation in multiple agricultural science areas, and has
relevance for animal science, plant and crop science, environmental
horticulture, as well as other agriculture disciplines.
