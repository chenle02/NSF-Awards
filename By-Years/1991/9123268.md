Partial support is requested for an American Society for Cell Biology Summer
Conference on "Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Traffic," to be held May 10-13,
1992 at the Airlie House near Warrenton, VA. Support for the participation of
European scientists has already been obtained from NATO. Molecules involved in
the individual steps of membrane traffic are being identified and their
functions defined at an amazingly rapid rate. This conference will concentrate
on the membrane transport steps where molecular detail is available, and draw
from data obtained in plant, yeast, and mammalian systems. The membrane traffic
field is expanding and fewer students and postdoctoral fellows are selected for
participation at the major, limited- attendance meetings, such as Gordon
Research Conferences. Communication between young scientists and leaders in the
field is an essential element of training; therefore, this conference will focus
on providing these interactions for students and postdoctoral fellows. The
meeting will accommodate 150 scientists and is designed to encourage maximal
interaction among participants. This award will provide scholarships for young
and minority scientists to attend the meeting.
