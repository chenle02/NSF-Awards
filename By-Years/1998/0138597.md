The investigator is studying the statistical properties of zeros and values
of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions in the context of random matrix theory. Random matrix
models are &lt;br/&gt;being used to conjecture the full asymptotic expansion and
analytic continuation&lt;br/&gt;for the moments of L-functions, and to make
predictions for the statistical behavior &lt;br/&gt;of ranks of elliptic curves.
A C++ L-function class library along with a front end &lt;br/&gt;application is
also being developed for computing zeros and values of L-functions.
&lt;br/&gt;This software is being used by the investigator to numerically
confirm the predictions &lt;br/&gt;being made, and will be released freely to
the public as a much needed tool for studying L-functions.&lt;br/&gt; Many
problems in number theory can be described in terms of the properties of
&lt;br/&gt;so-called L-functions. These functions, which encode profound
information about various &lt;br/&gt;number theoretic problems, have remained
largely unyielding to mathematical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Many deep problems in
number theory would be solved if one could understand these &lt;br/&gt;functions
in detail. Surprisingly, a seemingly unrelated field known as random matrix
theory, a subject that originally arose in connection to experimental physics,
has recently been found by number theorists and physicists alike to provide a
framework in which to model the behavior of L-functions. This mysterious
connection has been used successfully to make hitherto unimaginable predictions
for the behavior of L-functions. The work in this proposal is concerned with
exploring the connections between these two fields, number theory and random
matrix theory. To assist in this project, the investigator is also preparing a
software package, to be made freely available to the public, for numerically
studying L-functions.&lt;br/&gt; This award is being cofunded by the Algebra,
Number Theory, and Combinatorics Program, the Numeric, Symbolic, and Geometric
Computation Program, and the Computational Mathematics Program.&lt;br/&gt;
