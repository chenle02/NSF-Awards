This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Vanderbilt University
supports the research of Professor Sandra J. Rosenthal. The theme of the
research is the development of time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy for
the study of charge migration in novel optical and electronic materials. The
initial material being studied is self-assembled monolayers composed of
oligothiophene derivatives. Oligomers consisting of different numbers of the
thiophene monomer are synthesized and the degree to which their ability to form
ordered monolayers depends upon chain length explored with scanning probe
microscopy. The oligothiophene systems are ideal candidates to be incorporated
into a molecular transmission line to be used to demonstrate simultaneous
picosecond time resolution and molecular spatial resolution of a time-resolved
scanning tunneling microscope in the future. The research is a crucial step in a
long-term research program for direct observation of both structure and function
in novel materials, providing the information necessary to tailor new materials
designed for specific device applications. The ability to design new conducting
materials contributes to advances in the electronics industry.
