This collaboration between scientist/educators at Yale and the University of
Texas at San Antonio addresses a basic need in undergraduate neuroscience
education: a means to illustrate and explore the processes that underlie
neuronal function. The objective is to create a series of laboratory simulation
exercises, with an accompanying manual, that are designed to reinforce learning
of basic concepts, promote creative thinking through problem solving, encourage
productive interplay between simulation and experimentation, and provide a
launching point for students who wish to pursue independent research projects.
The proposed work has three principal advantages over existing educational
simulators. First the potential audience will be maximized by keying these
exercises to several leading neuroscience textbooks. Second, important topics
will be addressed that are not covered by present educational simulators. Third,
these exercises will be implemented using NEURON, which runs under MS-Windows
(3.1, 95 and NT) and UNIX, and which will be running on Macintosh systems by
mid-1997. NEURON is a research level tool that provides a flexible and powerful
environment for neural simulations, so that teachers can tailor and extend these
exercises, and students can create their own models and simulations. The
assistance of an expert consultant will be enlisted for overall guidance in
project evaluation. Feedback will also be solicited from a panel of advisors who
have considerable experience teaching neuroscience to undergraduates at several
colleges and universities, some of whom have themselves developed software for
neuroscience education. The educational utility of these exercises will be
assessed by their impact on student performance and attitudes regarding
neuroscience. Project results will be disseminated through presentations at
professional society meetings, articles, the Internet, and publication of the
manual and software by a major scientific publishing house.
