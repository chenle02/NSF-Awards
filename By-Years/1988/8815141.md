The objective of this proposal is to experimentally demonstrate and verify the
hundredfold speed/power ratio enhancements of optical phase conjugate devices
predicted by our calculations on structures composite model materials.
Specifically the investigators propose to formulate composites of coated
metallic nanospheres suspended in a nonlinear optical polymer matrix. The
speed/power ratio, spatial esolution, non-linearity characteristics and
wavelength response of OPC test devices constructed with three composites will
be studied in the degenerate four wave mixing apparatus.
