Westminster College, New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, will conduct the "High
School Psychology Teachers' Science Skills Equipping Project" for forty
participants. In each of two summers, a four-week long module will have as its
focus research methods applied to cognitive and physiological psychology
relevant for the high school psychology curriculum. During three afternoon
laboratories each week, participants will act as students in demonstration
experiments conducted by the project faculty. Demonstration experiments based on
lectures and readings will be designed by the participants, enabling them to
approach psychology as a science. Microcomputers will be used to demonstrate
basic psychological processes and replicate classic and current experiments in
psychology in the high school classroom. During the academic year, the project
staff will visit each of the participants classes, conduct two half-day in-
service sessions, and assist in developing a newsletter and psychology fairs.
Participants will return to the campus for a weekend at the end of the academic
year to share their insights and integrate their experiences into the second
summer module for 20 different participants. An extensive and careful evaluation
plan has been outlined.
