Understanding of geographical patterns and processes related to industrial
production has been limited to some extent because the focus of economic
geographers has been on the material production of manufactured goods.
Significant and rapidly growing sectors of the economy include industries that
produce little tangible output, such as information and other intangible goods.
Understanding the nature of the industries in these sectors involves
consideration of different economic and spatial factors than those associated
with traditional industries. This doctoral dissertation project will study the
production process, product characteristics, and the spatial organization of
production in the emerging field of knowledge- based systems (KBS), which are
software systems designed specifically to encode and apply extensive and highly
detailed factual data and techniques, usually of a scientific or technical
nature. An extensive statistical database of KBS industries, surveys, and in-
depth interviews will be used to increase understandings of the spatial
configuration of KBS development. This project will provide valuable information
about knowledge-based systems which soon will dominate computer-
telecommunications industries, and it will add depth to the understanding of
geographers and political economists about processes of industrial development.
This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young
scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
