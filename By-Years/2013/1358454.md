The Fairfield University Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program in
Mathematics and Computational Science is an eight-week summer program designed
to engage talented undergraduates in original mathematics and computing
research, beyond the college curriculum. The program hosts nine students per
summer, providing on-campus housing and student stipends. The participants spend
their time working and learning in small groups, with each group in close
consultation with an individual Fairfield University faculty mentor on research
topics drawn from the mentor's field of expertise.

The principal goal of the program is to prepare the participants for research-
based scientific careers, and to engender in each student a deep understanding
not only of the importance of individual scientific research, but also of the
broader context of collaboration into which that research fits. This is achieved
by providing the students with the experience of a research cohort. This
collaborative research environment - students working with faculty and with each
other - also allows for the general advancement of the mathematics and computing
disciplines, and fosters the continuing scholarly and pedagogical development of
all the academic professionals involved.
