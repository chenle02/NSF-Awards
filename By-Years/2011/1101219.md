This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
international "Workshop on Partial Differential Equations and Several Complex
Variables" that will be held from August 1-5, 2011, in Serra Negra,
Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on a variety of topics
in the area of several complex variables (e.g., the analysis and geometry CR-
manifolds; analytic hypoellipticity of differential operators; overdetermined
systems of partial differential equations and their applications in geometry),
with the theory of partial differential equations providing the unifying theme.
All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and
extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such
that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise
engaged in the various conference activities, especially in the mini-courses
that will be offered by Jeff McNeal and Loredana Lanzani.
