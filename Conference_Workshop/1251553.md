This proposal is for support of the Program on Motivic Invariants and
Singularities at the Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame,
which consists of an Undergraduate Summer School (May 21-25, 2013), a Graduate
and Post-doc Summer School (May 27-31, 2013), a conference (June 3 -7, 2013), as
well as a Distinguished Lecture Series throughout the program. The Undergraduate
Summer School will consist of three mini course on p-adic numbers and p-adic
integration, tropical geometry, and statistical learning theory and
singularities. The advanced Summer School will consist of five mini-courses on
D-modules and vanishing cycles, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and the motivic
Milnor fiber, the Monodromy Conjecture, motivic integration, and the Nash
Conjecture. The conference will bring together top researchers in areas related
to motivic integration and singularity theory. In addition, the Distinguished
Lecture Series, to be delivered by Jan Denef, will disseminate to a wide
audience an exciting topic related to the program. The website of the conference
is: http://nd.edu/~cmnd/programs/mis2013/

Since its creation by M. Kontsevich in 1995, motivic integration has been a
rapidly developing subject connected to Algebraic Geometry, Singularity Theory,
Number Theory, and Model Theory. The theory found a lot of applications to a
diverse set of topics such as the McKay correspondence, singularities in the
Minimal Model Program, and the study of orbital integrals that appear in the
Langlands program. While there has been a lot of work and notable progress in
this direction, some fundamental problems are still open. Such a problem is the
Monodromy Conjecture, which predicts a connection between p-adic and motivic
integrals and more classical invariants of singularities. Further recent
interest in the topic comes from connections with Donaldson-Thomas theory. In
light of recent multiple developments, this is a good time to have a program on
connections between motivic integration and singularity theory. While motivic
integration has achieved a certain maturity, several new interesting research
directions are being uncovered. By bringing together experts from different but
related fields, the program can achieve a fruitful exchange of ideas that will
result in progress on important problems (such as the Monodromy Conjecture) and
in formulating new questions.
