Doron Zeilberger proposes to continue to develop methodologies for harnessing
the great potential of Symbolic Computation to do research in Combinatorics and
related areas. In particular he hopes to introduce new computational and
conceptual frameworks that would extend the so-called Wilf-Zeilberger proof
theory to much wider classes of identities and theorems. He also proposes to
continue his efforts in `Artificial Combinatorics', and develop algorithms for
the discovery and {\it rigorous} proof of theorems in combinatorics whose
complexity make them unfeasible for human proofs. This research should be
symbiotic, as it is expected that both the concrete results and the underlying
methodologies, would help computer algebra developers to improve and enhance
their systems.

This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of
Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections
of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research. This research is also in the general area of Symbolic
Computation, that attempts to teach computers to perform research that
previously required extensive human resources. Progress in this area promises to
have important ramifications to science and technology.
