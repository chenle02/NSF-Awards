9422639 Kreps The archives of the Disaster Research Center, University of
Delaware contain approximately 3,000 transcribed and 5,000-6,000 untranscribed
tape-recorded interviews that have been conducted in field studies since 1963.
Using a portion of this material, the investigators have developed a theory of
organizing and role enactment during the emergency periods of disaster.
Continuing work on the remaining thousands of interview in the archives will be
completed during the three-year period of this grant. The objectives of this
phase of the research are to refine core dimensions of the theory, expand its
generalizabilty, and provide additional empirical grounding for principles of
emergency management. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate
in this endeavor, with support for the latter being provided under the Research
Experience for Undergraduates Program. ***
