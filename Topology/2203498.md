The goal of topology is to identify which features of a shape do not change
under a continuous deformation, with concrete applications in many areas of
science such as condensed matter physics, cosmology, data analysis, and biology.
As one can infer information about the shape of a drum by listening to the way
it sounds, one can define topological invariants of spaces of dimension 3 and 4
by studying the solutions of certain partial differential equations naturally
arising in gauge theory, the geometric language in which the fundamental laws of
the Standard Model of particle physics are formulated. This project focuses on
the Seiberg-Witten equations which, because of their geometric nature, provide a
perfect vantage point to probe the interactions of topology with neighboring
subjects such as hyperbolic geometry, spectral theory, and complex analysis. A
key objective is the exploration of new avenues of investigation at the
interface with these fields of mathematics. Towards this end, this project will
also create many research opportunities both at the undergraduate and graduate
level.

The PI will study monopole Floer homology, with the following main goals:
explore the interactions with hyperbolic geometry in three dimensions using
tools from spectral geometry, the theory of elliptic partial differential
equations, and the Selberg trace formula; develop computational tools for the
maps induced by general negative definite cobordisms using index theory and
functoriality properties of coupled Morse homology; investigate possible
relations with classical topics in algebraic geometry such as the study of the
singularities of the theta divisor of a Riemann surface; and use Pin(2)-symmetry
to understand potential geometric characterizations of rational homology spheres
with small Floer homology, in the spirit of the L-space conjecture.
