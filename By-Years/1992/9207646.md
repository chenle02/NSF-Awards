Comparative data on spermatogenesis spanning a range of pteridophytes will be
collected. Emphasis will be placed on elucidating the ultrastructural details of
spermiogenesis and the fine structure of the mature sperm cell. The role of
three cytoskeletal elements - microtubules, actin and centrin - in the
differentiation process will be evaluated by fluorescent labelling and
immunogold-localization. These data will be compared with data already available
on the bryophytes. Both taxa of spermatophytes that have flagellated sperm and
two species of charaphytes will also be examined. The bryophytes, algae, and
seed plants will be used as outgroups in a cladistic analysis of the data. The
purpose of this study is resolve phylogenetic relationships among early
pteridophytes and between them and the algal, bryophyte and seed plant lineages.
The major dichotomies in early diversification of archegoniate groups remain as
speculative today as they did before the advent of biological electron
microscopy. This study should enable the resolution of early lines of
diversification from the green algae to the major extant groups of land plants.
