One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the
development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded
in classifying all of the elementary particles, but there are known holes in the
theory. Many are connected to the neutrino, which we know can change from one
type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes in so-called neutrino
oscillation experiments, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one
of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.
This award will allow a deeper understanding of neutrino properties and allow
detailed simulations of future neutrino mixing experiments such as DUNE at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Sanford Underground Research
Facility (SURF) in South Dakota. The VA Tech team will involve undergraduate
students in this analysis work and will reach out to high-school teachers
through their QuarkNet center and the Virginia Tech Neutrino NSF REU
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently a large interest in
experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC)
spurred in part by the DUNE project at (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in
general. This award enables a deeper understanding and improved accuracy of
nuclear effects in Argon and thus reduces the systematic uncertainties in the
next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments. This result will be
obtained from measurements made at Jefferson National lab (JLAB) to determine
neutron and proton so-called spectral density functions. These spectral density
functions will tell us details of how neutrinos interact with the nucleus in
Argon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
