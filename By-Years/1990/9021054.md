Nonlinear optical materials form the basis of the emerging "photonics"
technology. II-IV semiconductors have some of the best nonlinear optical figures
of merit for applications in photonic devices. However, these materials have not
yet been developed to the point where devices can be made. %%% The goal of this
research project is to characterize the properties of materials such as ZnSe and
CdxMnxTe relevant to device applications and to characterize the properties of
prototype devices. This project will be carried out in the OSU Center for Laser
Research and as a joint university-industry interaction with Eagle-Picher
Research Laboratories.
