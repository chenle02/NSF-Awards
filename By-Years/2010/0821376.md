This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of instruments and equipment
for the environmental laboratory in the Civil Engineering Technology Department
at Southern Polytechnic State University. They propose to add a block digestion
system, an UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a particle size analyzer for water and
wastewater characterization. The addition of a particle size analyzer, an
additional jar test apparatus and a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a filtration
system will enhance their capabilities to better assess the efficiency of those
processes using parameters and analytical techniques currently used in water
treatment plants. The particle size analyzer, for example, can be used in water
quality assessment, but also in soil characterizations. Thus, this piece of
equipment will be used frequently by all civil engineering technology students.
The UV spectrophotometer will be used to identify specific organic compounds
that can be used as tracers or to evaluate the performance of treatment process,
without using expensive testing techniques.
