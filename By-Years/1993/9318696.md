This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-St. Louis
in the purchase of a 300 MHz NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: Chemistry of Diplatinum Complexes
Bridged by Dppc or Dppm Ligands, Metallaboranes Derived from Pentaborane(9) and
Hexaborane(10), Silicon Oligomers and Polymers; Synthesis of Heavy-Metal X-ray
Contrast Agents, Dioxirane Chemistry, and the Preparation and Reactions of
Chiral 1-Hydroxy Phosphonates and Phosphonamides. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
