Mathematicians use "functions" to describe and simulate our real world. A useful
method to understand "functions" is to decompose them into frequencies, in a way
similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches)
of its constituent notes. This is called the Fourier transform and is a part of
the so-called Fourier analysis method. The study of noncommutative objects
offers a new point of view on many topics in mathematics reflecting our daily
life and offers possibly the "right" language for quantum mechanics. In real
life, the order in which certain operations are executed can make a big
difference. For example, first boiling water and adding oil is very different
from first boiling oil and then adding water. This is an example of a
noncommutative process. Noncommutative Fourier analysis is about functions and
their properties in the realm of non-commuting variables. In mathematics, the
most important examples are matrix-valued functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is devoted to the Fourier analysis on noncommutative Lp spaces
associated with von Neumann algebras, including (non-radial) Fourier
multipliers, the Mikhlin-multiplier theory, Dirac Operators, and unconditional
sequences of group von Neumann algebras. A typical object is the Hilbert
transform on free group von Neumann algebras. Major challenges in the proposed
research are the lack of geometric/metric structure and the lack of a
commutative product in the abstract setting. The proposed research program will
strengthen the existing link between Harmonic Analysis and Functional Analysis.
Noncommutative harmonic analysis is motivated by quantum mechanics and
prediction theory and will make valuable contributions to these areas and more
applied topics such as financial modeling and signal processing.
