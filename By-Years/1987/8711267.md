There is a dichotomy between the way professional linguists think and talk
about language and the way laymen do so. This project focuses on the layman's
common-sense description of intelligibility, correctness, regional variation,
and esthetic qualities. Particpants are asked 1) to locate samples of US English
along a north-south axis, 2) to rate speech areas adjacent to their own
according to degree of differentness, 3) make regional judgements about
correctness and pleasantness, and 4) locate US dialect areas on an outline map
of the country. Results of the interviews are analysed for consistency, with an
attempt to identify patterns of folk taxonomy. This is the continuation of work
which has led to vigorous publication by the investigator. Practical application
of the findings will find their place in teacher-training, foreign language
education, and better understanding of how lay concepts of the characterisitics
of a given speech community may be involved in the community's practical
problems.
