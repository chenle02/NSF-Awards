The purpose of the workshop is to discuss recent developments in
our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the relationship between field theory and
string&lt;br/&gt;theory, with a focus on the physics of strong interactions
and&lt;br/&gt;QCD. The broad goal is to address and solve long-standing problems
in&lt;br/&gt;the physics of hadrons using emerging new methods.&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop is organized by the European Centre for Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;Studies
in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*) in Trento (Italy)&lt;br/&gt;-- one
of the few Centres world-wide which provides a dedicated
and&lt;br/&gt;structured combination of scientific activities for a
large&lt;br/&gt;international scientific community. The role of the workshop
in&lt;br/&gt;establishing both crossdisciplinary and crossnational
collaborations&lt;br/&gt;will be invaluable.
