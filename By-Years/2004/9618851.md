Ethics cases are of growing use in engineering courses. Few include design and
environmental issues. Yet, all designs have ethical implications, and increasing
concern for the environment will be one of the great challenges for future
engineers. This project will create and evaluate a collection of cases that
focuses on ethical considerations in the early stages of the invention and
design process, cases that encourage students to think imaginatively about
design in light of environmental concerns. Using the cases in engineering
education may help to produce engineers better able to make ethical decisions
about creating and marketing new technologies. Two sets of cases are planned in
order to illustrate (1) the need for moral imagination, and (2) the challenge of
trying to meet standards calling for the elimination of environmental risk. The
first set considers companies who make sound design decisions but find
themselves in trouble because they remained unaware of the ways in which other
people frame their experience. The second set will challenge students to design
products that are both environmentally sustainable and viable, or avoid social
and political risks inherent in any product design. The cases and teaching notes
will be tested in the classroom. Results should appeal to a variety of
disciplines including engineering, technology, environmental studies and ethics.
They will be published in the Case Bibliography of the Darden Business School
and appear on the World Wide Web and in articles and an eventual textbook. The
project also allows two graudate students to pursue a special course
concentration combining systems engineering and ethics as they do research and
help to write and evaluate the cases.
