This award will support continued collaborative research in nuclear
astrophysics between US and Belgian physicists. The US group is under the
direction of Dr. William Rodney, Georgetown University. The Belgian collaborator
is Dr. J. Vervier, Institute for Nuclear Physics, Louvain. The objective of this
project is to carry out a program of experiments using radioactive beams to
measure cross-sections important to understanding nucleosynthesis. In novae,
supernovae, X-ray bursters and possibly in the early universe, the temperature
and density were such that the lifetimes of some radioactive (and isomeric)
nuclides were comparable to the burning times for their destruction by proton or
alpha particle induced nuclear reactions. In these instances, these reactions
must be taken into account in developing models for stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis. Thus, the potential for the use of radioactive targets and/or
beams is receiving increasing attention in the nuclear physics community. In
this project, proposed experiments represent a major step in the direction of
providing the needed cross-section information. The Louvain-la-Neuve coupled
cyclotron facility will be able to produce the required beam intensity to carry
out the experiments. There are no existing US facilities capable of such
radioactive beam measurements. The research will benefit from Dr. Rodney's
expertise in nuclear astrophysics and the background of his research group in
active nuclear experimentation. The results of this research will contribute to
our understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis in stars.
