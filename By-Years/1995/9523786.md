This project will lead to improved modeling of the ionosphere by determining
physical causes of anomalous nighttime variations in density and temperature. It
will also further study the exchange of particles and energy between the
ionosphere and plasmasphere. In particular, the project will lead to a
quantification of the plasmasphere's transparency to the passage of ionospheric
electrons.***
