This proposal discusses the planning phase of a proposed I/UCRC Research Site of
the Ohio State University Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering
(CAPCE) at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. CAPCE is an existing, successful
I/UCRC. The proposed Florida Research Site compliments CAPCE by bringing to the
joint I/UCRC (1) strong partners in the aerospace and construction industries as
well as federal labs, and (2) additional capabilities in composite process
design, modeling and simulation, and advanced material testing and
characterization. This is in addition to conducting advanced polymer and
composite materials research and manufacturing technology research similar to
CAPCE's research focus.
