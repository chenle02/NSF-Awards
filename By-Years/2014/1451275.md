As part of NSF's Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, Science Learning+
(SL+) is a partnership among US and UK foundations. SL+ makes grant awards that
take transformational steps to inform, improve, and advance the knowledge bases,
practices, and design of informal STEM learning experiences and environments.
The long-term SL+ goals are to broaden participation in STEM and to better
understand, strengthen and coordinate STEM engagement and lifelong learning.

This is a Science Learning+ planning project that will develop a plan for how to
conduct a longitudinal study using existing data sources that can link
participation in science-focused programming in out-of-school settings with
long-range outcomes. The data for this project will ultimately come from
"mining" existing data sets routinely collected by out-of-school programs in
both the US and UK. 4H is the initial out-of-school provider that will
participate in the project, but the project will ideally expand to include other
youth-based programs, such as Girls Inc. and YMCA.

During the planning grant period, the project will develop a plan for a
longitudinal research study by examining informal science-related factors and
outcomes including: (a) range of educational outcomes, (b) diversity and
structure of learning activities, (c) links to formal education experiences and
achievement measures, and (d) structure of existing informal science program
data collection infrastructure.

The planning period will not involve actual mining of existing data sets, but
will explore the logistics regarding data collection across different informal
science program, including potential metadata sets and instruments that will:
(a) identify and examine data collection challenges, (b) explore the
implementation of a common data management system, (c) identify informal science
programs that are potential candidates for this study, (d) compare and contrast
data available from the different programs and groups, and (e) optimize database
management.
