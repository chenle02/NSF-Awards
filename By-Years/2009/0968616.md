This project studies the ongoing NASA-ESA-ASI Cassini Mission to Saturn to
better understand the issues that envelop complex socio-computation systems,
such as the mutual interdependence of humans and machines, to present broader
implications for the design of complex human-computer systems more generally.
While the robots become famous, robotic space exploration missions also require
networked and distant hardware to control spacecraft movement, extensive home-
grown software suites that coordinate work activity, and several hundred human
scientists and engineers who must negotiate scientific priorities and make
decisions that guide the robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using ethnography, oral
history interviews, and archival work, researchers will probe the practices of
sociotechnical organization, distributed operations, data sharing, and community
maintenance in an existing, complex, high-stakes and international
sociocomputational environment. The research addresses the questions: what
constraints does the social place on the technological, and vice versa? Also,
how does the political and decision-making structure of a group align or clash
with their technical infrastructure, and with what consequences for both social
interaction and scientific production?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the project lies in its melding of five disciplinary areas of
investigation - Science &amp; Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative
Work, Organization Sciences, Human-Computer Interaction, and Human-Robot
Interaction - to generate a holistic picture of the institutional and workplace
realities of large-scale technoscience in a radically distributed context. The
broader impacts of this work include design implications for the next generation
of socially-intelligent computational systems both within and outside of
planetary exploration.
