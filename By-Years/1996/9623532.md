This project focuses on expanding the capabilities of the present (DNA)
sequence analysis algorithms with respect to comparing sequences and detecting
features. In particular, the project concentrates on:(1) developing methods for
quantifying the relatedness of biological sequences under a broader model of
mutational events, than the currently used substitution-indel model, and (2)
improving methods for detecting tandem repeats in sequences. The Integrated
Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant includes(a)developing a curriculum for
graduate study in computational and mathematical biology, (b) developing courses
and course materials, including lecture notes, exercises, programming projects
and extensive bibliographies, that cover combinatorial and algorithmic topics in
sequence alignment, DNA sequencing, DNA physical mapping, DNA physical mapping,
and prediction of protein folding and RNA folding, and phylogenetic tree
construction, (c) instituting a summer training course for new researchers in
computational biology.***
