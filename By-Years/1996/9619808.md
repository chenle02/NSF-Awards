9619808 The core technology used in this project is called "model checking," a
term embracing a large family of automated analysis methods. To date, these
methods have been primarily used in domains like VLSI and protocol verification,
i.e., problems which possess an inherent finite-state structure. Model-checking
has proved less useful for analyzing general, concurrent programs realized in
software, where many basic properties are undecidable. The PIs are developing
algorithms to help attack this problem, by combining a variety of techniques
used in model-checking, program analysis, constraint-solving and graph theory.
The resulting methods guarantee convergence by allowing false negatives; often,
these conservative approximations are sufficient to prove the properties under
investigation. To date, the tools developed in the project have automatically
verified some classical infinite-state programs. Examples are (1) the well known
Bakery Algorithm which handles fair mutual-exclusion between multiple processes;
and (2) FIFO queuing via circular, N-place buffers, where N is not bounded a
priori. The analysis tools proved relevant safety and liveness properties in a
matter of seconds; the same properties usually take several hours for advanced
students to prove by hand. The PIs are now developing strategies for scaling
these results. Methods under investigation are (1) finding more precise
approximation techniques, specifically for abstracting path relations as
transitive closures of infinite programs; (2) developing compositional
strategies to help conquer state-explosion due to concurrency; and (3) unifying
the automatic tools with a "proof shell," to let the user combine automatic
verification results into a higher-level, global proof structure. ***
