This research continues a project on coupled free oscillations and the large-
scale lateral heterogeneity of the earth. Specific tasks to be done now are the
modification and improvement of the efficiency of the coupled-mode synthetic
seismogram code, the increase of resolution of synthetic inversion studies of
the structure of the earth, the study of surface-wave amplitude anomalies, and
body waves in laterally homogeneous and laterally heterogeneous earth models.
The theoretical and computer code results of this work will be widely applicable
to studies of the earth's structure, earthquakes, and tectonics.
