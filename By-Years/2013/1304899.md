This proposal addresses the feedbacks between glacier erosion and glacier
dynamics. It does so by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment
erosion, properties of basal till, basal water pressure, basal motion, ice
deformation, surface velocities, surface mass balance, and changes in surface
elevation and terminus position. This will be accomplished through a
comprehensive observational program using radio echo sounding, reflection
seismics, borehole observations, GPS, satellite remote sensing, and airborne
LiDAR and digital photogrammetry. All observations will be interpreted with the
help of numerical models that explore the effects of changing boundary
conditions and the longer term evolution, taking into account the effects of
sediment excavation. The work will be carried out at Taku Glacier, Southeast
Alaska where all relevant processes are currently active. This project will
impact model studies on glacier and ice sheet evolution, as well as
interpretations of sedimentary records from past glaciations.&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal will be closely coordinated with activities of the Juneau Icefield
Research Program, an annual educational program for high school and college
students on the Juneau Ice field.
