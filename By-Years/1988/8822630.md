Sharon Emerson, at the University of Utah, proposes a multifaceted study of
voiceless frogs in the genus Rana that occur in southeast Asia. Emerson's goal
is to gain an understanding of the evolution of a suite of secondary sexual
characters, associated with the frogs reproductive ecology and breeding behavior
(voicelessness), that appears to have evolved on two separate occasions among
four species in Borneo. To gain this understanding, Emerson proposes a
systematic study of the southeast Asian Ranids based on morphological characters
independent of the functional complex of secondary sexual features. Field
studies will be conducted in Borneo to determine the details of the breeding
biology of the four species and to determine the functional significance of the
secondary sexual characters. Assays of blood hormone levels will be made in
these species and in other species of Rana to determine the relationship between
testosterone levels and the lack of vocal development. Emerson hypothesizes that
the evolution of voicelessness may be mediated by the evolution of reduced
testosterone levels.
