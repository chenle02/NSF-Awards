ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to increase science literacy with regard
to environmental change. Deliverables include 1) a two-hour public television
program (Reinventing California) intended for public television broadcast; 2)
five Place-Based Programs located at state and national parks in California; 3)
an online educational portal with open source podcast videos and other resources
for downloading and use in multiple settings. Intended audiences include
California public television viewers, visitors to California state and national
parks, and users on line educational resources. The secondary professional
audience includes park interpretive staff, scientists, teachers, and media
professionals. STEM content includes geology, evolution of species,
biodiversity, and climate change. Through strategic partnerships with
universities, government agencies, and public television this three year project
is creating a new model that builds capacity, and impacts audiences in new ways.
The project evaluation and research conducted by the Institute for Learning
Innovation will look at how using media which provides an overarching sense of
place within the environment can be integrated with place-based programs that
add a personal scale to understanding environmental change.
