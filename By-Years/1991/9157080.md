PI plans to continue his work related to damage control and sensing, active
vibration control and structural design methodologies for material systems and
structures with complex embedded arrays of sensors, actuators and control
networks. The focus of his research program to date has been in developing new
material systems (intelligent material systems), characterising and modeling
these new material systems and implementing these innovations into active
control applications. The development and subsequent production of this new
class of materials could have impact on several diverse technological fields,
i.e., material science, design and health monitoring of civil engineering
structures, control of large flexible structures, ocean and aerospace
structures, structural acoustics, and robotics, and may act as a catalyst for
the development of many new devices and technologies.
