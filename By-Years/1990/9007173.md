Matching funds are provided for the purchase of an X-ray residual stress
measuring device. The equipment will be used to determine residual stresses in
ground surfaces of metallic and ceramic materials. The stress measurements will
be correlated with processing parameters and with performance in mechanical
property tests. Techniques will be developed to pre-determine the residual
stresses in ground ceramics.
