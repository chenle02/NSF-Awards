Dr. Gregory Dumond is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Dr. Dumond will develop a technique to determine the age of
different sections of a mineral grain by measuring uranium and lead isotopes in
zircons and monazites, for example. Dr. Dumond will take micrometer size samples
of mineral grains using a focused ion beam and then he will determine the
isotope composition using a thermal ionization mass spectrometer. The new method
will allow scientists to quantify the age of different sections of the mineral
grains in a precise matter to link mineral growth episodes to geologic
conditions and processes deep within the earth?s crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition, Dr. Dumond will be work closely with graduate students at different
stages of their career. He will lead graduate level seminars and classes on the
chemical evolution of continents and on tools that are used to study this
evolution (e.g. isotopes and computer models).&lt;br/&gt;
