9631321 Barbieri Robotic welding's success has primarily been limited to
repetitive and taught-welding tasks. This project seeks to apply robustness and
adaptability to the welding process so that the robot can successfully complete
changing tasks while minimizing human intervention. The proposed research
employs proven advanced design techniques in Nonlinear Control skillfully
adapted to handle the complexity of a robotic welding process in a very
innovative manner which has not been previously reported elsewhere. The
industrial participation by Laitram coupled with the investigators' expertise
present the two ingredients necessary for a successful project. Results from
this research will have immediate positive implications in several industries
such as Ship Building (Avondale), Rig Building (McDermott), Manufacturing
(Laitram), and other sheet metal and structural fabrication. ***
