High-frequency (&lt;0.01-10 Hz) fluctuations are prominent characteristics of
light in shallow, marine environments. High frequency fluctuations have been
shown to have significant effects on photosynthesis and primary production by
terrestrial plants and, more recently, by marine microalgae. The proposed
research will examine effects of high-frequency light fluctuations on the
photosynthetic physiology and productivity of the benthic macroalga, Chondrus
crispus. Plants will be acclimated under a variety of constant and fluctuating
irradiance, C-assimilation, and growth rates will be compared for the different
treatments. The mechanisms of fluctuating light effects will be examined by
comparing light-harvesting characteristics, carboxylating enzyme activity, light
absorption kinetics, and pool sizes and turnover rates of metabolic substrates.
Results of laboratory experiments will be related to environmental conditions by
comparing responses of plants grown under different in situ light regimes.
Overall, the proposed research will provide comprehensive information about
effects of high-frequency fluctuations and response mechanisms in a marine alga
from a light environment which is both highly variable and definable.
