The NSF is providing student support for the 2009 Nonlinear Optics Topical
Meeting, held July 12-17, 2009 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The funds support students
of US nationality. The first priority is to cover the registration fee of the
qualified students, where funds are distributed equally. Other funds are used to
cover hotel room fees, spread equally. The meeting covers nonlinear optical
phenomena which are being studied and applied over a wide range of energies and
powers, from single-photons to petawatts, and over broad spectral regimes, from
THz to X-ray frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting provides an
international forum for discussion of all aspects of nonlinear optics, including
new phenomena, novel devices, advanced materials and applications. Summaries of
papers are collected and published. Publications are provided to participants
and are also available to others interested in the meeting subject. These
topical meetings provide stimulus in research areas such as: integrated optics,
optical fiber communication, optical storage of digital data, atmospheric
transmission, reconstruction from projections, image processing, and picosecond
phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
