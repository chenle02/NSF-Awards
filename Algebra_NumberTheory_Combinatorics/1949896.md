The PI is interested in algebraic combinatorics and its relations to other areas
of mathematics. Algebraic combinatorics is a unique area in that it interacts
closely with a truly wide range of scientific subjects. For example, cluster
algebras studied by the PI arise in many areas of mathematics (representation
theory, geometry, combinatorics, dynamical systems) and physics (string theory,
scattering amplitudes, integrable systems). Discovered around the year 2000
cluster algebras provide an amazing unifying framework for many questions. The
PI is interested in deepening these connections, and finding even more ways in
which mathematics and physics are a single science. The projects also provide
research training opportunities for graduate students.

The four projects the PI will work on pertain to cluster algebras, the Ising
model, and Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. In the first project the PI plans to continue
his work on classifying periodic and integrable T-systems, as well as studying
their properties. In the second project the PI plans to work on a tensor diagram
approach to higher Teichmuller theory. In a recent work the PI and a coauthor
have used Postnikov's plabic graphs to give a comprehensive description of
correlation functions of the Ising model in terms of inequalities. In the third
project the PI plans to work on using those results to derive properties of
limits of correlation functions, as well as on extending those results to other
statistical mechanics models. Finally, in the fourth project the PI plans to use
the generalized Robinson-Schensted insertion he developed to study affine
Kazhdan-Lusztig theory.
