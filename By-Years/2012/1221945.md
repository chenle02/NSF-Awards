This project will build and validate a typology of collaboration types
associated with cyberinfrastructure (CI) use in the conduct of science. The
research focuses on documents and documenting practices as important windows
into the socio-technical arrangements of scientific teams. A large number of
virtual scientific collaborations will be studied and compared using a mix of
text mining, social network analysis and qualitative methods. The research will
result in: (1) a detailed compendium regarding what document infrastructures
scientists build to support their virtual organizing and documenting practices
and (2) specific design principles for the distributed, social and technical
aspects of scientific work. The findings will have implications for better
design and management of virtual scientific teams and for CI to support
scientific endeavors.
