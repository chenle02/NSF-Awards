A series of modeling studies of a variety of biologically significant phenomena
involving the interactions of biopolymers with smaller molecules and with other
biopolymers is proposed. Systems in which molecules bind to a long biopolymer
represented by a one-dimensional lattice will be studied. Specifically: a.) The
effects of multiple maxima (biomodality) in the probability distribution of the
number of ligands bound to the lattice will be examined; b.) earlier methods,
which take the lattice to be homogenous, with information about the sequence of
monomers along the lattice will be augmented; c.) new approximation techniques
more appropriate to heterogenous lattices will be sought; and d.) a new, simple
model for ion transport through multi-ion membrane channels will be explored. In
considering the aggregation of biopolymer chains with one another, e.) both the
kinetic and the structural aspects of the process by which biopolymers aggregate
to form clusters will be investigated; f.) methods for studying the kinetics of
linear aggregation phenomena with emphasis on the polymerization of tubulin to
form microtubules will be developed; and g.) approaches to designing molecules
that disrupt the aggregation process will be sought. The interaction of
biological macromolecules with smaller molecules and with other biopolymers is
an ever present occurrence in the normal (and abnormal) processes of biological
systems. An understanding of these interactions is essential for an
understanding of the functioning of biological systems. //
