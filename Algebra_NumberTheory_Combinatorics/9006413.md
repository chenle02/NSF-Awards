This award supports the research in algebraic combinatorics of Professors
Adriano Garsia and Jeffrey Remmel of the University of California at San Diego.
They plan to develop combinatorial algorithms for the construction of
representations and their decompositions into irreducible components. Among the
specific topics they will work on are: the new Macdonald polynomials and their
possible setting in representation theory; the structure of descent algebras of
Coxeter groups; and the explicit evaluation of the coefficients in Schur
function expansions in certain symmetric formal power series. This research
falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active
fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a
systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In
its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to
make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its
roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in
the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information
technology.
