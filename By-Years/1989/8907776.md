This experimental investigation is designed to establish the relative importance
of two mechanisms which are responsible for the suspension of solid particles in
a flowing liquid. One is fluid-particle interactions, and the other is particle-
particle interactions. Measurements of particle concentration, pressure, and
fluid as well as particle velocities will be obtained for the horizontal flow of
suspensions through a uniform size channel. The lateral distribution of these
quantities across the channel will be used to infer the local importance of the
two suspension mechanisms. The results have an important bearing on slurry
transport pipelines and plugging phenomena.
