EEC-9511912 Nail Pharmaceutical costs, along with medical costs, are rising
sharply. Research can help contain some of these rising costs in the
manufacturing area. An NSF planning award, EEC-9421600, provided funding to
Purdue University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmacal Sciences to hold a meeting
with pharmaceutical companies to determine their interest in forming an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Pharmaceutical Processing.
The Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy at Purdue University proposes
to establish a Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Pharmaceutical Processing. The purpose of the Center will be to explore and
develop new technology for pharmaceutical processing, to foster collaborative
research project between industrial and academic scientists, and to promote an
interdisciplinary approach to training students in pharmaceutical process
research and development. The Center's initial research agenda will address: 1)
Supercritical Fluid Technology for Particle Size Reduction; 2) Photon Migratimn
Measurement for Process Monitoring; 3) Sterilization of Emulsions; 4) Effect of
Milling on Particle Morphology; 5) Freeze Drying; 6) Effect of Particle Shape
Characteristics on Blending Dynamics; 7) Effect of Initial Particle Morphology
on Granule Strength and Shape Following West Granulation; and 8) Nucleation and
Crystal Growth During Drying.
