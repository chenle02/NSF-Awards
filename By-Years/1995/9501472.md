The focus of this research is to expand the basic set of chemical reactions
available to the organic chemist for application to the synthesis of complex
molecules. There are five areas of concentration. The first is the development
of addition reactions based upon the excellent coordination chemistry of
acetylenes with transition metals. In this context, new classes of cycloaddition
reactions will emerge which build molecular complexity rapidly. The second area
involves allylpalladium chemistry whereby a series of modularly designed ligands
controls absolute stereochemistry or chirality. The third area involves the
ability of silicon to promote carbon-carbon bond formation. The fourth area
probes the development of phosphines as novel catalysts. Finally, the fifth area
builds upon the versatility of sulfur to impart unusual reactivity, especially
in sulfones and sulfenium ions. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry
at Stanford University. Professor Trost will focus his work on developing
efficient synthetic methodology which is applicable to approaches to complex
organic molecules of theoretical and biological interest. The use of
organometallic intermediates, both catlytic and stoichiometric, is stressed in
the work.
