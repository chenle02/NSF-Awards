Social cooperation can be exploited and eroded by freeloading, which occurs when
some individuals receive help from others at no expense to themselves. Natural
selection is expected to favor social organisms that cooperate in ways that
prevent such freeloading. Most commonly, altruistic traits become protected from
freeloading and self-perpetuating because they help relatives, who also inherit
and pass along those same altruistic traits. For cooperation between non-
relatives, organisms can potentially prevent freeloading by increasing
investment in partnerships that yield returns while decreasing investment in
partnerships that are less beneficial. This project uses food sharing in common
vampire bats as a model cooperation system to test if and how freeloading is
prevented. Female vampire bats will voluntarily regurgitate portions of their
own meals to feed hungry roost-mates. This seemingly altruistic behavior occurs
among related and nonrelated individuals, is inducible, and is measurable under
controlled settings without training. Bats will accept and reject food-sharing
partners within a group, which provides a way to test the effects of genetic
similarity, familiarity, and reciprocity on cooperative decisions. Through a
series of experiments on captive animals this project will address three
questions about how vampire bats enforce social cooperation. First, can vampire
bats discriminate kin from non-kin using vocalizations? Second, will vampire
bats exert social partner choice by preferentially helping partners that
reciprocated more than others? Third, in the absence of partner choice, will
vampire bats exert social partner control by reducing investments in partners
that reciprocate less over time? The project will train undergraduate and
graduate students and support several outreach activities, including
presentations at academic and public forums. Studying the mechanisms underlying
cooperation in nonhuman animals has potential to provide new insight into the
origins of human social behavior.
