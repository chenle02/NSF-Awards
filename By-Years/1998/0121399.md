ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Pfeffer&lt;br/&gt;OPP-01-21399&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal is being recommended as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
to document to continuing retreat of the Columbia Glacier, Alaska by rapid
calving . The Glacier is presently retreating at a rate of approximately 1.67
kilometers (Km) per year. This rapid retreat has been accompanied by flow speeds
up to 34 meters (m) per day, making it now the world's fastest-moving glacier.
Since 1982, the glacier terminus has retreated more than 12 Km since the mid-
eighteenth century and thinned seaward (10-15 kilometers) by approximately 200
m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant changes may be occurring in the glacier's
pattern and speed of retreat during the next nine months as the glacier terminus
passes through a gap which confines its flow. The activities over the next few
months may provide important clues about the longer-term fate of Columbia
Glacier as the retreat progresses up the channel where the glacier bed lies
below sea-level. Recent calculations suggest that, depending on whether flow
speeds continue at their present fast rate or decline moderately, the portion of
the glacier grounded below sea level (the lowermost 25 km, with an ice volume of
ca. 8 x 1010 m3) will be removed by flotation or calving within 5 to 20
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators are continuing their
analysis of photogrammetric data from 1999 and 2000, and will submit a proposal
to OPP/ANS in September 2001. However, the present terminus position and newly
calculated subglacial topography may mean that that the glacier is at a critical
state in its retreat, and that significant events may occur before the end of
2001. The funds will allow them to continue the aerial photography through 2001
when important changes may occur as the terminus enters deeper water and passes
a major lateral constriction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
