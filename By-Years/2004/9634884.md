9634884 Clarke This minority research planning grant focuses on research for
developing decision models for integrated production and distribution planning
in large manufacturing companies, characterized by multiple plants that are
geographically dispersed, multiple products that can be produced at different
locations, multiple period planning horizons, significant transportation-
shipping costs, and intermediate tiers of distribution and supply. The decision
support integrated production and planning system must determine (1) which
product to produce at which plant, (2) what quantity to produce each period, (3)
where to hold inventory, (4) from which plants will a customer receive shipment,
(5) what route and what mode of transportation will the shipment take. The
methodology focuses on mixed integer programming. During the planning year, a
particular application from the gas industry will be studied, an extensive
literature review undertaken, some preliminary formulations will be developed.
The research problem addressed is important and interesting. Given the broad
scope of the problem addressed, a planning grant is most appropriate to allow
the PI to investigate the area in more detail so that a focused proposal can
result.
