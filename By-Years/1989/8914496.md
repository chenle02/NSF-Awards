This project concerns the study of both forward and backward adaptive speech
coding structures that operate at 6.4 to 16 kilobits per second. Techniques
involved are integer and fractional rate trees, unweighted and weighted squared
error distortion measures, the (M,L) tree search algorithm, and incremental path
map symbol release. Speech compression to these rates has a number of important
applications, including speech storage, voice mail, military communications,
commercial telephony, and land mobile radio.
