This study will explore the mechanisms responsible for acceleration of high
energy charged particles in solar flares and similar astrophysical events. The
explosive release of magnetic energy is the driver of many important phenomena
in nature, including flares on the sun and remote astrophysical objects, storms
in the Earth's space environment and disruptions in laboratory fusion
experiments. Energy release in the solar atmosphere is the driver of space
weather, which can negatively impact our space-based satellite communication
systems and threaten the safety of astronauts in space. The release of magnetic
energy takes place through a process called magnetic reconnection in which
magnetic fields pointing in opposite directions annihilate. While great progress
has been made in understanding the mechanisms for the fast release of magnetic
energy, the mechanisms responsible for the acceleration of charged particles to
high energy remain only partially understood and are the focus of this study. In
doing so, it will contribute to the goals of NSF's "Windows on the Universe: The
Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics" Big Idea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar flare
observations and in situ observations in the Earthâ€™s magnetotail suggest that a
large fraction of the magnetic energy released appears in the form of energetic
ions and electrons. The measured particle distributions take the form of
extended powerlaws in which the number of particles at a given energy is
proportional to an inverse power of that energy. Modeling efforts of magnetic
reconnection have not been successful in producing such powerlaw particle
distributions. A new computational model is being developed for exploring
particle acceleration in the regions of large spatial scale that characterize
reconnecting systems in nature. The new model is for the first time revealing
the high energy particle distributions as seen in observations and will be used
to establish the underlying particle acceleration mechanisms and the
partitioning of energy between electrons, protons and positively charged
ions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
