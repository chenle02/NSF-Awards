Professor Walker will investigate collisions occurring at ultracold
temperatures between atoms confined in a magneto-optic trap. By studying the
dependencies of the collision rates on detuning, intensities, and polarizations
of optical probes, detailed information will be obtained on the new physics of
collisions in dissipative environments.
