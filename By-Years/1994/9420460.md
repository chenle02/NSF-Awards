ABSTRACT AST-9420460. Rogers, Alan E. Millimeter-wavelength very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in astronomy--
typically 50 microarcseconds at 3mm and 20 microarcseconds at 1mm. Only such
resolutions can begin to reveal the compact astrophysical structures associated
with the massive central engines of active galactic nuclei such as quasars and
BL Lacertids, and only at millimeter wavelengths does one minimize the inherent
limitations of continuum VLBI due to scattering by the interstellar plasma and
optical depth effects. The millimeter band is also rich in molecular masers
whose structure can only be resolved by VLBI. This three year award will provide
support to form and operate a "Coordinated mm-VLBI Array" (CMVA). Replacing
previous ad-hoc efforts in this field by a the unified scheduling, support and
analysis infrastructure, the CMVA will make mm-wave VLBI available to all
astronomers, not just those who are experts in the technique. The CMVA will
consist of a core group of mm-wave observatories who have agreed to make
approximately two weeks per year available for VLBI; an additional group of
facilities will make time available on a per-proposal basis. The CMVA will be
managed out of the Haystack Observatory. which is also one of the CMVA's core
institutions. Haystack will coordinate the solicitation and review of mm-wave
VLBI proposals from the astronomical community, and will coordinate scheduling,
hardware and tape allocation, as well as in absentia data correlation; it will
also provide the technical support necessary to make the CMVA reliable and fully
functional, will loan two data acquisition systems to various CMVA sites, and
will continue to develop advanced VLBI instrumentation. ***
