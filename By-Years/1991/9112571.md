The Duke University Phytotron is a controlled environment facility for
experimental research. The Phytotron is used by Duke researchers and by visiting
investigators for a wide variety of research projects. This facility supports
research in plant growth and physiology, plant biochemistry and biophysics, and
experimental ecology, to name a few disciplines impacted by this national
research center. Continued operation of the Duke University Phytotron will
support numerous research projects that increase our understanding of plant
biology and the role of plants in biotic communities, atmospheric chemistry, and
global climate dynamics. This research facility provides significant benefits to
student research, and to the general botanical research community.
