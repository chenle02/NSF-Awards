Some biologists believe that during the last glaciation, tropical forest
retreated form marginal parts of its range to warm moist refuge areas not
seriously affected by ice-age climatic change. Such refuge areas would be
significant to ecologists as well as biogeographers, systematists,
anthropologists and climatologists. The idea of unchanged refuges will be tested
against a detailed record of vegetation in the warmest and wettest part of
equatorial Africa. Many data from tropical highlands indicate a glacial
temperature lowering of at least 5 degrees C, comparable to the modern
temperature difference between Boston and Labrador. Marine paleoecological data
indicate that the tropical ocean cooled by only about 1 degree C. General
circulation models of the atmosphere do not reconcile these two disparate
estimates. Pollen analysis and grass cuticle analysis of cores already taken
from four lakes in Cameroun and Ghana will provide a detailed 30,000-year proxy
record for the temperature of West Africa. These data will test the idea that
even lowland equatorial Africa was much cooler during the last ice age. The
time-course of temperature change will be compared with the modeled temperature
consequences of known changes in atmospheric CO2 and the orbit of the earth.
