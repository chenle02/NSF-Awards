For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely
investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics. This is true chiefly
because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of
unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and
electromagnetic). Results from string theory have also spilled over into many
other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories,
condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics. String theory has also led to
powerful new insights in mathematics. In this project, the Texas high-energy
theory group proposes to continue their quest for a deeper understanding of
string theory, focusing, in particular, on its connection with cosmology. Making
progress in this field requires a many-pronged approach, and the Texas high-
energy theory group plans to probe issues ranging from the proper mathematical
formulation of the theory to extracting its implications for low-energy physics.
At the same they also propose to proceed by following a pragmatic
phenomenological approach to questions in cosmology and physics beyond the
Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The envisioned broader impact activities of
this group include the professional training of graduate students and postdocs.
They also intend to continue their highly regarding outreach and education
activities. For example, Professor Weinberg has recently authored a number of
extremely well-received textbooks which are widely viewed as major contributions
to the dissemination of knowledge in the scientific community. He also gives
numerous public lectures. Likewise, Professor Distler authors a blog which
discusses and elucidates many of the important research papers which appear on
the daily arXiv listings, and he plans to continue his activity.
