A newly acquired aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) will be deployed at the PROPHET
(Program for Research on Oxidants: Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport)
site in Northern Michigan during the summer of 2001. The PI will attempt to
measure deposition fluxes of individual species associated with aerosol
particles. The size-segregated ambient aerosol composition will be measured at a
fast rate, including the ions sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Fluxes will be
determined using the eddy correlation method. This project is supported as a
Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) and is a collaboration with Aerodyne
Research Inc., the manufacturers of the AMS instruments.
