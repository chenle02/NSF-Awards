0124689&lt;br/&gt;Weller&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Henry Weller and students
from Duke in a collaboration with Hans Arends of the Institute for Nuclear
Physics at the University of Mainz, Germany. The project will focus on measuring
the validity of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule for the deuteron. The low-
energy part or the measurement will be performed in the US, with participation
by the German group, and the high-energy part of the measurement will be
performed on the Mainz Microtron in Germany. The measurements will compare the
sum rules on the neutron and proton to that on the deuteron, for which both
high- and low-energy measurements are required. A possible continuation of the
collaboration could then work on measuring the sum rule for Helium-3. The work
plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
