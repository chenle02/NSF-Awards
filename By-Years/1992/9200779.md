This research will increase our knowledge of biodiversity in the Amazonian
rainforest ecosystem of Brazil. The rate of deforestation in that area has
continued to accelerate in past decades in response to continuing human
interference. Many scientists have predicted great losses in biodiversity by the
early decades of the next century as well as significant changes in weather
patterns in response to burning and clearing forested areas. Yet we have
relatively little knowledge of the organisms that inhabit this great ecosystem.
Many areas remain unexplored, and there is a great paucity of information on the
systematics, phylogenetic relationships, and ecology of Amazonian plants and
animals. This proposal will focus on two groups of animals, reptiles and
amphibians, that play a vital role in the highly complex interactions that occur
among plants and animals. Amphibians, although not always conspicuous, can be
among the most abundant organisms in a given region, providing a significant
food source for many reptiles, birds, and mammals. By determining the numbers of
species and the ecological relationships among these two groups in a given area,
predictions can be made concerning the effects of large-scale conversions of
forested areas on the remaining biota. The reptile and amphibian faunas of nine
sites, adjacent to nine major river tributaries of the Amazon River and roughly
covering a circle north and south of the Amazon Riber, will be intensively
studied. The resulting data and specimens will provide answers to questions
related to the biogeography, ecology, and systematics of these organisms. In
addition, tissues and voucher specimens will be deposited in Brazilian and U.S.
museums and will provide valuable material for future studies on systematics and
on changes in distribution and abundance of these groups, Field guides, which
currently do not exist for these groups of organisms in Brazil, and popular and
scientific literature will result from this study.
