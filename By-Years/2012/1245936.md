Clemson Next-Net models a next-generation evolutionary campus network and
services for productive and innovative research and education. The project
builds upon existing work to expand Clemson's networking capabilities, enable
Software Defined Networking (SDN) in at least 20 buildings on campus, and
integrate high-speed campus research and education locations into the campus and
national OpenFlow based infrastructure. The completed network extension will
support significant new scientific research and education opportunities for
multiple departments, colleges, and research groups across Clemson that require
access to remote instruments and/or transfer large datasets. The project also
facilitates future advances in Clemson?s networking infrastructure and its
ability to connect to the national infrastructure.

The project provides a template for other universities who are planning similar
campus network transformations and are working directly with Clemson on cross-
campus projects in and beyond this project. Outreach, education, and training
activities are also engaging faculty, students, and IT staff on campus and
across campuses to leverage the created SDN network environment for their
research, education, and operational needs. Such a quantum change in their
perception of the networking and computing mechanism will provide users the
basis and incentive to create new use cases with the technology.
