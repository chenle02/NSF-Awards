Panda This project studies wormhole routing in clustered multiprocessor systems.
A clustered system raises new communication and synchronization issues in
parallel systems by deviating from the traditional assumption of one processor
per node. This project addresses these issues by: 1. developing communication
algorithms for frequently used communication patterns on clustered systems; 2.
developing synchronization mechanisms and algorithms to provide concurrent
intercluster and intracluster synchronization; and 3. developing guidelines and
architectural supports for interfacing processor clusters to k-ary n-cube
wormhole-routed networks. Theoretical and probabilistic analysis together with
simulation experiments are being used to develop and validate the results. This
research promises significant impact on the development of future clustered
scalable systems supporting various programming paradigms such as distributed-
memory, cache- coherent shared memory, and distributed-shared memory.
