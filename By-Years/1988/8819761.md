The theoretical connections between operational and denotational semantics, and
between semantics and logical theories, are being developed as a guide to
programming languages design and correctness. Principal topics include:
generalized type structures, especially polymorphism, in programming languages;
semantics and formal correctness theory of ALGOL-like and object- oriented
programming languages, and semantics of concurrent processes based on
observational congruence.
