Funds are provided to cost-share the acquisition and installation of a major new
computer facility at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. The facility
will be available to all investigators at Lamont and will be used in support of
oceanographic and other research projects. The new system is built around a
distributed network of workstations connected through an ethernet to fileservers
and peripherals at a central location. Modern hardware and networking techniques
have been incorporated that are especially configured for the predominately
observational nature of the basic research programs at Lamont. The networking
feature of the system also permits expansion as research requirements demand and
allows access to larger, remotely accessed computing facilities that are
increasingly used in geosciences numerical modelling.
