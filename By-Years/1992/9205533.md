This grant supports the research of Professor Daniel Goldston in analytic number
theory. Professor Goldston will use a new approximation to the von Mangoldt
lambda function to study problems that were previously examined with the circle
method. He will also study pair correlations of the zeros of zeta functions and
Siegel zeros. The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete realm
of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent on the notions of
continuity and limit, originating in calculus. The idea of using continuous
methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of
the modern analytic number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
