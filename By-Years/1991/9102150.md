Studies will be made of the composition of Dissolved Organic Mater (DOM) in
seawater using ultrafiltration as a means of isolating a larger, less altered,
and more representative fraction than has been possible with hydrophobic
adsorption techniques. The DOM isolates will be characterized by CP/MAS 13CNMR
and analyses of elemental and major biochemical composition, which together
should give a comprehensive assessment of their major structural features.
Selected additional experiments will be carried out to elucidate the biological
sources, environmental reactivities and analytical accountability of this
material.
