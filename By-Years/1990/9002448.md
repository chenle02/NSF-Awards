This research will use quantitative methods to discriminate tectonic from
eustatic components of sea level change during deposition of Pennsylvanian
cyclothems of North America and Northwest Europe. Techniques to be used include
(1) quantitative tectonic subsidence analysis, back-stripped with corrections
for compaction, sediment load, paleodepth and sea level change, (2) calculation
of tectonic plate stress and its effect on sea level change, and (3)
determination of the present-day elevation of Pennsylvanian shoreline sediments
so as to identify Pennsylvanian paleo-sealevel on a stable reference datum. New
criteria of the preserved position of sea level (so-called "sea level markers")
in coastal sedimentary rocks are available now to constrain the range of such
determinations. Paleodepths can be identified from this datum by measuring the
decompacted thickness of vertical sequences of shoreline facies. The decompacted
thickness of barrier island and tidal flat vertical sequences provides a
numerical estimate of the magnitude of eustatic change in sea level, and will be
used to make the eustatic sea level correction for tecotnic subsidence analysis.
Expected results include determining the exact present-day elevation of
Pennsylvanian sea level, and the numerical magnitude of both eustatic and
tectonic components of Pennsylvanian sea level change. The approach to be tested
herein can then be used to make similar determinations of eustatic and tectonic
controls on sea level in sedimentary rocks representing other periods of earth
history.
