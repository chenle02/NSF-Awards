Burns, Jack AST 96-16132 Dr. Burns will continue investigations of the
environments of clusters and groups of galaxies using observations at radio,
optical and X-ray wavelengths, along with numerical simulations using a code
which is a hybrid of N-body and hydrodynamics codes. The observations will
concentrate on 96 Abell clusters with a redshift near 0.2 and 24 X-ray bright,
distant clusters. The combination of modeling and observations will concentrate
on questions about the evolution of clusters, the intracluster medium, radio
galaxies and the general cluster galaxy population.
