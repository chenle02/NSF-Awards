The proposed research aims to enhance the use of computers in all phases of the
design, construction, and operation/maintenance of buildings, by creating an
open, interactive data environment to serve those activities. The funding will
support the activities of a multidisciplinary team including researchers from
university and industry, working toward development of an integrated generic
functional model of the construction process, and definition of an information
architecture which will support that process. Knowledge of the computer
integrated manufacturing area will aid the group in achieving the goal.
