The proposed program is to adapt the Heat Exchanger Method (HEM) for the growth
of ZnTe crystals. The integrity of the silica ampoule can be maintained during
HEM growth because there are no temperature gradients built into the heat zone
and a support structure for the ampoule can be used with minimal interference
for heat flow. It is intended to grow crystals under low superheat conditions
and to control the temperature gradient in the solid by the heat exchanger. ZnTe
has potential for applications involving green LEDs in optical displays, high
density recording and optical communications.
