9512540 Mathys The proposed project requests major research instrumentation
which consists of an RF channel simulator; microwave equipment for frequencies
up to 40 Ghz including a spectrum analyzer, mixers, phase shifters, etc.; a
frequency agile signal simulator; spread spectrum modems, fast A/D converters,
fast DSP boards, and three workstations with simulation software. The equipment
supports research and education in wireless and mobile communications. Planned
research projects are in areas of channel modeling, microwave transmitter and
receiver design and implementation, design and analysis of new modulation
methods including transmission and reception diversity, implementation of novel
concepts of detection, equalization and demodulation, design of multi-access
protocols, and adaptation of routing and flow control algorithms for wireless
environments. ***
