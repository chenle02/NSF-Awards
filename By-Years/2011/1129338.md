This engineering education research project seeks to introduce writing exercises
into engineering statics courses to improve foundational knowledge in this
engineering gateway course. The project team has demonstrated preliminary
results that show promise for using explanatory writing as a method to help
students learn conceptual and procedural aspects of statics. The project
includes both fundamental research on this approach that is well-grounded in
existing literature, and a plan to disseminate the results so that other
engineering programs can easily adopt the practices
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project will be to help students learn the engineering concepts in statics.
Statics is a "gateway" course in engineering; i.e. one that is taken by most
engineering students and is often a key factor in determining students' progress
in completing an engineering degree. Thus developing more effective methods of
teaching statics can result in improved retention in engineering and a reduction
in the time it takes students to earn an engineering degree. The approach taken
by the project team will require few changes in existing courses, and thus can
be broadly adopted at a diverse range of institutions.
