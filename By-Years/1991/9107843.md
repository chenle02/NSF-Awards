The PI request funds to operate the new Imaging Vector Magnetograph at Mees
Solar Observatory during the period of high solar activity, in support of both
Max '91 campaigns and individual research projects. The goals of his individual
research projects include: (1) to determine from photospheric vector
magnetograms whether coronal magnetic fields in flare-productive active regions
are demonstrably not only non-potential, but also non-force- free, and to
understand the origin of such departures; (2) to understand the morphological
relationship of photospheric magnetic fields and current systems to bulk
energization and nonthermal electron acceleration and precipitation in flares;
(3) to determine the temporal dependence of Ho polarization during flares, and
to understand its relationship to energetic protons in the ill-understood sub-
Mev range. ***
