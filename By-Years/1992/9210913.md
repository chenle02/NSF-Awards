New strategies for compiling large numerical programs will be explored in this
research. The use of hierarchical control flow graphs to facilitate fast
information propagation will be the major technique employed. This will exploit
hierarchies in program control thus allowing automatic parallelization in high
performance computing. A new compiler will be developed in order to demonstrate
the significance of this approach.
