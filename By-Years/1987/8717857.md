This research is directed towards developing suitable measurement methods and
related computer software for nondestructive characterization of the complex
permittivity of materials at UHF and microwave frequencies. An open-ended
coaxial line will be used to make permittivity measurements. A stationary
variational formulation for the aperture impedance of the coaxial opening on a
ground plane will be used to relate its input reflection coefficient with the
electrical properties of the sample medium. To start with, large sample media
will be considered. Thin dielectric sheet materials will be considered later.
The fourier transform method will be used to solve the case of thin dielectric
sheet materials, and possibilities of the surface wave excitation will be
considered.
