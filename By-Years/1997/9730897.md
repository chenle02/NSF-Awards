It is well known that it is highly desirable to operate scanning electron
microscopes at low voltages such as 1 kV. This is due to the fact that at low
voltages penetration of the incident electrons into the specimen is small and
any specimen damage is restricted to the surface layer. However, the use of low
voltages reduces the available resolution due to chromatic aberration effects.
The only practical way to avoid this problem is to use lenses of very short
focal length, but with a lens of conventional design this is not feasible. This
proposal will support continuing development of a prototype microscope in which
the lens of new design has been placed below the specimen. This makes lenses of
very short focal lengths feasible. Theoretically this development should improve
the resolving power of the microscope two, or even three, times over any
instrument that is currently available. The funds requested in this proposal
will be used both to refine the prototype microscope and demonstrate its
usefulness using well-characterized biological specimens.
