Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Complex Analysis Investigation is proposed in
differential geometry, geometric several variables, and methods of partial
differential equations in geometry, including the following specific topics: The
Bergman metric geometry of pseudo-convex domains, compact manifolds of non-
negative curvature, non-compact manifolds of non-negative curvature, the
spectrum of the Laplacian, and the geometry of orbifolds. The overall research
thrust of the project is the study of the relationship of the concept of
curvature to the global geometry, topology, and analysis of Riemannian manifolds
via geometric, complex analytic and partial differential equation methods.
