During the summers, the Aspen Center for Physics will serve as a meeting ground
where theoretical physicists and astrophysicists can gather to exchange ideas in
such areas as elementary particle physics, condensed matter physics,
astrophysics, and relativity. This exchange of ideas is crucial if there is to
be vigorous progress in these fields, and the Aspen Center is exceptionally
effective in fostering this exchange.
