This project deals with high temperature, Tc (>77K) superconducting material. It
deals with a novel method of current transmission by D.C. magnetic coupling in
these materials by using a chain of superconducting D.C. transformers linked by
a D.C. magnetic field. The practical limitations of the proposed linkage scheme
will be explored by initially using an ordinary insulated superconductor, such
as lead wire, and test its power transmission efficiency at liquid helium under
simulated load conditions. This will be followed by conducting similar
experiments using the high Tc superconducting oxide ceramic material at liquid
nitrogen.
