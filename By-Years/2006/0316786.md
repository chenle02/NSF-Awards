This project addresses a fundamental questions about the evolutionary
significance of non-Mendelian genetic transmission: female meiotic drive system
in hybrids between outcrosser Mimulus guttatus and selfer M. nasutus, two
closely related wildflowers. Evolutionary theory suggests that such elements may
be important factors in speciation. The primary goal of the projects is to
characterize the geographic extent, fitness effects and genetic mechanism(s) of
heterospecific meiotic drive. These studies will help answer the central
question of how species arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research bridges topics
from the ecology of natural populations to the molecular mechanisms of meiosis
and cell division. This project will involve undergraduate and graduate
students, particularly women, and will provide student researchers with an
introduction to genetic concepts and laboratory work in the context of natural
plant populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
