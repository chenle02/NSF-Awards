With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Instrument Development (CRIF:ID) Program, Professor Guyot-Sionnest of the
University of Chicago will develop a state-of-the-art laser system for
spectroscopy in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region. This new
instrumentation will be constructed from a diode-pumped Nd:YLF laser and two
optical parametric oscillators. It will provide two tunable laser pulses in the
2-10 micrometer range with high repetition rate, one wavenumber spectral
resolution, and 20-picosecond time resolution. This combination of features is
not available currently and will fill a valuable niche in chemical and physical
research. In the PI's research group, the new instrumentation will used to study
the spectra and dynamics of colloidal quantum dots and provide a tool for the
vibrational spectroscopy of surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several graduate
students will be intimately involved in constructing and using the new laser
system. Once constructed, it will allow the students to perform new experiments
that are not possible with current instrumentation. The new instrumentation will
also provide an improved and more reliable design for other researchers,
especially those involved in nonlinear spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;
