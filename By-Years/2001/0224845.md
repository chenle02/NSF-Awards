This award provides partial support for construction of new visitor housing at
the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL). The housing will
be used in support of an innovative scientific research apprenticeship training
program that brings together teams composed of faculty mentors, graduate
students and undergraduate apprentices who work in residence at the Laboratory
for 10 weeks during the academic year. Teams are selected from a national pool
of applicants by an external review committee on the basis of written
applications. The success and growth of this program has created a need for
additional, modern housing at the FHL, most of whose existing housing units were
built to serve as summertime housing. The program has a major impact on the
numbers and quality of undergraduate and graduate students who opt for
professional contributions to very high quality research programs nationally and
internationally. Through direct involvement with world-class mentors, students
learn how leading edge research is done, what some of the key questions in
marine science fields are, and what career opportunities
exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
