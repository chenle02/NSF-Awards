This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the Twentieth
ACM Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2019).
HotMobile, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special
Insterest Group on Mobile Systems (ACM SIGMOBILE), will be held in Santa Cruz,
California, February 27-28, 2019. HotMobile 2019 is the premier workshop
targeting mobile computing and system integration fields. Attending this event
will benefit the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to
the technical content of HotMobile 2019 will inspire students to address the
tough problems in their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of
scientific advances in mobile computing.

Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop
but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In
addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in mobile
computing research will be strongly encouraged. Up to 25 students will receive
travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2019.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
