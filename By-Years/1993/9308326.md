9308326 McPherson This research will test a theory arguing that groups gain and
lose members through the social network connections between individuals, and
through competition between groups for the time and other resources of the
people in the community. A previous NSF grant gathered data on 1050 individuals
and 254 groups in 10 communities. This new project will test group level
hypotheses through inductive coding and analysis of group level data, and it
will make the group data available to the public. The project will significantly
expand scientific understanding of the dynamics of growth and decline of
organizations, with potential benefit for corporations and voluntary groups as
well as advancing basic sociological theory. ***
