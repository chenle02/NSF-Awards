Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on an international
collaboration between US students from the University of South Florida (USF) and
students and researchers from the University of Science and Technology of
Beijing (USTB) China to conduct research related to Advanced Materials. For
twelve weeks, the teams of students will study advanced aspects of Materials
Science, specifically focusing on thin films and nanostructures, fracture and
corrosion. They will be supervised by three professors at USTB, Xiaolu Pang,
Kewei Gao and Lijie Qiao, along with the Principal Investigator. US students
will travel to Beijing for three months each of three summers. Training in
materials characterization will be provided to students from USF prior to the
international visit to ensure that they make meaningful contributions and have a
stimulating international research experience. Students will be encouraged to
publish their scientific results in journals. Students will also be encouraged
to disseminate and share their experience through presentations to diverse
audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this project, advanced materials
will be developed and the results of the research will be published and
disseminated through presentations. Students will form professional networks.
Overall, this project will contribute to the development of a new generation of
researchers trained with multidisciplinary and international skills.
