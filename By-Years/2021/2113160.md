This Community Instruments and Facilities (CIF) award makes the single-particle
soot photometer (SP2) at Clemson University available to the broader atmospheric
science community. The SP2 can be used to measure the mass of black carbon in
individual aerosol particles suspended in air. In addition, the advanced
capabilities of the SP2 allow direct measurement of black carbon mixing state,
or the degree to which black carbon is mixed with other, non-incandescing
chemical species, on a single-particle level. Funds awarded for this project
will provide support to keep the SP2 in a user-ready state for laboratory
studies, airborne field studies, and ground-based field deployments. The SP2
will be requestable by the scientific user community and provided with support
to make full use of the soot photometer data. This project also supports
outreach activities to reach a broader scientific community, to garner public
interest in science, and to increase diversity in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black carbon or
soot is an important aerosol type found in the atmosphere which is generated
from nearly every combustion process, including vehicle engines, factories, and
forest or agricultural fires. Soot aerosol is highly absorbing of sunlight,
which makes it an important component to understanding local heating,
micrometeorology, and long-range, long-term climate. Broader access to the SP2
instrument has the potential to advance knowledge in several topics concerning
atmospheric aerosol particles. This award will enhance the ability of the
broader scientific community to use the SP2 instrument at Clemson University
through the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences facility and instrument request
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
