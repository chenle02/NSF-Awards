In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Richard A. Mathies of the University of California at Berkeley will
conduct a series of investigations to determine the ground and excited-state
nuclear dynamics and structural changes that occur in condensed phase
photochemical and photobiological reactions and thereby understand their
molecular reaction mechanisms. The mode-specific nuclear dynamics that occur
immediately after excitation of a photochemically active system will be
determined by measuring and analyzing absolute laser resonance Raman vibrational
scattering intensities. Picosecond time-resolved resonance Raman and absorption
spectroscopy will be used to study the kinetics of ground-state photoproduct
formation and the structures and relaxation of ground-state photochemical
intermediates. The following studies will be pursued. 1) Photochemical ring-
opening, ring-closing and 1,7 hydrogen shift reactions of cyclic polyenes; 2)
the response of protein environment in bacteriorhodopsin and in
phycobiliproteins to the electronic excitation/photoisomerization of their bound
chromophoric prosthetic groups will be studied; 3) the photoexcitation of visual
pigment rhodopsin will be investigated; 4) the photochemical electron transfer
reaction in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers, and 5) the mechanism of
photochemical excitation of tetrapyrrole chromophore in phytochrome, the light
sensing pigment in plants, will be examined. These investigations probe the
basics of the interaction between light and photo-biologically active materials
and will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental processes which take
place in animate and inanimate living systems. The overall goal of this research
is to find general principles about how chemical reactions occur in condensed
phase photochemical systems at room temperature.
