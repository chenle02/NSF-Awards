Past experience has not used analytical techniques in the planning process for
the design of networks, such as highways, water distribution systems, mass
transit bus systems, and other types of total systems. This project will
investigate, develop, and test a procedure for optimal network design which has
variable demands. The procedure will be based on continuous, geometric analysis
methods. The model will consider idealized conditions such as uniform grids,
radial or circumferential geometry which are not uncommon in actual service. The
results will be of great benefit to network planners and engineers in designing
new systems and evaluating existing systems with variable factors of use.
