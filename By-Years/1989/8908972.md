This research project addresses the molecular basis of neural crest
differentiation. The approach will be to identify and characterize specific
genes that are developmentally regulated in a neural crest derived cell line.
Glucocorticoid treatment of human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells induces
differentiation to a thyroid endocrine C.cell phenotype that is highlighted by
increased calcitonin synthesis and secretion. The glucocorticoid induction of
calcitonin expression is due to an increased transcription rate and a bias in
the alternative RNA processing choice to favor calcitonin mRNA production
instead of CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide). To gain insight into these
and other regulatory events that determine neural crest phenotype, the strategy
will be to use subtractive cDNA cloning to isolate genes that are
developmentally regulated in the medullary thyroid carcinoma cells. Selected
cDNA clones will then be used as molecular tags to follow the plasticity of
neural crest cells during rat embryogenesis. To identify genes that might
control cell differentiation, selected cDNA clones and antisense copies of those
clones, will be introduced into medullary thyroid carcinoma cells in an attempt
to affect the cell differentiation process. These specific clones will provide
useful markers and tools for studying neural crest differentiation to neurons
and endocrine C cells and should potentially reveal some of the key factors in
cell differentiation and neuronal plasticity.
