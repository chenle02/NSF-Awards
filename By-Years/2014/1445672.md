University of California-Berkeley Title: EAGER: Collaborative Research: Cloaking
in stratified fluids

The objective of the proposed research is to explore the possibility of
developing and deploying the equivalent of an "invisibility cloak" to render
floating wind energy harvesting turbines invisible to ocean surface waves.
Invisibility cloaks, made of metamaterial, have identified as one of the top ten
important discoveries in solid state physics, optics, and acoustics in the first
decade of 21st century, but this is now being discussed in the context of fluid
mechanics and water waves.

Intellectual Merit An invisibility cloak for an object at the water surface can
be accomplished when the surface waves detour the object as if the object does
not exist, i.e., when there is no diffraction. An important consequence of such
a cloaking is that floating structures and objects in a cloaked region will be
protected from powerful incoming surface waves. The proposed research will take
first strides into this area in a fluid mechanics context by using a combined
theoretical, computational, and experimental approach. The research is focused
on the effect of buoyancy jump (typical of oceans and lakes), viscosity,
inertia, diffusion, and non-uniformities of seabed topography on cloaking in
both sharp and continuous stratified fluids.

Broader Impacts This research program can lead to designing new strategies to
protect moving and stationary ocean objects (ships, submarines, offshore
platforms such as wind turbines) from disruptive effects of oceanic waves. In
this work, fundamental fluid mechanics will be used to augment this area of
aquatic science and oceanography. The proposed research is potentially
transformative in that this area of fluid mechanics has to date gone mostly
unexplored. The grant will also provide partial support for training two
graduate students. The participation of women and members of underrepresented
groups will be facilitated through the Women's Engineering Program at University
of California Berkeley and Notre Dame. The PIs will ensure the participation of
undergraduates through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at both
Berkeley and Notre Dame.
