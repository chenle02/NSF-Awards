Cell membranes are subject to structural and functional damage when irradiated
in the presence of photosensitizing pigments. A prominent form of such damage is
lipid peroxidation, which can result in altered fluidity, increased
permeability, and other effects. Photosensitized lipid peroxidation in
biological systems has not been well studied in terms of reaction pathways,
cytotoxic effects, and protective/repair mechanisms. The overall objective of
this research is to improve our understanding of membrane lipid peroxidation in
each of these areas. A comprehensive and diversified program of work is planned,
using model systems initially (liposomes, erythrocyte membranes) and then
cultured cells (murine L1210 cells). The sensitizers of interest are non-bound
uroporphyrin, and membrane-bound protoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin derivative
(HPD). Model Studies: (a) Extensive work is planned involving cholesterol (Ch)
as an in situ probe of Type I (free radical) vs Type II (singlet oxygen)
pathways of lipid peroxidation. (b) Amplification of photoinitiated lipid
peroxidation by ascorbate will be investigated from a system-oriented
perspective, e.g. effects of hydrogen peroxide and oxyradicals. (c) Long-range
peroxidation (with sensitizer and target lipid in separate membrane
compartments) will be studied for the first time. (d) Reductive metabolism
(detoxification) of photoperoxides will be examined, using the glutathione
reductase/peroxidase system. Cell Studies: (a) The first experiments to exploit
Ch as a mechanistic probe in living cells will be carried out using (14C- Ch in
HPD-sensitized L1210 cells. (b) The relationship between photoperoxidation and
cytolethality will be investigated by (i) comparing lipid peroxide content and
survivability, and (ii) determining how depletion of glutathione or glutathione
peroxidase affects photosensitivity. The biochemical mechanisms and effects of
lipid peroxidation on the integrity and function of biological membranes is of
very great fundamental importance. Information that will be derived from this
research will have implications in enhancing our basic knowledge of such diverse
areas as the mechanisms by which light interacts with photoreceptors, the
mechanisms by which leukocytes kill bacteria, and the reasons that cultured
cells, when studied under the light microscope for periods of time, may behave
differently from cells in the organism.
