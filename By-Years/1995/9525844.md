This is a three-year project to synthesize and analyze the air-sea interaction
observations made during the IOP of TOGA COARE in order to understand the
response of the upper ocean to the atmospheric events on different time scales.
The important specific tasks to be achieved are the following: (1) synthesis of
in-situ air-sea flux data incorporating other remotely sensed and model-
generated data and the production of gridded surface flux fields of high
resolution near the center of the Intensive Flux Array (IFA) and of low
resolution over the IFA; (2) isolate the periods when the processes of mixing
are essentially one dimensional and try to understand the detailed physics with
the help of one dimensional model; and (3) utilizing the gridded data that
provides temporal and spatial variation over the larger area, drive a three-
dimensional ocean model to understand the detailed response physics of the upper
ocean to such spatially and temporally varying surface forcing. The improved
understanding of the flux parameterizations and the processes that maintain the
warm pool will improve our ability to predict SST over the warm pool, and thus
enhance our climate prediction capabilities.***
