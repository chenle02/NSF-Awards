The Institute for Genomic Research, TIGR, has developed tools for annotation and
a complex web display for presenting this information to the scientific
community. The annotation system includes software that allows its annotation
staff to initate a bacterial annotation project, update that data with manual
curation, and to electronically publish that data on TIGR's web site and at
GenBank. TIGR web display includes a database system with the capability of
representing all completed microbial genomes, graphical displays, and the
ability to allow users to perform complex ad hoc queries on that data.

The above tools were designed strictly for the purpose of running those software
locally at TIGR or on TIGR web servers. The current project will provide
resources for the development of software that will be used by scientists to run
those software locally on their own machines. This will allow users easy access
to annotation systems that are consistent with the well-developed set of
standard operational procedures developed at TIGR and will help ensure
consistency of annotation across many sequencing centers. By placing the
software developed at TIGR in the hands of users, they will also be able to
modify and improve upon the representation system, and use the graphical display
to promote individual analysis of bacterial genome information.
