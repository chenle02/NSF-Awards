The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use voice as a real-time measurement of
mental health. Transforming voice intonations into biomarkers could enable
disease diagnosis and progression, supporting the $13 B virtual health care
sector that was growing 27% annually prior to COVID-19. Furthermore, peer
support for mental health increases engagement in self-care decreases substance
use and depression, particularly for vulnerable populations. The project will
advance the use of machine learning for voice mental health biomarkers in a
group setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will define voice biomarker features for a deep
reinforcement learning based system. This project will advance a voice biomarker
technology that can serve as fast behavioral health diagnostic, potentially
superseding the current paper-based PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tests. The priority is to
scale the optimal mix of individuals and activities for group therapy based on
reward functions that maximize improvements in depression and anxiety scores.
The major technical challenges include: (1) capturing nonverbal cues in a video;
(2) interpreting multi-speaker audio processing; (3) creating deep reinforcement
learning models to serve relevant group matches and follow-up exercises; and (4)
building engaging visual feedback of progress from group meetings. The
anticipated technical result of this innovation will be to define voice
biomarker features and reward functions for a deep reinforcement learning based
system in clinically relevant settings to improve depression and anxiety
treatment outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
