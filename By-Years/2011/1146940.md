Despite its importance to the continuation of species, the differentiation of
primordial germ cells into functional oocytes is poorly understood. Primordial
germ cells begin to differentiate into oocytes during embryonic development in
the mouse. The oocytes develop in clusters called germline cysts, a conserved
phase of oocyte development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. During late
fetal and early neonatal development, mouse germ cell cysts break apart into
single oocytes (cyst breakdown) that become surrounded by pre-granulosa cells to
form primordial follicles (follicle formation). During the process of cyst
breakdown, a subset of cells in each cyst die with only a third of the initial
number of oocytes surviving to form primordial follicles. The mechanisms that
control cyst breakdown, oocyte survival and follicle assembly are currently
unknown. However, recent work suggests estrogen signaling may play an important
role in maintaining oocytes in cysts. The project goal is to understand the role
of estrogen signaling in cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation.
Establishing the role of estrogen signaling in neonatal oocyte differentiation
will elucidate mechanisms leading to formation of the primordial follicle pool.
This work will to contribute to our knowledge of conserved mechanisms of germ
cell differentiation and lead to a better understanding of mammalian
infertility. In addition to its impact on ovarian function, the project will
foster education and training through active participation of both undergraduate
and graduate students. Community outreach will be achieved by revival of a
program that brings together scientists and nonscientists in the community and
by participation in a local science program for high school girls.
