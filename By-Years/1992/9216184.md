Both the social sciences and the Federal Statistical System are vitally
dependent on survey research tools. The knowledge required to use and refine
these tools is unusually broad, drawing on a blend of many disciplines. As a
result, the current organization of U.S. universities does not serve well the
needs of innovative survey research. NSF funding for the Center for Survey
Methods in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area offers a chance to overcome
the weaknesses of current programs. The University of Maryland, University of
Michigan, and Westat, Inc., jointly propose to create and staff a Center for
Survey Methods located at the University of Maryland's College Park Campus.
Stanley Presser will be the Director; Robert M. Groves, the Associate Director.
Existing Maryland staff will be supplemented by a permanent Michigan team
located at College Park, a Westat team , and video instruction by Michigan
faculty from Ann Arbor. The curriculum will pool existing Maryland courses,
existing courses of the Michigan Summer Institute in Survey Research Techniques,
newly created specialty courses, and a series of short courses targeted to the
needs of the Federal Statistical System staff. An evolutionary strategy is
proposed for the Center, starting with easily developed and time-proven courses
and organizational ties, to a fully integrated course structure blending theory
and practice and increased integration across organizations. The research
program of the Center will be built around the selection of faculty devoted to
ongoing research, research uses of a survey practicum, small seed grants,
Master's research experience requirement, the research activities of visiting
scholars, and a research design seminar. One measure of the Center's success
will be collaborative research involving Center faculty and other survey
statisticians and methodologists who are affiliated faculty and/or located on
other campuses. This strategy will be critical in advancing the field of survey
methodology.
