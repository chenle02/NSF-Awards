The proposed project is on the filtration of fibrous aerosols using nuclepore
and fibrous filters. Fibers tend to align with the flow and penetrate the
filters. The fiber orientation in filter will be determined using holographic
and image processing techniques developed for ultrafine fibers with submicron
diameters. The results will be compared with filter efficiency measurements
complemented with a theoretical model. The project will provide unique
experimental results on the micromechanical aspects of a fiber motion in a
filter and filter efficiency, with application in environmental control,
semiconductor industry, biology and medical sciences.
