In order to mitigate the spread of Ebola infections, detecting the virus in
patients before the onset of symptoms is imperative. This requires, fast,
sensitive and specific detection of the virus. Current methods lack sensitivity
and ease of use. This project will adapt the author's previous method for
detecting ultra low Ebola concentration in patient's blood. Two new methods will
be developed; one can be used in the field and the second one, which is more
rigorous, is suitable for laboratory tests. These methods are expected to reduce
the rate at which Ebola epidemic spreads.



Currently quantitative PCR is the state-of-the-art for Ebola detection,
typically from blood samples. These tests though, are time intensive and require
a high degree of expertise to perform. Further the method is useful when viral
concentration is relatively high in the patient. Given the need to test large
numbers of people as a part of quarantine strategies, improved early diagnostics
are imperative. Therefore the aim of the project is to develop a more sensitive
approach to detecting Ebola viral RNA (vRNA) and single viral particles. The
research team will develop a single tube assay for detecting viral RNA in whole
blood, suitable for field application. In addition, a slide-based assay for
detecting single viral particles will also be developed, through the detection
of vRNA-protein interactions, with single virion sensitivity suitable for a
laboratory setting. In both cases, peptide labeled, single RNA sensitive, RNA
imaging probes and proximity ligation assay (PLA) methods will be utilized. The
results will be compared with current methods to demonstrate the improved
sensitivity. The combinations of both site-specific probe binding and distance-
dependent detection and amplification, will ensure both specificity (zero
errors) and sensitivity (<10 copies/ml).
