A six week summer program in mathematical physiology will be held during the
summer of 1992 at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in
Berkeley, California. The primary focus of the program is the application of
mathematics to cellular neuroscience and integrative physiology. The goals of
the program are to further ongoing collaborative research between mathematicians
and biologists, to demonstrate to the biology and mathematics community the
importance and the excitement of research in this field, and to bring new
mathematicians into the field by directly involving them in collaborations. The
program is organized into 4 two week workshops and 4 one week workshops
organized primarily around biological topics.
