9422771 Biswas This group of 3 faculty and a senior research staff member at the
University of Notre Dame and 4 graduate students participate in experimental
operations at Fermilab (FNAL) with the DO group. Their particular interests are
top quark properties and processes that confront QCD predictions in antiproton-
proton annihilations. They also are intensely involved in design and
construction of new tracking instrumentation to be installed in the DO detector
as a component of the current upgrade project. For application at future
accelerators they pursue R&D to improve tracking capabilities at higher
intensity, higher energy environments. ***
