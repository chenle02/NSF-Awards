This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by
Professor Thomas R. Krugh at the University of Rochester. REU students will
participate in a 10 week summer program. The primary focus for REU students will
be full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established research
team. Each participant will have a specific research problem, a specific faculty
adviser, and a specific mentor to provide day-to-day advice. A weekly REU Group
Meeting provides a forum for participants to report their research to each other
early in the summer in the form of an oral presentation, and again at the end of
the program in a poster presentation and final written report. Participants will
learn from each other, and about other areas of chemistry in the oral and poster
presentations. They will participate in a variety of social activities, the
group will have sessions on careers, they will visit the Laboratory for Laser
Energetics, and have a mini-course on entrepreneurship in chemistry. Recruitment
of students will give emphasis to the participation of underrepresented
minorities, women, and lower division
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will complete an independent
research project, gain an appreciation of life as a graduate student in
chemistry, participate in the excitement of discovery, gain in-depth knowledge
in their research area, and be exposed to research in other areas through oral
presentations and a poster session. The Group Meetings also will be used to
discuss graduate education, scientific careers, responsible conduct of research
and scientific ethics. Graduate student mentors will experience a valuable
learning experience in leadership.
