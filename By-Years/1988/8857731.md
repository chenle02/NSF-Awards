The principal investigator (PI) proposes to conduct research in the area of
distributed communication networks, with particular emphasis on their design and
control. Research will focus on developing a realistic understanding of the
transient behavior of distributed communication networks. The aim is to provide
design methodologies for minimizing the frequency of occurrence of undesirable
events such as buffer overflows and inordinately large delays--the disruptions
principally responsible for performance degradation in networks.
