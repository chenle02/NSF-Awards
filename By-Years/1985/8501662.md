The objectives of this research include improvement of the correlation between
atmospheric spectral data and the haze index, and determination of the temporal
and spatial variations of haze layers as steps toward being able to map them.
The San Joaquin River Basin has been selected as the site for this study because
of its large variations in climate and evaporation, high occurance of haze, and
ready availability of information and data relating to the variability and
composition of haze. Results of this project may be directly applicable to land
and water resource management and in conduct of atmospheric modeling and studies
of air pollution.
