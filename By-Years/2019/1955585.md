The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation supports the research program of Professor Evgeny Dikarev of the SUNY
at Albany. This project focuses on manufacturing important materials for battery
applications under mild conditions; this is known as a soft chemistry‚Äù approach.
The main targets are the next generation of rechargeable battery materials.
Rechargeable batteries represent a critical component of the growing energy
storage field, focused on renewable and green energy sources. In relation to
sustainability issues, this project seeks strategies for the efficient
replacement of expensive metals such as platinum with abundant elements such as
sodium, magnesium, and iron. Battery safety issues are also under consideration.
The project lays the ground work for new technologies that can be adopted for
the fabrication of advanced rechargeable battery materials. In support of the
broader impacts of the project, Dr. Dikarev is actively engaged in a program of
national interest to create a database of new designer drugs that can be
utilized by forensic investigation laboratories across the country for the
identification of illicit substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
develops new synthetic approaches for the predictable design of
heterotrimetallic compounds whose molecular structures and ratios make them good
precursors for the low temperature preparation of targeted materials.
Specifically, precursors are prepared and explored for the synthesis of
prospective cathode materials that are difficult or impossible to obtain by
conventional high-temperature techniques. The targeted materials are the oxide,
fluoride, silicate, and phosphate cathode materials of rechargeable batteries.
These contain specific A/M/M' (A = lithium, sodium, magnesium; M, M' = 3d
transition metal) combinations, which are duplicated in the heterotrimetallic
precursors. With the broad choice of targets the extent to which the molecular
precursor technique can be utilized in complex materials synthesis is explored.
The major practical outcome of this research is to demonstrate if single-source
precursors can facilitate the preparation of multimetallic materials with high
purity, exact stoichiometry, low preparation temperature, nanosized particle
morphology, clean surface, and, especially, highly homogeneous metal
distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
