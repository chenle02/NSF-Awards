Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Root and Rhizobiome
Innovation (CRRI) promises to break new ground in understanding of how plants
interact with their environment via their root systems, with the goal of
applying that knowledge to provide society with new technologies for more secure
and resilient food systems. The project is built upon an excellent statewide
foundation of research facilities and expertise, while also making critical
improvements to this research infrastructure. Much of this knowledge will be
made publicly available online. The Center will be strongly integrated across
many disciplines, involving scientists and engineers with expertise in plant
systems, chemical ecology, and microbiology, among others. In parallel with its
research agenda, the project will continue several successful programs that
provide outreach and workforce development opportunities aimed at improving the
accessibility of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
education throughout the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description
&lt;br/&gt;The CRRI will employ integrated systems and synthetic biology
approaches to investigate plant root metabolism and its interdependence on the
near-root soil microbial community (i.e., the rhizobiome). The genetic
variability of maize lines will be studied in the context of their influence on
root exudate production and in turn on the rhizobiome. These results will be
used to develop improved models to describe genetic influences on plant systems
behavior and to drive the development of new engineered maize lines with
improved responses to abiotic stresses. The project will lead to improved
understanding of the genetic diversity of plant roots and the rhizobiome. It
will also lead to technological advances toward the engineering of
agriculturally vital crops.
