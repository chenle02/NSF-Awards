IPS-2 is a performance measurement system for parallel and distributed
programs. It allows application programmers to measure their parallel programs
(both shared-memory and distributed), and produce execution profiles, graphs,
and high-level analyses. IPS-2 is in current use on VAX, DECstation (MIPS-
based), and Sequent Symmetry computers, and has been used for a wide variety of
performance tasks. The goal of this project is to adapt and port IPS-2 to the
supercomputer environment; specifically for the CRAY Y/MP under UNICOS.
Providing IPS-2 under UNICOS will allow the system to be available to several of
the NSF Supercomputer sites. This effort will place powerful performance tools
in the hands of an important class of parallel programmers, i.e., those writing
sophisticated scientific applications. IPS-2 should simplify the analysis of
complex programs, and make more efficient use of both hardware and programmer
resources. The combination of the Wisconsin IPS-2 group and the NSF San Diego
Supercomputer Center staff provides both the performance measurement experience
and the Cray UNICOS expertise to successfully transfer the IPS-2 system to a
broader audience of researchers.//
