Further development of an interactive software product to aid in the building
of model proteins is proposed. Dr. Lee proposes to refine, incorporate, and test
four new algorithms in the program. The first is the incorporation of secondary
structure information into the algorithm for the automatic locations of
conserved regions in the proteins. It will prevent inappropriate sections of the
reference proteins from being classified as being conserved. The second is the
adding of a method for generating loops in the variable regions. They will be
more random in nature than those currently found in a structural database, and
will span more of conformational space. The third is an algorithm for
systematically searching possible conformations for side chains. It will help
find a set of self-consistent rotamers that pack well. The fourth is an
algorithm to incorporate low resolution crystal data into the model. It uses
simulated annealing using x-carbon coordinates as distance constraints to find a
folded protein conformation with little input structural information. It can
also be applied in a more limited way as an adjunct to other model building
methods. Taken together, these new methods will be of great use to the
researchers who use the software product.
