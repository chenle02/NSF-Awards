The proposed work expands research on expertise beyond traditional descriptive
or normative analyses by creatively using statistical methods to define and
measure informational and perceptual patterns of experts. Presently, methods to
conduct such analyses of experts do not exist. The proposed studies extend
previous laboratory work to a complex field setting (medical decision making).
However, the methods and results should be relevant for any domain that requires
the understanding and application of large amounts of specialized knowledge. The
proposed research investigates the ability of expert physicians to solve novel
diagnostic problems. Using a generative approach, hypotheses are developed
regarding the knowledge used by physicians to perform a complex diagnosis task.
These hypotheses are tested using descriptions of physicians' knowledge
constructed from analyses of patient records. Performance on these cases will be
examined for evidence of generativity including fluency, strategic problem
solving, and use of general heuristics. The study extends previous
investigations of generativity to professional judgment and explicitly examines
the relationship between perceptual and strategic aspects of problem solving.
