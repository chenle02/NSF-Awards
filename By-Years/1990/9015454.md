Dr. T.L. Yates and Mr. J.A. Cook of the University of New Mexico and Dr. S.
Anderson of the American Museum of Natural History will continue their survey
work on mammalian diversity in Bolivia, by conducting five elevational transects
through the Andes Mountains in the Yungas and Valles region between 500 and 3000
M and obtain representative specimens, genetic material, and parasites from all
ecological zones. The study is also designed to involve Bolivian students and
professionals, thus, providing training in conservation and biodiversity, and to
continue to collaborate with and expedite the studies of other workers doing
research on South American mammals. Few South American countries are as
biologically unknown as Bolivia. This is particularly true of the largely
unexplored, biologically diverse regions to be examined in this study. Much of
this area has been opened to large scale development and deforestation.
Information provided by this study will provide a critical baseline for
evaluating the future impact of this development on the biodiversity of the
region and will provide an important database for broad scale comparative
research. It will also provide important training for Bolivian biologists
wishing to continue this type of work in Bolivia.
