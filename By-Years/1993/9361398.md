9361398 Zang Two-dimensional spatial light modulators (2DSLM) are key to every
optical signal/computing architecture. However, 2DSLMs have not been well
developed for practical applications due to a lack of high quality nonlinear
optical (NLO) material and inadequacies in the device concept. Current 2DSLMs
greatly limit the development of optical signal processing. MetroLaser proposes
to develop an innovative, two-dimensional optically addressed, thresholding, and
erasable 2DSLM. The proposed 2DSLM is based on a nonlinear Fabry-Perot
interferometer modulator with cavity material made of bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a
newly developed nonlinear optical (NLO) photochromic protein. The proposed
device utilized the large refractive index change of BR in the Fabry-Perot
cavity to alter the device optical transmission. This device is expected to have
excellent spatial resolution, high optical sensitivity, easy erasability,
simple, adjustable thresholds, random address capability, enormous pixel density
and high contrast. If this project succeeds, it will be a major breakthrough in
the real-time, high speed optical implementation of pattern recognition, optical
computing, neural network, and nonlinear imaging processing. The Phase I effort
will consist of analytical and experimental work aimed at evaluating spatial
resolution, sensitivity, write/erase cycles, and fabrication procedures of the
BR-SLM. ***
