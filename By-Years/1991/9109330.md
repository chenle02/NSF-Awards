The conductance through a quantum point was discovered in 1988 to be a multiple
of the quantum conductance 2e2/h. This quantum behavior may have an important
impact on the development of future generation of electronic devices. The focus
of this project is to study the interaction between far- infrared photons and
electrons in quantum point contacts. It is expected that this conductance can be
modulated by a small-amplitude far-infrared radiation. By absorbing photons, the
electrons can raise their energies to above the level of a subband in the
quantum point contact and contribute to conduction. This effect is similar to
photon-assisted tunneling in superconducting tunnel junctions. The result of
this research may substantially improve our understanding of the quantum
transport phenomena, and the interaction between electrons and photons in the
quantum transport processes. If the effect is verified experimentally, novel
long-wavelength optoelectronic devices, such as optically controlled switches
and modulators, photon detectors and heterodyne mixers, can be constructed.
