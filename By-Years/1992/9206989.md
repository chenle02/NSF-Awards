The principal investigator will work on several problems in the areas of
control theory, optimaization, nonsmooth analysis, and their applications.
Effective qualitative and numerical methods for studying and solving complex
problems in nonlinear optimization and control will be developed. Optimal
control problems are useful as mathematical models in many areas of engineering
and operations management. By better understanding their structure and
properties, the gained insight will lead to improved numerical optimaization
algorithms.
