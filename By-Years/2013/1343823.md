This award will support student travel to 22nd International Conference on
Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2013). The conference is
being held in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 2013. PACT is a leading
conference on parallel architectures, compilers, languages, algorithms, and
applications. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and
workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include
building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as
providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.
