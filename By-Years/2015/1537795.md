Stochastic processing networks have been used to model large-scale service
systems including customer contact centers and hospital operations. Due to the
complexity of a stochastic processing network, it is often difficult or
impossible to compute its performance measures in a timely manner. Diffusion
models offer efficient approximations for various classes of stochastic
processing networks. If successful, the research will contribute to the creation
of new analytical tools for accurate staffing and quality customer service at
customer contact centers. It will also contribute to the creation of analytical
tools for hospital inpatient flow management.

The research will establish convergence rates of steady-state diffusion
approximations. The established convergence rates guarantee the accuracy of the
steady-state diffusion approximation of a stochastic processing network with
given system parameters, which are not necessarily going to any limit. The PI
plans to fully develop a framework that is based on Stein's method to prove the
convergence rates. The framework currently has four components: Poisson
equations and gradient bounds, generator coupling, state space collapse, and
moment bounds. The framework, with possible addition of other key components,
will be developed and demonstrated through two classes of stochastic processing
networks: multiple pools of many-server systems and networks of single-server
queues.
