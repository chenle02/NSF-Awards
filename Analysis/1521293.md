Do and his collaborators will use new methods to investigate several questions
related to Fourier analysis and its applications to completely integrable
systems. This project concerns convergence of Fourier series along `thin' sub-
sequences of partial sums, as motivated by a conjecture of Konyagin; extensions
of classical and non-classical estimates related to Fourier series to weighted
settings, with motivations coming from work of Germain-Masmoudi-Shatah in
partial differential equations; a new approach to Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics
of orthogonal polynomials with rough varying weights, motivated by applications
in spectral study of unitary random matrices and by applications in other non-
commutative examples of the Fourier transform; and sharp estimates for lower-
order terms in long-time asymptotics of Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur integrable
equations, with additional motivations coming from studies of perturbation of
integrable equations. This mathematics research project is in the area of
harmonic analysis, in which data is analyzed by breaking it into more manageable
components. An important tool is the Fourier transform, which provides methods
to decompose complicated signals into basic waves. These decompositions and
related techniques have a number of useful applications in engineering and other
applied sciences. For example, in image processing, harmonic analysis is useful
in de-noising images and analyzing image structures. More generally, harmonic
analysis could be used in signal processing to compress and decompress data,
allowing for very large amounts of information to be effectively transmitted
with manageable errors. Other variants of the Fourier transform also appear in
statistics and mathematical physics. One such variant occurs in the study of
energy levels of random physical systems. This research project seeks to improve
the understanding of the above studies by investigating fundamental properties
of the new variants of the Fourier transform.
