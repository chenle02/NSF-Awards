9418264 Gromet The Scandinavian Caledonides provide an unusual opportunity to
study events and processes associated with a continental collision because it is
relatively simple, involving a single orogenic cycle, and is eroded so that both
allochthonous and autochthonous rocks are exposed. This project, in conjunction
with researchers in Norway and Sweden, is directed at providing improved time
constraints on tectonic processes such as subduction leading to high-pressure
metamorphism and assembly of a tectonostratigraphy by major thrust imbrication.
Detailed geochronlogic studies will use high-precision U-Pb and other methods to
directly date metamorphism and deformational fabrics in key areas. Results,
along with field structural studies, will lead to more precise understanding of
the development of this classic orogen.
