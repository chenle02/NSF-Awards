This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to
capitalize on the Phase I success of an innovative self-sensing of composite
structural damage utilizing the electrical conductivity of carbon (graphite)
composite materials for structural health monitoring (SHM). The Phase II project
is intended to provide a full-scale development (FSD) technology for composite a
structural self-diagnostic (CSSD) system/technique. The necessary
hardware/software and implementation procedures, such as microchip-based nodal
electrical conductivity acquisition electronic circuitry, composite structural
self-monitoring computer hardware and software will be incorporated in the CSSD
device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSSD technology should prevent the catastrophic
failures of aircraft and rotorcraft by predicting impending failures of flight-
critical composite structural components. The system hardware/software will be
demonstrated on new commercial passenger jet aircraft and military aircraft. The
application of the CSSD technology should reduce the maintenance cost of the
aircraft and rotorcraft due to automated structural health monitoring and
diagnostic feature.
