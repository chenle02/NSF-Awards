As a result of rapid growth in the field of molecular biology, recent
technological advances enable measuring the expression of thousands of genes
simultaneously. However, simply measuring the expressions of multiple individual
genes is insufficient to understand complex biological systems. To relate gene
expressions to physiological states and environmental factors, gene expression
networks are utilized. These networks enable the identification of previously
unknown macroproperties of biological systems that emerge from interactions of
multiple genes. Revealing these emerging properties relies on the precision of
network reconstruction from experimental data. The major limitation for network
reconstruction is usually the number of samples available for the study. This
project develops a mathematical foundation for a new method of biological
network reconstruction that relies on fundamental principles that connect
correlation and causality. Reconstructing gene networks will lead to greater
understanding of complex biological systems.

This project develops a new and more precise method of biological network
reconstruction based on measuring the Proportion of Unexpected Correlations
(PUC). This research extends into the mathematical theory of correlation
inequalities and its applications. By using probability theory and statistical
mechanics, this project will improve the precision in identifying the proportion
of false gene connections attributed to noisy data in gene networks. This
project has four primary components: (i) PUC investigations of interactions
between the microbiome and host transcriptome; (ii) experimental validation the
mathematical approach using metagenomic data; (iii) the development of a
Cytoscape plug-in for the PUC analysis of biological data; (iv)
interdisciplinary student research training in Systems Biology and Mathematics.
