Theoretical research on the interface of particle physics and cosmology will be
performed over the next five years. Models of particle physics attempting to
unify the four fundamental forces necessarily involve energies inaccessible to
present day accelerators. In the standard Big Bang model of the early universe,
however, extremely high temperatures and densities are present and lend a
background for testing unified models. Necessary observational consequences of a
unified theory should include, for example, a matter-antimatter asymmetry and
the correct abundances of light nuclear isotopes. The resulting goal of such a
program is thus to further our understanding of the forces of nature as well as
the evolutionary history of the Universe. The work will be carried out by a
highly-distinguished young physicist who is one of the new Presidential Young
Investigators for 1987.
