The goal of this project is to provide access to Global Positioning Satellite
(GPS) surveying technology to undergraduate surveying students in both the BT
(4-year) and AAS (2-year) surveying programs at the institutions involved in the
project. The project involves the utilization of two dual-frequency, geodetic
GPS receivers as well as accompanying software and peripherals. The project
allows the development of new laboratory exercises in several bachelor- and
associate-level land surveying courses, and allows for exposure of the
technology to students in other programs such as construction. Also, the project
emphasizes dissemination of state-of-the-art technology to undergraduate
students at several colleges.
