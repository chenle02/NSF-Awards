The Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) will establish a Committee on
Gravitational Physics to carry out an assessment of the field's status and plans
for the future. The committee will examine such factors as the development of
gravitational physics over the last decade and the relationship of gravitational
physics to other scientific fields. In addition, the committee will examine the
U.S. effort in gravitational physics compared to that of other countries and
will attempt to identify the opportunities in the field over the next decade.
The study will be part of the BPA's survey of physics.
