9452167 Wolf An instrumented laboratory is being developed for teaching
geophysical field methodologies that are used in environmental investigations to
undergraduate students. The students benefitting the most are those with majors
in geology, geological engineering, earth sciences, and environmental sciences
who are enrolled in the Auburn University Department of Geology's classes in
applied geophysics and field methods, the Department of Civil Engineering's
classes in subsurface hydrology and measurements, and laboratories associated
with these and other classes within Geology and Engineering. The equipment is
being used in a variety of local settings to demonstrate techniques of data
acquisition and experiment design that are useful in environmental assessments.
Four pieces of geophysical equipment, all used in environmental analyses, are
being integrated into the curriculum: 1) a 24-channel Digital Instantaneous
Floating Point (DIFP) Signal Stacking Seismograph; 2) a DC Resistivity unit; 3)
a Proton Magnetometer, and 4) an Electromagnetic Ground Conductivity Meter (EM-3
1). The equipment directly enriches the undergraduate applied geophysics class
and, at the same time, contributes to three interdisciplinary undergraduate
programs by giving students in these majors first-hand experience in
characterizing environmental conditions with geophysical tools. A review of
current institutional programs shows a lack, nationally, of educational
laboratory experiences in geophysics as applied to environmental investigations,
despite changes in career opportunities for graduates of earth science programs.
Auburn is addressing this deficiency by training students for environmental
careers and preparing them to lead research in new approaches for the future.
