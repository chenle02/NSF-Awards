This grant partially supports the administration of the competition to
determine the winner of the Loebner Prize. The Loebner Prize is an award
established to recognize the first computer system that can pass the Turing Test
of machine intelligence. "This test requires a computer to emulate human
behavior so well that it is impossible for human judges to distinguish the
response of the computer system from responses of a person."
