OPP-9615032 PI Posson Abstract In 1988, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy
Committee (IARPC) established the AEDD Working Group to identify, organize,
preserve, and present information about Arctic environmental data which is
available from US Federal agencies and selected Alaska State agencies and
academic institutions. The Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) was
assembled as a subset of the Earth Science Data Directory of the U.S. Geological
Survey. AEDD contains more than 400 references to data sets, each of which has
been reviewed for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. Data sets described
cover many disciplines including geophysics, hydrology, geochemistry,
oceanography, cartography, atmospheric physics and chemistry, marine and
terrestrial biology, health and medicine, contaminants, remote sensed data, and
in situ data. AEDD resides on a computer system accessible to scientists, policy
makers, educators, and the interested public over the Internet. Diary Note
Subject: Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) Proposal This proposal is
for continuation of funding support for the project activities of the AEDD
Working Group for 1996-1997. The AEDD Working Group is comprised of members of
IARPC agencies, and academic representatives. These activities include:
Maintenance of the AEDD, including entry and review of new data-set
descriptions, updates to existing entries, personal-computer hardware and
software; Internet access to AEDD on a Unix server located in offices of the U.
S. Geological Survey in Anchorage, Alaska; Development of an international
counterpart to AEDD, the international Arctic Data Directory (ADD) with partner
organizations initially in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Russia;
Coordination with and links to related data-management activities such as the
Global Change Master Director and the ADD; Outreach and information
dissemination, including sponsorship of and participation in workshops,
conferences, and meetings involving agencies, academics, the Arctic Research
Commission, the IARPC, and international partners; Liaison with related U.S. and
international environmental programs. This project supports the Interagency
Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) response to recommendations of the
Arctic Research Commission on Arctic Data and Information. Charles E. Myers
