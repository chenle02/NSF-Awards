The principal investigator will study isoparametric submanifolds of Riemannian
manifolds. A submanifold of Euclidean space is isoparametric if its normal
bundle is flat and the principal curvatures along any locally defined normal
vector field are constant. The research will use topological methods to
construct new examples of isoparametric submanifolds in the finite and infinite
dimensional case. This research in a classical area of differential geometry
attempts to explain and classify ways in which manifolds or surfaces sit inside
space. In particular, the research will consider families of surfaces which fill
space in layers which are curved in a fixed way. Such surfaces appear, for
example, as layers in composite materials. The methods to be used in the study
come from a wide range of areas such as algebraic topology and group theory.
