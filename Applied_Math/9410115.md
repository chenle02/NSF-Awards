9410115 Silber The investigator will develop equivariant bifurcation theory for
applications to symmetry-breaking bifurcations in hydrodynamic systems and in
globally coupled oscillator arrays. The first part of the research focuses on
translation symmetry breaking in hydrodynamic systems that are extended in more
than one space dimension. Both the situation where translation symmetry is
broken spontaneously by an attracting solution of the governing equations, and
the situation where it is broken externally by perturbing the equations will be
considered. In the former case, the manifestations of the underlying translation
symmetry in the possible evolution of instabilities of the symmetry-broken state
will be investigated. In the case of external symmetry breaking, the research
focuses on the specific physical system of rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection;
this is a system for which it has already been established that breaking
translation symmetry can have a profound effect on certain instabilities. The
second part of the research project consists of a group theoretic/dynamical
systems analysis of the $S_n$-equivariant Hopf bifurcation problem. This
bifurcation problem is pertinent to the dynamics of n globally-coupled identical
limit cycle oscillators. This research is motivated by recent analytic and
numerical studies of series arrays of Josephson junctions. Global coupling
represents an important limiting case for the coupling of oscillators; this
aspect of the research project should contribute to our understanding of
oscillator arrays ubiquitous in the modeling of physical, chemical, and
biological systems. ***
