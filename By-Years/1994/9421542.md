9421542 The investigator will conduct a comprehensive investigation of
children's relative clauses, consisting of six cross-sectional studies over a
three-year period. In the first five studies, they will apply two well-
established procedures in a consistent way to investigate a wide variety of data
domains that bear on the theory of relative clauses. Each of these studies will
investigate children's knowledge of a different subset of properties involving
relative clauses. A sixth study will investigate children's on-line processing
of sentences containing relative clauses. The studies are expected to produce
both within subject and within age group correlations across the phenomena under
investigation. In addition, children's judgments of sentences will be compared
with their productions. The findings will shed light on the acquisition of
relative clauses, as well as the properties of relative clauses in the adult
grammar. They will enable us to characterize aspects of children's grammars and
will help to determine how and when children's grarnmars change to the adult
grammar. Such issues extend beyond the particulars of relative clauses to the
acquisition process in general.
