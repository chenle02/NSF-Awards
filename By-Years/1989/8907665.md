This research examines the founding of three kinds of cultural institutions in
the United States: museums, resident opera companies, and resident orchestras.
The principal investigators will examine the influence of a wide array of
social, economic, and political changes on the founding of cultural
organizations in a representative sample of counties across the nation. In
contrast with European societies, which had rich cultural traditions, Americans
were initially suspicious of high culture and, moreover, were preoccupied with
the tasks of developing industry and agriculture, and contending with the
problems of growing cities and immigration. Once precedents for culture
institutions were established, however, the rate of increase in museums, opera
and orchestra companies was extraordinarily great. This research will
investigate the conditions under which these cultural institutions came into
being, including the effects of major national events (such as wars and
recessions). One thesis to be tested is that the conditions that fostered
culture in the early 19th century largely relate to the inequality of resources,
but other influences (such as education) increasingly prevailed. This study will
contribute to an understanding of how major cultural institutions were initially
established and developed over time.
