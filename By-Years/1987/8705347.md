Dr. Whitham of Northern Arizona State University will continue a study of
pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, which grows on the ash and cinder fields of Northern
Arizona's Sunset Crater. The pine is water and nutrient stressed, and although
adjacent sites suffer little herbivory, stressed pinyons suffer many-fold
increases in attack by 3 insect herbivores. This chronic and acute herbivory
results in a herbivore-mediated sex change in the tree, altered tree
architecture and greatly reduced growth. Five basic lines of research will be
continued: 1. experimentally manipulate stress and herbivore loads to separate
cause and effect, 2. quantify the chemical and/or genetic basis of resistance,
3. quantify the impacts of insect herbivory on the host's root, crown, and
reproductive systems, 4. quantify the impacts of host resistance on herbivore
survival and seed dispersal, and 5. reconstruct the past 200 years of chronic
insect attack. With the multidisciplinary skills of 6 researchers, rapid
progress has been made in examining these questions by employing insect transfer
experiments, tree transplant experiments, supplemental water and fertilizing
experiments, primary and secondary plant biochemistry, dendrochronology, and
electrophoresis. Because of the extremes of environmental conditions
encountered, the obvious impacts of herbivory on these plants and our ability to
experimentally manipulate the major components, the system represents a model
for integrating major factors in plant-herbivore interactions.
