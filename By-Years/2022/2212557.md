Large neural models trained on massive amounts of code still often produce code
of poor quality, with such elementary errors as uninitialized variables, type-
incorrect expressions, and loops that never finish. Such errors can be a source
of insidious software vulnerabilities. The root cause of these issues is that
the models treat programs as syntactic rather than semantic artifacts, both
during training and generation. The project's novelty is to couple such models
with symbolic, semantics-aware methods for program synthesis developed in the
formal-methods community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a
neurosymbolic program-synthesis framework that closely couples deep learning and
classical symbolic methods for program synthesis. The research explores new
learning algorithms in which neural models of code (specifically, transformers)
are exposed to explicit knowledge about program semantics, mechanisms that use
transformers to direct specification-directed synthesizers, and combinations of
classical synthesis and learned models to construct novel compositions of
neurally generated programs. The project's impact are a unified framework for
semantics-aware program synthesis, yielding better tools for automatically
creating programs. The project develops a cross-institution Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) program, with a special focus on recruiting women,
Hispanic, and Black students to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
