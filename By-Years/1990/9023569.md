The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University will acquire
several items of ocenaographic instrumentation to placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V POINT SUR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operatate by the
laboratory. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is
in support of NSF.sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: .A pc computer system
for shipboard data management that is essential for real.time acquisition and
display of large data sets, .A six.pen color plotter for displaying processed
data on board ship, .A precision temperature and conductivity sensors for
improving the capabilities of the CTD system, .remote readout of navigational
system for main science laboratory, and .triple point of water cell for use in
calibrations and high precision chemical analyses at sea. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the institution to support
NSF.sponsored research and engineering projects.
