0218195&lt;br/&gt;Bhat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support Dr. Deepak
G. Bhat and Dr Ajay P. Malshe to visit Dr. Mariana Staia, of the Department of
Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering of the Central University of
Venezuela in order to plan a research collaboration on the fundamental
tribological interactions of coated tools. While the need for durable surface-
engineered tools has long been recognized, the tribology, chemistry, and physics
of materials interactions at the mating surfaces and contact points between the
tool and work-piece are not fully understood. For instance, stringent machining
and frictional conditions require effective lubrication over a wide temperature
range, where the stability of the coating may itself be compromised.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The visit will help to design a study that aims to improve
the process of producing coatings for cutting tools with the potential of
minimizing the need for coolants and lubricants in machining and lessening
negative impacts on the environment. The US group will contribute their
expertise in machining and processing while the Venezuelan side has the
equipment and the expertise for tribological and metallurgical tests.&lt;br/&gt;
