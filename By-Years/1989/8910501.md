Mass spectral techniques such as Electron Impact (EI), Fast Atom Bombardment
(FAB), and Chemical Ionization (CI) are used to probe intimate structural
details and to obtain molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,
bioorganic and organometallic compounds. Access to instrumentation capable of
carrying out these state-of-the-art techniques is essential for the prosecution
of frontier research in several fields of chemistry. The Department of Chemistry
at the University of Florida will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a mass spectrometer. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Carbene complexes from rearrangement of transition metal sigma
complexes and strained allenes: free and complexed to transition metals 2)
Kinetic and stereochemical effects of fluorine substituents in thermal homolytic
and pericyclic reactions 3) Heterocyclic cations, benzotriazole chemistry,
thermolysis of organics, and polyvalent iodine derivatives 4) Synthetic studies
of the ene reaction and samarium diiodide mediated reactions 5) Electrochemistry
and mass spectrometry in the study of metabolic redox reactions mechanisms 6)
Gas-phase reactions of metal complexes and monoclonal antibodies elicited
against metal complexes.
