The award provides travel funds enabling students to attend the 15th IEEE
International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) to be held in
Orlando, FL on November 3-5, 2019. IISWC is the premier forum for understanding
and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems.
Topics of interest include but are not limited to characterization of
applications in domains; emerging workloads and architectures; implications of
workloads in design issues; benchmark creation and evaluation; characterization
of OS/VMM, middleware and library behavior; measurement tools and
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is to provide travel support for
around 30 U.S.-based students attending this event. The selection process will
give priority to US citizens and permanent residents, with special consideration
to members of under-represented groups and participants from universities that
do not have a strong tradition in the topical areas covered in the conference,
in order to expand the scope of the conference participation. Students attending
this workshop will benefit from the rich interactions and networking/mentoring
opportunities afforded by their presence at the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
