This project proposes an innovative approach integrating teamwork and
distributed collaboration into the engineering curriculum by using scaffolds
supported through information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance
critical skills in engineering students. Some of the specific skills sought
include project management, teamwork and leadership. This study incorporates the
design, implementation and empirical testing of a virtual team intervention in
two project-based engineering courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
intervention will be implemented in the context of courses that provide
authentic project learning experiences for engineering students through work on
real-life engineering problems. This initiative strives to place engineering
students one step closer to acting as successful team members and team leaders
in multidisciplinary and distributed teams. The funding sought will support the
development of a solid program in research and teaching in the area of
distributed collaboration and global leadership that can make an impact on
critical skills necessary for future engineers.
