The excitement of astrophysical research and discovery is brought into the high
school science and mathematics classes through a flexible set of student
activities and projects on variable stars. The project includes a computerized
database, of 400,000 measurements of brightness of 150 variable stars in five
constellations over 25 years, from which students can deduce properties,
processes, and evolution of these stars. Students can make additional
measurements and discoveries from carefully selected time sequences of 125 35mm
slides or from actual measurements from the night sky. A comprehensive student
manual and instructional videos make the materials self-contained and easy to
use. The teacher manual enables the instructor to adapt the materials to skills,
objectives and local curricula. The material can be used in a variety of
contexts: traditional mathematics and science classes at both the high school
and college level, independent projects, summer institutes, and community
science clubs. The material will be field tested in classes and refined through
workshops with teachers. A newsletter and a video about amateur astronomers is
planned.
