The project will examine the effects of a major biological change that has
occurred recently in the Bering Sea. Once a diatom-dominated ocean, the Bering
Sea has changed to a coccolithophore-dominated ocean. The dramatic change in
phytoplankton abundance has many ramifications, not the least of which is that
coccolithophores emit the gases Dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO). DMS and DMSO are greenhouse gases and the introduction of these gases in
the Arctic could lead to enhanced warming of the region and concomitant effects
beyond the Arctic.
