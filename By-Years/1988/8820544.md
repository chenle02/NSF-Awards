Graphics and imaging equipment will be provided for researchers at the
University of Georgia for research in the Department of Computer Science. This
equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer
and Information Science and Engineering program. The research for which the
equipment is to be used will be in the areas of, 1) geometric operations on
stripcoded images, 2) graphical display in computer-aided design, 3) development
of numerical schemes based on the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) for solving
nonlinear partial differential equations, and 4) spectral geometry of fractals.
