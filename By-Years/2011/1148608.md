The goal of this workshop is to explore the value of professional education at
the graduate level in mathematics by examining a new trend that responds to
workforce needs by preparing students with substantial knowledge of mathematics
as well as a broad set of professional skills to respond to the needs of
employers. These rapidly growing new programs called Science Masters or
Professional Science Masters programs provide a new paradigm in the field of
mathematics and warrant closer examination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will involve a variety of participants: program directors, faculty, and students
from current and developing programs, and industry and government employers.
Representatives from professional societies and the Professional Science Masters
Association are also involved in the development of the workshop. The workshop
will explore in a methodical way the career opportunities created by the
programs for mathematicians and statisticians, how these programs respond to
local and regional workforce needs, and the current and future impact they will
have on higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcome data from recent
graduates and descriptions of ongoing projects will help shape the discussions
about the efficacy of these programs, future directions, and possible further
evaluation.
