Professors, Richmond Sarpong of the University of California, Berkeley, and Neil
Garg of the University of California-Los Angeles, are supported by the Synthesis
Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop to stimulate new
research directions in non-catalytic organic synthesis. The workshop brings
together a diverse group of established and emerging leaders to identify
deficiencies in the current research arsenal of methodologies, to identify new
chemical methods required for streamlining and advancing industrial processes,
and potentially transformative methods needed to stimulate new directions in
organic synthesis. Non-catalytic synthetic methods are used extensively in the
synthesis of fine chemicals, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Industrial
participation underscores the practical challenges associated with non-catalytic
methods in the commercial economy. In order to broadly disseminate the
importance of non-catalytic synthetic methods, the workshop is coupled with the
Fall American Chemical Society National Meeting in San Francisco (Aug. 10-13,
2014) focused on "Frontiers in Non-Catalytic Organic Synthesis." Additionally,
the workshop proceedings and conclusions are disseminated to the scientific
community through websites and a workshop report.
