We investigate the dynamics of plane polynomial diffeomorphisms. These mappings
define diffeomorphisms of the real plane as well as the complex plane. This
project will investigate the dynamics of the complex mappings using the methods
of complex analysis and complex geometry. An important part of our research will
be to understand when and to what extent the complex results can be applied to
the underlying real system. Our main focus will be on the Henon family of
quadratic mappings of the plane. And within this family we study the horseshoe
mappings. Among other things, we will describe the shape of the boundary of the
horseshoe locus, and the behavior of the mappings on the boundary. We will also
apply our methods to describe the dynamics of certain bifurcations.

One motivation is that an understanding of the polynomial diffeomorphisms of the
plane should be a useful guide to the investigation of the dynamics of general
diffeomorphisms of the plane. It should provide examples of mappings and
bifurcations that can be understood in detail and provide the examples that
serve as guideposts for the development of the theory for more general mappings.
Closely related to this is the study of birational mappings of the plane. In
particular, we will analyze birational maps that arise in renormalization
questions in lattice statistical mechanics.
