0332103 Aultman-Hall The overall goal of this research is to characterize the
relationships between spatial transportation-related variables (e.g., road type,
grade, traffic conditions, land-use patterns), vehicle operating conditions
(speed, acceleration, load) and mobile source fine particulate matter (PM)
emissions. The project has three objectives. First, we will develop operating
mode-based PM emissions models for light-duty vehicles based on real-world
tailpipe emissions data. Second, vehicle operating mode and PM emissions will be
modeled spatially as a function of transportation network variables and the
surrounding land use environment. Finally, transient operating events will be
studied to determine the associated PM emissions and their spatial distribution.
