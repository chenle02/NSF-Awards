The Principal Investigator (PI) will use the University of Michigan's well-
developed Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to perform self-consistent
simulations that will address a number of scientific questions related to the
properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona. Using existing
and improved models of CME evolution, the interplanetary magnetic field, and the
solar wind, the PI's team will compute directly observable quantities from their
simulations. These quantities will then be compared with remote-sensing
observations from both spacecraft and ground-based instruments, as well as with
available in situ data from various spacecraft. The PI's team will determine the
effect of the background magnetic field and reconnection events on CME rotation;
how CMEs are deflected in the corona; how such deflections are affected by the
presence of coronal holes and streamers; how the location of the CME source
region with respect to the heliospheric current sheet might modify this
deflection; what causes CME expansion and non-radial propagation to eventually
cease; and what parameters determine the distance at which CME evolution becomes
"ideal" and why this distance varies from CME to CME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research has the potential to improve our understanding of the basic physics of
the inner heliosphere and outer corona, which in turn will enable improved space
weather forecasts through better predictions of CME orientation, propagation
direction, and spatial extent. The research team will disseminate their results
to the heliophysics community by publication of scientific articles, as well as
by participating in, and by organizing, topical workshops and conferences. The
PI is a young research scientist who will involve undergraduate students in this
work and who pledges to select, whenever possible, under-represented minority
students. The PI will engage in public outreach through the "Hawaii Center for
Advancing Systemic Heliophysics Education," taking special advantage of colorful
graphics and movies produced his SWMF simulations. The project team consists of
scientists from the University of New Hampshire, the Naval Research Laboratory,
and the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii, thereby enhancing
university partnerships as well as academic collaboration with a federal
laboratory.
