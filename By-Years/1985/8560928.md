The design and performance of multi-board systems could be greatly enhanced if
there were analytical tools that designers could use to evaluate alternative
systems. Research focuses on developing analytical tools that will enable
computer system designers to quantify the throughput-delay performance of
different configurations. Using these tools, the elements of the computer system
that dominate performance can be identified. These tools will also benefit the
community at large because they will allow the different bus standards to be
evaluated under many conditions. The tools realistic models that include such
factors as the bus topology, routing, service times, synchronization procedures,
arbitration algorithms, etc.
