Habituation is a process by which organisms come to show reduced response to a
stimulus as a function of repeated stimulation. Once habituation has taken
place, the response remains low over a period of time, suggesting that the
organisms remembers that this stimulus is the same one it is has encountered
previously. Thus, habituation is a simple form of learning. This award to Dr.
Alice Powers will investigate the neural basis of the blink reflex and
habituation of that reflex. First the anatomy and physiology of the reflex will
be examined. Then a study will be conducted investigating whether the interval
between consecutive stimuli affects habituation of the blink reflex. These
studies will provide the basis for further work investigating the brain
mechanisms of habituation and will contribute to understanding of the way in
which the brain mediates learning.***t//
