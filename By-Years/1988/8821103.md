This project will investigate micromechanical structures based on silicon
processing technology. These micromechanical components, which are typically
less than 1 mm2 in area and are fabricated by integrated circuit-type
manufacturing techniques, include cantilever beams, movable elements, and
suspended structures. Research emphasis is directed toward 1) investigation of
active materials for micromechanical actuators, 2) the development of suitable
microstructure processing technologies for making microactuators, 3) the design
and fabrication of piezoelectric (ZnO, AIN) microactuators, 4) the design and
fabrication of microactuators based on magnetostrictive thin films, and 5) the
implementation of several test vehicle microactuators. These test vehicles
include piezoelectric actuators based on surface-micromachined beam technology
and movable elements based on thin film magnetic materials.
