This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the
NSF/DoE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation
NSF 08-589. The award provides funds to support travel for a graduate student to
scientific conferences and for undergraduate participation in the overall
research effort, which is being funded separately by the DoE under contract to
UCLA (Science report #09ER55061)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use
UCLA's unique LAPD facility and its laser plasma capability to do experiments on
the coupling of mass, energy, and momentum from a localized, dense, and rapidly
expanding plasmas into a large-scale magnetized background plasma. Using the
laser we will generate field-aligned plasma flows that can be varied from
supersonic to super Alfvénic. The research program is divided into three main
topics: 1) the coupling of plasma jets to compressional Alfvén waves, 2) the
creation of wakes and structure with supersonic flows, and 3) the interaction of
Alfvén waves with fast-flowing plasmas. The experiments will be complemented by
computer simulations using a state-of-the-art PIC code developed at UCLA. The
code is capable of resolving skin depth structures as well as tracking Alfvénic
phenomena. The nonlinear interaction of Alfvén waves with moving plasmas has
been the subject of theoretical studies but has never been probed in laboratory
experiments. This study is of relevance to phenomena in the Earth's magnetotail,
coronal plume expansion within low beta coronal holes, and could be of relevance
to astrophysical jets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support of undergraduate
participation adds a broader educational impact through the early-year training
of students by introducing them to scientific research as a possible career
path.
