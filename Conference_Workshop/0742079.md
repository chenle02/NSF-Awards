Model selection in the frequentist setting is a well developed field. In the
Bayesian framework, in principle, model selection is very simple. Prior
probability distributions are used to describe the uncertainty surrounding all
unknowns, including models being considered and the parameters for these models.
After observing the data, the posterior distribution provides a coherent post
data summary of the remaining uncertainty which is relevant for model selection.
However, the practical implementation of this approach is not straightforward,
and involves issues such as choice of priors, interpretability, and
computational feasibility. In this workshop, twelve distinguished individuals
who work in Bayesian model selection present their work in a number of different
areas, including determination of good objective priors, assessment of various
information criteria (AIC, BIC, RIC), methods of calculation of Bayes factors,
and Markov chain Monte Carlo. A number of young researchers participate in the
workshop and present their work in poster sessions.

Variable selection is an important and pervasive problem in scientific and
medical research. A few important variables are to be selected from many
candidates and used for understanding, prediction and decision making.
Historically, variable selection has been carried out in a frequentist setting.
However, Bayesian approaches offer important advantages. In broad terms, they
give a coherent way of dealing with the distribution of the future response of
an individual for whom the predictor variables are now known. Recent advances in
both computing power and statistical methodology have greatly enhanced the
feasibility of Bayesian approaches to regression and variable selection. The
workshop provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the many recent
significant developments in Bayesian model selection and objective methods; to
discuss what has been found to work and what does not; and to identify important
problems and new research directions.
