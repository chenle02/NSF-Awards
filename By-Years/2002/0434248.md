Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0434248&lt;br/&gt;Mahendra Singh&lt;br/&gt;Virginia
Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A US-India Workshop on Sensing Systems and Smart
Structures Technologies will be conducted in Bombay, India in the winter of 2004
for the purpose of developing bilateral cooperative research in this area. The
workshop will assess the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice of this
emerging field in each country, identify mutual research interests, prioritize
intellectual challenges, and recommend coordination and implementation
mechanisms for future joint research. The discussion will include the cross
cutting areas of sensors systems, signal processing, system identification,
fiber optics, wireless technology, structural dynamics, earthquake engineering,
and smart civil and mechanical systems.&lt;br/&gt;
