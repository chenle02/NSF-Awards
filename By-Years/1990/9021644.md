The research objective of this grant under the SGER (Small Grants for
Exploratory Research) program is to generate and detect elastic interface waves
that can propagate along a fracture. The existence of these waves has been
predicted theoretically for appropriate mechanical properties of the fracture
and frequencies of excitation. Using ultrasonic frequencies, these waves will be
generated and measured initially for a synthetic fracture in aluminum, and then
in a natural rock specimen. If successful, this research will result in the
first observation of elastic interface waves. There is a potential for the
development of these waves as diagnostic tools in borehole geophysics and mine
safety.
