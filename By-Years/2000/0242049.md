&lt;br/&gt;Framing effects are said to occur when "equivalent" redescriptions of
objects or outcomes lead to different preferences or judgments. For example, a
medical treatment will be seen more favorably when described as resulting in
"75% survival" rather than "25% mortality." Such effects have traditionally been
seen as irrational. However, preliminary research conducted by the PI has shown
that even logically equivalent attribute frames can implicitly convey, or
"leak," normatively relevant information. For instance, speakers were more
likely to select the "75% survival" frame to describe a new treatment outcome if
it led to a higher, rather than a lower, survival rate relative to an old
treatment. Moreover, listeners "absorbed" this leaked information: They were
more likely to infer that the old treatment led to a lower survival rate when
the new treatment was described in terms of % survival rather than % mortality.
The objective of the proposed research is to deepen and broaden our
understanding of the role of information leakage in framing effects. Framing
effects, rather than indicating irrational behavior, may instead indicate
behavior that is rational, much richer, and more adaptive than previously
thought.&lt;br/&gt;
