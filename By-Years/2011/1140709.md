The goal of this project is to improve the preparation of secondary mathematics
teachers through the implementation of an integrated teacher development model
that deepens pre-service teachers' mathematical knowledge while integrating
their knowledge of mathematics and pedagogy in a meaningful way. The model is
based on how teachers develop and use their knowledge in the act of instruction.
It draws upon current research in order to help teachers integrate their
knowledge sets through the process of decision-making and reflection. This
proposed model (demonstrated as a capstone course) and the discoveries made by
the project could also lead to and inform the development of new teacher
preparation curricula that can be disseminated to the wider education community.
