The environment often contains a great deal of extraneous sound (noise) from
which listeners nevertheless can sometimes extract information from particular
sounds (signals). The mechanisms by which this is accomplished are still not
well understood. The importance of clarifying them is not only the basic
scientific interest and in basic mechanisms working in auditory perception. In
many instances the extraneous sounds prevent the listener from extracting
information from the signal. Knowing how to minimize this problem is important
in designing systems for auditory communication in many applications. In this
project the investigator is attempting to test his hypothesis concerning this
problem, which is that in listening we compare sounds of various frequency
regions (pitch) and different intervals of time, weight them in some way, and
separate the signal from the noise in analyzing the result. He will present
subjects with reproducible noise samples in which the frequency spectral and
temporal fringes are systematically varied. Using computers he will stimulate
various models of excitation, inhibition and other interactions to determine
which models (if any) accurately account for the effects observed by the
listeners.
