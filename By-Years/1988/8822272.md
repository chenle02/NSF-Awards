There has been a resurgence of interest in Markov Random Field models for
analysis of digital signals, image structures, and neural-network learning and
pattern matching. This workshop will bring together active researchers to
discuss emerging themes and limitations. Proceedings of the workshop will be
widely disseminated in the relevant research communities.
