Saint Vincent College will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Chemistry, Computer Science and Physics for 24 students entering
grades 9 and 10. During the first week of the summer program all participants
will attend overview presentations and laboratory sessions on scientific
principles, research methodology and pertinent ethical issues in the three
disciplines. Week 1 will also include a session on mathematics topics related to
the science programs. During Weeks 2 and 3 the students will divide into groups
of eight; each small group will work on intensive research projects over the
two-week period in environmental chemistry, digital logic and computer
interfacing, or the physics of the electromagnetic spectrum. Findings from these
research projects will be presented to the entire group of Young Scholars at the
end of the summer program. Career exploration for all participants will include
field trips, guest speakers, and use of the informational resources of the Saint
Vincent College Career Development Center. An "Ethics in Science" forum will be
the capstone activity for study and discussion of ethical issues surrounding the
program's three disciplinary areas.
