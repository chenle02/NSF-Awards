Numerical simulations of the growth of structure predict that the nearby
universe should contain large numbers of low mass halos, which by their very
nature are hard to detect. Recent advances in the mapping capability of
centimeter wave radio telescopes have enabled surveys for atomic hydrogen
emitters, which are not ruled out by any other observations, but the low mass
end of the resultant mass function is poorly determined and may depend on
environment. The new Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) revolutionizes the ability
of the telescope to find these systems, and the planned survey will not only
provide an answer to this problem but also produce an archived dataset of value
to other studies. This first phase supports the principal investigator for one
year to refine the details of the collaboration with Cornell University to carry
out this important work.

The survey principles will be designed to maximize the scientific return, engage
the broadest community of researchers, educate the next generation of students,
and raise the broadest level of public interest. Meanwhile, support for this
researcher from Union College will provide increased opportunities for
undergraduates to receive exposure to radio astronomy, and will assist in the
development of teaching modules and visitor center displays.
