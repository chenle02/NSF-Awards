9500126 Yang This research integrates dynamic multistate reliability model and
quality loss analysis in order to describe the product performance degradation
as a function of time. In this modeling approach the product performance level
is expressed as the function of product design parameters and environmental
factors at any given time. A quality loss function which measures the product
performance level over a time period will be defined. The model and loss
function then lead to reliability-driven product parameter design, product
performance evaluation, reliability-driven product tolerance design, and
reliability and robust design integration. The research is partially built upon
work in collaboration with the Ford Motor Company on reliability-base motor
vehicle system evaporative emission, using evaporative emission as a typical
performance degradation problem. Collaboration with Ford Motor Company allows
the results of this research to be validated by combining the theoretical
research with a practical reliability-based study of a motor vehicle fuel
system's evaporative emission for 1995 and subsequent model years. This research
will contribute to motor vehicle manufacturers' ability to meet new standards
for evaporative emission governed by the Clean Air Act and set by the EPA and
the California Air Resource Board. It will also develop techniques for
reliability-driven product design and suggest robust design integration
strategies that can be used more generally.
