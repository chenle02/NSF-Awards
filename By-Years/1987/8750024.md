The Ripon College physics department will renovate its nuclear physics
laboratory. A microcomputer and personal-computer-based analyzer will form the
core of the new laboratory. Students of modern physics and nuclear physics will
learn how to detect ionizing radiation in a variety of new detectors, amplify
and shape the electronic signals with modern nuclear electronics modules,
collect data under microcomputer control and analyze their results with the
microcomputer system. An alpha spectrometer will give the students experience
with solid-state detectors and vacuum systems and a new scintillation detector
will be used for the detection of gamma rays. As the students use these systems,
they will learn about the structure of nuclei, the interactions of ionizing
radiation with matter and the many ways a microcomputer can be used as a
laboratory instrument.
