In this project by Prof. David Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh, the
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports experimental
research on fundamental questions concerning the structures and forces at work
in weakly bound complexes, mechanisms of intramolecular energy flow, and
chemical reaction pathways. By means of high resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy
the properties of excited electronic states are determined and questions of the
dynamics of chemical reactions are addressed. %%% Understanding the fundamentals
of chemical reactions on a molecular level is at the current frontier of
physical chemistry. Once a molecule is enriched with high vibrational and
electronic energy, it can shed this energy in a reactionless process, it can
dissociate into fragments, or it can react with other molecules to form new
ones. If the details of these individual processes are known and understood,
reactions could be steered into preferred directions. The determination of such
detailed, molecular level understanding for species of chemical interest is the
goal of this research project.
