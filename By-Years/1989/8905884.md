An evaporator/sputter-coating apparatus will be purchased for use with a high
resolution scanning electron microscope to support research in membrane science,
biotechnology, combustion and coal gasification research at the University of
Colorado at Boulder. The high energy electron beam used in SEM analysis can
cause charging as well as thermal degradation in nonconducting, thermally
sensitive materials such as polymeric membranes and microbial cells. This
problem is minimized by applying a coating of conductive metal or a carbon
coating to the materials. Small scale structures, however, such as nodules on
polymeric membranes and pili on microbial cells can be masked by conventional
techniques. The equipment to be purchased features electron beam evaporative
coating capability to achieve ultrathin, fine-grained conductive films required
for ultrahigh resolution SEM analysis.
