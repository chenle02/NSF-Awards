It is claimed that a new technology based on compressive crushing of a bed of
particles between rollers having a variable gap can lead to significant
reduction in the energy required for comminution. This research will measure the
breakage kinetics for three types of materials on passing through the rollers
and also measure the breakage kinetics in a ball mill of particles prestressed
by passage through the rollers. The data required, although highly empirical, is
need for the design and optimization of grinding loops. If only 10 percent of
the energy consumed in the U.S. on comminution can be saved by this technology,
it would be a significant savings.
