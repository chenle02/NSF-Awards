9627891 Olson The PI proposes to conduct laboratory fluid dynamics experiments
with applications to flow in the Earth's mantle and core. The PI will study
experimentally the convective processes responsible for the seismic anisotropy
that has been detected in the upper mantle and in the inner core, and will also
investigate thermochemical convection in liquid metal subject to the influences
of rotation and magnetic fields, with application to the geodynamo. The
experimental results will be compared with both numerical calculations of
magnetoconvection and with the flow patterns in the outer core. Measurements of
the elastic and electrical anisotropy of solid gallium crystallizing in the
presence of convection, rotation and magnetic fields will be compared with
observations of inner core anisotropy as a test of theories for the growth of
the inner core. ***
