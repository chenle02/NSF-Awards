The project ``Automorphic forms, Galois representations and ramification'' deals
with some of the key issues that occupy modern algebraic number theory. They
relate to the study of algebraic extensions of the rationals, and some of their
more elusive properties that are not accessible by direct means. One uses
automorphic forms to construct algebraic extensions of the rationals, which
gives greater control on some of the basic properties that one would like to
know about such extensions. The PI proposes to continue this theme of his work
by using congruences between modular forms to produce extensions of number
fields with controlled ramification. Such a control is related to classical
conjectures like the Leopoldt conjecture. He will also continue the study of
attaching automorphic forms to Galois representations, and proving more cases of
the inverse Galois problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on the
connection between automorphic forms and number theory is a very active area of
number theory. This has broad implications which might also be useful to
applications of number theory in areas like cryptography that are of practical
use.&lt;br/&gt;The PI also expects to continue to disemminate knowledge by
involving students in research projects, by organising conferences, and giving
talks aimed at broad audiences about his subject.
