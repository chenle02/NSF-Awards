This award will support a one-year collaborative project between Professor
Robert L. Hemminger, Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University, and
Professors Derek Holton and R.E.L. Aldred, Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The activity takes place
under the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science Program. The cooperating
mathematicians will carry out joint research in various aspects of graph theory.
The subject matter will primarily include (1) the distribution of contractible
edges and (2) the neighborhood connectivity of graphs. These are important areas
of study in modern graph theory, and Professor Hemminger and his New Zealand
colleagues are respected researchers in the field. Their previous collaboration
has been productive, and the current studies will build upon and expand their
earlier results.
