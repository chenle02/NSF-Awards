Dr. Hernando Trujillo has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Truillo's doctoral degree was from Dartmouth with Professor Russell Hughes.
He plans to continue research with Professor Didier Astruc at Bordeaux. In
Atruc's laboratory, he will learn about electron chain catalysis with transition
metal catalysts. This will also bring him into contact with techniques stuch as
Mossbauer spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and ESR. These experiences will help
him with his long range goal of studying highly strained molecules and
addressing the questions of their reactivity. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
