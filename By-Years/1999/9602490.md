9602490 Swanson This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Peter Swanson at the Mechanical
Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Swanson will work with Dr.
Tatsuo Arai, Director of the Autonomous Machinery Division, Department of
Robotics, on a research project entitled, "Dynamical Robot Walking." The
proposed research will explore the use of passive components in dynamic robot
walking. Current robot walking strategies are mostly statically stable: the
robot could stop at any time without falling over. However, recent advances in
dynamics and biology suggest that passive components such as springs and dampers
assist in dynamically stable walking without requiring unreasonable control
effort or static stability. In the course of the research project at the
Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, one of the existing legged robots at the site
will be modified with passive components, and a control strategy will be
developed to allow dynamical robot walking without static stability constraints.
The new dynamical walking behavior will improve the robot's ability to function
in an autonomous manner and its ability to interact dynamically with their
environment will be improved. ***
