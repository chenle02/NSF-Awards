This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to
collect baseline winter information on the overwintering physical and biological
characteristics of three important Arctic Seas: The Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea,
and the Beaufort Sea. Understanding of seasonality, and particularly winter
conditions, in the Arctic is severely limited because of difficulties in
accessing these regions during winter and because of limitations to sensor
technology that can be deployed on overwintering moorings and ice-tethered
profilers/buoys. In particular, understanding of the overwintering strategies of
one of the dominant copepod genera, Calanus spp., is not well understood but is
critical to ecosystem modeling efforts. This lack of knowledge has compromised
our ability to model and to predict Arctic ecosystems, knowledge that is
critical to our efforts to understand the potential impacts of ongoing climate
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a 6-week cruise to the Bering,
Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, in January-February 2010, during which they will
conduct physical (hydrography, circulation), chemical (nutrients), and
biological (zooplankton, microzooplankton, chlorophyll) sampling. They will
describe the hydrography, circulation and aspects of the planktonic and nutrient
environments, identifying the overwintering habitat of Calanus spp., determining
the condition and activity of Calanus spp. and euphausiids, describing the
interconnectedness between species/populations of Calanus and euphausiids in
these regions, identifying the transformations of Pacific Water on the Chukchi
Shelf, describing off-shelf flow of Pacific Water into the Artic Ocean and the
circulation and hydrography of Barrow Canyon, and quantifying the course- and
fine-scale vertical distributions of plankton and particles in relation to the
vertical structure of the water column.
