This research involves the study of the two-dimensional electron system in
intense magnetic fields on GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures characterized by very
high mobility, low-density two-dimensional electron gas samples with extremely
low disorder. Magnetotransport, activated transport and nonlinear transport
measurements will be employed to investigate collective states of this system.
The fractional quantum Hall effect, quantum Wigner crystallization, and
magnetic-field-induced localization will be studied. Radio-frequency
magnetospectroscopy will also be used to study collective excitations in these
systems.
