This grant allows the acquisition of four experimental stations in the area of
open channel hydraulics, sediment transport, pump performance and dynamics of
pipeline flow. It also provides a data acquisition, communication, processing
and analysis network. This equipment, along with existing resources, provides a
wide spectrum of design applications, including design of stable channels,
experimental investigation of hydraulic structures, sizing of pumps and
selection of surge systems, and the analysis of the safety and environmental
aspects of water resources projects. The ultimate goal of this project is to
develop a set of modules covering broad hydraulic engineering experiences and
offer them to other engineering programs as successful modules. The institution
is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
