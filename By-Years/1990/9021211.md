Thermal analysis instrumentation is used for a variety of types of experiments,
including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA),
differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA).
This instrumentation is used to determine physical or thermodynamic properties
of materials in which heat is directly involved, such as boiling, freezing and
solidification-point determinations, heat of fusion and heat of vaporization. In
some cases thermal studies include measurment of weight changes of a system as a
function of increasing temperature. The results of these types of analysis
provide meaningful information and a deeper understanding of the effects of
temperature changes on materials. Thermal methods are used in studying materials
such as polymers and ceramics. This award from the Chemistry Research
Instrumentation program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Michigan acquire a Thermal Analysis System. The system will be used in the
following areas of research. "Synthesis and Characterization of New Fe/S and
Fe/Mo/S Clusters as Structural Analogs for Metallo-protein Active Sites and of
Binary Metal Sulfides" "Characterization of Organometallic Polymers and Surface
Reaction by Thermal Analysis" "Thermal Analysis of Solid-State Intercalation
Compounds" "Studies of Solid State Telluride Compounds" "Characterization of
Nanometer-Sized Materials" "Characterization of New Heteroaromatic Materials
Based on Cyanoimidazole"
