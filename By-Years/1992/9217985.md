This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Melvin Okamura of the University of California, San Diego and Professor Teizo
Kitagawa of the Institute for Molecular Science, Okazaki National Research
Institutes, Japan. The study involves the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy to
study the structure and dynamics of quinones in the bacterial reaction center, a
protein that is involved in the primary electron and proton transfer processes
in photosynthesis. The project combines the extensive experience on reaction
centers of Professor Okamura's group with the expertise in resonance Raman
spectroscopy of the Okazaki group. The results should lead to new information
about the mechanism of solar energy conversion.
