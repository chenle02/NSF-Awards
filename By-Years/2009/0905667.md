Accurate wireless measurements are critical to the sustained growth of deployed
wireless networks, as well as the successful development of wireless
innovations. Because of the significant effort required to deploy wireless
networks and obtain reliable measurements, current wireless traces are lacking
both in breadth of environments and consistency of methodology. The AirLab
project seeks to facilitate meaningful analysis of wireless networks by
deploying a distributed wireless measurement infrastructure that produces
consistent and comparable wireless traces over different deployment
environments. AirLab provides core periodic measurements as well as user-driven
experiments, and a centralized repository for storing, accessing, and
statistically analyzing wireless traces. The richness of these measurement
datasets allows researchers to detect and confirm hidden trends, and derive
statistically meaningful conclusions based on real-world observations. All
AirLab measurements are public and accessible by the research community, thereby
lowering the barrier to entry for research and enabling researchers to innovate
without the upfront expenses of deploying local wireless testbeds. The project
integrates its research outcomes into the undergraduate and graduate education
programs. It also proactively seeks to increase the number of women and
underrepresented groups in the field.
