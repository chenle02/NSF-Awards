Biologists have long sought explanations for why some groups of species on Earth
are so much more diverse than others. This project will study the way that new
species have formed and changed across different vertebrate groups throughout
the history of life. New statistical methods will be developed to measure rates
of speciation, extinction, and trait change across the jawed vertebrates, a
large group of animals that includes fishes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and
amphibians. Using new information obtained from NSF's Assembling the Tree of
Life program, the project will identify groups with unusually high diversity and
test potential explanations for these "evolutionary
explosions."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the forces
influencing evolutionary change over the past 500 million years of vertebrate
history. Describing evolution at this scale will give us a broader understanding
of life over time in general, and will be of great interest to many scientific
fields. A number of educational outreach activities will be conducted with this
grant, including interactions with a local science center, involvement of
regional public schools, and coordination of a workshop for graduate students
from around the world.
