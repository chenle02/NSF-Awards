The principal investigator will carry out research on a variety of topics
related to probability theory, many involving probabilistic inequalities. These
topics include optimal stopping as in prophet inequalities and order selection,
partitioning of fair-division inequalities, ranges of vector measures, first-
digit implications of perception of randomness, and decision processes and
gambling theory. These problems have practical applications within areas of
mathematical decision- making such as operations research, management science
and statistics, as well as theoretical application in classical probability,
measure and function theory.
