An adaptive computing system is one that evolves its behavior based on changes
in the environment. For an adaptable system built on a distributed architecture
where multiple machines are connected by a nework, such changes can range from
site failures to updated application requirements. The evolutionary action taken
when a change occurs can vary as well, ranging from dynamically reconfiguring
the system software to maintain the same service guarantees under changed
conditions, to negotiating new service guarantees with the application. The goal
of this project is to develop fundamental new techniques for designing and
implementing adaptive distributed computing systems. The specific focus is on
providing a distribution support layer, a software layer implementing strong
execution guarantees regarding the distributed state of the application, that
can adapt to changes. The research concentrates on two lines of investigation:
(1) the development of a conceptual model for systems of this type and (2) a new
approach to implementing adaptive distributed systems based on fine-grain code
modules called micro-protocols. The framework is being extended to support
dynamic evolution of software, including reconfiguration, dynamic code linking,
and runtime code generation. ***
