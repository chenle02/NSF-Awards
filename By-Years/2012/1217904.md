Grasping and manipulation of deformable objects presents a host of new research
challenges that are much more demanding than for rigid objects. A particular
challenge is to fully understand the physics of deformation and to model
deformable objects in a way that can be used by real robotic systems in the
presence of noise and uncertainty and with real-time constraints. This project
will use offline simulation to predict states of deformable objects modeled as
thin-shells (i.e. cloth, fabric, clothing) that can then be recognized by a
robotic vision/grasping system to pick up and manipulate these objects. The
Intellectual Merit includes a significant step forward in the synthesis of
state-of-the-art numerical computation of plasto-elastica with a database-driven
manipulation approach to allow robots to manipulate deformable objects. This
includes fabric simulation technology that provides the requisite level of
accuracy at speeds amenable to online computation parallel to the robotic
grasping task. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this research
include 1) creation of an open source, extensible, 3-D database of deformable
objects for dissemination to the robotics and graphics communities, 2) extending
the range of working environments for the emerging field of personal robotic
assistants, and 3) developing and educating a new class of scientists who bridge
the fields of computer graphics, computational mechanics, and robotics.
