This professional development fellowship will enable an ecologist specializing
in restoration biology to study with scholars in the humanities and cultural
studies who specialize in environmental ethics and the role of tradition and
ritual performance in human societies. His intention is to bring the material he
learns to bear on ethical and value questions raised in the practice of
ecological restoration and to publish journal and magazine articles on his
findings. This base of information about environmental philosophy and the
history of ideas about nature will be used in the development of the journal
Restoration and Management Notes, which the investigator edits, in curricula,
and in conferences, symposia, workshops and other programs of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison Arboretum and the Society for Ecological Restoration.
