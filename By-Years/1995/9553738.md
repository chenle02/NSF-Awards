Economic competitiveness, rapid technology advances and changing workforce
requirements call for new ATE teaching strategies, curricular reform and better
teamwork among educators, business and industry and professional organizations.
Urban ATE colleges face these and other challenges, serving largely economically
disadvantaged and predominantly minority students many under-prepared for ATE
college learning. Yet, these same urban institutions offer diversity, academic
expertise and opportunities for urban businesses seeking flexible, dynamic
partnerships to meet their workforce needs. New ATE curriculum development and
program improvement resources and initiatives must be developed by urban ATE
colleges and their partners in a more cost-effective and coordinated way. The
National Urban ATE Center is directed by a consortium of City University of New
York (CUNY) associate degree colleges, eventually offering services to between
25-35 of the country's largest urban ATE colleges. Services include: (1)
establishment of a Resource Clearinghouse creating an Internet hub,
teleconferencing and traditional research services; (2) exemplary ATE curricula
dissemination in engineering technology and development of an ATE Curriculum
Frameworks; (3) exemplary faculty enhancement services in the use of technology
in associate degree engineering technology; and (4) student academic support
services to urban ATE colleges in mathematics and communications. Ten major
urban ATE colleges throughout the United States will participate in the first
year, along with national professional organizations and businesses, including
CORD, American Chemical Society, Urban League, NYNEX, Hughes Corporation and
others. CUNY expects substantial resource gains among participating colleges and
development of effective strategies to improve student achievement and to meet
the workforce needs of business and industry.
