Software Engineering (34) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's development of
teaching materials is based on research into the background and effectiveness of
case study techniques in professional education. The case study materials
include the artifacts produced in the development of a real-world, moderately
complex software product such as DigitalHome artifacts. The project approach is
concentrating on a complete developmental life cycle that includes planning,
analysis and specification, design, construction, testing, and maintenance. The
project serves as a foundation for the full development of comprehensive cases
that represents a framework for the teaching of professional software systems
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive software case study represents a
perfect opportunity to alter the current bottom-up approach of teaching software
engineering, starting with writing small programs in the first year and building
toward a modest-sized capstone in the final year. A case-study approach exposes
students, at a very early stage, to the problems, constraints, and needs in
developing realistic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two summer faculty workshops
are being offered to involve other faculty in the development and use of the
project materials. The workshops include consideration of assessment of the
project materials and cover a variety of teaching and learning styles. They
provide dissemination of the project materials and involve faculty in the
solution to the problem of how to best include real-world software engineering
in the classroom.
