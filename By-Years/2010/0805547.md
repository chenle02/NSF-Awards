The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Alexander Li of Washington State
University. The essence of this project is to design and synthesize novel
polymer nanoparticles, whose red-fluorescence signal can be modulated using
external light pulses so that it has amplitude and a phase. When the
nanoparticle recognizes the analyte associated with a green-fluorescence donor,
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) will propagate the modulation from
the nanoparticle to the green fluorescence donor, whose signal will be in turn
modulated at the same frequency, unambiguously confirming interactions. This
study will provide a new analytical method that dramatically improves the
statistical confidence of fluorescence detection, including fluorescence
imaging, fluorescence sensors and fluorescence-based quantitative analyses. It
will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students
and postdoctoral trainees in the use of advanced spectroscopic methods in
quantitative bioassays.
