The major aim of the proposed research is the development of a self-healing
structural system that can self-repair after extreme events, such as multiple
dynamic impacts, and also self-assess the effectiveness of the repair. This
self-healing capability will be accomplished through a room temperature cure
epoxy resin healing system delivered through embedded glass fibers. The delivery
system will be integrated with an optical fiber sensor network that self-repairs
through the phenomenon of self-writing in photopolymerizable resins. A multi-
physics predictive computational model of the entire process that accounts for
the interrelated processes of photopolymerization, lightwave propagation in a
heterogeneous structure, opto-mechanical interactions and sandwich composite
damage mechanics will also be derived. The model will be applied to lifetime
predictions of the self-healed structural system.&lt;br/&gt;The ability of a
structural system to survive catastrophic events such as earthquakes, blast
loads, or multiple impacts through self-repair of critical components would
significantly improve the safety of critical airframes and civil infrastructure
systems. Furthermore, the capability of the repaired structure to assess its
structural condition would be invaluable to evaluate the necessity of further
repairs, and would reduce the loss of life for rescue workers or future users of
the structural system. Undergraduate students will be recruited to work with the
research group through the NSF REU program and the PIs will participate in
programs for academically gifted high school students from underrepresented
groups across the state of North Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;
