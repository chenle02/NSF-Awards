The proposal deals with studying ``Heegaard Floer homology,'' the new invariants
for three-and four-dimensional spaces constructed by the investigator in
collaboration with Zoltan Szabo. These invariants give new insight into earlier
invariants for spaces constructed using ``gauge theoretic'' techniques: the
Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. In addition, they can be used to
address older topological questions, including specifically questions about Dehn
surgery on classical knots. This project aims to understand these invariants
better, in veiw of recent computational advances in the theory, and to give
further applications to knot theory and the topology of three- and four-
dimensional manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of
equations with origins in mathematical physics has has lead to great advances in
our understanding of the topoligical properties of three and four-dimensional
spaces over the past twenty years. Further progress in this area is facilitated
by an alternative, more geometric understanding of the data derived from these
equations, known as ``Heegaard Floer homology'', a new theory developed by the
investigator in collaboration with Zoltan Szabo. Heegaard Floer homology has
already shed new light on the structure of three- and four-dimensional spaces.
These new methods have been the object of study of the investigator, and the
present proposal deals further developments using these techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
