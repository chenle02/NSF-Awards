9706296 Chamberlain One of the more critical problems in understanding crustal
deformation is understanding deformation mechanisms and strain partitioning in
the middle and lower crust where plutonism and partial melting are not critical
factors for crustal softening. This collaborative study address this problem
through the examination of lower crustal, Late Archean rocks in southeastern
Wyoming. The study will involve field mapping to determine the distribution of
strain, metamorphic petrology to establish the pressure-temperature (depth)
conditions of deformation, and geochronology to determine the absolute timing of
the various deformation events. the laboratory data will allow the
reconstruction of the depth and time conditions of the various deformations, and
textural work will allow mechanisms of deformation to be identified. In addition
to this, the data will bear directly on the structural evolution of this package
of rocks, and allow the tectonic reconstruction of the Archean boundary of this
crustal fragment.
