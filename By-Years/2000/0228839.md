Professor John Rabolt of the University of Delaware and Dr. Bruce Chase of
Dupont Corporation are supported by an SGER grant from the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program to develop an infrared focal plane array spectrometer
for the real-time detection of chemical and biological agents in gases. The
method eliminates some of the problems of FTIR spectroscopy including
hygroscopic optics and sensitivity to alignment due to moving parts. The
proposed spectrometer, already demonstrated in the 34000 to 2000 cm-1 region,
utilizes reflection optics and dispersal and array detection so that there are
no moving parts. The team will extend operation to the IR fingerprint region so
that more chemical specificity can be obtained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rugged
instrument can sample in real time and would have applications in national
security, environmental and industrial process monitoring.
