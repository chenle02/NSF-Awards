The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting a research program by Robert G. Parr at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, in which he is continuing his work on density functional
theory. The new work continues the development of qualitative applications of
the theory to a variety of systems of chemical significance. It also involves
cooperation with Professor Yang of Duke University on further extension of the
"divide and conquer" strategy they have developed for computational applications
of the theory. %%% Density functional theory is an alternative to the commonly
used ab initio approach to the quantum chemical description of molecules. It can
be used in a qualitative manner to permit the deduction of useful correlations
and generalizations with limited computational requirements. This research
effort is developing further applications and techniques to broaden the utility
of the method and apply it to currently puzzling chemical phenomena.
