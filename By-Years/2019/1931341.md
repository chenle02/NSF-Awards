This award is to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 39th IEEE
International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2019) in
Dallas, Texas. Participation in ICDCS 2019 and similar conferences are valuable
and important activities of the graduate school experience. It provides students
with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes
students to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area
of research. The long-term merits of this program's impact on distributed
computing research are well established.

The conference will be held in Dallas, Texas, July 7-10, will span four days and
will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, industry presentations,
posters, and demonstrations. It will also feature keynote speeches from leading
researchers and practitioners in the field.

Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed
with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the
conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying
particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research
interest.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
