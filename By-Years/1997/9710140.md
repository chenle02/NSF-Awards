9710140 Nelson The aim of this proposal is to achieve an improved fundamental
understanding of the dynamical and structural evolution of amorphous and
partially disordered materials. Density dynamics of super cooled liquids in the
picosecond through millisecond range will be examined, together with the mode-
coupling theoretical predictions of supercooled liquid behavior. Linear and
(primarily) nonlinear lattice dynamics in crystals near structural phase
transitions will be studied to elucidate anharmonic crystalline potential energy
surfaces that dictate phase transition mechanisms as well as the dynamics of
phase transitions under the influence of short laser pulses. Measurements will
also be conducted on thin film structures using laser generated acoustic waves
to carry out a systematic study of adhesion, and to develop a new kind of
photoacoustic imaging of patterned films and film-substrate assemblies such as
those used in microelectronics. %%% An understanding of condensed materials such
as glass forming liquids and sol-gel glasses with viscous liquid guests are of
tremendous importance to industries involved with the advancement of various
technologies dependent on both bulk and thin film materials applications. For
example, this project will develop new techniques that will allow for the first-
time a thorough characterization of adhesion mechanics in highly spatially
resolved film substrate structures, the study of semiconductor transitions under
the influence of short laser pulses, and density dynamics in glass forming
liquids that will allow more complete testing of theoretical predictions and
additional guidance for theoretical development.
