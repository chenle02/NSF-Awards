This project will address questions in Analysis, Group Representation Theory,
and Number Theory. The part on Analysis will include Radon transform, partial
differential equations, Riemann surfaces, and scattering theory. The part on
group representations will be devoted to developing new techniques to handle
higher rank groups. Finally, the part on number theory will encompass the Roger-
Ramanujan identities, transcendental numbers and PDEs, and Euler series. This is
an ambitious program designed to solve fundamental problems intertwined among
various mathematical disciplines.
