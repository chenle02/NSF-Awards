This proposal on "Kinetics and Mechanisms of Oxygen Atom Transfer" between Dr.
Fred Basolo of Northwestern University and Professor Qizhen Shi of Lanzhou
University, China, is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
and the Chinese State Educational Commission (SEDC). In this renewal of their
earlier grant, the investigators propose to continue their research on the
kinetics and mechanisms of O-atom transfer reactions to CO of a metal carbonyl,
extending it to other O-atom transfer reagents and to attempt to understand
better the properties responsible for a good O-atom transfer reagent. The
investigators will conduct experiments to understand why (CH3)3NO is such a
strong nucleophile of the carbon atom of CO in certain metal carbonyls. Since
these types of reactions are often used in the syntheses of organometallic
compounds and in their use as homogeneous catalysts, the knowledge gained on
this project should be of value to research chemists in industry working on more
applied related problems.
