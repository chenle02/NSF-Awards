The survey, a vital element in NSF's efforts to measure scientific and
technological activities in industry, collects data on dollar volume of research
and development, sources of financing, employment of R&D scientists and
engineers, and other economic characteristics of industrial R&D performance. The
contractor will produce detailed statistical tables displaying survey results.
As part of its requirement under the National Science Foundation Act, as
amended, to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation
and analysis of data on the current and projected availability of scientific and
technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and disseminates
statistical data on detailed characteristics of industrial R&D spending and
employment of scientists and engineers. The data collected in this survey are
published as tables and used in analytical reports; they provide policy makers
with a broad range of statistical information for industrial research and
development spending and employment.
