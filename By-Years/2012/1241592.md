The School of Business and Management at Norwich University is supporting four
cohorts of upper-class undergraduate students in Computer Security and
Information Assurance (CSIA) for the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program. Students elect one of two concentrations -- Forensics or Advanced
INFOSEC -- and are expected to meet the standards established by the National
Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee for
Information Systems Security Professionals upon graduation. Norwich's CSIA
program has been designated as both a Center of Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance (since 2001) and, most recently, a Center of Digital
Forensic Academic Excellence by DC3 in the Department of Defense.

The Norwich SFS program supports the Nation's demand for information assurance
professionals in the federal workforce with expertise that ultimately
contributes to the protection of the national information infrastructure.
Students develop a thorough commitment to a multi-disciplinary perspective on
computer security, with awareness of how technology must be integrated with
human factors for success in defending information resources. This is done
within a program that emphasizes internships and academic-year activities that
serve to reconnect students constantly to the importance of IA for our economy.
The program's strong mentoring component also gives students grounding in the
advantages of a cooperative culture as they transition to the workplace.
Additionally, the SFS program seeks to increase participation from more women
and veterans, the latter group aligning closely with the military orientation of
Norwich.
