This project supports the dissertation research of graduate student Stacey Fritz
on the militarization of Alaska and the western Canadian Arctic through the
construction of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line). Fritz has an
innovative logistical plan, she will approach communities via "low impact"
transportation, by canoe, snow machine, and hiking; in this way she hopes to
gain entre into a number of communities in a locally contextualized way. The
interdisciplinary research project combines ethnography, ethnohistory, and
environmental sciences to examine the social, political, cultural and economic
impacts of the DEW line in the north.
