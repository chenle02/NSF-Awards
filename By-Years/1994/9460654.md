This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the
feasibility of developing a mathematical software environment for classroom use
in high schools. The design philosophy will be driven by the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics' (NCTM) Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School
Mathematics and the software system will run on a Personal Digital Assistant
(PDA.) Major components of the system will include: a geometry sketching
facility, algebraic manipulation, numerical calculation, trigonometric
evaluations and graphing. All these components will interact with each other and
will be accessed via a user interface suitable for use by high-school students.
The project will evaluate these components with the aid of teachers and high
school students and, subsequently, produce a software architectural design
suitable for implementation in Phases II and III.
