Electroslag welding is an automotable process having several advantages: high
rates of weld metal deposition, applicability to thick sections (up to one foot
or even more), low distortions due to residual stresses, and cost-effectiveness
if no post-weld heat treatment is required. However, the process also has
disadvantages: wide heat-affected zone, large grains, and possible embrittlement
due to segregation of impurities in grain boundaries. The disadvantages are
attributed to the high rates of heat input and the slow cooling. The
disadvantages are reduced by reducing the rates of heat input and by stirring
the weld puddle. The materials used will be 2 1/4% Cr - 1% Mo steel and HY 80
structural steel. The speed of deposition will be increased above normal rates,
thus distributing the heat over a longer weld distance. Hollow strip electrodes
filled with iron and manganese powders will be used. The weld pool will be
stirred magnetically. The voltage-current diagram will be explored
systematically. Weldments will be evaluated by x-ray and ultrasonic inspection
methods, metallography, hardness traverses, and charpy V-notch tests (for
toughness).
