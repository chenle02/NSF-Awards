This project will support a special year in general topology to be held at
Kansas State University. The focus of the special year will be on areas in
general topology which include the topology of function spaces, which relates
general topology to analysis and descriptive set theory. In particular, there
will be an emphasis on cleavability, a generalization of one-one continuous
functions, which is applicable to different areas of topology such as abstract
spaces and continua theory. The special year will consist of a semester-long
visit sponsored by Kansas State University of Professor A.V. Arhangel'skii of
Moscow University, a joint topology seminar held jointly with the University of
Kansas, short-term visits by researchers in topology and, finally, a short
conference on topology. This conference, to be held January 3-6, 1992, will
feature a major series of lectures on the concept of cleavability of a
topological space and talks on general topology.
