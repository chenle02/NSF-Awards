9405068 Caviness The research to be carried out is in the general area of
algorithms for integration in finite terms (that is, indefinite or symbolic
integration) with particular emphasis on the development and implementation of
algorithms involving special functions. In the last few decades substantial
progress has been made on algorithms for integration in finite terms. Risch's
work culminated more than a century of work on integration of elementary
functions. Almost immediately attention turned to integration involving larger
classes of functions including special functions. The first real advance in this
area was the extension of the Liouville theorem for a class of special functions
by Singer, Saunders, and Caviness upon which Cherry and Knowles developed
algorithms for integrating integrands containing error functions and logarithmic
integrals in terms of such. This work however did not cover the important
dilogarithms and associated functions that occur in many applications.
Baddoura's work has given an elegant way to integrate in terms of the
dilogarithm. This project will continue this line of research. The overall
objective is to implement the algorithms obtained and to improve and extend
their scope for integration of and in terms of various special functions. ***
