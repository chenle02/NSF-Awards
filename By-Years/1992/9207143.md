This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan. The student will study changes in the social
stratification of a village in a developing area of Sri Lanka. Using baseline
data from the 1960s, the student will get life histories, practice participant
observation, and analyze daily linguistic interactions to assess changes in the
underlying principles of caste, class, and gender as they affect changes in
social stratification. This project is important because it will provide a case
study of changes in social stratification in one village in Sri Lanka that are
mirrored in many traditional societies of the world. Understanding the affect of
new economic opportunities on old hierarchies of gender and caste dominance can
help policy makers ameliorate the problems created by rapid social and economic
change.
