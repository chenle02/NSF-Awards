A primary goal of this project is to finish the proof of the Atiyah-Floer
conjecture by a version of the large structure limit in a formulation of mirror
symmetry for Kaehler surfaces. This would relate the gauge theoretic Floer
homology of a homology three-sphere to a Floer homology of Lagrangians which
arise from moduli spaces of flat bundles associated to a Heegaard splitting.
Another large part of the project aims to realize Lagrangian correspondences as
composable functors on refined Donaldson-Fukaya categories. This should lead to
topological invariants and TQFT's by using gauge theoretic moduli spaces to
represent topological morphisms ( e.g. 3-cobordisms or tangles) as Lagrangian
correspondences.

The project belongs into the general realm of interaction between symplectic
geometry and low dimensional topology. The construction of topological
invariants via a symplectic category has been a guiding vision in this field
although the geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences is only
partially defined. This project aims to realize this vision, based on a full
algebraic definition of compositions. Moreover, a proof of the Atiyah-Floer
conjecture would be an important step towards understanding the relations
between different invariants of 3-manifolds. More generally, this project aims
to further the understanding and exposition of the analytic foundations of gauge
theory, pseudoholomorphic curves, and moduli spaces of nonlinear PDE's in
general.
