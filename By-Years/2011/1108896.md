The purpose this project is to examine the capabilities of cyber-enabled
tangible tools in real educational settings with five teachers (three high
schools and two college) and 450 high school and college students. The project
evaluates the use of cyber-enabled tangible tools to enhance student's
understanding of three difficult topics in molecular biology: (1) protein
structure, (2) DNA, and (3) viruses. As core concepts of molecular biology
instruction in the U.S., students often have difficulties understanding how
molecular interactions result in structures that give rise to function. The
intent of this project is to help students understand mappings between
structure, function, and emergent properties and processes. Hence, the cyber-
enabled tangible tools will test whether technology enhances and improves how
difficult subject matter is taught. Additionally, the study provides information
about what areas of content can be effectively conveyed with these technologies
and for which levels of students (high school or
college).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project are potentially
transformative improvements in medicine, pharmacology, agriculture, ecology
education. The tools promote computer-human interactions at the atomic,
molecular, and organ levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand-held objects with
markers, similar to barcodes, use a web cam to track and illustrate different
properties and features on a computer screen. Research shows that as molecular
biology grows in prominence, there is greater need for materials and scaffolds
that promote deep learning and motivation. To help meet those needs, the project
brings together leaders from top research entities, researchers in cognition and
student learning, scientists, science educators, teachers, and high school and
college students to investigate how cyber-enabled tangibles promote different
and improved ways to learn core concepts in molecular biology.
