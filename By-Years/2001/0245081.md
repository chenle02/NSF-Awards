This project focuses on interference phenomena in multilevel coherently driven
atomic systems. The research will involve two extensions of an on-going project
in non-linear optics, to nuclear matter and to wavelengths of the radiation to
below 0.1nm. The main research objective involves the development of a rigorous
theory of the coherent control of gamma ray Mossbauer transitions and also of
making a series of pioneering experiments demonstrating the strong influence of
optical laser radiation on gamma ray Mossbauer transitions. The broader impact
of the program will be in the ability to manipulate nuclear processes and gamma
emission.
