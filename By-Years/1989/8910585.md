This action is to support the basic maintenance of the Los Angeles Basin Strong
Motion Accelerograph Network. This network was established in 1979/80 to record
the strong ground shaking in the Los Angeles Basin resulting from large
earthquakes. The goal is to provide information that is fundamental to
earthquake engineering and to earthquake hazard mitigation. Very little
earthquake activity occurred in the area covered by the network during the
period from 1980 to 1986. Since then, the Palm Springs, Oceanside, Whittier
Narrows, and Pasadena earthquakes have been recorded. Even though these were not
major earthquakes, outstanding data on strong ground motions were recorded. A
much larger event is expected in the near future, and the Los Angeles Basin
Strong Motion Network is strategically located to record this event. Until this
or another significant earthquake occurs in the vicinity of the Los Angeles
Basin, it is important that the network and its instruments be maintained
satisfactorily, and that the network be kept in a state of readiness to record
strong ground shaking. That is the purpose for this action.
