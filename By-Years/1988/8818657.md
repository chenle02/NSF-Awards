Tritiated proline when injected into the nervous system of cats, is
incorporated preferentially into glial cells. The unusual incorporation pattern
suggested the existence of a previously unrecognized glial-neuronal
communication system. This system involves the translocation of molecules from
glial cells into neuronal soma followed by axonal transport and partial
redistribution to adjacent glial processes. The long-term goals of the research
are to characterize the molecules involved in the translocation sequence and to
understand the operations and functions of the system. These studies will
utilize anatomical and biochemical methods to characterize the preferential
incorporation of proline into feline glia and to determine the translocation
process to neurons. Other studies will document the suitability of the rat and
determine the use of optimal neuronal pathways. Future studies will address
questions regarding possible functions of the glial-neuronal communication
system during neuronal activity and maturation. Although neuroscientists agree
that brain function is carried out by combined actions of neurons and glia, the
actual mechanisms of communication and cooperation are poorly understood. These
studies are designed to improve this understanding.
