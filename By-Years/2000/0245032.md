The focus of this project is the development of a novel physical system for the
creation of non-gaussian quantum states of light and of multipartite continuous-
variable entanglement. The system is a three-photon optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) based on an effective third-order nonlinearity resulting from
the cascade of two second-order non-linearities in a properly designed optical
resonator. Feasibility studies of such a system show that its threshold can be
made much lower than would be expected, practically as low as that of a two-
photon OPO. Experiments will be undertaken to characterize the quantum
properties of the three-photon OPO. Broader aspects of the proposed activity
include, besides significant contributions to graduate education, the
development of collaborations with the Engineering School at the University of
Virginia on the topics of quantum information and nonlinear optical materials
science, and in the context of the University of Virginia 2020 Initiative for
the Sciences.
