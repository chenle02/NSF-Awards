Abstract

The objective of this research is to establish a fuel-cell architecture that
maintains the energy density even with miniaturization down to millimeters. The
approach is to eliminate all the supporting components (pump, gas separator,
membrane electrode assembly, and the interconnections) from the fuel-cell
construction, leaving only the active fluidic materials and the housing
structure in the system. Such a revolutionary system is proposed feasible by
integrating two recent technologies: self-circulation of liquid reactants and
laminar-flow fuel cells.

Intellectual merit: While already commercialized in regular scale, fuel cells
have been encountering serious challenges in system miniaturization below a
centimeter. Since most of the components essential in the existing fuel cells
cannot be miniaturized to microscale, micro fuel cells would require a
completely new architecture free of discrete components. Such a system is
proposed by circulating the liquid reactants by the self-generated CO2 bubbles
in a membrane-free fuel cell based on laminar flows. When developed
successfully, the ultra-compact system can be fabricated without assembly.

Broader Impact: Due to the high energy density of their fuels, micro fuel cells
are promising to extend the operation time of many small devices ?{ from cell
phones to remote sensors. Considering the ever-increasing use of portable
devices, the environment friendliness of fuel cells should also be noted. The
proposed work requires an interdisciplinary and integrated approach in research
and education on the issues ranging from microfluidics, fuel cells,
microfabrication, and applications, to societal impact. Students will gain
first-hand experience for their future career in miniaturized systems and
alternative energies.
