This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the Major Research
Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) program have been awarded to
support the acquisition of a TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Microscopy)
microscope at the Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY Hunter
College). TIRF is an emerging technology used by researchers to probe single
molecules in biological samples, both in living cells and in fixed preparations.
In addition, TIRF can be used to probe in vitro preparations containing cell
extracts or purified molecular components with fluorescence characteristics
compatible with the system. The research enabled by the new microscope will help
refine the models of RNA transport, and improve understanding of cell-cell
signaling in eukaryotes, and neuronal development. The new microscope is also
being used to provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to
do research and learn innovative, leading-edge fluorescence imaging techniques.
Hunter College of the City University of New York is a minority-serving
institution, with a full commitment to research and teaching. The College is
committed to increasing the opportunities for under-represented minority
researchers, women, and people with disabilities to pursue scientific careers in
areas of biological research by providing an environment of excellence and
active research. The faculty involved with this project actively recruit
students from groups underrepresented in science to be involved in their
research, and are using the system to expand a course in fluorescence microscopy
at Hunter College. Results from the studies performed with the TIRF system will
be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and disseminated through
student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.
