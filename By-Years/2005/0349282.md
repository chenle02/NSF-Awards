This project will characterize the physical and chemical properties of
carbonaceous particles generated in the combustion of solid fuels. Particles
from these sources have received less attention than from other sources, but are
estimated to account for roughly 2/3 of the global emissions. The project will
involve a mixture of laboratory and field studies that include examining the
emissions from fuels in various stages of combustion using a two-stage pyrolytic
reactor developed in this study, analyzing samples collected from locations for
which solid fuels are widely used (primarily third world Asian countries) to
compare with the laboratory results, and development of schemes for
incorporation of these results into models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work plan
includes a broad goal to improve understanding of international air-quality
issues for students and the general public. Observations and data analysis will
be incorporated into a class that will include discussion and application of
statistical methods. The concept of emission inventories will be used along with
a database query model as a tool to demonstrate the impacts of various types and
locations of emissions on atmospheric particulate content. This model will also
be made available as a web-based tool. Guest lecturers, with expertise on
international air quality issues, will be invited to the PI's institution to
interact with students in the department and with members of the wider
university community. Two graduate students will receive training under this
program. This research will lead to better representation of carbon-containing
particles in chemical transport models. Links between the fields of combustion
and atmospheric chemistry will be improved, and collaborations between
international researchers and non-profit organizations will be enhanced. The
facility for generating combustion-based particles will be useful to the
community for calibration and instrument intercomparison.
