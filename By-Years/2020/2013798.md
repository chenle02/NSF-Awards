The overarching goal of the project is to better understand how cells respond to
DNA damage. Recent evidence suggests that localized DNA damage affects the cell
state as a whole, but the mechanisms underlying such a large-scale response are
unknown. This project aims to investigate nucleus-wide changes in chromatin
modification and reorganization that occur well beyond the sites of DNA damage,
and their impact on gene expression. The project will provide multidisciplinary
training opportunities, ranging from visualization of single cell responses to
DNA damage to genome-wide views of damage signaling, for graduate, undergraduate
and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past studies have focused on
chromatin changes at sites of DNA damage that are important for proper DNA
repair. More recent data suggest that damage signaling spreads beyond these
sites and triggers nucleus-wide changes in chromatin. This project will utilize
a combination of fluorescent single-cell imaging and integrative genomic
sequencing analyses to determine DNA damage-induced histone modifications and
alterations in three-dimensional chromatin interactions, and address how these
changes influence gene expression and cellular phenotype. The outcomes will
provide new insights into epigenetic DNA damage signaling in mammalian
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
