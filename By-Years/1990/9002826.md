Nets are widely used in the theory of concurrency. One evident reason for that
is the convenience of visualizing the communication structure of systems. Nets
seem to cover almost any situation which involves "sharing" or communication.
For an engineer it could mean sharing of component terminals by connecting them
electrically; a mathematician can consider sharing of variables in a system of
equations or sharing relations when they are composed. This is a research
program into semantics of concurrent systems which are based on the net concept.
Hopefully the expected results will provide a reliable basis for design of such
systems and reasoning about them. As a byproduct one can expect also more
insight into the semantics of nets in other "sharing situations". Fundamental
research will be carried out on semantics and proof theory of networks of
dataflow and other concurrent processes, emphasizing "causal" semantics to
support refinement and atomicity of process behavior. The work will be carried
out by Professor Boris A. Trakhtenbrot of Tel Aviv University in collaboration
with the Principal Investigator.
