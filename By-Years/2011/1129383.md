This engineering education research project seeks to use a large, existing data
set to help understand why some engineering disciplines attract more women and
under-represented groups than others. In recognizing that different populations
respond differently to programs, recruiting, and perceptions, this study can
help us understand why students from different groups have different success
rates for earning degrees in various engineering disciplines. The results of
this study can better inform policy decisions aimed at recruiting and retaining
students in engineering programs, and thus impact the engineering workforce.

The broader significance and importance of this project is by looking at data on
large numbers of students from multiple institutions, the researchers can begin
to understand how different groups experience college differently and how this
impacts their success in obtaining an engineering degree. By basing the analysis
on historical data, the study can potentially identify and help correct
misconceptions about which groups of students succeed in engineering programs,
and thus better engineer recruitment and retention efforts already underway at
colleges to become more effective and efficient.
