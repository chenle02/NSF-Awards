DMI-9561853 Miller This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
develops new software for solving planning, and scheduling problems in flexible
manufacturing facilities. The software design is directed to solutions for
large-scale industrial planning and scheduling. @enefits are expected in
increased production capacity, reduced waste, lower operating costs, reduced
inventories, and shorter response time to customer orders. The approach is a
rigorous mathematical formulation of planning and scheduling problems and relies
on a novel problem decomposition methodology. The decomposition scheme uses a
sliding time window containing a detailed model, coupled to a coarse-grained
planning model for the remainder of the time horizon. The heart of the method is
an automated mechanism for propagating a detailed window along the time axis in
an iterative fashion, much like numerical integration. The time axis is
decomposed into fine and coarse grained sections. In the fine grained section,
the scheduling problem will be modeled and solved as a mixed-integer linear
program. The length of the fine-grained time window is chosen so that the
scheduling subproblem may be solved using a customized algorythm. The remainder
of the time horizon (outside the fine grained window) will be modeled using
aggregate constraints and solved by relaxing integrality conditions. This allows
such macroscopic features as plant capacity and anticipated product demand to be
propagated into each detailed scheduling subproblem. If successful, this
research will provide a new engine for scheduling tools useful in process
industries. Available software is difficult and expensive to install and
maintain and does not provide high quality solutions. The new software is
expected to reduce customization and installation time and yet provide high
quality results.
