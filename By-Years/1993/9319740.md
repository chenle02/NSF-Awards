9319740 Weiller The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography will develop
a program trageting biologically oriented aquatic scientists who have recently
obtained their Ph.D. Degrees, wish to pursue interdisciplinary, aquatic science
research, and benefit from the cross-fertilization derived from combining
limnological and oceanographic research and perspectives. The goals of the
program are to help integrate young scientists into the research community,
broaden their perspectives of the field, foster long-term collegial associations
and collaborations across the spectrum of biologically oriented limnology and
oceanography, and interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research. A five-day
symposium for 40 recent Ph.D.'s will be held during October, 1994. During the
symposium entitled "Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology
and Oceanography" (DIALOG) Program, participants will make oral presentations on
their Ph.D. work, discuss emerging trends and issues in limnology and
oceanography, and work together to develop a set of recommendations on one or
more topics of current interest.
