This project is concerned with the mathematical foundations of control theory
of those partial differential equations, hybrid and hereditary systems which
arise in science and engineering. The issues to be addressed are robust control
and stabilization of such systems and their effective approximation by finite
dimensional systems (usually governed by ordinary differential equations)
together with facilitating computer algorithms. One of the main problems of
structural mechanics is to dampen vibrations, or to control the motion, of
highly flexible, often very large, lightweight structures. This project is
intended to design and analyze control mechanisms which stabilize those infinite
dimensional dynamical systems which model such structures. Feedback controls
designed to achieve a certain performance level often contain unavoidable time
delays due, for example, to the time required to process the information
required to implement the control action. Another aspect of this research will
be the study of robustness of techniques of control system analysis and
synthesis of such "hereditary" systems to errors that may be involved in their
modelling or approximation.
