The research investigates the importance of international financial market
linkages for macroeconomic activity. It is divided into three related topics,
each part very cruical in improving our understanding concerning financial
markets and fiscal policies in an international setting. (1) Financial Markets
and Macroeconomic Linkages. This part explores the effect of closing
international markets in contingent securities on the character of international
business cycles and asset prices. Specifically, whether imposing plausible asset
market restrictions improves the predictive power of international real business
cycle models will be explored. (2) The International Transmission of Fiscal
Policy. This part studies the international transmission of shifts in domestic
tax and expenditure policies, under alternative assumptions concerning the
extent of financial market linkages. Initial research suggests that asset market
restrictions are likely to be very important for the transmission of fiscal
shocks. (3) Incomplete Asset Markets and Optimal Portfolio Choice. This part
reopens the well known, but little understood, "international diversification
puzzle" (individuals tend to hold portfolios in which their country's assets
represent a disproportionately large share, relative to their share in the world
market). When labor income risk is non-insurable, the optimal portfolio is shown
to involve a short position in securities of national origin, in order to
optimally hedge this risk. In this part of the project, the welfare effects of
the observed deviations from the optimal portfolio under incomplete markets will
be investigated.
