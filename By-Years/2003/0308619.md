This research will advance the state-of-the-art of carbon nanotube-based
materials for applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Carbon nanotubes are a
novel material with unusual structural, electronic, mechanical and
chemical&lt;br/&gt;properties. The researchers have developed a unique
capability to produce sizeable quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNT) with controlled structure (diameter and length). The project will
capitalize on this capability&lt;br/&gt;by focusing on the design of unique
molecular sieve supports for&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous catalysts, which would have
the following characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;large diameter compared to typical
zeolites, adjustable channel length, and&lt;br/&gt;chemical inertness. There is
also the possibility of adjusting the support's acidity&lt;br/&gt;density, one-
dimensionality, and enhanced molecular diffusivity. To reach&lt;br/&gt;this
goal, the SWNT diameters will be adjusted by modifying the
synthesis&lt;br/&gt;reaction temperature and by selectively removing small
diameter nanotubes by&lt;br/&gt;preferential oxidation. Heterogeneous catalysts
will then be synthesized with varying metal and acidity contents and tested for
two reactions of great industrial importance. These are the aromatization of
alkanes and the hydrogenation of aromatics in the presence of sulfur.
Environmental concerns about aromatics have resulted in regulation that limit
their handling and transportation as well as their content in diesel fuels and
gasolines. The two processes to be investigated play an important part in
minimizing the environmental impact of handling aromatics and diesel fuels.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to broaden the impact of the research activities,
undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;high-school teachers and selected high school
students will participate in&lt;br/&gt;the project. In collaboration with the
American Indian Student Association,&lt;br/&gt;minority Engineering students
will be selected to join the research program. &lt;br/&gt;
