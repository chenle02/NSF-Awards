9318772 Stoecker Flagellated microalgae that exist in brine pools within land-
fast sea-ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, will be investigated. The research
focuses on the growth and life history of the dominant cysts-forming brine
microalgae. Oceanographers envisioned that cysts of brine microalgae may be
important paleoenvironmental indicators of past global climates. Dr. Stoecker
plans both field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the physiological growth
responses of flagellated microalgae and cyst formation to changes in
temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients and irradiance. The presence of brine
microalgal cysts from sea-ice will also be assessed in the water column and
sediments under annual sea-ice. This research will provide significant
biological information on the interaction of brine microalgae in land-fast ice
and underlying marine sediments. ***
