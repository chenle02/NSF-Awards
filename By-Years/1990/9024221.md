Andean cloud forest is the most devastated and threatened area within Ecuador.
Consequently, studies of cloud forest plants must be undertaken before their
genetic diversity is lost to extinction through habitat conversion. The
Ericaceae family (blueberries, cranberries, rhododendrons, and azaleas) is a
prominent feature of tropical cloud forest in Ecuador and often dominates a
major vegetation type. Fifty percent of the Ericaceae (92 species) growing in
cloud forest in Ecuador maybe be considered endangered. Ericaceae also has great
economic potential in Ecuador for food, horticulture, and floriculture which
have not yet been exploited. This project, culminating in a taxonomic treatment
of the family Ericaceae for the international project Flora of Ecuador, will
enhance the capabilities of institutions in Ecuador to conduct research related
to biological diversity and economic potential. It will provide basic
information on species richness (i.e. biodiversity); it will provide a picture
of the distribution of plants thus pinpointing centers of diversity (for local
conservation); it will provide a reference for purposes of comparing areas and
help Ecuadoreans in locating and designing new areas for protection and in
preparing master plans for these areas; and finally it will provide training for
local scientists and students in survey and collecting techniques, herbarium
management, and botanical publication.
