The reseach involves the exploration of the implications of the standard model
of strong and electroweak interactions. This investigation is particularly
important as experimental particle physics moves to higher energy. Predictions
of the standard model are necessary either to confirm the foundations of the
model or to aid in recognizing its limitations. Specific topics include the
properties of the Higgs sector and the detectability of the Higgs boson using
the effective gauge boson approximation to study W and Z boson fusion processes,
unitarity effects in guage boson scattering, one-loop corrections to gauge boson
scattering amplitudes, QED corrections to bound state energy levels and the
effects of quantum chromodynamic corrections to the quark-antiquark short
distance potential on the spectrum of heavy quarkonia.
