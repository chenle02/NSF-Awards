This project is collaborative with J. George Shanthikumar of University of
California at Berkeley. The principal investigator's developed the notions of
strong stochastic convexity and directional convexity, which are sample- path
based structural properties essential to the analysis and optimal design of
stochastic discrete event systems in general and queueing networks in
particular. This project focuses on properties relating to structural and policy
changes in queueing networks. To model and understand these changes, notions of
monotonicity and convexity do not apply directly. New concepts and new
machineries along the lines of stochastic rearrangement and stochastic
majorization will be developed. These notions provide mathematical support for
"pairwise interchange" arguments that are widely used in scheduling, control,
and resource allocation. Preliminary studies have demonstrated their usefulness
and effectiveness in dealing with structural and policy changes. Furthermore,
these properties are natural extensions of stochastic convexity. A new, unified
hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-order properties in queueing networks
appears to be now emerging. Together, these properties will support the (static)
parametric design of queueing networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.
