Why do increases in women's participation in the market economy tend to be
associated with increases in the number of households maintained by women alone?
In order to answer this question, more accurate measures are needed of long run
changes in both labor force composition and household structure. Yet, most
studies of this crucial interrelationship in the U.S. are limited to the post
World War II period, when the overall picture was greatly complicated by the
dramatic expansion of federal welfare programs. To remedy this shortcoming, this
project will a develop and analyze data on the growth of female labor force
participation as affected by the percentage of families maintained by women
alone. The data will be assembled for five rapidly industrializing towns in
Massachusetts between 1880 and 1910. The study will explore the economic
consequences for women of different ages, family composition, and ethnic
background. This will involve the collection and analysis of manuscript census
data, tax and poor relief records that will provide new, accurate estimates of
female labor-force participation, household structure, and economic welfare. In
addition, the study will also provide some benchmark estimates of similar
nationwide trends based on analysis of the U.S. Census Public Use Samples for
1900 and 1910. This project is important because it will provide a better
understanding of the factors affecting the growth of women in the labor force,
particularly the effect of female headed households.
