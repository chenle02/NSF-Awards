Plantations, the botanical garden and arboretum of Cornell University, is
developing a model program of informal education for elementary (K-5) school
children. Project LEAP, Learning About Plants, will integrate the academic
resources of Cornell University and the informal setting of its botanic gardens
with the teaching of mathematics and science in local elementary schools. The
project contains five components: 1) a conceptually-based curriculum of biology,
ecology and agriculture which will include some components of SCIS (Science
Curriculum Improvement Study) and OBIS (Outdoor Biology Instructional
Strategies); 2) a teacher training workshop to stimulate curriculum integration
and modification; 3) multiple two-year visits between Plantations and local
schools providing children with direct experience with plants and animals; 4) a
quantitative program of curriculum development and evaluation based on learning
theory; and 5) a plan for dissemination of the structure and instructional
contents of this program. Because children will experience LEAP over a period of
years, the complex and meaningful learning of concepts in science will be
achieved in the earliest years of a child's education. Because LEAP is being
designed to become a model program applicable to many institutions of informal
education, two publications will be produced: a notebook which describes the
overall structure of the program, and a handbook for teachers which presents the
individual lessons of the curriculum and the theoretical background supporting
the choice of curriculum material. The notebook will distinguish those elements
of the program peculiar to Cornell and Plantations, and mechanisms through which
the program can be adapted to other institutions. The project is being split-
funded by the Instructional Materials Development and Informal Science Education
Programs.
