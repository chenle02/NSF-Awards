9305478 Luo This is a Research Planning Grant that will allow the principal
investigator to attend meetings and participate in other activities that will
facilitate the preparation of a full proposal in the area of ferrofluids. On
particular interest are the properties of frozen ferrofluids, which are
interesting random magnet systems. %%% This is a Research Planning Grant that

other activities that will facilitate the preparation of a full proposal in the
area of ferrofluids. Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles
which are of great interest both fundamentally and technologically. They are
used in magnetic clutches and can also serve as friction reduction and cooling
media in loudspeaker coils. ***
