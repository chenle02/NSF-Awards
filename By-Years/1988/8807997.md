A direct connection will be made between ultrafast time resolved measurements
of the internal motions of proteins and calculations of protein motion based on
molecular dynamics. The experiments will use both absorption and emission
anisotropy techniques to study orientational correction functions and order
parameters. The aim is to provide a definite set of measurements against which
to match current simulation techniques and assess the adequacy of the potential
model. In addition, complementary simulations of carefully chosen proteins
including solvent will be carried out. The internal motions of protein molecules
have generated much interest in recent years because of their possible
significance in protein function. A variety of techniques for the study of
protein dynamics have been developed. Improvements in time resolved spectroscopy
and computers are extending the time scale of both experiment and simulation so
that it is beginning to be possible to make direct comparisions. The major aim
of Dr. Fleming's research is to make these comparisions in as clear and direct a
way as possible.//
