Funds are requested for the further development and upgrading of the Electron-
Spin Echo Spectrometer that was constructed under NSF grant B1R-9224431 in
1993-1995. The main directions of ESE instrumentation development are: 1.
Increasing the sensitivity to weak modulation by implementation of a /2
increment phase cycle with a quadrature detection scheme and by several other
improvements described hereafter. 2. Extension of the frequency range of the
existing ESE spectrometer down to 2 GHz, to give a unique wideband 2-18 GHz ESE
spectrometer. 3. Implementation of a broadband pulsed ENDOR spectrometer. This
research equipment will be employed in several different research projects
including: general development of pulsed ESR spectroscopy focused on detection
of the extremely weak Electron Spin-Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) with
special emphasis on its Pulse-Adjustable variant; investigation of the
structures of model heme complexes and heme proteins; investigation of the
structure of the molybdenum and heme centers of sulfite oxidase (SO) and model
molybdenum (V) complexes; studies of cytochromes P450 and b5 from insects and
the effects of point mutations on their heme centers; characterization of
coordination compounds of large ring systems and determination of their
molecular recognition properties. The wide range of biological research problems
addressed in this proposal clearly demonstrates the comprehensive capabilities
of this state-of-the-art spectrometer that combine broad-banded ESE and pulsed-
ENDOR in a single flexible system. The diverse capabilities and high sensitivity
of the proposed instrument will enable the surroundings of metal centers in
biological systems to be mapped out in unprecedented detail. No presently
available commercial instrument provides all of the unique features proposed
here. The new generation of commercial instruments that are soon to be marketed
will c ontain some of these features but will cost two to three times as much.
