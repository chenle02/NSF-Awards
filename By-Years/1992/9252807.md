The goals of this Summer Science Camp are to generate and maintain an interest
in science and mathematics among African-American and Hispanic students and to
encourage them to consider careers in science and mathematics. Sixty rising
seventh-, eighth-, and ninth grade minority students from Knoxville,
Chattanooga, and other areas of East Tennessee will partricipate in this camp.
The program foccuses on both life and physical sciencw, thus exposing them to
two major divisions of scientific inquiry. Mathematics, as well as other
discipline areas, are integrated into the four-week residential program. The
life science component focuses on population studies; the physical science
component focuses on the science and mathematics of several aspects of daily
living and recreation. Biology, mathematics, geology, chemistry, physics, money
management, and nutrition are intgegral facets of the both project areas.
Students participate in hands-on research activities interspersed with
discussions related to their activities. In addition, students participate in
career guidance and counseling activities, learn to write and present a formal
report, practice good study skills, are exposed to motivational programs, and
interact with role models from a variety of settings. During the four-week camp,
activities will also be offered for parents and siblings. Instructors are
experienced college and high school staff members, practicing scientists and
mathematicians, and high shcool students. Follow-up activities during the
academic year will be on a bi-monthly basis.
