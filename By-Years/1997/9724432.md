9724432 Wattrus This award to University of Minnesota supports acquisition of a
multibeam sonar system for lake floor mapping and an acoustic doppler current
profiler for measuring water column velocity. Both systems are portable so they
may be used on vessels of opportunity in the Great Lakes and elsewhere
(including East Africa and South America, where these investigators have ongoing
research projects). In conjunction with these systems, they will acquire a high
precision navigation system, which may be operated with both instruments,
providing the necessary velocity, heading and motion sensors. This project is
supported under the Major Research Instrumentation Program, and includes
substantial cost-share towards instrumentation and technician time by University
of Minnesota. ***
