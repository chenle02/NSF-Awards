9703329 Okikiolu The research supported in this award lies in the general area
of geometric analysis. More specifically, the investigator is to study
properties of the determinant of the Laplacian on closed compact Riemannian
manifolds under all smooth perturbations in the metric which leave the total
volume fixed. This may have implications for the Poincare conjecture. In
addition, the investigator is to consider the wave operator on general
negatively curved manifolds in connection with quantum chaos theory. This award
is made under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program which funds
projects that contain highly meritorious research coupled with a strong
educational component. For example, the investigator of this award intends to
run summer workshops for students introducing them to various current problems
in geometric analysis using numerical methods. Also, she is to help develop
inner-city K-12 mathematics and science curricula by producing a series of
videos depicting model lessons for the inner-city classroom. The lessons will
involve design and construction activities which lead directly to the study of
mathematics, and incorporate elements from minority social cultures.
