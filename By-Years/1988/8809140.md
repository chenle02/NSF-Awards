This research is a theoretical and experimental study of the detachment of
particles from surfaces by flowing liquids. The effects of particle size,
particle material, fluid motion, electrical double layers, and liquid - liquid
interfaces will be explored. Release rates will be determined from the measured
concentration of particles in the liquid flowing past a particle laden surface
and/or by microscopic observation of the particle laden surface. The kinetics of
particle removal from surfaces is poorly understood, yet is of very great
importance to surface cleaning, filtration efficiency, contamination transport,
oil field permeability control, and other applications.
