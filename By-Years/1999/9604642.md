The middle ear is the chamber containing the tiny bones that link the eardrum
to the neuronal structures of the inner ear. Its mechanical performance is a
major factor determining hearing range and sensitivity. We know very little
about how middle ear anatomy in different mammals may be adaptively specialized
for different environments. This interdisciplinary collaborative study combines
a bioengineering and theoretical approach with comparative anatomy to derive and
test models for middle ear mechanics. Hearing physiology is well known for the
domestic cat, but the whole cat family (Felidae) includes a large range of sizes
and a wide diversity of habitats. This work compares the anatomy across a range
of felids to obtain precisely measured dimensions, mathematical scaling factors
for size, and construction of models of acoustical mechanics. Predictions from
these models will be tested by non-invasive recordings from diverse
representatives, including some rare species only available in zoos. Results
will be important not only to auditory biology, but to bioengineering and to
evolutionary biology.
