The 73rd Device Research Conference (DRC) has a University setting and will take
place at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio from June 21 to 24, 2015.
Topics to be addressed include biological devices, emerging Electronic device
materials (graphene, MoS2), devices for energy scavenging power, memory,
nanoscale applications, including Terahertz and spin-based approaches. The
Conference seeks financial support to support student participation. It has a
strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its
short courses, poster session and oral presentations. The DRC also has a
tradition of offering discounted student registration fees, not only for general
attendance but also for its short courses, in order to encourage student
participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an
abstract. Support will allow offering 50% discount for student registration to
the general conference and the day-long short course "Devices Beyond CMOS",held
just prior to the beginning of the conference.
