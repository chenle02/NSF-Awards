This research will use geoelectrical methods along with a supporting systems
methodology for defining aquifer protection layers: natural aquitards and soil
liners. The systems methodology will utilize geostatistics and multicriterion
decision making to quantify the electrical measurements in terms of protection
and soil liner parameters.
