Abstract

Proposal: CHE-0243921 Date: 1-17-2003 Institution: State University of West
Georgia PI: Ray

The Department of Chemistry at the State University of West Georgia will be the
site for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program during the
summers of 2003-2005. Gigi B. Ray is the site director and Victoria Geisler is
co-PI. The site will host 9 students (8 NSF supported) for ten weeks. The West
Georgia REU program is designed to give two-year college students from across
the Southeast a research experience. Approximately two-thirds of the
participants are targeted from two-year colleges. The students will have the
opportunity to participate in research in analytical, biological, computational,
inorganic, and physical chemistry. Nine research projects in these areas, some
involving collaborative efforts between the faculty members, are proposed for
investigation. The intellectual focus will be a hands-on research experience
supplemented with weekly seminars, workshops, field trips to regional research
centers, and student presentations of their work.
