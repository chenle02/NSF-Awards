The development of new hardware architectures encourages the development of
database system technology to take advantage of this greater capability.
Parallel computers hold the promise of increasing the computer throughput at
lower cost than the comparable single processor system. However, these computers
require that the programs that run on them be converted to exploit this
parallelism. The need for ever increasing transaction rates on database systems,
as well as increasing volumes of data processed by these database systems,
requires research into how database systems can make effective use of parallel
computer. This research will investigate how new database algorithms can achieve
considerable speedup through the use of medium grained parallelism on multiple
instruction stream, multiple data stream multiple instruction stream, multiple
data stream (MIMD) computers.
