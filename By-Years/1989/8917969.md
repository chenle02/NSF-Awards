This equipment grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is helping
Professor Alivisatos to obtain critical equipment needed in his investigations
of the synthesis and properties of semiconductor clusters containing several
thousand atoms. Funds are being used to purchase a liquid helium cryostat and a
cryostatic temperature controller for use in electro-optical studies of the
lowest excited state and higher excited states of semiconductor clusters of
nearly uniform size. An oscilloscope for diagnostic work in this experiment and
other facilities will also be purchased.
