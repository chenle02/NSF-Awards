Since plastic packaging accounts for approximately 20 per cent in volume of the
solid waste, recycling plastics will play a significant role in reducing the
volume of solid waste to the landfills of decreasing number and space in the
nation. Students must be educated in the methods to recycle materials in order
to reduce future waste. This project is intended to improve materials laboratory
instruction for major and non- major undergraduates by presenting a series of
typical plastics recycling experiments, including collecting, grinding,
processing, testing and analyzing of recycled plastics. The requested equipment
includes a plastics granulator, an extruder, an optical microscope and a
plastics hardness tester. These instruments and equipment are typical of those
used in the recycling, quality control and property identification of plastics.
The theoretical and practical experience in materials recycling will give
students knowledgeable insight in reducing solid waste, conserving natural
resources and protecting the environment. This project could serve as a model
for undergraduate institutions in the nation for creating an understanding of
the effect and need of recycling materials for the conservation of our
environment and natural resources.
