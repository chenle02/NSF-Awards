This award is for support for U.S. participation in the Arctic Observing Summit
2013 (AOS 2013). The AOS 2013 is the first in a planned series of high-level,
biennial international Arctic observing summits. The AOS is led by the
International Study for Arctic Change (ISAC) as part of the implementation of
the observing change component of the ISAC Science Plan. It is a task of the
Arctic Council's Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) initiative and as
such is also part of the broader SAON implementation process, which is led by
the Arctic Council jointly with the International Arctic Science Committee
(IASC), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Support is sought for
U.S. participant costs, and specifically for the participation of early career
scientists and representatives of Alaska Native organizations and communities
engaged in observing activities or requiring observational information. Exposure
to the international community engaged in the diverse aspects of arctic
observing and the process by which coordination and collaboration across
multiple scientific and other boundaries will benefit early career scholars who
will ultimately be responsible for creating the synergies and collaborations
needed for the future. The participation of Alaska Native groups will ensure
that the AOS outcomes reflect their observing needs and will serve to build the
community of partners to advance arctic observing over the coming years.
