The objective of this workshop is to identify paradigm shifting high impact
research and education themes for systems and control that could lead to
transformative impacts on energy, biology and cognitive sciences in the next
decade. New tools and theories will further advance knowledge and understanding
of control system and its application to an expanded range of systems and
applications. This workshop is an opportunity to formulate new directions for
basic control systems design/research issues that do not fit into the by now
well-known methods of controller design. Experts in the thematic areas of
energy, biology and cognitive sciences will be invited to speak about the
research challenges and the needs in their respective area that can be addressed
by new tools and theories that are not being developed by the control research
community today. Working groups will be organized and charged to develop
specific details in research needs. A final report of the workshop will be
composed to summarize the outcome of the workshop
discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to have a broad impact
in engineering and science areas where systems and control theory and approach
are an integral part. Specifically, the workshop will encourage collaboration
between control system researchers and researchers in energy, biology and
cognitive science area and foster cross-fertilization and interdisciplinary
research. The workshop will encourage the participation of young and
underrepresented groups of researchers to enhance the diversity of
representation and their involvement in scientific activities. The summary
report will provide research and education guideline for control system
development for the next decade.
