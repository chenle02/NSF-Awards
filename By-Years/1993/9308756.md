The limit distributions of GL-statistics with kernels which are degenerate, of
infinite order, or with estimated parameters are proposed. The underlying
invariance principle of ``averaging Kendall's tau on its marginals'' is also
proposed. Furthermore, an approach to derive new test statistics from some
distances for independence of circular data is proposed. Finally, a unifying
theme for many circular rank statistics will be investigated.
