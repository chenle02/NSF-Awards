The principal investigator will continue his study of questions involving
functions of several complex variables related to potential theory, dynamical
systems and holomorphic mapping. With regard to potential theory, he will study
properties of the complex Monge-Ampere operator and its relationship to the
stability of the Dirichlet problem and to the pluri-complex Green function. With
regard to dynamical systems, he will study the behavior of invertible polynomial
mappings of complex Euclidean space, especially the equilibrium measure of the
analog of the Julia set. And with regard to holomorphic mappings, he will try to
classify the smoothly bounded domains that have noncompact automorphism groups.
