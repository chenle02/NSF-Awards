This award supports a two-day workshop in Washington, DC in Spring, 2009, to
discuss ideas for supporting research networks of mathematical scientists. The
mathematical sciences are becoming increasingly collaborative,
interdisciplinary, and interactive. A program of research networks could provide
a novel and effective way to supplement to current funding strategies of
individual investigator awards and large institutes.

A broadly representative group of about 35 participants will consider the
benefits and potential pitfalls, and provide DMS with an report of its
deliberations. A program of research networks would create new ways for
mathematical scientists across a broad spectrum of organizations to interact,
make possible collaborations that current programs cannot support, and provide
researchers who merit support (but who, through lack of NSF funds, have not
received an individual investigator award) with significant resources. Research
Networks would form a very cost-effective way for the DMS to further the broad
goals of the NSF.
