Understanding the motion of fluids with free surfaces is a fundamental problem
in fluid dynamics. Part of the current challenge lies in extending two-
dimensional results to the three-dimensional setting. This project explores
several free-surface problems, including well-posedness of three-dimensional
problems for single fluids and for vortex-sheet interfaces between two shearing
fluids, development of efficient numerical methods to deal with surface tension
in three dimensions, and investigation of global existence of small solutions
and of weak solutions.

Predicting the motion of fluid interfaces is central to many branches of
sciences and engineering. The aim of this project is to facilitate advances in
fluid dynamics research through analysis of underlying fundamental mathematical
structures. By investigating well-posedness of systems of partial differential
equations, this work helps determine whether the underlying fluid-dynamical
models can accurately describe physical reality. By developing efficient
numerical methods, this work facilitates insight into long-time behavior and
mechanisms through which singularities may form. The insight gained will
significantly influence future analysis and experimental studies.
