Frost and Swapp&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0125113&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
determine the effect that melting had on the world-class lead-zinc ore deposit
at Broken Hill, Australia, which was metamorphosed at granulite facies, well
within the range of melting for the pure Pb-Zn-Fe-Ag-S system. We plan to study
the textures, assemblages and mineral compositions within the ore body and its
alteration halo to see if the relations observed can be explained by reactions
between the country rock and a crystallizing and differentiating polymetallic
melt. We plan to use trace element geochemistry to determine if the pyroxenoid
horizon around the ore crystallized from the polymetallic melt. It will also
determine if the high-variance assemblages around the ore body that involve
garnet could have been produced by fluids that were released from the melt
during crystallization of the pyroxenoids. It also intends to study assemblages
within the ore body to see if they record a liquid line of descent, with the
melt becoming enriched in incompatible elements, Ag, Au, As, Bi, Sb, and Tl,
during differentiation. &lt;br/&gt;
