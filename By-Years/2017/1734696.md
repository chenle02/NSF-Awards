This award aims to subsidize travel, workshop and housing expenses of selected
students participating in the Second Workshop on Coreference Resolution Beyond
OntoNotes (CORBON 2017), which will be held on April 4, 2017, immediately
preceding the EACL 2017 conference in Valencia, Spain. &lt;br/&gt;Only students
from U.S. universities who participate in CORBON 2017 as co-authors and/or
presenters of papers accepted to the workshop will be considered for the travel
awards. Preference will be given to (1) students who are in the final year of
their Ph.D. where making long-term collegial connections is valuable and (2) any
financially needy students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the successes of
CORBON 2016, the first of this series of workshops on coreference resolution,
CORBON 2017 continues to encourage work on under-investigated coreference
resolution tasks as well as coreference resolution in less-studied languages.
CORBON 2017 will have two major innovations: a shared task on entity coreference
resolution in a surprise language and a panel discussing the interplay of
referential and discourse relations in text. The travel awards supported by this
project will enable selected students to participate in this exciting workshop.
