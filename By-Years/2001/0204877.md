The ATLAS detector is currently under construction for operation at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Extensive studies show that
the LHC should be able to elucidate the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry
breaking and to study a variety of other topics related to physics at the TeV
scale. In particular, a Higgs boson with couplings given by the Standard Model
will be observable in several channels over the full range of allowed masses. If
supersymmetry is relevant to EW interactions, it will be discovered and the
properties of many supersymmetric particles elucidated.

This proposal requests support for the research of approximately 250 physicists
and engineers from 33 U.S. institutions that comprise the U.S. ATLAS
Collaboration. The U.S. ATLAS groups are making major contributions to the
construction of the ATLAS detector and have continuing responsibilities for the
components they have built as the detector is installed in the experimental
cavern and during the commissioning and installation phases. The U.S. ATLAS
groups are planning to establish Tier 2 regional computing centers as part of an
overall hierarchical grid of ATLAS computing centers spread around the world.
The Tier 2 centers, a key component of this proposal, will play a powerful role
in allowing U.S. universities to fully exploit the potential of the LHC, and
will set an important precedent for future collaboration on large-scale,
international projects.

The groups continue to expand their education/outreach programs, with a
particular focus on high school teachers and students (closely coordinated with
QuarkNet) and on outreach to traditionally under-represented populations.
