The focus of this research is the development of catalysts for enantioselective
1,4-additions of non-stabilized carbanions (Grignard and dialkylzinc reagents)
to alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyls. The investigation will involve the
synthesis of tridentate ligands, preparation and characterization of Cu(I) and
Ni(II) coordination complexes and the examination of the complexes as catalysts
for asymmetric conjugate addition. The focus of the educational plan involves
the teaching of both chemistry majors and non-majors,the involvement of
undergraduates and graduate students in laboratory research and an active
involvement in outreach. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program
is supporting the research and educational plan of Dr. Erick M. Carreira of the
Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.Professor
Carreira will focus his research efforts on the design, synthesis and
development of catalysts for chiral carbon-carbon bond formation. The focus of
Professor Carreira's educational plan involves the teaching of both chemistry
majors and non-majors,the involvement of undergraduates and graduate students in
laboratory research and an active involvement in outreach.
