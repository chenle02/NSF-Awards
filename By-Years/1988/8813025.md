The marine laboratory of the Department of Marine Sciences, Univerity of Puerto
Rico is uniquely situated to provide an easy access to a wide variety of
tropical marine habitats. The field station has a permanent resident staff and a
number of well equipped laboratories. Departmental faculty have in recent years
demonstrated an increased productivity in terms of publications and grant
support for basic research. At the same time, the number of outside scientists
desiring to utilize the Department's field station as a base for their own or
collaborative research has also increased. Presently, a number of U.S. mainland
and foreign scientists regularly utilize the Department's facilities. However,
visitor demand has reached a point where the present accommodations are no
longer adequate. This project provides funds for construction of a dry
laboratory for use principally by visiting scientists, a wet laboratory which
will be suitable for controlled-environment experimentation, and equipment. The
equipment items are commonly requested for use by visitors.
