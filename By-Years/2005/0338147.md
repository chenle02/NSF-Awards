This is a three-year project to maintain and augment as necessary, the network
of approximately fifty automatic weather stations established on the antarctic
continent and on several surrounding islands. These weather stations measure
surface wind, pressure, temperature, humidity, and in some instances other
atmospheric variables, such as snow accumulation and incident solar radiation,
and report these via satellite to a number of ground stations. The data are used
for operational weather forecasting in support of the United States Antarctic
program, for climatological records, and for research purposes. The AWS network,
which began as a small scale program in 1980, has been extremely reliable and
has proven indispensable for both forecasting and research purposes
