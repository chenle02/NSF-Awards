This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to discover and
prove chemical additives for lithium bromide(LiBr)-water vapor absorption
chillers that will significantly improve absorption rates compared to currently
available additives. Current state of the art absorption chiller technology uses
performance additives to increase rates of vapor absorption in order to reduce
absorber size and cost. An additive meeting this goal will enable absorption
chillers to be built with significantly smaller copper tube heat exchangers,
resulting in reduced first costs. This in turn will allow for increased market
share for absorption chillers in the air conditioning industry, and
significantly enhance the competitiveness of this non-chlorofluorocarbon(CFC)
alternative technology. Candidate additives will be selected based on a chemical
catalysis mechanism describing their activity. Absorption rate enhancement
activity will be determined using a falling film test absorption machine.
Chemical stability will be verified by calorimetry and long term thermal
exposure tests. In Phase II, field tests of selected additives will be performed
using production machines. This technology has commercial applications in any
new designs of LiBr-based absorption chillers, as well as similar chillers
currently in service worldwide.
