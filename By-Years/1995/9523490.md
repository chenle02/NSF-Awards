EEC-9523490 Ni This award provides funding for one year to the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Dimensional Measurement and Control in Manufacturing. The central theme of this
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is "achieving manufacturing
quality through measurement and control." The Center conducts research in: 1)
Dimensional Measurement Systems; 2) Dimensional Control for Formed Parts; and 3)
Dimensional Control of Machine Parts. The Center currently has nine industrial
members. In the past few years, the Center has established a strong research
program and has achieved tremendous success in terms of research, technology
transfer, industrial collaboration, and spin-off activities. Through the
Center's activities the university faculty, students, and industrial members,
have enjoyed a very close and mutual beneficial working relationship. This
proposal requests a one year renewal of the Center to capitalize on these
successes and help expand the impact onto other U.S. manufacturing industries.
