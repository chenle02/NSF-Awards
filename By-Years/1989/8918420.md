This research will study those factors that give rise to the distribution of
genetic variation within populations of tropical trees. A statistical technique,
genealogical reconstruction will utilize several genetic loci to identify the
parents of seeds and established seedlings. Once the parents of these
individuals have been identified, several questions concerning the development
and maintenance of fine-scale genetic structure can be answered. Dr. Hamrick
will be able to measure the distance pollen moves and to determine whether the
immigration of pollen plays a significant role in shaping the genetic
composition of these populations. He will also be able to measure seed dispersal
distances and to determine which adult individuals are effective in reproducing
the next generation. The importance of this research is its potential to provide
a better understanding of the mechanisms that play a role in the reproductive
biology of tropical tree species. This information could be used in the
effective design and maintenance of conservation areas. It could also be
important for attempts to regenerate tropical forests after their destruction.
Finally, this research will provide basic information concerning the ecology and
evolution of tropical tree communities.
