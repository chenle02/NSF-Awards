9361664 Swedlund The goal of this project is to develop a tissue culture system
for the neem tree, Azadirachta indica, to provide a source of pure secondary
metabolites. The best known product from this plant is the insecticide
azadirachtin. This compound is effective, even though it has a very low
toxicity. Production of azadirachtin in tissue culture would provide a constant
supply year round, while eliminating the large quantities of solvents that are
required when this compound is obtained by extraction from seed material. The
phase I research objectives include: (1) the determination of the effects of
various hormones on the initiation and maintenance of cultures, and the
production of azadirachtin by cells of the neem tree; (2) the use of the best
cultures in further experiments designed to increase the levels of azadirachtin;
and (3) to determine the location within neem seeds where azadirachtin is
produced in order to develop better cell types for tissue culture. ***
