This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of development of an affordable, flexible, and trackless
apparatus and process for full penetration welding of large steel structures.
The project will address two critical issues in arc welding; complete joint
penetration and joint line tracking. The project will develop an automated
welding system including a movable weld backing and trackless mechanism for
welding large steel structures. A prototype machine will be designed and
experimentally verified based on the requirements of arc welding production. The
successful development of the technology will improve significantly automatic
equipment for fabricating heavy weldments of large steel structures,
productivity and weld quality, and reduce welding cost.

The broader impacts (commercial applications) are expected in fabricating heavy
weldments within the shipbuilding, high-pressure vessel, pipelines, heavy crane,
power generation and aerospace.
