9320041 Venkatasubramanian The proposed research is in the area of dynamic
theory underlying the security analysis of large interconnected electric power
systems. Among the expected contributions of the proposed research are the
resolution of certain modeling issues which arise near singular surfaces, and a
practical procedures for finding homoclinic orbits. Another objective is the
development of a useful theory to deal with the common problem of changes in
system dimension as various devices reach hard limits, or in the case of
structural changes. ***
