Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging
Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based
observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique
capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic
and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at Barnard College to
carry out research with VERITAS. The group will participate in both technical
operations in support of the observatory and in scientific investigations with a
focus on studying emission from active galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, and
unidentified gamma-ray sources. The Barnard College group is heavily engaged in
education and outreach efforts. They involve undergraduate students in
astrophysics research with an emphasis on broadening the participation of women.
They are also involved in outreach efforts to high-school students in the New
York City area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS has embarked upon a broad program
of galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of
signatures for new physics such as dark matter. With this award the Barnard
College group will participate in VERITAS observing campaigns and carry out
scientific data analysis with a focus on the extragalactic physics of active
galaxies and cosmology. Their scientific program will also include the study of
galactic sources such as pulsar wind nebulae, investigating the nature of
unidentified gamma-ray sources, and using multi-messenger approaches to
investigate the origin of cosmic rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
