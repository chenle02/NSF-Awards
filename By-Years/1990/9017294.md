The Mississippian Stanley Shale exposed in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas
and Oklahoma exhibits surprising bulk chemical characteristics that are probably
related either to metamorphic processes or to hydrothermal alteration. The west
to east increase in metamorphic grade seen in the Ouachitas is paralleled by
bulk chemical changes including depletion in Mg, Ca, Na, K, and Ba, and relative
enrichment in Al and Li. The increased Al content is reflected in an increased
abundance of aluminous phases such as chloritoid and pyrophyllite. The changes
in bulk chemistry suggest that the Stanley may have exported material to
surrounding terrains. It is necessary to evaluate the processes that may have
led to the chemical and mineralogical changes recorded in the Ouachitas. To do
so involves a study of the differences in bulk chemistry, mineralogy, and fabric
that exist between diagenetic Stanley in the western Ouachitas and greenschist
facies Stanley in the eastern Ouachitas. In particular, this research will
document changes in fabric, bulk chemistry and isotopic tracers that may be
useful in estimating volume loss and evaluating the extent to which the Stanley
was an open system during diagenesis/metamorphism.
