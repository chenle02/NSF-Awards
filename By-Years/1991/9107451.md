Oomycetes are fungal-like organisms that are important in aquatic and moist
habitats where they decay organic matter and parasitize algae, fungi, plants,
insects, and crustacea. Despite their importance, many characters currently used
to show phylogenetic relationship and to classify these organisms are not stable
under different environmental conditions. This project will use ultrastructural
features to develop a new base of stable characters and then to use that data
base to develop a new model of phylogeny, both of and within the taxon, and to
revise their classification. The character base will focus on motile, asexual
spores. Once completed the PI will turn to an analysis of the genus Aphanomyces.
The phylogenetic analysis of the larger group and the genus will use parsimony
analysis based on polarization of transformation series using out-groups.
