A comprehensive mesoscale four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) and
predictability study is proposed using the National Meteorological Center ETA
model. The PIs intend to continue FDDA studies using the ETA model, assessing
the performance of the assimilation system and examining the problem of
mesoscale predictability. In addition, the investigation will be extended to the
problem of profiler data assimilation in mesoscale models, including an
assessment of the usefulness of the profiler network in short range weather
prediction. Finally, as an outgrowth of this study, the role of large-scale
forcing, model resolution, and model physics in the evolution of finer-scale
features in a mesoscale model will be investigated.
