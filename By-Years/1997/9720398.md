This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
Initiative, and will focus on the key role played by time in the organization
and understanding of spoken language. Statistical properties of spoken language
will be computed and analyzed. The resultant data will be used to develop a
computational model of speech processing based on syllable units and principles
of temporal binding. The data and modeling will guide the design of
physiological experiments probing the neurological basis of spoken language
understanding. These experiments will focus on the integration of phonetic and
syllabic information into sequences of higher level linguistic units, and will
involve recordings of single-unit and population responses in the auditory
cortex of the brain. Perceptual experiments will also be conducted to delineate
changes in the representations of linguistic information during learning of
spoken language material. The statistical, perceptual, and physiological data
derived from this project will provide the foundation for a computational model
of how listeners proceed from `sound` (the acoustics of speech) to `meaning`
(the interpretation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic information). The model
promises to have important consequences for theories of learning and language,
and will influence various scientific domains pertaining to human communication,
including automatic speech recognition, communication disorders, linguistics,
developmental psycholinguistics, computational neuroscience and cognitive
psychology.
