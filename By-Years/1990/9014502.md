Heteroarm star polymers containing x arms of monomer A and n-x arms of monomer B
should exhibit unusual segregation and interphase phenomena. Living linking
reactions will be used to synthesize A2B2 star polymers composed of polystyrene
and polydiene arms, and a new general fluorescent-labeling chemistry will be
utilized to attach pyrene, anthracene, and naphthalene groups at the termini of
the arms. A series of heteroarm star copolymers with well-defined structures
will be used to explore their unique dynamic and equilibrium properties in the
solid state, in the melt, and in solution. The consequences of interarm
interactions in isolated heteroarm stars will be assessed from the rates and
equilibrium for macrocyclization, as deduced from excimer emission by molecules
in which two arms bear pyrene or naphthalene groups at their free ends.
Discrimination between the various types of interarm interactions that can occur
in semidilute solution, melts, and in the solid state will be determined with
heteroarm stars selectively labeled for the study of excimer emission or the
rate of Forster transfer. The dynamics of isolated heteroarm stars, and their
diffusion in concentrated solutions and melts, will be determined using pulsed-
gradient spin-echo NMR.
