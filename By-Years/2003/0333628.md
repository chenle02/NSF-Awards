This Targeted Research project is investigating the issues involved when
integrating an existing NSDL repository (the iLumina digital collection) with a
traditional research library (the Randall Library at UNC-Wilmington). Such an
integration offers a model for sustaining the many digital collections that
reside at institutions of higher education. As part of this effort the project
is automating the conversion of IMS metadata to MARC data records via an
implementation of Innovative Interface Corporation's XML Harvester software to
transform IMS metadata compiled in iLumina directly into MARC data records used
in the Randall Library catalog. As iLumina resources are listed within the
Randall Library catalog, they become shareable with the OCLC WorldCat database,
a national resource that serves over 43,000 libraries around the world. This
substantially increases the accessibility of the digital resources housed in
iLumina.
