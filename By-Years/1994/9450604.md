9450604 Whitesell We have devised a sequence of instruction that addresses many
of the concerns that have been raised about the quality of lower-division
education in chemistry. At this point, it represents a working plan that will be
extensively modified in the next year as we gather background information and
advice from institutions both within and outside the core group of four. The
core of the first two years is a two-semester sequence that covers the essences
of organic, bioorganic, and bio-inorganic chemistry. This core is preceded and
followed by a group of one-semester courses that, on the one hand, introduce the
basic elements of chemistry and, on the other, deal in greater detail with
specific areas that bridge the class divisions. This new program of instruction
will require a body of teaching materials that, at best, must be brought
together from many different sources. Other essential teaching aids must be
developed from scratch. In the next nine months we intend to explore available
resources and to begin the development of these new materials. We are especially
keen on developing integrated packages of audio-visual aides to be used in
lectures as well as hands on, interactive packages of audio-visual aides to be
used for student self-study. Further, we anticipate that faculty from other
departments and colleges within the universities involved (University of Texas
at Austin, Trinity University, St. Edwards University, and Austin Community
College) will be able to contribute substantially to the development of the
curriculum and also be directly involved in instruction. We will also interface
with institutions outside the primary group of four, seeking their involvement
in this planning stage as well as possible participation.
