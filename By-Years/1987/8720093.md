Spiders are uniquely characterized by their ability to produce silk nets that
trap prey. The architectures of these traps are highly variable as are the
physical properties of the silks from which they are spun. In this research the
importance of web design and the reflective properties of web silks to the
ability of insects to see and avoid them will be investigated. Factors that
affect web visibility are related to the optical properties of web silks and the
optical properties of websites. Although nothing is known about how insects
perceive spider webs, in general insects make use of three different visual cues
to evaluate their environment: contrast between objects and object background,
object color and object movement. Craig will study how contrast between webs and
web backgrounds and web color affect the ability of insects to see and avoid
spider webs. By taking a comparative and phylogenetic approach, the field and
laboratory studies will explore many of the aspects of spider foraging modes
that affect their ability to capture prey. The finding that result from this
research will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey
interactions, in general, as well as the effect of insect visual perception on
the foraging modes of insect predators. First, this work will result in an
analysis of how different components of a prey capture process constrain
variations in foraging modes and hence the evolution of a predator foraging
strategy. Second, by using a combination of field and laboratory approaches,
these studies will help to identify the factors affecting insect visual
discrimination in the field. Third, this research will contribute to an
understanding of the ecological relationships between spiders and insects.
