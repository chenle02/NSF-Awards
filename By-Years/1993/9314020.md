9314020 Badding This work is concerned with the chemistry of covalently bonded
hard/superhard materials that are synthesized at high pressure (1 gigapascals to
greater than 70 gigapascals), but can be quenched to ambient conditions. These
experiments will be performed using diamond-anvil cell techniques together with
recently developed methods for the synthesis and characterization of solids at
high pressures. Syntheses at extreme pressures and/or temperatures will be
combined with detailed in situ observations of the formation and properties of
hard materials. The topics to be addressed are the synthesis of diamond and
diamond-like materials from novel polycarbyne network-backbone polymers and the
synthesis of new hard materials in the carbon-nitrogen and boron-oxygen systems.
The goals will be to look for new hard materials, potentially with properties
superior or complementary to existing ones and to gain new information about the
relationship between crystal structure, chemical composition, and hardness that
will help in the design of new hard materials. ***
