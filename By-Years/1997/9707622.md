9707622 Fitzpatrick This proposal will support the continuation of a long-term
study of the ecology, demography, and conservation biology of the Florida Scrub
Jay, a species listed as federally threatened. The study of a color-marked
population at Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida has proceeded
uninterrupted since 1969. The study has produced a important discoveries in
animal behavior, sociobiology, demography, life history theory, evolution, and
ecology, and has spawned widespread attention to the conservation biology of an
ancient ecosystem unique to Florida. In addition to labor-intensive demographic
monitoring of about 60 Florida Scrub Jay territories, current field work
emphasizes 1) distribution of arthropod, vertebrate, and plant food resources
through space and time, 2) long-term effects of natural fire cycles and post-
fire succession on jay demography, resource availability, and oak reproductive
effort; 3) the role of episodic disease in population regulation; and 4) source-
sink dynamics in natural as compared with human-modified habitats. Recent
completion of a major program of GIS data-preparation, and a series of large-
scale field experiments employing prescribed burning, have opened new
opportunities to understand the long-term effects of environmental variation and
natural perturbation within the Florida scrub ecosystem. Overall, this project
uill continue the extensive regime of question-driven ecological monitoring
which represents the foundation of this long-term study.
