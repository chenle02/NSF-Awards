This is a geophysical pilot study of the Vestmannaeyjar volcanic system south of
Iceland. It is uncertain whether the Vestmannaeyjar system, which includes the
newly formed island of Surtsey and the recently eruptive island of Heimaey, is
part of the American/European plate boundary. If so, it may result from active
rifting associated with southward ridge propagation of the Eastern Volcanic Zone
past the South Iceland Seismic Zone. This is a pilot project to collect seismic
reflection data.&lt;br/&gt;
