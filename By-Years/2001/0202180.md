Life is the most complex physical phenomenon in the universe, manifesting an
extraordinary diversity of form and function over an enormous scale ranging from
the largest animals and plants to the smallest microbes and sub-cellular units.
Yet, many of its most fundamental and complex phenomena scale with size in a
surprisingly simple fashion. For example, metabolic rate (the power needed to
sustain life) scales as the 3/4-power of mass over 27 orders of magnitude
ranging from molecular and intra-cellular levels up through the smallest
unicellular bacteria to the largest multicellular organisms. Similarly, time-
scales (such as lifespan and growth-rate) and sizes (such as genome length and
density of mitochondria) scale with exponents that are typically simple powers
of 1/4. The universality and simplicity of these scaling relationships suggest
that fundamental universal principles underlay much of the generic structure,
function and organization of many biological phenomena.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of this project is that regardless of size,
almost all life is sustained, and ultimately constrained, by space-filling,
fractal-like hierarchical branching networks (both real and virtual), which are
optimized by the forces of natural selection. Previous work has shown how these
principles explain universal quarter-power scaling and how they lead to a
quantitative understanding of many diverse biological systems. This project will
continue to explore and elaborate on these universal principles by applying them
to other fundamental problems in biology while extending the paradigm into other
areas of science where their analogs might be applicable, such as corporate
structures and urban development. The biological problems will include aging and
mortality, minimum and maximum sizes of mammals, size and energy distributions
in ecosystems, quantifying evolution including thermodynamic considerations, and
understanding the scaling of genome size and its relationship to the complexity
of the organism.&lt;br/&gt;
