East-west oriented jets are observed in the high latitudes of the troposphere,
the oceans and other planetary atmospheres. Explanations of "eddy-forced" zonal
jets usually require some external influence, such as geometrical boundaries or
localized forcing, to account for their spatial persistence. Preliminary
calculations indicate that, when motions are quasi-geostrophic, energy arising
from the instability of an imposed, spatially uniform, north-south temperature
gradient can be organized into jets of a persistence not directly linked to
feature of the forcing. The scale of the jet is self-determined, so that once a
region is sufficiently wide to support one jet, further widening of the region
increases the number of jets. The goal of this research project is to examine
the source of this persistence and its scale using (relatively) simple two-
layer models embodying various numbers of wave-wave interactions. Special
attention will be paid to how maintenance and persistence are affected during
the transition from a regime that supports a single jet to one supporting two.
The influence of linear wave dynamics in determining the scale of the jets will
be examined using different indices of wave activity. An examination of the
transition regime may also indicate which low frequency processes play a
prominent role in the Northern Hemisphere where a second jet does not emerge.
