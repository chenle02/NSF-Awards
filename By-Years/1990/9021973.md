The research aims to study seismic cone penetration tests in granular soil by
conducting tests in a calibration chamber. Shear wave velocities will be
measured in the horizontal and vertical planes. The microscopic soil fabric will
be measured using the section-microscope method and resonant column tests. In
the numerical studies, a particulate calibration chamber will be simulated using
a coupled discrete element /boundary element scheme.
