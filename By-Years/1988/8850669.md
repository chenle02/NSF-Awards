This model project is designed to increase the participation of women and
minorities in mathematics careers by providing special instructional and
outreach activities for students in grades six and seven to encourage their
enrollment in high school elective mathematics courses. It is a two-year
collaborative effort of Louisiana Tech University and Grambling State University
serving the northern half of the State, and Louisiana State University and
Dillard University serving the south-central metropolitan region. The project
identifies women and minorities with potential in mathematics, provides
enrichment programs to stimulate their interest in mathematics, and provides
skills and methodology enhancement for middle school mathematics teachers. The
activities in the project include 5-session mathematics inservice workshops for
skill development of middle school teachers based on the concepts and strategies
recommended by the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics
Report of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The five sessions
address topics identified as critical for readiness in algebra and geometry and
explore the impact of mental set (verbal and nonverbal signals that encourage
and discourage development in math). The sessions are conducted by a Louisiana
NSF Presidential Award winning teacher of high school geometry (Mrs. Lynn
Stallings-Roberts, 1987). A series of five Saturday morning enrichment programs
are conducted for students identified as having talent in mathematics. The
opening session is designed for students, their parents, and participating
teachers in which an overview of activities is presented. Succeeding session
include telelearning sessions taught by award-winning teachers, programs to
stimulate interest and excitement in mathematics, field trips, individual
student projects, and a culminating end-of-the-year picnic. A special seminar to
promote parental support is also held for parents.
