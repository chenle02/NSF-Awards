9412104 Naganathan This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toledo to purchase a
UNIX based computing and graphics platform. The requested computing equipment
will support ongoing NSF supported research on piezoceramic materials as
actuators. The equipment will be housed in the Smart Materials and Systems
Laboratory and will also be used by other faculty and students in the College of
Engineering for several other research projects. This equipment will
significantly contribute to furthering the objectives of these research
projects. ***
