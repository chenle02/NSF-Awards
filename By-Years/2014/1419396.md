This is a pilot project to extend and broaden utilization of existing
educational resources created with support from the NSF to each of two PIs in
separate large grants 5 years ago. The extension is through a type of course
that has become ubiquitous across American colleges and universities: the
"freshman seminar." The information content of the existing educational
resources meets the criterion of being important and interesting to a broad
spectrum of our society. The materials that underpin this pilot are broad,
varied, and adaptable to local circumstance as well as extensible as new
knowledge emerges. A positive characteristic of the project is that the base
resources (book, video, social media outlets, web sites) exist, the delivery
vehicles (freshman seminar courses) exist, a publicly visible scientist is
available and interested in participating, and that scientist's MOOC on climate
science will continue to be offered and could become part of local courses. This
pilot project will test the response of faculty who teach environmental science
courses to the opportunity of selecting freely from a rich set of materials that
can be used as course building blocks. It will also examine the impact that
their use has on enrolled students.
