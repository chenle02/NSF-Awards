(Public Law 111-5).

The authors propose to develop, test, and deploy enhanced HUBzero-powered
science gateway technology that will host TeraGrid-approved codes and workflows
with results-archiving and reuse that is connected to a portion of TeraGrid
configured for queue-less, instant-on, interactive parallel computing. This
project demands the creation of production-quality middleware to connect a
HUBzero- powered science gateway to TeraGrid resources that will operate
reliably under actual loads.
