The goal of this project is to develop effective numerical methods for solving
complex nonlinear optimization problems. The algorithms to be developed and
analyzed follow two distinct but related approaches: - Sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) methods; and - Barrier methods (i.e. interior methods). This
research will concentrate on large-scale problems, direct treatment of sparse
linear and nonlinear constraints, and the guarantee of superlinear convergence.
The research on SQP methods will extend techniques based on linearly constrained
subproblems and an augmented Lagrangian merit function. Topics to be considered
include use of a reduced Hessian, use of exact second derivatives, strategies
for accepting inexact solutions of subproblems, and techniques for treating
infeasible subproblems. Work in barrier methods have already proved remarkably
successful for linear programs. Much research remains to improve their
reliability and to extend their application to large-scale nonlinear (and
convex) problems. Research in barrier methods emphasizes matrix factorization
rather than matrix updating, and can utilize the substantial body of research on
factorization methods for machines with parallel and vector architectures. We
propose both direct and iterative methods for solving the indefinite systems
involved.
