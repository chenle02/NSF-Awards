The independent evolution of similar forms has interested researchers ever since
Darwin. Three pathways--adaptation, exaptation ("preadaptation"), and genetic
drift (random factors)--could potentially result in such convergence. The
research proposed here aims to tease apart these factors in a well-studied
group, the Anolis lizards, using a new estimate of evolutionary history based on
DNA sequences and anatomy. At least 17 independent instances of solitary
existence in species Anolis afford an extraordinary arena for studies of
evolutionary convergence. The PI and his students will study the evolution of
convergence in 'solitary species' living on islands. They will test for
nonrandom patterns in traits and use established and new comparative methods to
distinguish adaptive from exaptive explanations for shared similarities in these
species. The researchers will also compare ancient evolutionary colonizations to
recent invasions, and describe new species discovered during planned fieldwork.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will clarify the evolutionary processes that
produce similar traits during evolution. It will also result in the publication
of identification keys and descriptions of several new species, thereby
facilitating conservation efforts in the regions where Anolis are found (many of
which are established biodiversity 'hotspots'). The research will train
graduate, undergraduate, and international students in taxonomic and
evolutionary studies.
