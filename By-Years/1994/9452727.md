9452727 Daley The Memphis State University seeks to initiate a four-week,
commuter EAI, Young Scholars program in engineering science for a group of
highly promising African American student entering grade 9. The program will
provide 20 participants with research and career exploration experiences through
classroom and laboratory activities, field trips, and interaction with various
professionals in the science and engineering fields. A major goal of the program
is to stimulate career interest in engineering science through the use of
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and aspects of physics to examine specific
laboratory and field problems.
