This scholars program at the Ohio State University offers talented students the
opportunity to live and study in a community as they participate in career-
themed activities and take advantage of carefully-architected support
structures. Scholars have specialized advising, attend first year classes
together as a cohort and have a host of thematically related activities
available that contribute to their success as students and in securing
employment. These scholars are selected because of their desire to utilize
engineering talent for the betterment of marginalized peoples and underserved
communities. Using engineering to obtain direct positive effects on humanity is
often called "humanitarian engineering" and this humanitarian engineering
program is enrolling 144 scholars. The program has two primary goals: 1)
Positively impact retention and graduation rate of engineering students with
financial need and 2) Improve academic performance relative to a control group.
The program is sustainable in that it will not create new programs, curricula or
degree requirements; its financial support will facilitate degree completion and
career placement for a group of students who have financial need and are
academically talented. The project has three secondary goals 3) Incorporate
humanitarian engineering ideas more broadly across campus, 4) Increase
diversity, and 5) Develop well-rounded engineers and problem-solvers who are
able to think globally.
