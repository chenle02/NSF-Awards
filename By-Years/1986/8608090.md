Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) are a group of primitive fishes which
synthesize and retain in their tissues high levels of urea for the purpose of
counteracting the high salt concentration of seawater. Our studies have shown
that the pathway for urea synthesis in sharks is uniquely different from the
urea cycle in mammalian species, which excrete nitrogen waste products as urea.
Other significant differences in related metabolic pathways have also been
discovered. The purpose of this study is to 1) characterize these unique
properties and relate the results to the adaptive metabolic strategies of
elasmobranchs and osmoregulation and 2) relate these unique metabolic properties
of the sharks. The results will contribute to understanding of metabolic
adaptation and evolution, and of the significance of the different pathway for
urea synthesis relative to regulation of osmolarity in a seawater environment.
