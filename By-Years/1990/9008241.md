Paul Rowe, an amateur archaeologist, made surface collections and excavated
archaeological materials from over 200 sites in southwestern Iowa. Because of
the care with which he worked and the extensive documentation associated with
these materials, they are widely used and provide an important data base. The
collection includes lithics, ceramics, and both worked and unworked faunal
remains. The materials are currently held by several institutions. With National
Science Foundation support, Dr. William Green and his colleagues will continue
their work to make these materials of maximum research use. In this next phase
of their project, the team will correlate objects with the relevant
documentation and ascertain the specific sites from which each collection
derives. Detailed data will be entered into the Office of the State
Archaeologist's files, and the objects themselves will be sorted by site and by
material class within each site, labeled by catalog number, and boxed in
standard-size storage containers. They will be added to the State Artifact
Repository. One portion of the collection is held by the Mills County Historical
Museum, and it will be surveyed to determine physical condition and the nature
of its documentation. Recommendations for treatment will be developed. The Rowe
collection is important because it can provide insight into prehistoric cultural
development in the Midwest United States. Because of storage and documentation
problems, the collection cannot now be used efficiently. The work by Dr. Green
and colleagues will serve to remedy this situation.
