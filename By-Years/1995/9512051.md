This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at University of Dayton acquire an upgrade of an
existing 270 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The research activity to be supported
includes: the study and development of transformations of aromatic compounds via
electronically "benign by desien" electrochemical methodologies, and DNA
reactive drugs in cancer chemotherapy. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
