The Frontier Probability Days (FPD) conference will be held at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, in Las Vegas, Nevada, from May 8 to 10, 2020. FPD, held
approximately once every other year, is a conference that has rapidly
established itself as the premier regional meeting in probability and its
applications in the Intermountain West of the United States.

The 2020 conference will be its seventh meeting. The conference schedule will be
similar to that in recent meetings: There will be 7 one-hour plenary lectures,
as well as 15-20 twenty-minute lectures. At least two of the plenary
presentations will be dedicated to deep applications of probability theory in
other important and exciting, as well as possibly-emerging, scientific
disciplines. The conference is expected to host 70-80 participants in FDP 2020.
Seven distinguished mathematicians, at the forefront of several different areas
with probability and its applications, have accepted invitations to give plenary
one-hour talks. The 20-minutes lectures are made to encourage early career
researchers, women, and minority-group representatives to speak and showcase
their work. The conference website is maintained at:
