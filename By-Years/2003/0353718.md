This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides support for up to three-years for an REU Site at Washington University.
Nine students will be recruited for a ten-week summer experience in research
related to civil infrastructure. Students will have an opportunity to engage in
state-of-the-art research projects in infrastructure innovations, durability,
assessment, and management. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor.
The student will become a part of the faculty member's research group. It is
anticipated that this type of collaborative research opportunity will
effectively expose students to the exciting world of research and thus encourage
students to pursue graduate study. It is anticipated that this program will have
a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and
permanent residents engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities,
government agencies, and in private-sector organizations.
