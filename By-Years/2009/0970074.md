This award supports the research activities of the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee LIGO Scientific Collaboration (UWMLSC) group. The central theme of the
project is the extraction of astrophysical information from gravitational-wave
observations. Building on broad expertise, the group will engage in specific
activities spanning all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy. The award will
foster synergy by focusing expertise in gravitational physics, astrophysics, and
grid-computing on gravitational-wave data analysis challenges that are on the
critical path to the scientific success of
LIGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves are a fundamental prediction of
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Yet almost 100 years after the theory
was put forward these waves have eluded direct detection. Having recently
constructed exquisitely sensitive detectors, such as LIGO, scientists from the
United States and around the world are poised to make the first detection. With
these instruments now operational, the challenge is to dig deep into their data
to find the imprint of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, such as
black holes, neutron stars, and signals from the beginning of the universe. The
first detection will usher in a new era of scientific discovery: the era of
gravitational-wave astronomy. This work will make a significant contribution to
many critical-path components of the LIGO data analysis effort, which will
enable the first detection of gravitational waves and the wealth of
astrophysical information thereby garnered. This award also supports research
into the nature of highly energetic astrophysical sources of gravitational
radiation which will provide valuable insight into the nature of Einstein's
theory of gravity. Graduate students receive valuable training in the emerging
field of gravitational wave science.
