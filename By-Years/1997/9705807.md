9705807 Sherman It has been hypothesized that male steroid hormones,
particularly testosterone (T), suppress immune system functions. Males with high
T levels are said to be less capable of mounting an immune response that males
with lower T levels. If so, males with high T levels should be more susceptible
to infections and parasitic infestations. To investigate this hypothesis, the PI
will use as a vertebrate model, the red-winged blackbird. Birds (24) will be
captured locally and maintained in captivity for 10 months. Each will be
injected with a non-pathogenic antigen (KLH) in the (I) autumn (natural T levels
low), (ii) early spring (rising T levels), (III) mid-spring (peak T levels,
during breeding), and (iv) late-spring (T levels boosted higher with an
implant). At each sampling period, immunocompetence will be measured with an
ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) that was developed for quantifying
humeral immune responses (antibody production) in this species; T levels will be
quantified with a radioimmunoassay. This research will yield precise information
on how naturally-produced and enchanced levels of steroid hormones affect immune
functions in a wild vertebrate. It will also help us to understand why only some
males express exaggerated T-dependent secondary sexual characters (e.g., plumes,
crests). Perhaps only extremely high-quality males can produce such characters
and also maintain levels of immunocompetence necessary for survival. Females
that choose these males as mates benefit their sons and daughters genetically.
This exploratory project thus merges three fields of research (immunology,
endocrinology, and behavioral ecology) and promises to open up a new area of
investigation into how interactions between the hormone and immune systems
affect sexual selection.
