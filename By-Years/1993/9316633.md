9316633 Ledley This project is the application of an existing generalized sea
ice model to the particular regional setting of the Ross Sea. A smaller-scale
version of the same model will be nested within the regional model to represent
McMurdo Sound. The simulated sea ice fields will be validated through a
comparison with available observations, and used to assess the impact of sea ice
on ocean-atmosphere energy exchange processes. After the model is adapted for
the Ross Sea setting, and the simulated seasonal sea ice variations have been
validated, a series of sensitivity studies will be carried out. These will be
designed to examine the response of the sea ice to changes that may occur in the
regional climate system on both short and long time scales. Finally, the model
will be extended by nesting a finer grid submodel in the Ross Sea model in order
to examine the effects of katabatic winds and synoptic weather variations on the
sea ice distribution. ***
