Many sensory organs receive information back from the brain by a nerve supply
called efferent innervation, which can modulate the sensory signals carried to
the brain by the incoming, or afferent, innervation. The statocyst organs of
cephalopod invertebrates (cuttlefish, squid, octopus) are sensors used for
control of balance and posture, and have many features remarkably similar to the
vestibular parts of the vertebrate inner ear, also used for balance. These
statocyst organs receive extensive efferent innervation, and one of the
compounds found here is nitric oxide (NO), which is currently of great interest
in mammalian nervous systems as a potential neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.
This project uses a multidisciplinary approach of physiology, pharmacology, and
anatomy to localize and characterize the activity of the enzyme nitric oxide
synthase (NOS), its product, NO, and interactions of NO with second messenger
systems such as cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP. Results from this model invertebrate
system will be important beyond clarifying cephalopod statocyst function,
because they will provide a better understanding of evolutionary convergence of
equilibrium sense organs, and understanding of mechanisms of action of NO, with
broad implications for neuroscience in general.
