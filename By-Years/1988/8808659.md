An insect society, such as an ant colony, represents a critical test case for
general theories of evolution, as Darwin himself recognized. Ant workers are
sterile, and in general their sole means of reproduction resides with their
mother queen. A fairly common yet unstudied characteristic of ants is that a
colony can split up into several discrete nesting units, a process called
polydomy. When this happens, workers in colony subunits without the queen are
released from her influence, and can proceed to behave in ways to maximize their
own fitness. Thus studying polydomy, the process of colony fractionation, is
important to a full understanding of social evolution. Polydomy is best studied
by applying hierarchical selection models. In these formulations, evolution
proceeds on several levels: the entire colony; different nesting units that
comprise the colony; and individual workers and queens within those nesting
units represent levels in the selection hierarchy. Dr. Herbers will study the
process of colony fractionation among primitive ant species in Australia, where
polydomy is just now beginning to evolve. A combination of field studies,
laboratory aggression assays between members of different nests, and biochemical
analysis will allow her to determine when and how often colonies split up.
Furthermore, measuring the fitness of all individuals within nests will provide
insight into the nature of selection at each level in the hierarchy. This is a
proposal for a Career Advancement Award under the aegis of the Research
Opportunities for Women. It is likely to result in a significant enhancement of
the scientific field as well as Dr. Herbers' own career.
