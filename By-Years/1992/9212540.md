Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will utilize an
approximation in which the space-time continuum is replaced by a discrete
lattice of points. The primary purpose of the work will be to gain a
quantitative understanding of why quarks cannot exist as free particles. No free
quarks have ever been seen, so it is important to understand how the strong
nuclear force results in their complete confinement within the particles which
have been seen, such as the nucleons.
