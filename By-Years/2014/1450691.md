This award will emable the participation of students and early-career
professionals in the conference, Shaping the Developing Brain: Prenatal through
Early Childhood, to be held November 11 - 13, 2014 at the New York Academy of
Sciences in New York City. This multidisciplinary conference will convene
leading researchers with expertise in the fundamental stages of early brain
development, and will include exploration of the connection between research and
improved outcomes for children. Conference sessions will present the latest
discoveries regarding the development of human learning and memory, emotion, and
social behavior in the first few years of life and explore socioeconomic,
family, and nutritional factors that can influence both brain and behavior.
Discussion topics will include implications for educational practices, health
and nutrition practices, applied research, and government policy with the
potential for enhancing healthy brain development and assisting children with,
or at risk for, developmental delays and disorders.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a competitive application process, travel and
registration fellowships, underrepresented minority fellowships, and child care
grants will be awarded to 23 students, postdoctoral fellows, junior
investigators, and recent graduates in science, medicine, psychology, education,
and public health. Fellowships and grants will be awarded to applicants based on
a written description of need, the relevance of their work to the conference
topics, and letters of recommendation. Applicants who received high marks on
their research abstracts to present during the conference poster sessions will
be given priority. Participation in the conference will provide opportunities
for outstanding individuals in the initial stages of their careers to interact
with and gain insight from senior researchers, promoting future collaborations
addressing the cognitive and behavioral development of the nation's most
vulnerable children.
