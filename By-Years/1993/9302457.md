Dr. Deborah S. Wuttke has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship In
Chemistry. Dr. Wuttke's doctoral degree was from the California Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Wuttke will
continue research at the Scripps Research Institute under the sponsorship of
Professor Peter Wright. Dr. Wuttke's postdoctoral training will focus on nuclear
magnetic resonance studies of complex biological systems. Longer term, she plans
to study molecular recognition of oligonucleotides by proteins and
protein/protein and protein/peptide interactions involved in antibody/antigen
recognition. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
