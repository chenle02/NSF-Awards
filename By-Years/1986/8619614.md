This SBIR Phase II award is for the integration of optical CAM system
parameters directly into an optical CAD system. The importance of the
integration concept will be demonstrated by the design and manufacture of a
sample optical system. With CAM systems emerging, it is important to be able to
represent directly in the optical design program the families of surfaces which
can be manufactured using CAM technology. This allows the optical design
engineer the freedom to use aspheric surfaces with the confidence that the
resulting design can be manufactured. Mathematical models will be included
directly into a commercial optical design program which will then be used to
study tolerance of some typical optical systems directly in terms of CAM process
parameters. The implications of successful completion of this research are far-
reaching in simplification of optical system designs, increased reliability, and
reduced optical production costs.
