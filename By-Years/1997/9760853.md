*** 9760853 Fleming This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes to apply the infinite velocity method for quantification of elements to
time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and to evaluate the
concept for semiconductor testing. A key requirement to improve semiconductor
performance and efficiency will be better analysis procedures for quantification
of elements in smaller features and thinner layers. The infinite velocity method
stems from the observation that secondary ion yields per unit of sample
concentration tend to a single value for all elements at infinite velocity (high
ion energy) if the ion yields are first corrected for sputter yield and
instrument transmission. In Phase 1, the efficacy of this concept will be
demonstrated. Quantitative elemental analysis of thin films and small features
in semiconductors are marketed as commercial analytical services and instrument
upgrades. Estimated revenues for this small firm are $2,000,000 per year, or
larger if quantification can be performed at the expected detection limits. ***
