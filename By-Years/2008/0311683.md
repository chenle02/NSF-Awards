Recently introduced and forthcoming multithreading processor architectures
&lt;br/&gt;represent new challenges and opportunities for the compilation
system.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will focus on three areas, exploiting features
of a &lt;br/&gt;simultaneous multithreading (SMT)
processor:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Generating Task Threads and Helper Threads -
Task-based parallelism &lt;br/&gt;provides heterogeneous parallelism that is
particularly effective for an &lt;br/&gt;SMT processor. Helper threads assist
and accelerate the execution of other &lt;br/&gt;threads, without necessarily
offloading any computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Simultaneous Compilation -
Using spare contexts to do dynamic &lt;br/&gt;compilation, optimization, and
profiling provides the opportunity to &lt;br/&gt;perform these functions
concurrent with the running program, and &lt;br/&gt;continuously, without
interrupting other threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Program Placement for SMT -
Efficiently using the memory hierarchy is &lt;br/&gt;more difficult on an SMT
processor because programs interact in &lt;br/&gt;non-deterministic ways. Novel
code, data, and page placement compiler &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will reduce cache
misses for multithreaded workloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will
involve grad and undergrad students, including students &lt;br/&gt;from
underrepresented groups, training them in research methodology and
&lt;br/&gt;practice, and developing particular research expertise. This research
will &lt;br/&gt;create a compiler and simulation infrastructure that will be
made available &lt;br/&gt;widely to other academic institutions. This should
most benefit &lt;br/&gt;institutions that lack resources to develop such an
infrastructure themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
