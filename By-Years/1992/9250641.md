The objective of this project is to implement a data acquisition laboratory to
be used by electrical engineering majors for experiments in signal analysis,
digital filtering and digital control. The laboratory will exploit new personal
computer technology in which microcomputer and signal processing elements are
integrated with software in a single commercial workstation. This equipment
provides an integrated, self-networking system which contains the necessary
software and hardware to provide a sophisticated, user-friendly environment for
digital signal processing, system analysis,and design. Eight NeXT computer
workstations will be set up in a room specifically dedicated to the proposed
laboratory. In addition to the computer equipment, each workstation will include
a signal generator, digital voltmeter, and tape recorder. This equipment will
enable students to generate analog signals, acquire them through a data port,
process them digitally, and observe the processed signal in the time or
frequency domain. The Mathematica mathematics programming language will be used
for computational and modeling studies associated with the teaching of control
systems.
