Edward Kohler &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, Los
Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Title: High-level and Efficient Sensor-Network Programs
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for embedded
networked sensors must run well on resource-poor, unmaintained, environmentally
exposed, and unreliable hardware. These hardware constraints rule out many
traditional approaches for improving programmability, since they impose high
runtime cost. As a result, system specialists must be involved in every stage of
application development and deployment, and scientists cannot construct sensor
applications on their own. This limits how well sensor networks can solve real
scientific problems, since deployment is gated on the involvement of a few
systems experts. This research program uses programming language technology to
make efficient sensor network applications easy to deploy and tune. A set of new
sensor components and a higher-level programming language for component
configurations combine to form smart, efficient libraries of application-level
services. Using these services, scientists can define an optimized application
in just two or three lines of code, enabling quicker application deployment and
tuning for different field conditions and, thus, more responsive science. The
project will produce a new TinyOS component library, a sensor network
programming language (SNACK) and compiler, a set of SNACK services designed for
different application types, and several sample applications, including some
designed for classroom use. All of the code will be freely and widely
distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
