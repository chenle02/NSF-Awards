This investigation allows the researchers to undertake the fourth phase of the
Foreign Policy Leadership Project. The investigators utilize a mail survey sent
to 2,200 social, political, and economic leaders in the United States for the
purpose of exploring the underlying dimensions and interconnections of policy
beliefs, with particular focus on foreign policy. Building on studies undertaken
in 1976, 1980, and 1984, the research monitors trends in, and the stability of,
elite attitudes. The 1988 study expands the prior investigations by assessing
the linkages between domestic and foreign policy. The data set from this project
is made available to scholars for additional analyses and represents the most
in.depth assessment of the structure of foreign policy attitudes.
