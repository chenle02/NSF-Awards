This is a renewal grant for continuation of studies of equations of state and
kinetics of phase transitions of mantle minerals and their analogs at high
temperatures and pressures. Measurements will be carried out in the diamond
anvil cell using both the synchrotron radiation source at Stanford and the high-
intensity rotating anode source at the University of Hawaii. These measurements
will be used to interpret the composition, thermal state, and dynamic processes
of the Earth's deep interior.
