A mechanism of endogenous growth suitable for investigation of sectoral or
regional interaction is developed. The effects on steady state growth of
consumption and production linkages between sectors are assessed, and it is
shown how the high value placed on production linkages by economic historians
might be reconciled with the high value placed on openness (often implying lack
of linkages) by observers of contemporary less developed countries. It is also
shown how sectors or regions interact out of steady state through both product
and labor markets, and in particular how if the former interaction dominates one
sector can be an "engine of growth" pulling along the other, while if the latter
interaction dominates one sector or region booms while the other declines. By
building on these results it is shown why liberalization of foreign trade should
lead to a transition from a lower to a higher steady state growth rate and why,
during the course of this transition, growth might initially be even slower than
before liberalization. On this basis a reinterpretation of the post-1973
economic performance of Chile is offered. An application to economic integration
of previously separate regions or countries shows that the largest growth
effects are to be had if one region is allowed to decline and provide a source
of cheap labor for the other region. This study would make an important
contribution to our understanding of sectoral or regional interaction in
response to economic integration during the growth process.
