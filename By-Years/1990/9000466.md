The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a research vessel operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Spectrophotometer and
Nephelometer for in situ measurements of optical characteristics in the water
column, -Plankton nets for general shared use, -Vibration isolation work station
to dampen out ship vibrations while doing microscopy work, and -general
electronics test and maintenance equipment for shipboard systems. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the organization
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
