Part 1: The activities of the proposed workshop will consider the intersections
of the natural, built, and social-cultural environments in the changing Arctic.
The ways in which building design, art, and music can be a bridge between
scientific data and understanding will be explored in the context of Arctic
landscape change. The workshop will consist of one-day symposium, followed by a
three-day workshop, both taking place at the University of Virginia. A post-
workshop activity will take place in Utqeagvik (Barrow, AK) to present and
discuss outcomes. The workshop organizers will engage with the next generation
of Alaska Native youth through the intersection of science, engineering,
architecture and music.&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: The proposed workshop and associated
activities will explore the intersections of the natural, built, and social-
cultural environments in the changing Arctic. In this proposed workshop, the
investigators will explore how building design, art, and music can be bridge
between scientific data and understanding, both academic and Indigenous, of
Arctic landscape change. The investigators hope to develop creative and truly
interdisciplinary approaches for understanding landscape change and refining
questions about the effects of these changes. The workshop will consist of one-
day symposium, followed by a three-day workshop, both taking place at the
University of Virginia. A post-workshop activity will take place in Utqeagvik
(Barrow, AK) to present and discuss outcomes. In addition, the workshop
organizers are promoting the idea of engaging the next generation of Alaska
Native youth through the intersection of science, engineering, architecture and
music, hoping that they will become interested in pursuing these fields for the
ultimate benefit of their own communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
