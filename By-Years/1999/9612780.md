9612780 Leburton The International Conference on Quantum Devices and Circuits is
dedicated to recent research I various aspects of the science and engineering of
electronic and optical devices, as well as circuits and systems that exploit
mesoscopic or quantum-mechanical phenomena in their operation. This conference
will be first to bring together experts from diverse fields. It is intended to
promote interaction between physicists, molecular chemists, engineers and
computer scientists who all have a role to play in the development of the next
generation of computers and electronics employing nanotechnology. NSF funds will
support graduate students attending the meeting. ***
