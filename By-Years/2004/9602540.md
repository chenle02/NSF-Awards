The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) will acquire laboratory and field
equipment that will benefit resident and visiting scientists and the educational
program, primarily in the area of ecosystems research. This project addresses:1)
the acquisition of a state-of-the-art sample combustion system for the existing
mass spectrometer laboratory that will allow rapid and relatively inexpensive,
yet precise, determination of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios on
biological samples as an analytical balance capability to support the enhanced
accuracy of determination; and 2) a new small research boat to support land-
margins and marine field research. These basic enhancements to the capabilities
of the MBL's Ecosystems Center will provide for programs in ecosystems research,
and will prepare for the research and educational challenges that are planned at
the MBL in the coming decade.
