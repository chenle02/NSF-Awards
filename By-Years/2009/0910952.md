Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of smart sensors interconnected over
wireless links are quickly becoming the technology of choice for monitoring and
measuring geographically distributed physical, chemical, or biological phenomena
in real time. Dynamic WSN environments encountered in environmental monitoring,
surveillance, pollution control, and reconnaissance applications, require
responsive management of WSN resources and their adaptive allocation to sensing,
networking support, localization, and planning tasks, based on user requests and
changes in the environment. A specified quality of service should however be
ensured for criteria such as resolution of the raw-data, latency, network
reconfiguration delay, and resource utilization in the steady-state. This
project develops an integrated cross-layered approach to networking, databases,
control, mobility management, and information processing in WSNs. In particular,
context-aware and energy-efficient solutions are pursued that are based on
opportunistic sensing and processing techniques, dynamic indexing structures,
novel query language constructs, reactive mobility control algorithms, and
distributed compression based routing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
technological advances from this research will significantly simplify the
deployment of WSNs and lead to novel context-aware applications. The advances
will directly benefit domains such as emergency-response management,
environmental threat remediation, and biological habitat monitoring. Apart from
developing the required algorithms, the project will implement simulation
platforms and a monitoring environment using physical devices. The platforms
will provide students with new educational opportunities to actively explore
information acquisition and resource management in resource-constrained
environments. All project resources will be shared with the public through a
project webpage.
