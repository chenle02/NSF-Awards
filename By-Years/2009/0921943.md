This dissertation project traces the meaning of rehabilitation as a goal of the
correctional and parole system in California. In 2005, California restructured
its correctional system to place a greater emphasis on rehabilitation. For
parole, the turn to rehabilitation appears as a reemergence of a policy that
dominated California penal law before the 1970s. It is unclear, however, whether
what is meant by "rehabilitation" in California's correctional system after 2005
is similar to the policies relied upon before the 1970s, or if it is something
different. Understanding what is meant by rehabilitation in California's
correctional system, and how it is different from previous versions, is
necessary to understand how rehabilitation is achieved through the parole
system. As such, this project asks the following questions: 1) What is meant by
rehabilitation as a goal of California's correctional system as expressed in the
2005 legislation and subsequent reorganization of the system? 2) How did the
current version of rehabilitation come about? 3) How does the current version
compare to prior meanings of rehabilitation in the context of California's
correctional system? and 4) How does the legislative intent of rehabilitation
impact the practice of parole? By drawing on the methodologies of comparative
historical and textual analyses, this study will focus on what rehabilitation
means, how the current call for rehabilitation came about, and its relationship
to prior attempts at rehabilitation within California's correctional system as a
whole, and, more specifically, within the parole system. In so doing, this study
will attempt to provide a better understanding of rehabilitation as a
legislative goal and how rehabilitation is mandated to the parole system.
