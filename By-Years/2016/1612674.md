This project concerns probability models evolving and coalescing in one
dimension. Such models arise in diverse areas of application; the models in this
project are taken from materials science, social science, genetics, and
distributed computing. Specific examples are: an interface between regions of
liquid in a pipe; candidates sequentially dropping out of a primary election;
tree-search for approximate evaluation of a Boolean function. Common to all
these models is an underlying mathematical structure in which initial conditions
are random, after which the evolution is governed by a non-random mechanism.
Analyses of evolutions without randomness is often considerably more difficult
than analysis of those with randomness. The focus in this project is on creating
tools to circumvent this problem. In most cases the PI seeks qualitative answers
to questions such as: what does the system look like after a long time, how long
does it take to reach this state, and how robust is the description to changes
in the initial conditions? The project's broader impacts beyond the potential
applications to the aforementioned areas, include the training of graduate
students in the mathematical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who will
have opportunities to engage in research on highly non-trivial topics in
probability theory. The PI will also devote some effort to improving STEM
education at a broader level through the development of innovative techniques
for calculus instruction and curriculum development. The PI will investigate the
systematic mathematical study of certain common practices which have suffered
from a lack of methodological validation, as a further broader impact.

The mathematical techniques to be used in this project involve the introduction
of time reversals. In a time reversal, randomness of initial conditions becomes
randomness of the time-reversed path. Once there is randomness in the evolution,
it is possible to use techniques from Markov chains, statistical mechanics, and
other applications of probability theory. There are a number of Markov chains
that describe time reversals of a given system. Suppose one's concern is to
describe the time-zero distribution of a system evolving deterministically from
random conditions at time minus infinity. Among possible Markovian time-
reversals, the one that describes this is the one with the maximum entropy. The
PI then plans to compute this using a variational principle.
