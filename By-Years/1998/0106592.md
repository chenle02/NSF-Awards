0106592 Mueller The Great Falls tectonic zone is a NE-trending feature that
extends from northeastern Idaho to the Montana - Saskatchewan border, and may
represent the collisional suture between the Archean Wyoming province and the
Hearne province of the Canadian shield. However, recent work has raised the
alternative interpretation that the Great Falls tectonic zone is an
intracontinental shear zone reactivated by the Trans-Hudson orogeny and another
feature represents the Wyoming-Hearne suture. This project will examine newly
documented 1.86 Ga meta-igneous rocks of the Great Falls tectonic zone that will
address several fundamental issues associated with the assembly of southern
Laurentia and the breakup of Rodinia. Results are expected to help clarify the
interpretation of the significance of the Great Falls tectonic zone in relation
to the development of the Pacific Northwest.
