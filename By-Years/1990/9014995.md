Parallel, distributed memory supercomputers have proved capable of very large
gravitational N-body simulations. In order to address further questions in
cosmology and the large-scale structure of the Universe, new algorithms which
can model the dissipative dynamics of gas, as well as dissipationless
gravitational dynamics will be needed. This project will focus on developing a
parallel "Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics" (SBH) code, and use it in an ongoing
astrophysics collaboration studying the formation of large-scale structure in
the universe. The applicability of parallel computers and large N-body
simulations to globular cluster evolution and an alternative to SPH, based on
multigrid methods, for evolving the dissipative equations of motion will be
considered. Finally, the applicability of new high-level software systems to
particle methods in computational astrophysics will be investigated.
