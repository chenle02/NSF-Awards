This award is to support the activities of a Mathematical Sciences Research
Group in Linear Analysis and Probability at Texas A&M. The activities of this
group (whose fields cover Banach space theory, probability, operator theory, and
operator algebras) are focused by a workshop where graduate students,
postdoctoral students, invited researchers, and the faculty of the group meet to
discuss their ongoing research. Funds from the grant would go towards the
expenses of the workshop, and the graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in
residence.
