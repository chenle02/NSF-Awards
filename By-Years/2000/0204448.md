DMS-0204448&lt;br/&gt;Eugene Lerman and Susan Tolman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
main subject of our proposal in the geometry and topology of
group&lt;br/&gt;actions on symplectic and contact manifolds. The underlying
theme is&lt;br/&gt;that these symmetries offer a very powerful tool for
classifying or&lt;br/&gt;computing invariants of such manifolds. More
specifically, ideas that&lt;br/&gt;we will investigate include: the cohomology
of symplectic quotients by&lt;br/&gt;loop groups, the cohomology of contact
quotients, highly symmetric &lt;br/&gt;manifolds, the Gromov width of coadjoint
orbits, the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;group of symplectomorphisms, uniruled
symplectic manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;foundational work on group actions on contact
manifolds, the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between completely integrable systems and
toric contact&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and explicit constructions of special metrics
on contact&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is
to further our understanding of two&lt;br/&gt;important types of geometry ---
symplectic and contact. Both&lt;br/&gt;geometries have their origins in
mechanics and optics and are&lt;br/&gt;currently of interest to physicists
investigating string theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
