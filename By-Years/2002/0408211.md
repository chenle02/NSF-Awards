In this project the PI seeks to expand her research program in industrial
mathematics into the biosciences at the molecular and cellular level. As part of
the University's emphasis on developing programs in genomics and bioinformatics,
collaborations between traditional biosciences departments and departments such
as Mathematics and Computer Science are being encouraged. The PI wishes to take
advantage of this trend to form new research alliances on campus, which will
enhance her research career, as well as increase educational opportunities for
students. Therefore part of the project is for the PI to work at the Center for
Integrated Bioscience (CIB) on campus and collaborate with Dr. Daryll Dewald on
modeling processes in cellular signaling. The other part of the proposal is to
build a new collaboration with scientists at Idaho Technology (IT), a firm that
develops fast DNA detection devices based on PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
Cultivating industrial contacts, especially within Utah, is important to the
vitality and effectiveness of the Industrial Math Masters program at USU, which
the PI helped to create in 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is
jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
