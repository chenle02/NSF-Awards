This project is developing a software prototype that will make the Alice
programming environment an integral part of the Institute for Advanced Education
in Geospatial Science?s (IAEGS) Virtual Portal. The Virtual Portal is an intense
interactive environment where animations are crucial and virtual communities are
the norm. Integrating Alice ? a teaching tool for introductory computing ? into
the Virtual Portal makes it possible for students with Web access to use Alice
and associated learning materials without the need to install additional
software.
