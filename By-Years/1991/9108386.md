Resource-constrained project scheduling with cash flows is difficult due to the
large number of possible combinations of tasks which can generate feasible
schedules. This had led to the evolution of a variety of heuristic procedures
that can aid the generation of a near-optimal schedule. Choosing the best
heuristic is difficult because it depends upon the particular problem;
furthermore often a combination of heuristics is better; finally since
circumstances can change, real-time adjustment of the scheduling solution is
important. Hence the proposer will analyze the feasibility of using neural
networks in the selection of the best heuristic algorithm for the resource-
constrained project scheduling problem.
