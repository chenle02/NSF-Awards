Professor Rudd will continue his research into the dynamics of ionizing heavy
particle collisions. He has designed and now has under construction a unique
apparatus that will permit measurement of the energy and angular distribution of
electrons emitted by impact of moderately high-energy protons on hydrogen atoms
in a crossed beam configuration. These studies will decide which of several
competing theoretical models is the correct one describing this most elementary
of heavy particle collisions.
