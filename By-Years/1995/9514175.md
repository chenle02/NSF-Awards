Dermatoglyphic traits develop during the second trimester in utero, and are
excellent markers for second trimester antenatal environmental events. Recent
research has demonstrated that a monozygotic twin model employing
dermatoglyphics may be used to determine whether antenatal environmental
conditions influence the etiology of complex bio-behavioral traits during the
second trimester. This model has been successfully applied in a study of
schizophrenia. Identical twins discordant for schizophrenia (ie., one twin had
the disease while the other did not) were also discordant for total finger ridge
count. As monzygotic twins are usually concordant for this dermatoglyphic trait,
an environmental event is implicated. This event would have to occur during the
second trimester and may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia, as well
as in the development of dermatoglyphic traits. The present study will use this
monozygotic twin-dermatoglyphic model to determine whether there is evidence of
a second trimester antenatal environmental component in the etiology of other
complex behaviors in males. This study will also collect data on other
characteristics associated with antenatal development, such as handedness and
birth-weight.
