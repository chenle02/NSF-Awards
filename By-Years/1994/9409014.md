9409014 Kurucz This is an award to support conduct of a Conference and Workshop
on recent advances made in uses of ionizing radiation for decontamination of
solids, fluids and gases. The workshop will include presentation and discussion
of results from research conducted under NSF Grant No. 91-08033 to the
University of Miami and the associated subcontract with Florida International
University's Drinking Water Research Center. This research has been conducted
with a large, engineering-scale, electron-beam accelerator located at the Miami-
Dade wastewater treatment plant on Virginia Key. The workshop will address
progress made in destruction of hazardous organic compounds in contaminated
water, soil and gaseous waste streams and the potential application of this
environmental technology for disinfection of infectious medical solid and liquid
wastes. The workshop is expected to result in identification of further needed
research that has promise of advancing uses of ionizing radiation in engineering
design of processes and systems for decontamination of environmental resources.
