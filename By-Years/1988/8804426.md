Recent developments in a variety of fields of geophysics have revealed that the
core-mantle boundary region exhibits a very rich range of behavior. Simple
explanations of the wide range of data which have recently become available do
not seem to be forthcoming. The PIs will investigate this region, concentrating
on two aspects: 1) the modes of interaction between core and lower mantle
convection; and the relative importance of different mechanisms of core-mantle
coupling; and 2) the structure of the boundary layers at the core-mantle
boundary, using both simple dynamical models and data to bound structure at the
core-mantle boundary.
