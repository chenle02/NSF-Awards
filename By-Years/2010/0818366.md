The creation of new firms is recognized as a major source of new jobs,
productivity gains, product innovations, integration of immigrants into the
economy, and a major career option for many people. The Panel Study of
Entrepreneurial Dynamics is based on a nationally representative sample of 1,214
nascent entrepreneurs and provides a unique empirical record of their actions,
from the initial stages of the process to the establishment of an ongoing
business. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of three annual interviews have been
already completed. The interviews provide information on the nature of the
business, start-up activities implemented, the characteristics of the founding
team and helping networks, sources and amounts of financial support, evaluations
of the economic context, competitive strategy and growth expectations, along
with details of the motivations, perspectives, and personal background of the
nascent entrepreneur. NSF funding of the fourth interview will enable a more
comprehensive assessment of which of these factors have a critical impact on the
outcome of the process, ranging from the abandonment of efforts to the
establishment of an ongoing business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding will
enhance the existing data set that is now widely used for theory development
about the entrepreneurial process, it will contribute to more accurate
conceptualizations of entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy, improve estimates of
the social costs and benefits associated with the entrepreneurial process, and
further contribute to understanding the contributions of new firms to U.S.
global competiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
