9526972 Richards The PI proposes to develop global mantle convection models that
are directly constrained by the history of plate motions and by knowledge of
present-day mantle heterogeneity. The focus will be on elucidating the large-
scale dynamics and evolution of mantle convection and plate tectonics during the
past 100-200 million years for which reasonable well-constrained plate motion
reconstructions are available. Models will be constrained by seismic tomography
and plate motion reconstructions, and by comparing their predictions with
geological and geophysical observations such as intraplate stresses and
deformation, plate boundary interactions, dynamic topography (sealevel)
variations, and true polar wandering. ***
