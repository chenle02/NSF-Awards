Nancy Makri at University of Illinois has submitted a renewal proposal to
develop and apply forward-backward semiclassical dynamics methods for large-
scale simulations of polyatomic systems. She proposes to integrate these methods
with a rigorous path integral description of the Boltzmann density, state-of-
the-art molecular dynamics techniques for optimal sampling of phase space, and
on-the-fly ab initio calculations of forces to produce a powerful tool suitable
for including quantum mechanical effects in simulations with hundreds of
particles. Extension to treat exchange effects in bosonic fluids is also
planned. Applications will focus on vibrational relaxation in liquids and the
dynamics of doped helium clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy transfer in and
out of molecular vibrational modes plays an important role in many topics of
current interest, such as chemical reaction pathways and laser control. It is
clear that understanding the mechanism of energy relaxation phenomena in large
molecules, clusters, or in solution requires a delicate treatment of nonlinear
many-body interactions and quantum effects, which will be pursued in this
research effort.&lt;br/&gt;
