In this proposal, it is proposed to use state estimation to identify the
location and type of harmonic sources in electric power systems. These sources
are frequently power rectifiers or inverters. This area has significance since
it is likely that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
will approve a recommended practice which will limit the injection of harmonic
signals into power systems and also limit bus voltage distortion. The proposed
identification techniques will permit detection of violation of the IEEE
recommended practice. It is proposed to test the methodologies using data
already available.
