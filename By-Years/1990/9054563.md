This is a three year project to help teachers learn about contemporary
applications of mathematics and of modern technology so that these can be used
to engage high school students in problem solving. It also hopes that such will
increase the interest of female and minority students in science and
mathematics. Two mathematics teachers from each high school will receive
intensive training on both the "content" of the project as well as how to do
peer coaching in its implementation. All high school mathematics teachers will
receive training on the use of technology, mathematical connections, and problem
solving applications. The business sector will be involved directly in providing
examples of each of these components through providing mentors for the teachers
as well as summer internships for teachers from each high school.
