The focus of this research is the development of anionic and photochemical
condensation reactions. When combined with anionic fragmentation reactions,
these transformations will produce highly functionalized 5-10 membered ring
systems including those present in the biologically active cembranoid natural
products. The educational component of the project includes K-12 science
outreach and curriculum development at the undergraduate level. At the graduate
level, future educators will be introduced to ways of describing chemical
research in layman's terms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Jon D. Rainier of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Arizona. Professor Rainier will focus his research on the development of
synthetic methodology applicable to the preparation of complex molecules with
important biological properties. Dr. Rainier's educational activities include
outreach efforts and curriculum development at the undergraduate level.
