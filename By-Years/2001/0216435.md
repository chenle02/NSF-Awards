A grant has been awarded to Dr. Primus V. Mtenga and colleagues at Florida
A&amp;M University - Florida State University College of Engineering (FAMU-FSU
CoE) to acquire an EchoTherm System for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in
infrastructure condition assessment and other applications. Infrastructure
deficiencies such as cracking in concrete structures, corrosion in steel
structures, production anomalies in materials have made condition assessment
using NDE techniques a very important area of research and development . These
NDE techniques include visual techniques, ultrasonic based techniques, x-ray
techniques, and now increasingly thermographic techniques. Both ultrasonic and
x-ray techniques require the attachment of probes or film on the component or
structure to be evaluated. The attachment of devices to the location to be
inspected is time consuming and may cause some inconveniences such as closure of
a facility for extended periods. On the other hand, Infrared thermography (IRT)
techniques have all the characteristics of providing an efficient and economical
method for NDE. These characteristics include the ability of measuring surface
temperature at a distance and the ability to cover a large area at a time. These
characteristics make the technique very useful in situations such as the
condition assessment of bridges where minimum inconvenience to the traveling
public is desirable.&lt;br/&gt;The EchoTherm System to be acquired will
complement an existing IRT capability at FAMU-FSU CoE. The EchoTherm system
allows controlled heat pulse application, thus providing the ability to monitor
heat decay precisely, which in turn allows the determination sizes of anomalies
and their location with depth. The availability of the system will enhance the
productivity of the existing IRT facility and increase FAMU-FSU CoE
competitiveness in the area of infrastructure condition assessment. With
anticipated funding from Florida Department of Transportation, studies on
quality control of Fiber Reinforced Polymer retrofit will be the maiden project
for the requested equipment.&lt;br/&gt;The Florida A&amp;M Univerisity, a
historically Black University, is a leading producer of minority and female
engineering graduates. The requested Echo-Therm System, augmented by the
existing IR Camera, will provide NDE exposure to the existing diverse body of
undergraduate and graduate students, thus bringing underrepresented groups to
the condition assessment field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
