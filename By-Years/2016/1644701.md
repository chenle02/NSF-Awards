The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project spans the
petrochemical, medical, and energy industries. The protective coatings developed
in this project will allow for safer storage, transportation, and use of
corrosive chemicals, as well as the containment and treatment of hazardous
wastes. These coatings may also find application to medical instruments and
devices, allowing longer lifetimes and lower risks of contamination. The same
coatings will also be useful in improved electrochemical systems such as fuel
cells and electrolyzers, which will allow for effective use of renewable energy.
Because this technology allows the deposition of iridium oxide coatings that are
only a few atoms thick, the virtues of iridium oxides can be imbued to surfaces
using fractions of a percent of the iridium required by currently employed
methods. This will improve the applicability of this rare, and otherwise cost-
prohibitive element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project starts with a
technology that allows the room-temperature deposition of iridium oxide coatings
from a molecular organometallic precursor dissolved in water. The coatings are
only a few atoms thick, but have been shown to be as impervious as iridium oxide
coatings 500 times thicker, and more active than the thicker coatings as
electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water and small organic molecules.
Additionally, the coatings are electrically conductive. During this I-corps
project, the team will gather information from potential customers to develop
products that will best take advantage of this ultra-thin, protective and
catalytically active coating. It is envisioned that this will be a
transformative technology in some sectors, allowing devices and systems with
unprecedented functionality and durability.
