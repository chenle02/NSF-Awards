Continuous observations using Global Positioning System (GPS) geodesy yield
high-precision determination of horizontal and vertical deformation rates and
their variation in time and space. This project focuses on two aspects of the
current GPS-determined four-dimensional deformation field along the Cascadia
convergent margin in the Pacific Northwest. First, the spatial and temporal
distribution of transient events on the Cascadia megathrust is being
investigated. This part of the study is motivated by preliminary results that
indicate at least 8 silent earthquakes (aseismic slip events lasting days to
months) with Mw > 6.0 (equivalent) occurred in the Pacific Northwest since 1992
based on analysis of the PANGA network. The data are being reanalyzed using
principal component analysis the results of which are used for spatial inversion
to determine the moment yield, spatial locations, and migration of each creep
event across the plate interface. Second, the kinematics of the migrating
continental fore-arc (western Washington) as it encounters a rigid buttress
(Vancouver Island) are being examined by analysis of the velocity field from the
PANGA array, and development of fault geometry and mechanical block models of
the intraplate deformation of the Cascadia margin and Puget Lowlands.
