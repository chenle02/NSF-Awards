9315694 Nazmy This research project addresses the reinforcement of soil
excavations to resist earthquake shaking through the use of soil nailing. Soil
nailing is an insitu soil reinforcement technique that has been tested and
implemented during the past twenty years in a variety of civil engineering
applications. The fundamental concept consists of placing in the ground passive
inclusions (steel reinforcing bars) as the excavation proceeds, in order to
restrain displacements, limit decompression during and after the excavation, and
to form a nailed mass that can behave similarly to a soft retaining wall. Post-
earthquake field investigations and laboratory studies have shown that soil-
nailed structures are highly resistant to earthquake loading. However, to date,
only limited studies have been conducted to evaluate their response and possible
failure mechanisms under seismic loading. Such research is needed to develop
reliable design methodologies. Given the increasing popularity of soil nailing,
this research project will have considerable impact on the geotechnical design
and construction industries. This project involves numerical analyses,
laboratory experiments -- in which a geotechnical centrifuge is used to subject
small-scale models to horizontal shaking -- and post earthquake observations.
This integrated approach provides a thorough understanding of the seismic
response of soil nailed systems, and will result in specific engineering
guidelines for their seismic design. This is a collaborative project involving
the University of California at Los Angeles and the Polytechnic University, New
York, with the experiments being performed on the geotechnical centrifuge at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
