This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models training award affords the
student the opportunity to take an additional year of advanced training (not
available at her home institution) at Princeton University. The training
involves courses in formal modeling and statistical techniques. The training
will strengthen considerably the student's research skills as she undertakes a
Ph.D. dissertation of bargaining in the process of coalition formation.

The training has the broader social value of enhancing understanding of
bargaining and coalition formation and strengthens the research and teaching
skills of this future member of the professorate.
