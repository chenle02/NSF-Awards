*** 96-60609 Allred This Small Business Innovation Research project will outline
chemical strategies for "interfaces by design" to formulate new finish
compositions that should vastly improve the performance of composite materials
in high humidity or marine applications. Initial results from fiber finishes
incorporating this novel chemistry suggests the possibility of advanced
composites that offer not only moisture resistance, but an actual improvement of
mechanical strength and fracture toughness following water exposure. Composite
materials are universally affected by humidity or water immersion due primarily
to the ingress of water at the fiber/matrix interface. Moisture degradation of
composite properties remains a critical technology problem for these versatile
materials. Advanced composite materials are finding increased usage in a growing
range of applications. The more the engineering and fabrication properties of
these materials are understood, the greater is the demand for them. As composite
technology is applied to evermore new and demanding areas, further improvements
in performance are necessary while simultaneously reducing costs. ??
