Front Range Community College (FRCC) will use evidence-based, inquiry-based
teaching strategies to attract local high school and community college students
to jobs in biotechnology, and equip them with the skills to succeed in the
industry. Despite a robust industry, Colorado faces a severe shortage of skilled
biotechnology technicians, mostly due to the lack of career awareness and
training of local students. Career exploration activities will allow students to
explore career paths in biotechnology and increase their awareness of and
interest in pursuing biotechnician careers. FRCC STEM students will serve as
near-peer mentors to facilitate student learning in the classroom and promote
self-efficacy in career exploration. This project will make an important
contribution to the development of a skilled workforce, which is essential for
the continual growth and prosperity of the Colorado biotechnology
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRCC will develop the biotechnology educational
pipeline in Colorado by increasing students' exposure to and engagement in
biotechnology careers. Inquiry-based molecular biology labs will be developed
and implemented in local high schools and in high-enrollment science courses at
FRCC. These materials will be adapted and developed to equip students with the
foundational knowledge and skills in demand by the industry for entry-level
biotechnology jobs. Partnerships with local industry will ensure the workforce
relevancy of the inquiry curriculum and will provide engaging career exploration
opportunities to attract students into biotechnology careers. This project will
generate valuable instructional materials, which can be adopted by the science
education community and will be shared with the ATE community. A long term goal
is to reduce the regional educational achievement gap, and to increase local
participation in Colorado's bioscience workforce.
