Traditional models in evolutionary biology are founded on a straightforward
relationship between genes and traits. However, gene function and the
relationship between the genes and their influence on organisms can be quite
complex, depending on other genes in the genome, the environment, and even from
which parent the gene is inherited. This later case, known as genomic
imprinting, is the focus of this research. The evolutionary and developmental
consequences of imprinting will be examined in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum)
with a combination of controlled greenhouse crosses and studies of gene
expression levels. In addition to discovering imprinted regions of the genome
that influence seed weight, this research also will identify other complex
genetic influences on seed traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imprinted genes are
common in diverse organisms, including humans, but little is known about the
evolutionary and developmental consequences of this phenomenon. Imprinting is
important in human health as some genetic diseases are due to mis-expression of
imprinting. Additionally imprinting is often a barrier to hybridization and crop
improvement especially in the genus Solanum (tomatoes, potatoes and their
relatives).
