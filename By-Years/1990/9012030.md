Propose to use the PICES submersible to sample the flanks of the Liohi and
Mahukona volcano in order to study the petrology and geochemistry of this
endmember in the Hawaii volcano chain. They wish to test a hypothesis that a
period of alkalic volcanism preceded the current period of coeval tholeiitic and
alkalic volcanism. Recovered rocks will be characterized with petrography and
mineral and glass chemistry. The glasses will be analyzed for major and trace
elements. For selected samples Pb, Sr, Nd, and O isotopes will be determined to
evaluate the history and source of these lavas.
