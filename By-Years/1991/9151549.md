The Department of Geology is purchasing sample preparation and computing
equipment to be used by students for chemical and mineralogical analyses of
geologic materials as part of laboratory exercises and undergraduate research
projects. This equipment is increasing the utility of existing X-ray
diffractometers in Clay Mineralogy, X-ray Techniques, and
Sedimentology/Stratigraphy laboratory courses. The equipment is also being used
extensively in undergraduate research projects on stream and river sediments,
soil formation processes, and hydrothermal alteration of dike-intruded
sediments.
