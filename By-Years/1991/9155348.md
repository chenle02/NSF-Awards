The grant would substantially fund a 3 year project which would provide 2-week
summer inservice training for teachers and teacher leaders in physical science.
Grades K-12 would be included with most of the focus on pre-high school. The
summer workshops would both train a cadre of teacher/leaders in conducting
workshops (20 per summer) and offer direct and indirect training in physical
sciences to teachers. Local teachers would be the recipients of the practice and
demonstration workshops in the summer. Additionally, trained leaders would be
expected to run workshops in their own communities and return the following
summer to share with the new group of leader trainers. The total impact would be
on 60 trained trainers and 1200 other recipients of the training. An additional
feature of the project is the ongoing support and sharing among those involved.
Through academic year Saturday meetings, newsletters, a source book, and return
meetings with new leaders, a substantial communication mechanism is established.
