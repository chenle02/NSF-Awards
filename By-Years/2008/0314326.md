The focus of this research is in the development of synthetic methods for the
synthesis of modified nucleosides by palladium catalysis. This research project
aims will develop methods that use Pd-catalysis for C-N, and C-C bond formation
to produce modified nucleosides. In addition to the fundamental work involving
the catalysis itself, specific applications of C-N bond-formation will aid in
developing novel approaches to advance the understanding biological responses to
DNA damage. Use of polymer-supported synthesis techniques, including traceless
linkers and high-throughput, diversity-oriented studies will be explored.

With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Mhesh K. Lakshman of the
Department of Chemistry at City College in New York City. Professor Lakshman
will focus his research on the development of new ways to synthesize DNA bearing
unusual nucleoside bases. This research will contribute to the fundamental
understanding of the role DNA plays in biological activity, and how cells
respond to DNA damage. Chemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and
post-doctoral level will be trained in Professor Lakshman's laboratory, which
has a strong track record of training minority students.
