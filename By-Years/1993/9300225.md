This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at the National Museum of
Natural History to help support 48 undergraduate students over a three year
period who will participate in both a formal curriculum and closely supervised
independent research in areas such as systematics, botany, zoology, and
paleobiology. Research and training in organismal biology, systematic, and
ecology has declined at most universities over the last decade, even though
these fields are critical for evaluating and addressing loss of biodiversity and
global change. Museums still carry out basic research in these fields, but have
had little to do with undergraduate education. The National Museum of Natural
History (NMNH) Research Training Program at the Smithsonian Institution is
designed to stimulate undergraduates to pursue careers in the natural sciences
through a balanced program of hands-on research, scientific lectures, and group
discussions. The 10-week long summer program emphasizes an independent research
project supervised by a member of the scientific staff. The training value of
the project is enhanced by a set of lectures, discussions, field trips, and
laboratory and collections demonstrations. The strengths of the NMNH Research
Training Program are the large number of research staff (over 120 Ph.D.-level
scientists and 250 technicians), the breadth of research projects (e.g.
morphological and molecular systematics, paleobiology, behavior, morphometrics,
ecology), the size of the collections (more than 119 million specimens of
plants, animals, fossils, etc.), and the excellent libraries (over 1 million
texts and journals). The combination of these resources creates an unparalleled
environment for getting undergraduates started on careers as researchers in the
natural sciences. As of 1992, students who complete the Program now have the
opportunity to apply for a Pew Fellowship in Systematic Biology at the
Smithsonian that will allow them to continue their research training at the NMNH
through the end of their undergraduate education.
