The hypothesis that has emerged from the PI's dissertation work is that
stereotypical behavior is generally controlled by motivational systems related
to foraging and other behaviors related to basic motivational systems (e.g.,
mating, social contact). The postdoctorate project will test this hypothesis by
studying several species of primates at the Washington National Primate Research
Center. The research plan includes: 1) relating familial relatedness on
stereotypic activity, 2) observing behavior (stereotypic, social contact, etc.)
of young and adult primates interacting in their environment, and 3)
manipulating the availability of food (type, predictability, amount, location,
etc ) for which the animal will forage. The research will also be conducted at
the Woodland Park Zoo where the PI intends to study how environmental
"enrichment" reduces stereotypical behavior. He intends to study several
species, including bears and large felids which hunt prey and would have a
strong hunting motivation. He will manipulate variables associated with
appropriate prey stimuli (movement, shape, etc.) to determine what is missing
from the zoo environment that would eliminate or trigger stereotypical behavior.
