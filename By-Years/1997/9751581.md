The primary purpose of this project is to enhance and reform the learning of
mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum according to the current calls for
change in pedagogy predicated by the Mathematical Association of America and the
American Mathematical Society. To implement this nationally promoted educational
reform program, the university is providing a computer-assisted technology
classroom, the use of which brings new methods of mathematical instruction to
the students, prepares them for the use of technology and industry-standard
mathematical software, and increases their capacity for the application of
mathematics to other disciplines. The project strives to accomplish the
following objectives: provide computer-assisted instruction and learning
facilities and disseminate the information regarding the activities made
possible by these facilities; increase the amount of mathematical content taught
in courses and its retention by students; motivate students to learn with the
use of open-ended, real-world applications; emphasize active, creative, problem-
solving approaches to learning through group work, class projects, discovery
exercises, and other reform-oriented methods of instruction; use technology as
it naturally fits into course work so it becomes an integral, rather than a
peripheral, part of learning; acquaint students with changing and emerging
technologies in order to make graduates more competitive in the marketplace. *
