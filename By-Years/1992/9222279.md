ABSTRACT During the 1980s statistical techniques for analysis for geographical
patterns have been refined to the point that they may be applied to data from
many different fields. This project will implement density-estimation algorithms
to draw differential- frequency boundaries for language data, using the
extensive computer files of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South
Atlantic States (LAMSAS); these boundaries will then be compared to dialect
feature boundaries generated with pre-statistical qualitative methods and to
boundaries of selected topographical and cultural areas. Prior NSF support
assisted the development of efficient small-computer methods to encode LAMSAS
data and to develop preliminary methods for its statistical analysis. This
project will process files from the existing data-bases with statistical
algorithms and with GIS (Geographical Information System) software for displays;
a Sun work station will provide fast processing for computer-intensive
statistics and graphics. Specific programs will be written by a consultant to
implement density- estimation for LAMSAS data and to enable comparison with
digitized maps of older boundaries under GIS. Approximately 50 items will
receive comprehensive analysis and comparison, leading to several articles on
the nature of areal variation when it is conceived as the differential frequency
of linguistic features, and on the relation of this quantitative method to
earlier qualitative methods.
