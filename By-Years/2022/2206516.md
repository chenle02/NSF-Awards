By studying chemistry in the gas and dust that pervades the Milky Way,
astronomers are able to better understand the birth of stars and planets and the
way the galaxy changes over time. A team from the University of Virginia will
continue their research on how large molecules are formed in dense regions where
stars like our sun are born. This theoretical work may even lead to a better
understanding of how life began on Earth. The proposers will also continue
outreach and teaching efforts through their association with various university
programs, most of which are committed to bringing people of all backgrounds and
life experiences into scientific research. Graduate and undergraduate students
will also participate in the research being proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims at modelling the formation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in
the hot, inner regions of low-mass star forming cores. These so-called “Hot
Corinos” harbor molecules that are of prebiotic interest. Hot Corinos are
therefore of great value as we develop a better understanding of the origins of
life on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere). The project will combine chemical,
radiative and magneto-hydrodynamical (RHD and MHD) models to explore the time-
and spatially-dependent chemistry occurring in these sources during core
collapse and the formation of a circumstellar disk, jet and protostar. The
coupled models will seek to distinguish between heating mechanisms and will
probe the influence of protostellar UV on the chemistry of the outflow cavity
walls. The study will be of relevance to existing and future ALMA observations
as well as upcoming observations of solid-phase molecules using the James Webb
Space Telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
