This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Point Sur, a 135? general purpose Regional research vessel. The vessel is
operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes three items
listed by priority:

1) Tucker trawl nets, frame, TDR 2) Beam Trawl nets

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The
acquisition of improved, shared use, mid-water and benthic sampling devices will
enhanse the R/V Pt. Sur's ability to support meaningful research.
