This continuing project will conduct laboratory investigations of electron
impact excitation and ionization cross sections for atmospheric species at Johns
Hopkins University. Ionization and excitation are produced by both
photoelectrons produced by the sun's extreme ultraviolet photon flux on
atmospheric constituents and precipitated accelerated electrons in auroral
zones. Excitation and ionization are also the main processes by which
thermospheric electrons lose energy to the ambient atmosphere. Thus, we must
gain familiarity with the cross sections for these electron impact processes to
understand the rate of electron energy loss as well as intensities of optical
emissions they produce. Specifically, we plan to measure ionization-excitation
branching ratios for atomic oxygen ion production in all final electronic states
of the ion. The work should significantly advance thermospheric modeling and
many processes of interest in planetary atmospheres.
