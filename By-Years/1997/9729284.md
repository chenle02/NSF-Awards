In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida will join
with colleagues at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the
University of South Carolina to study the relationship between near surface
biogeochemical processes affecting the fluxed of carbon and nitrogen and the
downward flux of particulates in the Cariaco Basin, an anoxic embayment on the
coast of Venezuela. The Basin is famous for its relatively undisturbed varved
sediments which many sedimentologists, geochemists, and paleoceanographers
regard as a potentially valuable proxy archive for past oceanographic conditions
of the CaribbeanSea and Atlantic Ocean. the USF group will concentrate on
collection, modeling, and interpretation of hydrographic and core geochemical
data (carbon, nitrogen, phytoplankton composition) of the water column and
relating observations to events in the greater Caribbean basin. The SUNY
investigators will study the chemical transformations of organic matter as it
sinks from surface waters to depth in the Basin. And the South Carolina group
will study particle sedimentation through the use of sediment traps and analysis
of seabed sediment cores. It is anticipated that these studies will help
establish a linkage between the Cariaco sediment archive and regional
oceanographic processes over time, hopefully allowing researchers to predict
future paleoclimatic/paleoceanographic events by referring to the record left in
Cariaco sediments.
