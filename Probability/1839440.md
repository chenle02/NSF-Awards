The meeting `Advances in Asymptotic Probability' will take place in Stanford
University, on December 13-17, 2018. It is expected to gather about 25 talks
given by some of the world leaders in probability theory and stochastic
processes, and more than one hundred participants. The workshop will focus on
asymptotic properties of large random structures.

Within probability theory and statistical physics one common goal is to
understand behavior at macroscopic (and mesoscopic) scales in systems governed
by relatively simple local interactions. In recent years there have been
numerous significant developments on questions relating to this general theme.
Topics represented at the conference will include: integrable probability,
interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations;
conformal probability, random planar maps; spin glasses, random matrices, Markov
chains, random graphs.
