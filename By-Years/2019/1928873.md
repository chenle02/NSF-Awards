The High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) conference is the
premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use
of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data
analysis, and other innovative applications. The travel grant for HPDC 2019 will
defray the costs of overnight accommodations, travel costs (e.g. airfare, public
transportation), and food. The travel grant is very beneficial for the domestic
PhD students. The travel grant supports the research interests and the
involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are
just beginning their participation in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support
will be provided for student registration and travel. Support for 10-20 students
is anticipated. Availability of support will be advertised and participation
from under-represented communities in the travel grant application process will
be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
