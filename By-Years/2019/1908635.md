This proposal provides funding for the fourth GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups
in Security Research workshop, which will held in May 2019, in San Francisco,
CA. This day-and-a-half-long workshop intended for women and underrepresented
minorities in computer security and privacy, will be co-located with the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society's
Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number
of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security
is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security,
language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues.
The goal of the organizers is to encourage graduate and highly motivated
undergraduate students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose
security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide
range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are
working towards solving those problems with talks and interactive participatory
sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
