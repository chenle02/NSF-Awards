ABSTRACT AST-9424416 Ostriker, Jeremiah P. This theoretical research project,
directed by Dr. Ostriker, has the objective of elucidating the physical
processes occurring in active and quiescent galactic nuclei. While there is
general agreement that a proper model will include a dense stellar system and in
all likelihood a gaseous disc and one or more massive black holes, the detailed
mechanism whereby the prodigious energy output is achieved remains poorly
understood. The focus of this research is not on the electrodynamics or
relativistic dynamics in the vicinity of a black hole, but on the physical
environment in dense stellar systems. Three related areas will be studied: (1)
hydrodynamics of time-dependent accretion flows; (2) evolution of dense stellar
systems; and (3) the union of the previous two subjects, i.e. physical processes
in systems containing both accretion flows and dense stellar systems. ***
