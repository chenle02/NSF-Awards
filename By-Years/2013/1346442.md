This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
materials to replace silver in conductive ink applications. Current silver
replacement materials all have significant drawbacks making them unsuitable for
use in many industries which would benefit from these cost savings. The project
will utilize advanced thin film nanocoatings to produce silver replacement
materials at a low cost while maintaining high performance. These advancements
will ultimately allow for the production of lower cost "printable" electronics,
as well as decreasing the cost of sophisticated technologies such as
photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of
this project directly impacts any sector making use of conductive inks or
adhesives in manufacturing of goods. In solar panels, the most important current
commercial application, silver inks are used to print conductive traces onto
panels. In other areas, conductive inks are gaining new applications daily in
everything from computer displays to RFID tags. The value of the silver being
used in these applications is roughly $1B/year, and rising consistently.
However, current market fluctuations in the cost of silver metal have caused
increasing difficulty for manufacturers, with prices of $125/kg in 2003
skyrocketing to $1000/kg in 2012. We anticipate being able to produce silver
substitute materials which will increase supply stability and reduce cost in
this critical industry.
