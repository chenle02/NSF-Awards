This project involves the development of an undergraduate Laboratory integrating
computer vision with robot task planning. Further, applications involving low-
level electronics interfacing are studied by students of applied physics. One
aim of the laboratory is to provide experiences for Computer Science students
that will enable them to understand, implement, and clearly see the applications
of artificial intelligence techniques in a physical world situation. Major
instruments in this project include 1) cameras and image processing computers
for the vision component, 2) robot manipulators and controlling computers for
the machine intelligence component, and 3) a local area network to integrate
vision with robotics and to allow data transfer among all components. The
project is significant in that it eliminates a curriculum deficiency by
providing laboratory experiences for undergraduates in the areas of computer
vision, machine intelligence, and electronics interfacing. These serve both for
instruction and for instilling enthusiasm for continued work at the graduate
level. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
