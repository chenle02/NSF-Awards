An individual's preferences can be complicated. The project investigates whether
people's preferences do, in fact, conform to the CP-net (conditional preference
network) formalism, how such preferences can be combined according to different
voting methods, and how vulnerable those methods are to manipulation or
"strategic voting." Finally, the very large corpus of preference data from the
Netflix Challenge is used to build statistical models of the efficiency of
manipulation algorithms and to compare the performance of different consensus
methods.

Laboratory experiments will check whether people exhibit preferences that can be
modeled by CP-nets. The project extends ideas from aggregation in Bayesian
networks (models of conditional probabilities) to aggregation in CP-nets (models
of conditional preferences).

The team investigates how statistical inference from noisy data relates to or
interacts with strategic manipulability and bribery. The project extends
behavioral social choice and computational social choice on voting systems, and
the manipulation thereof, from preferences expressed as ratings, rankings, or
subsets to preferences expressed as CP-nets.

The team investigates the performance of voting methods and the efficiency of
manipulation schemes on real preference data from the Netflix challenge data
set. These data, namely hundreds of thousands of (slightly perturbed) personal
rankings of movies, were released several years ago for data-mining purposes.
One can extract individual "elections" based on the rankings of a small set of
movies, evaluate and compare various aggregation methods and empirically
characterize voting scenarios that are especially susceptible or especially
resilient to strategic manipulation.

Among the broader impacts of the research, beyond the integration and cross-
fertilization of several distinct research areas spanning several scientific
disciplines, are the development of more adequate individual and collective
decision making tools, that will help individuals, groups, organizations, and
society to improve decision making.
