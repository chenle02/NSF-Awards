Using carbon monoxide (CO) as a relatively conserved tracer this project
investigates temporal and spatial variations on a global scale of an important
atmospheric oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (OH). These two species are closely
coupled since the reaction of CO with OH is the most important loss process for
atmospheric CO. The first element of the project involves monitoring
isotopically labeled 14CO abundance at a tropical, clean air sampling site in
each hemisphere, in conjunction with similar measurements at mid- and high-
latitude sites in each hemisphere through collaborations with other groups, with
data analyzed and interpreted in terms of advanced 3-D general circulation model
simulations with the objective of improving our understanding of the oxidative
capacity of the atmosphere. The second element of the study entails using stable
isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen and mixing ratios of CO measured in air
samples extracted from firn and ice cores to determine the southern hemisphere
CO source strength from biomass burning in pre-industrial times. Broader impacts
are addressed by providing a significant advance in our understanding of the
oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, and the education of young atmospheric
scientists in an environment of international collaboration. Data from this
study will provide powerful constraints on the atmospheric CO budget, and
provide new information on global OH behavior - each having implications for
climate change and global policy. The project education plan includes research
opportunities for graduate students and undergraduates - including women through
the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program.
