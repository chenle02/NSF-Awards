All cells are capable of recognizing and responding to signals from their
environment. The molecular machinery that carries out this recognition and
response has been well described for many signals, and it is recognized that
interacting networks of signaling pathways exist. However, a central problem in
cell biology is the manner in which these signaling networks interact and are
controlled and integrated to produce an appropriate response to multiple
signals. This project will explore the design principles of signaling networks
that allow cells to process information that includes both the strength and
duration of external signals. Experimental and mathematical modeling approaches
will be used to gain a systems-level understanding of multiple signal sensing in
a plant (Arabidopsis) well-suited to the study of responses to changes in the
environment. A new teaching tool for High School students and the curricular
materials for their teachers will be created that make explicit the underlying
mathematical principles that will allow students of biology to develop and
manipulate models of cell signaling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
establish systems-level properties of the glucose/pathogen (PAMP) sensing system
of Arabidopsis, building on the emergent property of "dose-duration reciprocity"
formulated using the glucose response in the heterotrimeric G protein pathway.
The specific aims of the project address 1) The emergent properties conferred by
network architecture on the glucose response systems, 2) the manner in which
multiple signals can operate through a single complex to generate different
outcomes, and 3) the manner in which the dynamics of subcellular location of
system components regulate the cellular response outcomes.
