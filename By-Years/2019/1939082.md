This award provides travel support of participants to the conference titled
"Talking Across Fields" will take place at Stanford University, on January
31-February 2, 2020. It is expected to gather about 17 talks given by some of
the world leaders in combinatorics, probability, and statistics, and more than
fifty other participants.

The purpose of this meeting is to explore the fundamental connections between
probability, combinatorics, algebra, and their applications in statistics and
scientific computing. In particular, the meeting will explore recent advances in
rates of convergence of Markov chains, exchangeability, random graphs, and
sampling, and the foundational role they play in our understanding of
randomness, symmetry, and computation. The conference webpage can be found at
