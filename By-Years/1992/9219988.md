The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the assembly of the
spore coat that surrounds and protects dormant spores of Bacillus subtilis. The
investigator has assembled new evidence that oxidative crosslinking of tyrosine
residues in the spore coat is a significant element of the process of spore coat
morphogenesis. Also, the lab has identified potential substrates for
crosslinking among previously cloned genes known to code for proteins comprising
the spore coat, and has preliminary evidence that another spore coat protein,
CotE, has predicted structural elements which suggest that it might be the
enzyme responsible for carrying out this modification in vivo. CotE, expressed
in E. coli, possesses the predicted ability to bind heme , consistent with its
proposed function as a peroxidase in vivo. The specific goals are to: 1.Quantify
the amount of crosslinked tyrosine present in wild type B. Subtilis as a
function of time during spore formation and intracellular location. 2. Verify
biochemically that CotE is competent to carry out the proposed crosslinking
function. 3. Mutationally inactivate CotE and correlate changes in spore coat
structure with changes in CotE function to confirm its role in spore coat
assembly and modification. %%% Certain bacteria are capable of surviving extreme
conditions of heat and cold by producing spores. The coat proteins of these
organisms are chemically modified to adapt to environmental stresses. This
research will study the enzyme that is responsible for the modification as well
as the target protein that it modifies. This research could lead to the
production of new biomaterials with altered properties which would be useful in
extreme environments.
