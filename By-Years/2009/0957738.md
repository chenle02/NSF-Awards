The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the NSF Division
of Chemistry and the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the Division
of Materials Research supports the research project of Prof. Alexander Wei of
Purdue University. Prof. Wei and his students will fabricate annular magnetic
nanostructures on metal surfaces and focus primarily on the synthesis of cobalt
nanometric rings. The group will investigate fundamental aspects of nucleation
and growth in nanostructure synthesis and optimize the reaction conditions to
realize templated anisotropic growth of the cobalt nanostructures. Cobalt
nanostructures exhibit superb magnetic properties and controlling their
dimensions at the nanometer scale will potentially led to the development of
improved magnetic nanodevices. The project will also lead to the development of
new concepts for non-voltaic memory and data processing, with potential for high
density in 3D. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to
undergraduate and graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary area at the
forefront of science and nanotechnology.
