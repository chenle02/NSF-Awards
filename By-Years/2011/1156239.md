An empirical assessment of the railroads' contribution to 19th century American
economic growth is central to understanding the United States' historical rise
to global economic prominence. Railroads and internal market integration may
have been a major contributing factor to American economic growth; if not,
isolating the limited impact of railroads enables research to explore
alternative explanations.&lt;br/&gt;This project revisits the historical impact
of railroads on American economic growth, using a new methodology that combines
recent advances in general equilibrium trade theory, county-level historical
data, and the construction of a new spatial network of freight transportation
routes.&lt;br/&gt;Railroads spread throughout the United States from 1830 to
1920, both complementing and substituting for the use of navigable waterways.
This historical setting provides an opportunity to implement and test recent
theoretical advances in trade theory using a direct shock to trade costs and
county-level data on population and agricultural land values. The aggregate
economic impact of changes in counties' access to markets is capitalized by
changes in counties' land values.&lt;br/&gt;The empirical analysis uses changes
in the railway network to estimate the relationship between counties' market
access and land values. These estimates are used to calculate the implied
aggregate economic loss from removing railroads or replacing railroads with a
hypothetical extension of the canal network. Further analysis considers
railroads' impact on the geographic distribution of economic
activity.&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of historical American economic growth is
shaped by the impact of railroads and, more generally, the impacts of market
integration. When analyzing other determinants of American economic growth, the
created datasets provide an opportunity to adjust for concurrent railroad
construction and changes in counties' market access.&lt;br/&gt;Globally, many
growth initiatives focus on improving transportation infrastructure and market
integration. This project develops and illustrates a new methodology for
estimating the impacts of transportation infrastructure improvements and
increased market integration.
