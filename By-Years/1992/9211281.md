The purpose of the research to be performed on this RIA award is to develop a
thorough understanding of the mechanism of chemical segregation of
multicomponent, noble metal-bearing metallic precursors that occurs during the
recently developed "cyclic oxidation" process used for the preparation of
superconducting oxide/noble metal composites. Combined use of the oscillating
oxidation process and oxide melt processing should yield fracture-tough
superconducting composites with high transport critical current density in
significant magnetic fields.
