Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ANI-0344881&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for a one-and-
a-half-day workshop on "Revisiting Broadband Homes: Research challenges in
Networks, Broadband Access and Residential Applications." The workshop will
bring together researchers with expertise covering a variety of research areas
related to broadband access and will be a strong contribution towards better
understanding and fostering of the issues affecting fundamental research in
residential networking and applications. This workshop will prepare a report
that will be available to the community and can help to better articulate the
future networking research agenda in broadband access, home networks and
applications; it will stimulate far-reaching future research initiatives,
collaborations and evolvement of the community. &lt;br/&gt;
