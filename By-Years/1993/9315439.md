9315439 Sachs This award supports a two-year cooperative science project between
Dr. Matthew Sachs, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry,
and Molecular Biology, Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology, and
Professor Hirokazu Inoue, Department of Regulation Biology, Saitama University,
Urawa, Japan. The goal of the collaborative effort is to obtain cDNA clones for
Neurospora crassa genes that are induced in response to ultraviolet light
damage. The investigators will use sensitive differential hybridization
techniques to identify these clones in cDNA libraries prepared from UV-induced
cultures. They will also prepare libraries using this cDNA to enable expression
in yeast and bacteria, providing additional powerful approaches to understand
gene functions. This collaboration will provide the basis for an increased
understanding by the scientists in the U.S. and Japanese laboratories about the
functions of genes induced by mutagenic events as well as the mechanisms that
control the expression of these genes. ***
