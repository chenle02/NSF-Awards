Dynamic integrity constraints arise in many traditional and non- traditional
database applications; however, such constraints are not supported by current
database management systems. This project focuses on efficient methods for
checking dynamic integrity constraints in databases. Past Temporal Logic and
Past Metric Temporal Logic are proposed as constraint languages, making it
possible to formulate both qualitative and quantitative temporal conditions. The
project includes the development and the implementation of a method to reduce
dynamic integrity checking to static integrity checking. If this method is used,
past database states do not have to be stored for the purpose of dynamic
integrity checking. Instead, compressed historical information is stored in
every database state as auxiliary relations. The definitions of the needed
auxiliary relations are automatically derived from the constraints. Techniques
that optimize constraint checking and issues that arise from the integration of
this new method with existing database management systems will also be
addressed. The proposed research will significantly enlarge the application
scope of database management systems and will make it easier to integrate these
systems with real-time processes.
