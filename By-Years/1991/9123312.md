The aim of the proposed research is to develop methods for predicting stress
distributions within geosynthetic reinforcements at working loads through an
integrated program of experimental measurements and analytical modelling.
Measurements of load transfer onto reinforcing inclusions will be achieved using
the Automated Plan Strain Reinforcement (APSR) cell developed recently at MIT.
Experiments will be performed using a dry sand with different classes of
geosynthetic inclusions including: a) polymeric sheets ('geomembrane
materials'), b)grids, c) woven fabrics, and d) non-woven fabrics. The results of
the study will help to provide a rational basis for selection of reinforcing
materials in design.
