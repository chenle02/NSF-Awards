ABSTRACT Israel Wachs The objective of this program is the establishment of a
foundation for the rational design of multilayered surface metal-oxide
catalysts; this requires a data base that includes materials with a wide range
of properties. The primary supports used in this study are silica, a weakly
interacting support and titanic a strongly interacting support. These are
surface-modified with zirconia, alumina, silica, or titania to give a range of
surface properties. Vanadia is the second surface oxide layer deposited on the
modified supports; it is selected because of its unique redox properties and the
fact that a considerable amount of data on vanadium oxide overlayers on oxides
already exists. Characterization is performed under reactive environments to
determine the structures of the surface metal-oxide layers and whether the
vanadium-oxide layer is anchored to the support oxide. Catalytic activities of
the multilayered systems are probed with temperature-programmed reduction
studies and with studies of methanol oxidation. Structure and reactivity
information are combined to illuminate the natures of the interactions in these
multilayered surface metal-oxide phases and their effects on catalytic
reactivity and selectivity. Multilayered surface metal-oxide catalysts are
widely regarded as the next generation of catalysts for partial oxidation and
controlled reduction. These systems have a wide range of applicability and are
considered central to cost-competitive production of many products including
drugs, gasoline additives, plastics, and pesticides. This project aims to
develop a rational strategy for design of these catalysts. ***
