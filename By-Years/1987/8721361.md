EERI's Committee on Planning for Earthquake Hazards will conduct a cooperative
US-Japan 3 day workshop on the subject of planning for urban earthquake hazards
reduction. This will be the second such workshop, following a first held at
Stanford University in August 1984 in conjunction with the 8th World Conference
on Earthquake Engineering (8WCEE). This second workshop (2USJW) will be held in
Shizuoka, just prior to the next World Conference (9WCEE, 2-9 August 1988), and
will focus on problems of earthquakes at the urban scale, examining in the
context of mitigation efforts on-going in the US and Japan: 1. Policy Problems
of Earthquake Prediction 2. Public and Private Preparedness 3. Vulnerability
Assessment/Estimation of Earthquake Damage 4. Fire/HazMat Following Earthquake
5. Search and Rescue/Emergency Response 6.
Recovery/Repair/Reconstruction/Rehabilitation 7. Governmental Response to the
Earthquake Problem 8. Insurance The format will include invited papers on key
topics, working group discussions and a final plenary session for summaries of
the working groups' findings. A workshop proceedings will be prepared by the
Japanese co-sponsors and disseminated to attendees and others in the field.
