The proposed research will examine basic physiological processes controlling
plant growth and water used in native plants under conditions of fluctuating
sunlight. Most previous studies have been done under constant sunlight but both
native and agricultural plants are more commonly exposed to variations in
sunlight due to clouds or other plants shading each other. Basic knowledge of
how plants respond to fluctuating levels of sunlight in terms of their growth
and water use is crucial for our understanding of native plant and crop
productivity. The studies will build upon patterns of responses already
documented and provide a mechanistic interpretation of them. No-steady state
plant responses to humidity, reduced water availability, and temperature will be
completed. Such a mechanistic understanding will be useful to basic ecologists
as well as use in crops plants. The use of three different ecosystems for study
sites (subalpine, desert, tallgrass prairie) will broaden the applicability of
the results.
