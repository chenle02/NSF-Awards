9628363 Thurber This research is to investigate the relationship between
earthquakes, of magnitudes about 3.3 and above, to creep events on the Northern
Gabilans section of the San Andreas fault (SAF) in central California. There has
been an apparent temporal relationship between creep events and earthquakes on
the SAF in this area from April - November 1995; six successive times, magnitude
3.4 to 5.0 earthquakes were preceded by creep events in the region, with the
creep events occurring between 1.5 and 5 days before the earthquakes. The
statistical significance of this correlation will be evaluated as well as
related questions of the physics of earthquakes in creeping sections of the SAF.
The findings may be relevant to the Parkfield segment of the SAF and other
creeping fault segments. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
