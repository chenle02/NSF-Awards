The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve battery
health and predicting hazardous events related to battery performance. This will
have an important impact on consumer safety, sustainable energy development via
promoting reliable energy storage from solar and wind power, as well as in
critical applications related to healthcare. As the power density of the
batteries keeps increasing, consumers start seeing evidence of potentially
catastrophic battery failures, resulting in fires and explosions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to validate the preliminary results that sensor sensitivity,
dimensions and speed are sufficient to capture subtle changes in the battery's
signatures that are indicative of formation of SEI degradation of electrodes,
electrolytes and other battery components. It will be based on ex-situ and in-
situ measurements, modelling and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
