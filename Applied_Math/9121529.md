This is a project to study shock wave and other discontinuous solutions of the
equations that govern the flow of compressible fluids. For example, there are
still many unanswered questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms
play in the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time stability
of such waves. The principal investigator will use analytic and asymptotic tools
to answer these questions and related ones. In addition to the usual equations
of fluid dynamics the principal investigator will study systems of equations in
magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases, and the theory of shallow
water waves. Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain problems
in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected. For example, the
viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very small and yet it affects the
large-scale behavior of objects that move through the gas. The principal
investigator will study how such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the
formation and propagation of shock waves in gases. A shock wave is something
like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at high speeds.
