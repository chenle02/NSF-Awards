A recent study on hiring indicated that interviewers felt that 80 to 85 percent
of the job candidates they interviewed were poorly prepared. This has led to a
remarkable rise in career coaching and employment websites. At the present time,
the American unemployment rate is 6.2%, representing 9.7 million unemployed
persons currently seeking work. Extending beyond this figure, the
underemployment rate, or the overall rate of those seeking full-time work, is
estimated to be as high as 15.1% for the same period. The vast majority of these
job seekers lacks experience in branding themselves successfully and does not
possess an extensive professional network from which to learn about job
opportunities; this means that companies could easily be missing out on large
numbers of qualified candidates. The proposed technology provides digital tools
to help candidates hone their interviewing skills and professionalism for no
charge, while simultaneously providing companies with an inexpensive platform to
apply video analytics to the task of pre-screening candidates. This will allow
companies to gain the high-value information normally only obtainable at high
cost during a live interview for a much broader set of candidates.

This I-Corps team envisions a free service where job candidates are able to try
the proposed concept "Honest Signals" video analytics features before
subscribing and gaining access to a network of potential employers. Companies
who use the Honest Signals service for employee screening will have access both
to a network of users who have asked to have their videos shared with employers
and to custom analytics tools which will allow them to screen candidates based
on their own unique needs, thus streamlining human resources operations for
challenging hiring scenarios such as low-end/unskilled labor, retail associates,
and overseas labor. The proposed work will bring fundamentally new kinds of
information to job candidate assessment and will help pioneer automated methods
to exploit these new data sources. The use of these vastly richer forms of
information has the potential to transform the practice of hiring through the
use of innovative techniques drawn from social psychology.
