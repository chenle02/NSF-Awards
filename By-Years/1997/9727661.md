This research focuses on thermally and photochemically induced electron transfer
and electrophilic addition reactions in solid matrices. X-ray diffraction
analysis of donor-acceptor doped solid matrices will be used to correlate matrix
structure and its changes with dopant reactivity in order to develop a database
useful in achieving reaction control, enhancing charge separation, and
increasing reaction product lifetime. Correlating solid state structural changes
with observed reactivity offers graduate and postdoctoral students a unique
opportunity to become familiar with modern fast reaction and structural analysis
techniques. With this Renewal, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports Professor Kochi's studies of donor-acceptor reactivity in solid
matrices. Professor Kochi will focus his research on correlating the structural
changes that occur in the matrix with donor-acceptor reactivity and product
stability in order to develop the database needed to utilize the host matrix as
a means to control reactivity in the solid state. Graduate and postdoctoral
students carrying out the experiments will gain experience in modern fast
reaction techniques and x-ray structural analysis. / ¥╝Á_Á&gt;┤?┐¢ ╣_║/│¥ ╣&gt;
