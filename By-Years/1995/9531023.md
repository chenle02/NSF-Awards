9531023 Cornwall Research in theoretical physics will be done in virtually every
critical field of modern particle theory, including non- perturbative field
theory, lattice theory, supersymmetry, and string theory. Among the vital
physical issues the studies will help to resolve: How are nucleons and electrons
created and destroyed in the early universe? How does confinement of quarks in
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) really work? How does one go from a fundamental
description of nature (via 10-dimensional string theory) to an effective field-
theory or string theory description of our 4-dimensional world, properly
accounting for all the quantum-mechanical phenomena not visible at the classical
level? ***
