This award provides support for the continuation of an REU Site at the
Demographic Research Laboratory, Western Washington University. Ten
undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in "Applied Demographic
Research on Migration" for two months in the Summer, 1989. These students,
supervised by a project team of professional demographers, will focus their
research efforts on the study of migration profiles and analytical models.
Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and the County to County Migration Flow
files will serve as primary data sources for the research experiences for
undergraduates. The project provides undergraduates the opportunity to become
involved in the research process and to expand their research- related
competencies through an intensive, two-month research project.
