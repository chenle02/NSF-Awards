New evidence has been discovered recently that indicates the presence of
archaic Homo sapiens sapiens in southern Africa during the Middle Paleolithic.
This is many years before the appearance of modern human beings in Europe and
Asia. There are also indications that these prehistoric peoples had a more
developed foraging adaptation characterized by blade and burin stone tools than
had previously been expected. During this project, the researcher will analyze
the spatial organization of Middle Paleolithic hunters in the Zeekoe valley of
South Africa. She will analyze the changes in settlement pattern that occurred
during the last Interglacial and establish a time scale and sequence of changes
in stone tool design based on materials collected from the Driekoppen
Rockshelter and a series of open air sites. This project will enable the
researcher to establish which tool types are the most diagnostic time-markers
for this region and period. The establishment of regional chronologies is
becoming increasingly important in paleoarchaeology. Without good chronological
controls, little can be said about the development of modern human culture.
