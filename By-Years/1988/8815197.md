This grant will provide partial funding for a conference and workshop on the
topic of discrete element methods. This method allows for the solution of
dynamics problems involving multiply interacting deformable bodies, and allows
for fracture of the elements. Applications deal with such problems as
deformations in jointed rock masses, ice loading of offshore structures,
underground explosions, projectile penetration of objects, and underground waste
isolation. The technology is relatively new. This meeting provides an
opportunity for persons in such related fields as engineering, robotics,
computer technology, and applied mathematics, to interact in developing this
emerging technology.
