This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site at Cornell University
entitled, Protecting Water Quality: An REU Site for Research Experience of
Undergraduates in Environmental and Biological Engineering, under the direction
of Dr. Tammo S. Steenhuis. This 10-week summer program will provide 10
undergraduate students from Florida A&M University, Clark Atlanta University,
and the University of Puerto Rico with the opportunity to do research, with the
assistance and guidance of a faculty mentor, on various aspects of biological
and environmental engineering associated with protecting water quality. In
addition, the students will attend weekly seminars, make weekly presentations on
their work to their fellow REU students, and make a final technical presentation
in a department wide setting.
