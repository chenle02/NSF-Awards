&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and test an
umbrella-shaped microactuator for thrombus retrieval in stroke therapy. The
approach is to 1) design the actuator based on the properties of blood clots; 2)
fabricate the actuator using an integrated micro/nanofabrication technique; and
3) demonstrate and improve the functionality and reliability of the actuator
through in an in vitro vascular model. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
proposed actuator consists of active structures that are precisely controlled by
novel piezoelectric nanofibers. The functional principle of the proposed
actuator is unique in that it can provide a dynamic shear force on blood clots
in vascular arteries. This shear force can be fine-tuned to facilitate the
separation of the blood clot from the wall of the vascular artery due to the
shearing-thinning phenomenon, thus enabling complete retrieval while minimizing
the risk of damage to the arteries. This research will contribute new
fundamental knowledge in the areas of piezoelectric response of nanomaterials as
well as the mechanical behavior of blood clots.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Stroke
is the third leading cause of death in the U.S, with blockage of arterial blood
flow accounting for 83% of all strokes. If successful, this research will lead
to a safe and reliable stroke therapy providing recanalization of blocked
vascular arteries on the order of minutes. Educational materials based on this
research will be implemented in courses at different levels and in different
formats through various outreach programs and an existing NSF Nanotechnology
Undergraduate Education program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
