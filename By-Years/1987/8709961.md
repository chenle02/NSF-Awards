This is a career advancement award made through the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. The award will enable Dr. Stoecker to expand her research
capabilities by collaborating with Dr. C.M. Price, a plant molecular biologist
at Rutgers U. The research centers on the process whereby oligotrichous ciliates
sequester functional chloroplasts derived from ingested algae. This research
addresses the regulation and maintenance of these photosynthetic subcellular
organelles and the mechanisms of endosymbiosis.
