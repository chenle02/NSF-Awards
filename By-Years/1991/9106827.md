Transposable elements or TEs, which as examples of so- called "selfish DNA"
function to ensure their own survival and reproduction, exist (in multiple
copies) in the chromosomes of all organisms, often causing mutations. A portion
of the TE's own genome is devoted to directing its own reproduction
independently of the host's genes, thereby enabling it to spread through a host
organism's chromosomes quickly, even if the TE has a slightly detrimental
effect. Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is known to have a large number
of different kinds of transposable elements. When one such element, called hobo,
moves among chromosomes, it causes hybrid dysgenesis, which leads to sterility,
high mutation rates, chromosome breaks, and other deleterious effects, so its
persistence over millennia of evolution is quite puzzling. By comparing DNA
sequences of hobo elements in different populations and in other closely related
Drosophila species (D. simulans for example), it will be possible to learn about
the rate at which hobo elements have evolved, what selective forces have acted
to modify genetic function, and mode of TE transmission between species. In the
long run, studies of this type are expected to yield a fundamental understanding
of how organisms have dealt with "DNA parasites" over time, as well as how the
action of TEs, via mutation, have led to useful, novel gene functions.
