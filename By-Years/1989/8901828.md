In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Lipkowitz will study the molecular interactions
between optical analytes and chiral stationary phases. Using a new energy
partitioning algorithm, it will be determined which binding sites on the analyte
and which binding sites on the stationary phase are most responsible for
enantioselectivity. The results will allow development of chiral recognition
models. Further, the influence, if any, of the silica surface upon the
enantioselective binding process will be determined. The analyte's separability
factors will be obtained directly from the computed free energies of the
corresponding diastereomeric complexes.
