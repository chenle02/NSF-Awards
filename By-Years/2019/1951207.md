The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a high-resolution digital
fingertip: a soft, easy-to-use, and compact sensor that will provide human-like
tactile sensing. Such a sensor can be used to automate assembly tasks in next-
generation factories, enable smart objects to understand their tactile
environment, and equip scientists with a finger-like sensor for studying human
touch. Industries have been transformed by the digitization of our auditory and
visual worlds. A high-resolution digital fingertip will provide the mechanism
for digitizing the tactile world, leading to applications and technological
developments that will affect many industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a soft,
compact, and high-resolution tactile sensor based on elastomeric imaging
technology. To achieve the desired form factor while maintaining a large sensing
area, this project will develop novel optical and illumination configurations
more compact than designs using conventional optics. These developments will
demonstrate micro-scale imaging by a compact device and allow for modularity to
expand the sensing area. This effort will lead to new insight into illumination
design for shading-based 3D measurement, as well as optimizations to allow for
real-time tactile information. The system will be coupled with a software
development kit that provides real-time tactile information, including contact
locations, force, and shape. The software development kit will make the system
accessible to researchers and engineers from other disciplines, essential for
broad adoption. The high-resolution digital fingertip, together with the
software development kit, will enable new applications benefiting from tactile
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
