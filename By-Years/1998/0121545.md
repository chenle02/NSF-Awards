To facilitate research and education in Green's functions and their
applications, this project is developing an education-oriented digital library
focusing on Green's functions and their applications - the Green's Functions
Research and Education Enhancement Network (GREEN). GREEN will serve
undergraduate, graduate and professional education user communities and support
Green's functions research and application development in academia and industry.
The project is providing an integrated learning environment and set of digital
resources for science, mathematics, engineering and technology education (SMETE)
and is aggregating and organizing learning materials related to Green's
functions and their applications. This project has two primary objectives. The
first objective is to implement a solution for transforming and expanding the
existing digital resources of an on-line collaborative work group (the National
Institute of Standards and Technology Green's Functions Working Group or NIST-
GFWG) from a loose collection of useful digital resources to an NSDL-SMETE
digital library. The second objective is to enhance the educational value of the
proposed NSDL-SMETE library by applying an education-oriented metadata schema
(Learning Object Metadata schema from the IEEE Learning Technology Standards
Committee) to the collection and coupling that schema with a quality assurance
process and support tool that will provide for the continual evolution and
refinement of the collection materials during their lifecycle. Significant co-
funding of this project is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in
recognition of the emphasis on collections in the area of Green's functions
represented in this work.&lt;br/&gt;
