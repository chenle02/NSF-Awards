0504393 Harper The prevalence of pharmaceutical chemicals in aquatic
environments is increasing, especially as detection techniques improve. It is
known that existing wastewater treatment often cannot, and does not remove
pharmaceutical chemicals from waste streams. In the proposed project, the PIs
will test the degradation of four common pharmaceuticals in bioreactors and
relate the degradation to the microorganisms present and the reactor
configuration. The PIs hypothesize that ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and
heterotrophs work in concert to degrade pharmaceuticals and that bioreactor
configuration plays a role in defining the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals
and their transformation byproducts.
