This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University at Camden, New Jersey acquire a
SGI INDIGOZ and four SGI Indy R4600SC workstations. The research activity to be
supported includes investigations into the mechanism of doping in electronically
active polymers, the design and synthesis of quaternary inorganic compounds with
unusual electrical and magnetic properties, the mathematical modeling of
chemical reactions, the synthesis of membrane ion channel models, and the
analysis of environmental contaminants. A workstation network of fast, modern
computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and
visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing.
