This project studies several questions that have applications to cryptography.
One goal is to develop classical cryptosystems that are secure against quantum
computers. In particular, the project explores the security of some of the
recently proposed lattice-based systems. Another goal is to make systems that
are currently being used more efficient. The project aims to improve some of the
algorithms for constructing curves that can be used in cryptosystems. This
project will have implications for understanding which cryptosystems should be
used now or in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some lattice-based
cryptosystems were recently broken by use of quantum algorithms. The
investigators are exploring whether other lattice-based systems, such as systems
based on Ring-LWE, can be broken by quantum computers as well. The Ring-LWE
problem is important because a number of cryptographic constructions, including
fully homomorphic encryption, can be based on it. The PI and the co-PI are also
investigating other post-quantum key-exchange, signature and encryption schemes.
In a different direction, the investigators work on more efficient algorithms
for constructing curves that can be used in discrete-log based cryptosystems.
The investigators involve their graduate students in many parts of these
research projects. Through her involvement in various mentoring activities the
PI aims to increase the number of women who will pursue a career in science or
mathematics. She also teaches middle school and high school students about
cryptography.
