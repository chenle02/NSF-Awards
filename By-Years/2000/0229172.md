0229172 Huang The fate of antimicrobials in the environment will be
investigated. The oxidation of three classes of these materials (those
containing phenol, aniline or piperizine) with manganese, iron, and aluminum
oxides and with oxide-rich soils will be studied to identify susceptibility to
oxidation. Oxidation products, structure-activity relationships, reaction
kinetics, mechanisms and pathways will be elucidated.
