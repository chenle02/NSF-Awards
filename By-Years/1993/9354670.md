9354670 Vesilind The purpose of this project is to develop curriculum materials
on academic integrity that can be used in the introductory engineering course.
These materials will include a video that will consists of scenarios, acted out
by students, that describe ethical dilemmas commonly faced by students. The
accompanying written material will relate these scenarios to actual professional
engineering situations and help the instructor guide the discussion toward
engineering ethics. The material will allow the instructor to bridge the gap
between academic dishonesty and engineering ethics and to conduct a productive
discussion on professional engineering ethics.
