The Department of Psychology at UTA requests support to initiate a laboratory
course in Artificial Intelligence and to improve laboratories in Experimental
Psychology, Cognitive Processes, and Sensory and Perceptual Processes. Much
modern psychological research uses computers for measurement and control of
response and event times, and to generate stimulus displays. We currently use
Commodore C-64 computers in existing laboratory courses for these functions. The
C-64s were once cost-effective but are now obsolete, with modest memory and
limited graphics. We propose to replace them with IBM- compatible computers with
VGA monitors and the capacity to store programs, graphic and other displays,
data, and system and language files for the various courses. We propose to
purchase Micro Experimental Laboratory software and pcSTEREOSCOPE hard and
software to perform experiments, and to purchase LISP for the new Al laboratory
course. This will improve laboratory instruction by at least an order of
magnitude, enabling us to perform many experiments that cannot currently be
conducted. It will increase the diversity of laboratory courses and enable
students to conduct more significant and creative final projects in each course.
At non- classroom times the equipment will be used for independent study and
honors projects, providing enhanced research opportunities to our most able
students.
