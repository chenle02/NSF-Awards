This project involves a group of students working in peleontology, sedimentary
petrology, and geochemistry. The research project on environmental geochemistry
is especially topical, interesting and diverse enough to offer a range of
research choices to the students who work with him. It will deal with the
environmental geochemistry of surface waters of a river in Georgia and Alabama.
Other students may be involved with an additional project examining and
interpreting fossils to determine paleocurrent directions, faunal dispersion,
and evolutionary development.
