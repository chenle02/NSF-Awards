In this exploratory research, an integrated methodology involving
microstructure-level simulations and sustainability metrics will be developed to
evaluate the environmental benefits of simulated microstructure-level
improvements for a pilot steel component. This work represents the first phase
of a comprehensive research thrust to determine the potential environmental
benefits of microstructure-level simulations and to develop a design methodology
to optimize the microstructure of a steel component based on its life-cycle
environmental performance.

The key to the feasibility of this project is the ability to adapt
sustainability metrics into a useful decision-support tool for evaluating
environmental impacts of alternatives for the design of steel components, such
as the different steel microstructures with their associated manufacturing
processes and product characteristics for desired product performance.
Collaboration with Caterpillar will focus on both the technical research tasks
and the educational foundation for undergraduate student interns.
