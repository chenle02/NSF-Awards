This award supports continued use of the 0.6 meter telescope on the campus of
Wesleyan University to monitor stars that appear to have starspots and other
activity. Observations in the light of hydrogen-alpha will be improved to the
point where even the normally active, Sun-like stars can be monitored. The
observations will be extended to activity on cooler stars by monitoring the
calcium infrared triplet lines. Stars with large spots change their brightness
as they rotate the spots into and out of our view. Thus measurements of
brightness changes inform us directly of the rate at which the stars rotate. A
knowledge of stellar rotation is valuable because rotation is a major cause for
starspots and other activity similar to solar activity. This program has
emphasized observations of very young stars, especially the star T Tauri and
other members of the T Tauri class, because these show very strong activity. The
Sun may once have been similarly active.
