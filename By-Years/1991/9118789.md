The Posterior Sex Comb (Psc) gene of Drosophila is a pleiotropic developmental
regulatory gene. As a member of the Polycomb group of genes it is essential for
the maintenance of segment specific embryonic determination. We have cloned and
sequenced this gene and found that it shares a 200 amino acid domain with the
neighboring Suppressor Two of zeste (Su(z)2) gene and the recently described
murine bmi-1 oncogene. Using immunostaining of polytene chromosomes we have
found that the Psc protein is a locus specific chromosomal protein that is found
at the location of a number of expected target genes. We will use this
chromosome staining assay and germ line transformation to map the target DNA
sequences that are responsible for the chromosomal binding site and we will
determine if the Psc protein can directly bind to these sequences in vitro. We
will attempt to determine the function of the protein domain shared with Su(z)2
and bmi-1 using in vitro mutagenesis and chimeric genes combined with assays for
mutant rescue, chromosomal binding, and if possible DNA binding in vitro. We
will also continue our analysis of the developmental function of Psc. We will
use antibody staining and lacz expression from enhancer traps in embryos that
lack both maternal and zygotic Psc function to determine if it is the initiation
or maintenance of gene expression patterns that is effected in several of the
developmental pathways that are perturbed by a lack of Psc function.***//
