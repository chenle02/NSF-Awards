This grant will provide partial support of a conference entitled, "Outstanding
Problems in Solar System Plasma Physics: New Theory and Instrumentation." The
support is for organizational and clerical expenses, on-site logistical
expenses, student travel grants and advertising costs. The purpose of the
conference is to examine outstanding questions in solar system plasma physics
and to discuss the current and future role of theory and experiment in answering
them. As such this is an important element in the continuing task of defining
new programs, theory and instrumentation under the National Solar Terrestrial
Program (NSTP).
