Through this project a speech science laboratory for undergraduate students is
being developed. Such a laboratory encourages the development of scientific
problem solving through integration of hands-on experiences with basic
undergraduate coursework related to acoustic and physiologic aspects of speech.
Four computerized speech laboratories are being used by students to examine
acoustic characteristics of speech. Three computerized work stations supporting
a number of different pieces of equipment are being used to examine various
physiologic aspects of speech production. Laboratory exercises are being
designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn about the various
processes of speech as well as the relationships between different physiologic
processes and the acoustic signal. This type of hands-on experimentation serves
the students well as they move into graduate education and throughout their
professional careers.
