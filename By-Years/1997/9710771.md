This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of
Chemistry provides partial support to enable the participation of eight to ten
assistant professors and a similar number of ACS Division of Analytical
Chemistry graduate student award winners in the 1997 Gordon Research Conference
on Analytical Chemistry. This conference is entitled `Measurement Problems and
Tools Arising from Combinatorial Synthesis` and it focuses on the current and
emerging problems of doing analytical chemistry on enormous numbers of small
samples produced by this new approach to chemistry. Much of the effort in this
area is presently resident in small venture capital companies and this
conference would expose bright, young analytical chemists from academe to the
opportunities in combinatorial chemistry. This award enables participation of
young analytical faculty and graduate students in the 1997 Gordon Research
Conference on Analytical Chemistry. The focus is on analytical problems arising
in the area of combinatorial synthesis and the consequent explosive growth in
the need for fast, sensitive, and selective analysis of many, small samples.
