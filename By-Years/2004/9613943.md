9613943 Soreghan The history of late Paleozoic climate is of great interest to
both (paleo) climatologists and geologists. Part of this interest derives from
curiosity in Pangea's unique geography and correspondingly unique climate.
Another part derives from a more applied interest: Upper Paleozoic strata of
Pangea house significant resources. Most recent studies cite glacioeustasy as
the first-order control on upper Paleozoic strata, but intracyclic climate
change likely accompanied late Paleozoic glacioeustasy. Currently, the evidence
for and character of this high-frequency climate change is poorly constrained.
The objective of this research is to test the feasibility of obtaining high-
resolution paleoclimatic data from upper Paleozoic loessite-paleosol sequences
using an integrated paleomagnetic-sedimentologic approach. Recent research on
Cenozoic loess-paleosol sequences indicates that variations in magnetic
susceptibility correlate with changes in paleoclimate. To investigate the
application of this paleomagnetic approach to the Paleozoic, magnetic
susceptibility will be measured through an upper Paleozoic loessite-paleosol
sequence located in western Pangea (Ancestral Rocky Mountains). Patterns in
magnetic susceptibility will be integrated with sedimentologic observations to
identify paleoclimatic fluctuations. Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses
will be performed to (1) characterize the magnetization and (2) assess possible
remagnetization. If successful, this approach will provide data on the
paleoclimate of low-latitude western Pangea that can be used to address
fundamental and applied research questions.
