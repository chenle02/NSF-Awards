9423564 Weiss The Eighteenth Fungal Genetics Conference, is being held at the
Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 21-26, 1995.
Approximately 500 scientists and students from around the world will attend. The
conference is focused on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell
biology of filamentous fungi. The meeting consists of six plenary sessions,
three poster sessions, informal discussions, and a day devoted to concurrent
workshops in specialized areas. Topics covered are signal transduction, gene
expression and genome structure, sexual and asexual reproduction, cell biology
and morphogenesis, and plant and animal fungal pathogenesis. Strong emphasis is
placed on the participation of scientists and students from underrepresented
groups. %%% Fungal genetics is important to a number of areas of biotechnology,
such as bioremediation and plant pathology. The semiannual Fungal Genetics
Conference provides a means for scientists studying a number of different fungi
to exchange ideas and information. For example, there has been an extraordinary
increase in sophistication of the research approaches used by plant pathologists
due, in part, to their exchanges with the basic research community at these
conferences. ***
