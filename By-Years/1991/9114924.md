A laboratory plasma experiment is proposed to investigate the fundamental
topology of magnetic reconnection regions and associated magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) phenomena. Reconnection is well established as a fundamental process of
importance to understanding the geospace environment, from magnetospheric
substorms and the magnetopause to solar flares. The proposed experiment will
test whether reconnection is a laminar two- dimensional process, the model of
prevailing theories, or whether three-dimensional structures will spontaneously
arise. A very flexible double-spheromak configuration is proposed with six
different operating regimes that should have quite different flow patterns, as
well as variations in the initial configuration from two-dimensional (with
toroidal symmetry) to fully three- dimensional. A novel element in reconnection
physics that will be tested is the generation of flows along the neutral-line
direction which arise for counter-helicity reconnection but not for co-
helicity. Institutional support for theoretical research will simulate merging
spheromaks with three-dimensional resistive MHD codes and these simulation
results will be checked against the laboratory results.
