PI: Evans DMS-9424342 Evans will continue his research on a variety of questions
from nonlinear differential equations, mostly variational problems having
geometric or physical origin. The primary proposed new efforts include
investigations of new PDE methods for designing optimal Monge-Kantorovich mass
transfer schemes, flat spots on surfaces evolving under Gauss curvature flow,
the possible regularity of "optimal" Lipschitz extensions, and time evolutions
generated by natural quasiconvex energy functionals. Partial differential
equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role
of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to
provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may
include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In
addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and
estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
