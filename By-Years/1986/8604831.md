The PI will set up a multi-probe experimental approach to the study of the
metal-semiconductor interface formation in GaAs (100) and other III-V compound
semiconductors, with the goal of simultaneously determining structural (both
electronic and morphoogical) and electrical transport properties of the
interface under study. In this way it will be possible to correlate the
information about the Schottky barrier obtained by the local probes
(photoelectron spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation) with that obtained by
macroscopic probes (I-V and C-V measurements) in situ, without disturbing the
sample. Such data will be of crucial importance in evaluating which of the
theories put forward recently best describes the Schottky barrier, both during
its formation and in the final stages of the extended interface. Also, they will
have a direct relevance in the technology of GaAs processing by clarifying which
of the interface structural parameters has a direct and verifiable influence on
the device performances, i.e., on its transport properties.
