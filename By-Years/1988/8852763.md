This award to Florida International University's Department of Geology is made
in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire an image analysis system for the purpose of
enhancing education and research in the Department's undergraduate training
programs. The University is committed to providing fifty percent matching funds
for this acquisition. The equipment will be used in the Department's microscopy
laboratory exercises in courses in mineralogy, petrology and paleontology. The
image analysis system will also be used in the Department's undergraduate
research program to enhance modal analysis of rocks, analysis of deformation
fabrics in metamorphosed rocks, and morphological analysis of evolution in
microfossils.
