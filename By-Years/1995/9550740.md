The four small, rural Virginia counties of Surry, Sussex, King and Queen, and
Charles City, have formed a consortium identified as Project SUCCESS. This
consortium was organized to address the historical pattern of academic under-
achievement of its public school students, especially minorities. The project's
academic focus is science and mathematics. The primary intervention strategies
will be in the following categories: 1) professional development for teachers;
2) curriculum revision; 3) student enrichment; 4) parental involvement; and 5)
community involvement. It is to be noted that the objectives and activities
described for Project SUCCESS have been developed in consideration of Virginia's
Statewide Systemic Initiative in science and mathematics, VQUEST (see Appendix A
for a further explanation of this relationship to VQUEST). This grant
application is being submitted to request support for the staff development and
student enrichment aspects of the consortium plan. Activities in these
categories will include summer programs for teachers and students, student
Saturday Academies during the academic year, informal education experiences,
parent and community seminars on the importance of science and mathematics for
today's citizens, increase participation of teachers in professional science and
mathematics organizations, more student participation in science fairs,
workshops to increase the types of science and mathematics assessment methods
used internships, and other interactions between students and professionals to
increase student awareness of careers in science, mathematics and relate fields.
Support is being sought to continue staff development activities focused on
summer "Laboratory Institute" for three additional years. ***
