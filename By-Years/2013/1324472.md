The rights mobilization literature suggests that a high risk of harm generally
inhibits social movement activism, yet this does not appear to be the case for
undocumented youth who have mobilized for social change. To understand
theoretically what has allowed these youth to organize despite the threats they
confront, this research explores the social movement activism of undocumented
Asian and Latina/o youth advocating for immigration reform. A theoretic model of
legal mobilization is proposed and tested based on data gathered from in-depth
interviews and participant observation of three community-based organizations
over a period of two years. Recent developments in the national landscape
regarding immigration and immigrant rights point to the need for an
understanding of the inner workings of legal mobilization among members of
marginalized populations, and how such activism does or does not relate to
conventional understandings of mobilization among members of similarly situated
groups.
