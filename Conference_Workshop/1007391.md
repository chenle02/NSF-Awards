The discovery of Oded Schramm's Stocastic-Loewner-Equation (SLE), which is also
referred to as Schramm-Loewner-Evolution, in 1999 led to an enormous activity in
probability theory, statistical physics, and conformal mapping. SLE gave
mathematicians a tool to verify numerous predictions from theoretical
physics,such as Mandelbrots conjecture. At the same time, it gave physicists a
deeper understanding of interfaces that appear in critical two-dimensional
lattice models, such as self-avoiding walks. An international conference
"Conformal maps from probability and physics", centered around theses
developments,will be held in Ascona, Switzerland, May 23-28, 2010. The proposal
requests partial travel support for U.S. participants to attend thismeeting. The
intellectual merit of the proposal lies in the discovery of connections between
related but different fields of mathematics and physics.

Funds will be used with priority to support the participation of researchers
without current NSF support, in particular graduate students and junior faculty.
The broader impact consists of the exchange of ideas of researchers from various
disciplines, the training of graduate and post-graduate students, and the
strengthening across continents of research ties between loosely connected
groups.
