Upper division laboratory experiments are developed for the areas of electron
microscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy and superconductivity in which advanced
undergraduates will use state-of-the art laboratory equipment. In addition to
the novel experience for the undergraduate participants, these experiments will
promote undergraduate physics at ASU, and stimulate interest in physics among
the high school community.
