The equipment purchased through this project was for a laboratory program
associated with a course designed for students who are not majoring in the
natural sciences. The course, "Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to
Modern Forensic Science", is a one semester course designed to teach the
fundamentals of forensic science ranging from atomic absorption spectra and
paint analysis to infrared spectroscopy and drug analysis to electrophoresis and
DNA analysis. The funds were used to purchase equipment for six experiments. (1)
Gas chromatography is being used to determine the concentration of alcohol in
blood, to determine the identity of accelerants used in arson and to
characterize a sample containing a mixture of drugs. (2) High pressure liquid
chromatography is being used to separate and identify drugs in suspect samples.
(3) The drugs present in samples separated by high pressure liquid
chromatography are being identified by infrared spectroscopy. (4) DNA profiles
for suspect identification are being obtained by using restriction enzymes and
electrophoresis equipment and power supplies. (5) Visible spectrometers are
being employed for determining the blood and breath levels of alcohol. These
experiment have supplemented a series of experiments previously in place, on a
limited basis, with phenomenal success. The various pieces of equipment acquired
for the forensic science laboratory are also used in the organic and
biochemistry laboratories. A "crime lab" equipped so that the above experiments
can be conducted has created an environment to stimulate the interest of the
traditional nonscience majors. It has made the study of chemistry more
interesting, more challenging and more rewarding. The institution contributed to
this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
