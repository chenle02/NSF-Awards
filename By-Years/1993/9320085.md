9320085 HENSLER This workshop will bring together a number of scholars from
different disciplines, including economists, social scientists, and academic
lawyers, to develop a research initiative on the civil justice system. The
workshop will use problems having to do with tort litigation as a point of
departure for considering a larger set of empirical questions about the role of
the civil justice system in our society. Current controversies over tort
litigation stem from claims that tort liability is a barrier to technological
innovation, that malpractice suits are a major cause of increased costs in the
health care system, and that lawyers are simply lining their pockets at the
expense of insurance companies, consumers, and the overall economy rather than
serving the interests of justice. Counter claims hold that the system serves the
powerless and the ordinary citizen who has suffered harm. This side of the
debate argues that the critics have no empirical grounds for their complaints.
Knowledgeable social scientists are concerned that the debate is not based on
valid empirical data, but rather on numbers generated by junk science. This
workshop will focus on policy issues, data sources, methodological problems, and
broader theoretical questions. Its product will be a research agenda on civil
justice for the Law and Social Science Program. ***
