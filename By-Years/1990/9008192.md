Rigorous theoretical methods and simulation procedures will be used to study
the details of polymer chain statistics due to entanglements, interpenetration
by another chain, and the proximity of an interacting surface. A detailed study
of the collective density fluctuations in a solution of semiflexible chains will
be undertaken to better understand the onset of the isotropic-liquid crystalline
phase transition as a function of chain stiffness. A study of defects in random
and model networks will be undertaken, as well as a study of the dynamic
properties of gels.
