9404097 Bao The project involves further work on differential-geometric problems
on Finsler spaces using a certain torsion-free connection. It is proposed to
establish a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type of theorem for a large class of such spaces.
This research may have potential applications to topics in relativity theory
where such structures arise. ***
