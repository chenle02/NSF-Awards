Proposal DMS-0347033

Title: CAREER-On the geometry of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds

P.I.: Zhiqin Lu (University of California, Irvine)

ABSTRACT

The proposer will study the Szego kernel of certain unit circle bundle. The
study of this is closely related to the stability of manifold. It is now
believed that the stability of manifold is the key concept in solving the
Kaehler-Einstein equation on Fano manifolds. The other problem the proposer will
work on concerns the geometry of Calabi-Yau moduli. In particular, the BCOV
torsion on the Calabi-Yau moduli may play a key role in verifying some
predictions in Mirror Symmetry. The proposer will participate in various
programs in education as well as various activities to improve the efficiency of
education.

The proposer is working on some key problems in geometry which are not only
important to mathematics, but also important to other sciences like physics. For
example, general relativity is the the geometric theory of gravity. One of the
application of the proposer's work is related to the number of "allowable"
Universes. The proposer's work may lead to the proof of the fact that the number
of the Universes is finite. On the other hand, The proposer will participate the
integrated research and education activities that will promote the education
level of the nation.
