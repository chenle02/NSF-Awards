This new course combines concepts from the students' prior course work and
introduces them to a broad range of modern design and testing techniques for
advanced materials. Fundamental engineering concepts are followed immediately
with engineering problem-solving. A series of lab sessions have been formulated,
each involving a task directed toward the reverse-engineering, evaluation, and
improvement of a sample, manufactured mechanical product. Design and manufacture
is approached as parallel rather than sequential tasks. The course also enhances
learning by increasing the level of interaction on various levels. The course is
arranged in a way which emphasizes discussion and oral examination rather than
lecture. The instructor spends most of his/her time interacting with small
groups of students rather than the entire class. The students are required to
interact amongst each other in the organization and preparation of the lab
reports. Unlike more traditional courses, grading will not be based strictly
upon knowledge level. Student interest in the material will be stimulated
because the proposed lab sessions have both a sequence and a unifying context
which give the learning experience continuity. The course will give the students
exposure to more modern and advanced mechanical testing techniques, engineering
materials, and approaches to the design/manufacturing interaction than they
currently receive.
