INT 9406779 Gordon Technical Description: This project provides partial support
for Brent Gordon, University of Oklahoma to be a guest scientist for four months
at the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR), School of Mathematics,
Bombay and two months at the Mehta Research Institute, Allahabad, India. His
research area is arithmetic algebraic geometry. The specific problems to be
investigated focus on questions about algebraic cycles in algebraic-geometric
varieties associated with automorphic forms. One goal of the research is to
determine the Hodge structure, and verify the Hodge conjecture, for particular
special constituents of these varieties. A second goal is to analyze and
understand the groups of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence for some
Kuga-Shimura varieties. Scope: This project will be very beneficial to Prof.
Gordon's research by providing vital contact for an extended period with some
exceptional Indian theorists with whom he has had limited contact at meetings
and via e-mail. He anticipates significant interaction with two groups at TIFR
and one group at the new Mehta Research Institute having common interests and
expects that after the necessary incubation time specific plans for
collaborations will develop. Indian scientists excel in theoretical mathematics
and many mutual benefits may be expected to result from the interaction. Project
corresponds with INT guidelines by supporting a new activity that benefits a
U.S. scientist. ***
