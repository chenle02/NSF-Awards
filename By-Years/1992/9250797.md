Laboratory materials are being developed which allow students to use the
computers and calculators as a classroom tool for exploration, visualization,
and computation. This institution has a heavy enrollment in traditional
mathematics courses below the level of calculus as well as in courses designed
to support other majors, such as business and liberal arts. For the traditional
precalculus sequence, classroom sets of graphing calculators are being used to
assist students in developing visualization skills and to better prepare them
for calculus. For the service courses, a computer classroom with appropriate
software allows students to focus on concepts and exploration rather than
manipulation and arithmetic detail.
