This grant provides funding for equipment upgrades for the Econometrics
Laboratory (EML) at the University of California, Berkeley, including a 660GB
fiber channel disk tray for its fileserver, and a five-unit tape library for
backups. The disk tray will increase the storage capacity of the EML, and
provides larger, faster disks for improved I/O as well as RAID performance and
fail-safe capability. The new removable media technology will remain
synchronized with the new disk technology. The EML provides a state-of-the-art
computational environment for economic research, particularly in compute-
intensive methods and the analysis of very large datasets. Extending its disk
storage and backup capabilities provides key resources that are urgently needed
by applied econometrics faculty investigators and graduate dissertation
students.
