The three year New Jersey Institute of Technology Summer Science Camp serves
seventy-eight seventh grade, low income, educationally disadvantaged African-
American and Hispanic students from Newark public schools. The non-residential
program is comprised of a four-week summer component with eight follow-up
sessions. Instruction is provided in science and math, based on the theme of
Marine Science, oral and written communication skills, as well as four field
trips to various marine science locations in New Jersey. In addition, students
receive academic, financial and career counseling and are exposed to formal and
informal interaction with minority and women professors and students already
engaged in science based careers. Parents/guardians are involved throughout the
program. Project partners include: the Newark Board of Education, the New Jersey
Marine Science Consortium and the Protestant Community Center, Inc, a community
based parent organization. Follow-up activities will be carried out during each
academic year which provide additional math/science opportunities, academic and
career counseling, and monitoring of student progress.
