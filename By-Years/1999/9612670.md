9706393 This award is for a research symposium on the impact of information
technology on disaster mitigation and management. The symposium will examine the
current state of information technology in disaster management practice and
identify possible ways to improve or increase interorganizational and
interjurisdictional performance through appropriate uses and new applications of
such technology. Specific objectives of the symposium include a demonstration of
the application of a prototype distributed, intelligent, spatial information
system to a set of simulated problems in disaster mitigation and response, and
the development of a set of recommendations for action regarding the integration
of information technology into disaster mitigation and management practice.
Symposium participants will include both researchers and practitioners. ***
