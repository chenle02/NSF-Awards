The goal of this research project is to develop new algorithms and systems for
effectively discovering knowledge in unstructured textual data. The approach
first uses trained information extraction systems to obtain structured data from
unstructured natural-language documents or web pages, and then applies rule
induction methods to discover interesting patterns in this extracted data. Since
data automatically extracted from text is noisy, heterogeneous, and non-
standardized, the project studies two approaches to effectively mining extracted
data. First, methods are developed for inducing rules that only partially match
extracted text. Second, methods are developed that automatically cluster noisy
variations of strings into standardized data items prior to mining. Algorithms
are also developed for using discovered knowledge to further improve the
accuracy of information extraction. Developed methods are being evaluated on
large text corpora in business, medicine, science, and technology. The research
will contribute to the development of technology capable of automatically
discovering significant scientific, commercial, and industrial knowledge from
the ever-growing supply of textual electronic information.
