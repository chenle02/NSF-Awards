This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and the
subfield of molecular beam surface dynamics. Professor W. Henry Weinberg of the
University of California at Santa Barbara will interface a Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer to a molecular beam surface scattering experimental
chamber. This device will be used to study the rates and mechanisms of simple
reactions on well characterized surfaces of metals. The results of this research
will serve to explain the details of metal surface chemistry in catalytic
reactions involving oxidation of carbon. In this program the reflection
absorption infrared measurement will complement ongoing spectroscopy and
desorption studies of the reactions of ethylene and carbon monoxide on iridium
(110), ruthenium (001) and platinum (110) surfaces.
