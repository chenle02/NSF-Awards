Better numerical algorithms are needed to effectively utilize the current and
next generation parallel supercomputers. The numerical algorithms must not be
limited in application but must efficiently solve the most challenging
scientific and engineering problems. Proposed is an Improved Element-by-Element
(IEBE) algorithm applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems. The
algorithm encompasses the advantages of existing EBE methods and expands the
algorithm capability by utilizing direct solution techniques, a generalized
geometry formulation, and unrestricted material properties and equation
formulation. The research will derive, validate, and demonstrate the algorithm
and benchmark the performance. The principal investigator and consultant
together provide expertise in CFD and algorithm development. The research could
dramatically impact the way in which CFD and other application problems are
performed in parallel computer environments by industry and government.
