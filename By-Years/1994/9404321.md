With this award the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) has
entered into a three year cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. This agreement will facilitate the
continuing development, promotion, and implementation of the Arctic System
Science (ARCSS) Program, with special emphasis on integrating and synthesizing
its various parts, and to broaden ARCSS so that it involves other presently
neglected areas such as the human aspect of global change. ARCUS will work to
increase communication among arctic researchers, academic institutions, federal
agencies, and logistical field facilities and projects; to inform policy-makers,
funding sources (federal agencies, private foundations, corporate bodies), and
educators on the need, opportunities, and benefits in arctic research; and to
improve offerings and programs in arctic science education. ARCUS will
facilitate an Arctic Week, combining several of these activities to increase
participation of all interested arctic groups and individuals, to foster
interdisciplinary exchanges and to make the most effective use of available
resources.
