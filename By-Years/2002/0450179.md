This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will advance the
development of the high frequency pulse/pulse reverse electrodeposition process
for the catalyzation of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) for polymer
electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The Phase II objectives/research tasks
include: (1) fabrication and testing of a Betascale reel-to-reel manufacturing
line which will be used to catalyze full-size gas diffusion electrodes; (2)
optimization of the electrode structure and the deposition process on full size
gas diffusion electrodes; and, (3) characterization of the MEA performance and
relationship to the catalyst size and location and deposition process
parameters. The anticipated results of the Phase II program are a marketable
manufacturing process in the form of a Beta-scale reel-to-reel manufacturing
line incorporating the pulse/pulse reverse catalyzation process.

This STTR Phase II project addresses the needs of the emerging fuel cell
industry, enabling the cost-effective manufacture of a critical component of PEM
fuel cells. More specifically, this process enables production of MEAs with
specific cost-performance targets for a range of applications. This
product/process technology is enabling to PEM fuel cells for the automotive,
portable and stationary power markets.
