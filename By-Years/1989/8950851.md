The Department of Earth Science, University of Northern Iowa, will expand and
broaden opportunities for undergraduate projects and research by the acquisition
of equipment for fluorescence microscopy. Although widely used in the biological
and medical fields, fluorescence microscopy has received only limited use in the
geosciences. Recent studies, however, document the value of fluorescence
microscopy in recognizing depositional textures in dolomitized and
recrystallized carbonate rocks. Acquisition of a research-quality petrographic
microscope, equipped for fluorescence studies and photography, will open up new
fields of investigation at the institution. Undergraduate students will be able
to systematically tackle questions dealing with the environment of deposition of
the dolomitized strata which are so abundant in the state. Geology students
enrolled in stratigraphy and sedimentation will be introduced to fluorescence
microscopy. Subsequently, interested students will utilize fluorescence
microscopy further in undergraduate research projects designed to decipher the
depositional history of dolomitized strata. Undergraduate research is a
requirement for the Bachelor of Science degree. In addition, a number of
Bachelor of Arts majors select undergraduate research as an elective in their
programs. The University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
