A collaboration between the Engineering and Education programs at Hope College
will be established through this planning grant. The collaboration will develop
a model course to provide an element of engineering in the education of pre-
service teachers and a model summer workshop for in-service teachers. Through
the planning grant, a case study of this established course will be conducted
using the principles of learning and the recommendations outlined in the
National Research Council's: "How People Learn" and the .Standards for
Technological Literacy,. established by the International Technology Education.
The course examines the scientific principles underlying modern consumer
technological devices and features hands-on laboratory projects such as taking
apart a car engine and building a speaker and amplifier. Distinguishing features
of this course are study of a representative sample of familiar technological
devices, construction by students of working devices, and writing assignments on
technological topics.
