This project proposes a technological-economic-organizational analysis of the
barriers preventing the substitution of cellulosic ethanol from replacing
gasoline as a fuel for automobiles and light trucks in the United States. They
propose to investigate the amount of ethanol that could be produced in the US
and its cost of production, the circumstances under which it might displace
gasoline as a motor fuel, and the technological, economic, and organizational
barriers to ethanol use. Even if cellulosic ethanol were more attractive than
gasoline as a motor fuel, hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure are
presently dedicated to gasoline use. Enormous inertia together with specific
technological, economic and organizational barriers would be expected to hamper
the transition to ethanol. Building on prior work on alternative automobile
fuels and working relationships with General Motors, Ford, Texaco, ExxonMobil
and BP Amoco, the researchers will examine the conditions under which ethanol
might become a more attractive fuel, and the organizational and other barriers
to its adoption.
