9702443 Nied This research project is to develop design principles for
integrating design and manufacture of load bearing structural components
fabricated from thermoplastic materials. The mechanism for achieving this plan
is the design and forming of advanced structural parts from thermoplastic
materials using blow molding and thermoforming processes. The outcomes of this
study could significantly improve the linkage between processing mechanics,
material behavior, and structural performance of the load bearing applications.
The research activities have balanced theory and experiments to adequately
characterize the process physics, developing process simulation models, and the
necessary testing techniques to measure the relevant polymer materials
properties that are uniquely required for thermoforming and blow molding process
simulation. The research activities will be balanced by an education plan to
improve quality of graduate and undergraduate education at Lehigh University.
