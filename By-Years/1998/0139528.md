&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to the University of Colorado, Denver to
host the American Economics Association Summer Training Program. A primary goal
of this program is to increase the number of minorities in the economics
profession. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is a nine-
week program for 15 student participants aimed at strengthening their analytic
skills and to demonstrate the relevance and excitement of economics as a
profession. The program will combine hands-on empirical research with honors-
level coursework in economic theory, econometric methods, and mathematical
economics. Weekly workshops and seminars by outside speakers will familiarize
students with policy issues and career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
