The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative algorithm which can
be used to obtain maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates in situations where a direct
attack on the problem fails. In this research the PI will study the application
of the EM algorithm to the problem of optimal decoding of trellis coded
modulation signals in the presence of white Gaussian noise and random
parameters. Specifically, the work will focus on two channels: the random phase
channel and the random timing error channel. For each of these channels, the
optimum receiver processing will be described, as well as its performance using
existing trellis codes; further the implications of the optimal processing on
the coding problem will be addressed.
