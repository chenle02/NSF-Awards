The main aim of this project is to complete the formulation of effective
descriptions of quantum systems in canonical language. Especially the field of
canonical quantum gravity (including loop quantum gravity) requires a more
general setting than standard effective actions, allowing for instance for an
enlarged gauge structure, general covariance and the associated freedom to
change the time variable, and a non-Gaussian or non-vacuum state as expansion
basis. Compared to existing formulations, the major extension provided by work
in the project will lead to a canonical version of effective quantum field
theory. Applications will include an analysis of renormalization in canonical
quantum gravity, comparisons with existing results in effective quantum gravity
to check the low-energy limit of loop quantum gravity, as well as structure
formation in the early universe and possible restrictions on initial states.

Quantum gravity is expected to be important at high energy density, for instance
in the early universe during or just after the big-bang. In such regimes, space-
time itself, and not just matter in space-time, is described by a wave function
subject to quantum uncertainty and fluctuations. For several conceptual and
technical reasons, it is difficult to evaluate such wave functions for potential
physical observations, but as in particle physics, their implications can often
be approximated and derived using effective equations. Standard methods of
particle physics are not directly applicable to quantum gravity, in which the
classical structure of space-time is no longer available. This project aims to
complete the setting of effective equations suitable for quantum gravity, a
process in which several questions of mathematical interest (such as Poisson
geometry and algebraic structures) will be touched as well. It will contribute
to physical cosmology by providing new scenarios and equations for structure
formation in the early universe that include quantum-gravity effects.
