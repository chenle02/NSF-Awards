0108875&lt;br/&gt;Donovan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landscapes (the collection of
habitats in a given area) have been dramatically altered in North America in
recent decades, and can affect the ecology and genetic structure of species in a
variety of ways. The proposed research seeks to understand how landscape
fragmentation affects demographic and genetic parameters of a migratory
songbird, the black-throated blue warbler. Information on birth, death,
immigration, and emigration rates will be collected on 9 forest patches in
Vermont that vary in level of landscape fragmentation. Birds will be captured in
nets, aged, sexed, and released, and then followed over the course of 2 years to
estimate the vital rates across sites. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Because
fragmentation of continuous, natural landscapes is one of the most important
factors contributing to the loss of biological diversity, it is a key issue in
biological conservation. The question of how landscape fragmentation affects the
demography and evolution of vertebrate populations is of extreme interest to
land management agencies that are mandated to maintain viable populations of
native species. The combined demographic and genetic approaches will yield
insights into this important issue. Two graduate and 10 undergraduate students
will gain educational and field training at the University of Vermont and
Washington State University.&lt;br/&gt;
