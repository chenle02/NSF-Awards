9614782 Langmuir Convergent plate margins play a key role in the solid earth
geochemical cycle, as the setting where new continental crust is created and
oceanic lithosphere is recycled into the mantle. The petrogenetic processes
involved in the origin of magmas in oceanic arcs, where the overlying crust is
thin, are better understood than those in continental arcs where the overlying
crust is much thicker. The primary goal of this proposal will be to identify the
processes responsible for the thick crust geochemical signature that is often
seen in convergent plate margin magmatism. It is proposed to use the eastern
Mexican volcanic belt as a test locality because the lavas in this continental
arc have thick crust characteristics and contain a large number and range of
mafic compositions. The analytical approach will include high-precision trace
element and isotope analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb and He) of the mafic rocks in order to
obtain the combination of geochemical parameters that are most sensitive to the
addition of subducted sediments, melting of the mantle wedge and crustal
processing. This approach will hopefully allow the distinction between the
various hypotheses currently invoked for the thick crust signature in
continental arcs.
