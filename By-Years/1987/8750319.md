Although the curriculum currently offers lecture courses in Biochemistry,
Molecular Genetics, and Cell Physiology, laboratory work is available only in
Cell Physiology. Given the tremendous advances in research that are occurring in
Biological Chemistry today, this situation leaves Biology and Chemistry majors
relatively unprepared for advanced work (including undergraduate research
projects) in these areas. This project is remedying the situation by supplying
equipment for a Gene Expression Laboratory course in the Biology Department, and
for new laboratory exercises associated with the current Biochemistry course in
the Chemistry Department. In the former course, students are learning methods
for the study of proteins, RNA and DNA at the molecular level. In Biochemistry,
a new series of experiments involving enzyme functions, lipid and carbohydrate
analyses, and protein purification are being added to the lab. The collective
experience of these courses are allowing students to more fully utilize their
talents as they prepare for scientific careers.
