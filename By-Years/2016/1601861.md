Number theory is a branch of mathematics with a history of over two thousand
years, but it remains a vibrant subject today, linking several different
mathematical fields and physics. Much recent progress in the subject has come
from exploring links of number theory with geometry and algebra. This research
project will study extended classifying spaces of arithmetic and analytic
objects that allow degenerations, and apply the results to number theory. The
project involves five graduate students in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies mixed Hodge structures,
mixed p-adic Hodge structures, Drinfeld modules, and motives over number fields.
The investigator intends to apply prior results on extended classifying spaces
to the study of Iwasawa theory, the Sharifi conjectures, asymptotic behaviors of
heights, regulators, and height pairings of motives over number fields, and
degeneration of Hodge metrics and their p-adic Hodge versions. This research
project will develop new interactions between different areas of mathematics and
science, including arithmetic, physics, harmonic analysis, and representation
theory. The study of extended classifying spaces of Drinfeld modules will have
applications to Langlands correspondences for function fields, and degenerations
of Hodge structures are related to physics.
