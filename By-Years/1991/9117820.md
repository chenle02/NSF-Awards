The tectonic history of New England includes several paleozoic orogenies that
involved collision and accretion of island arc fragments and continental blocks.
Because of this tectonic complexity, stratigraphic and structural correlations
are difficult and despite extensive study, several key relationships are
equivocal. Recent work has shown that a volcanic unit thought to be a remnant of
an island arc that collided with North America during the Taconic contains rocks
of two distinctly different ages - Silurian and Cambrian. This RUI project will
restudy this unit by mapping and radiometric age dating in order to resolve the
stratigraphic position of the fragment or fragments. Results will help to better
constrain tectonic models of western New England.
