Emerson 9320911 This project will develop a new cleaning technique which will
permit 230-Th dating of planktonic foraminifera. If successful, it would extend
the range of direct chronology by an order of magnitude from the existing 1
4C-based methods. The problems heretofore have been the need for complete
removal of detrital and adsorbed Th, and the difficulty of making precise
measurements of low concentrations. The Pl's plan to address the first by using
a series of rinses for reduction of Mn and Fe, followed by chelation to prevent
reabsorbed ions. The thermal ionization mass spectrometer at Hanford will be
used to achieve precision.
