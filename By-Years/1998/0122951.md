Scholarships are being granted to academically talented, low-income students as
they seek to complete their degrees in mathematics, computer science or
engineering. Scholarship recipients have access to an extensive academic support
infrastructure that includes faculty mentoring, opportunities for cooperative
education, seminars on topics in mathematics and engineering, workshops on
career preparation, and advising on graduate education. Part-time employment on
campus as tutors is available for juniors and seniors. &lt;br/&gt;
