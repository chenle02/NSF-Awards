It is a truism that science changes our view of our place in the universe. The
rise of modern science which came with the Copernican Revolution of the 16th
century moved the earth and mankind from the center to the periphery of
creation. The Darwinian Revolution of the 19th century made mankind itself just
one more of the animals which evolved from the primordial ooze. The quantum
revolution of this century called into doubt our most trusted theories of
causation. The project that Professor Roe is undertaking aims to examine another
scientific theory, one which has hardly been studied at all, but which, she
argues, radically altered man's view of God and the State in the 18th century.
Her study focuses on the role biological ideas played in the mid 18th century,
when traditional concepts of nature, morality, and society were being
challenged. During the High Enlightenment (1750s to 1770s) the notion of a
divinely ordered, unchanging, and hierarchical universe (including both the
natural and social worlds) clashed with a new view of nature and society without
God, in which processes of change and development replaced those of stable
harmony. Biological ideas, especially on the generation of life, were taken up
into this controversy and in turn were charged with new significance by it.
Professor Roe's study focuses on a number of individuals (Buffon, Needham,
Bonnet, Haller, Voltaire, Helvetius, Diderot, d'Holbach, and other
contemporaries), and recreates the intellectual and political world of mid-
century Paris and Geneva. She aims for a contextual history that demonstrates
how the biological controversy arose within these intellectual and social crises
and why materialist views of nature seemed so threatening to some and so
provocative to others.
