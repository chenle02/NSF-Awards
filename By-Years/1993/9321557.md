9321557 Washburn Technical abstract: This Small Grants for Exploratory Research
project is a study of new nanostructures in silicon-germanium alloys. The
structures include small point contacts, lateral resonant tunneling devices and
interferometers. Three kinds of devices will be fabricated: (1) split-gate and
shallow etched point contacts and ballistic wires, (2) interferometers, and (3)
compound gate, lateral, one-dimensional resonant tunneling structures and
interferometers. The experiments will extend the study of quantum interference
to a new materials system and provide the first controlled system for testing
recent predictions of conductance quantization in a one-dimensional Luttinger
liquid. Non-technical abstract: New electronic devices depend on increasingly
smaller physical structures, so-called nanostructures. One promising
nanostructure material is gallium arsenide. However, it is more expensive to
fabricate than traditional silicon. This Small Grants for Exploratory Research
project is a university- industry (IBM) collaboration which will explore
nanostructures made from silicon-germanium alloys. The latter material can be
fabricated by traditional silicon technology. The research will explore the
physics of these materials and determine their quantum electronic properties in
order to assess their potential as device materials. ***
