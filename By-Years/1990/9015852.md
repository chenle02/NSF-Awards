This research is to extend previous advances in full-wave elastic inversion of
seismic array data at pre-critical reflections to the post-critical reflection
case at wide apertures. Wide-aperture data has large amplitude and phase changes
associated with post-critical reflections. The inversion process will yield
information on P-wave and S-wave velocities and on density in crustal and upper
mantle seismic reflection studies.
