Seven projects devoted to determining the reactivity of dioxygen species and
means of activating them will be pursued. These are: I) activation of peroxides
by iron and cobalt complexes, II) activation of dioxygen by iron complexes, III)
ligand centered redox reactions of metal complexes, IV) the chemistry of
superoxide, V) development of a model for the heme containing component of
cytochrome c oxidase, VI) development of a model for the manganese cofactor of
photosystem II, and VII) the characterization of the nucleophilicity of
peroxides towards electrophilic centers such as sulfur dioxide, chlorine, and
chlorinated, aromatic hydrocarbons. %%% In this project in the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Donald
T. Sawyer of Texas A&amp;M University will continue studies of the reactivity
and activation of oxygen, superoxide, and peroxides. This work will increase our
understanding of such diverse topics as biological oxidation, combustion
processes, and decontamination of some environmentally hazardous chemicals such
as chlorinated hydrocarbons.
