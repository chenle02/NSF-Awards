Multivariate time series is an active area of research in many academic
disciplines such as Economics, Environmental Science, Finance, and Statistics
among others. Since many observed series are not low dimensional, traditional
methods lead to models with poor performance because too many parameters are
estimated. Statistical methods in this proposal deal with these issues.
Procedures proposed here bypass the generalized eigenvalue problems associated
with traditional methods for dimensionality reduction which create serious
difficulties in the theory and practice of data analysis. Simultaneous
parsimonious modeling of signal and noise is addressed. An entirely new method
based on exponential prediction is outlined in this proposal.

There is substantial interest among researchers in building parsimonious models
and in developing effective methods for prediction. This proposal has been
motivated in part by a need to analyze air pollution and macroeconomic data. In
the study of air pollution, it is important to model multivariate time series
consisting of pollutants, particulates and meteorological variables, and their
impact on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Information obtained from
such analyses has implications for policy on public health. The results of this
research will be used to analyze air pollution and macroeconomic data. More
generally, this proposal addresses issues in analysis of high dimensional time
series that have wide applications. The educational aspect of this proposal
includes monitoring and teaching graduate students the theory and practice of
multivariate time series.
