A "United States-Spain Workshop on Natural Disasters Research" will take place
in Barcelona, Spain, June 9-11, 1993. The purpose of the meeting is to identify
research areas of common interest to both countries in the identification,
prediction and mitigation of natural disasters. Such disasters include wind
storms, floods, droughts, landslides, earthquakes among others. Technological
advances in remote and in-situ sensors, communication and warning systems,
computers hardware and software, and improvements in mathematical simulations of
natural disasters will be some of the topics discussed at the workshop.
Proceedings of the presentations, discussions and recommendations for a joint
research agenda will be published and disseminated to national and international
research organizations. This meeting is one of the many activities taking place
during the ongoing International Decade for Natural Disasters Reduction (IDNDR).
