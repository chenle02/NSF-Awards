This Small Business Innovative Research Project proposes to combine a novel low-
frequency acoustic energy technology with an airlift bioreactor. This is
expected to provide a dramatic increase in bioreactor productivity by greatly
increasing mass transport. The proposed technology will meet contemporary
industry needs for a high productivity, low-shear bioreactor that can be used to
economically produce a broad range of traditional and newly emerging
biochemicals and bioproducts.

The commercial applications of this project include the culturing of
pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals from a broad range of organisms including
plant cells, mammalian cells, fungi, bacteria and yeast.
