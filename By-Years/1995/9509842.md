ABSTRACT CTS-9509842 This is a study of the electrochemical kinetic behavior of
diamond (doped and undoped; single-crystal and polycrystalline) and an
evaluation of its potential as an electrode material in electrochemical
technology. Factors influencing the electrochemical behavior of diamond film are
explored, including dopant levels, type of dopants, surface pretreatment, plasma
etching, annealing treatments, diamond morphology, and graphitic content.
Undoped and doped diamond thin films with various surface morphologies are grown
on molybdenum silicon, glassy carbon, single-crystal diamond, and graphite
substrates by microwave plasma and hot-filament techniques. Anodic and cathodic
transfer coefficients, corrosion rate, exchange current density, double-layer
capacitance, film resistance, polarization resistance, and/or charge-transfer
resistance of diamond electrodes in a 0.5 M salt solution are determined using
AC impedance and DC polarization techniques. Voltammetric techniques are used to
study redox behavior of model systems, working potential limits of diamond
electrodes in various electrolytes, and electrocatalysis by doped diamond and by
platinum/iridium or ruthenium dioxide on diamond. It is generally accepted that
further advances in industrial electrochemistry will require new electrode
materials. Diamond is a promising, but as yet unproven, candidate. ***
