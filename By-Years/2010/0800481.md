The objective or this interdisciplinary research collaboration is to develop the
materials processing science underpinning a new class of hybrid machining
processes that enable large-scale, low-cost manufacturing of nanostructured
alloys. The finding that chips produced during normal machining operations are
composed of nanocrystalline structures of high strength and hardness opens a
low-cost, direct way of making these materials in large volumes. The study
focuses on Large-Strain Extrusion Machining (LSEM) and Modulation-Assisted
Machining (MAM), two new processes that impart grain refinement through severe
plastic deformation (SPD) together with independent control of the product size
and shape, in both bulk and particulate forms. The program couples systematic
processing experiments on alloys of commercial interest with advance
microstructure characterization methods, including electron microscopy. This
work will map the capabilities and limitations of these new processes and
provide clear direction for their application to commercial processing
operations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Widespread use of nanostructured alloys has
been hampered by their high cost, frequently quoted in excess of one hundred
dollars per pound. The new machining-based processes offer a transformative
solution to this fundamental problem. The research will provide an important
bridge between the manufacturing of nanostructured alloys and the practical
utilization of these materials in bulk forms in the discrete products sector. An
important secondary benefit, with broad societal impact, will be providing
higher value utilization for chips produced in manufacturing operations (up-
cycling). Complementing the research is a student-centered education and
training program that includes an interdisciplinary, collaborative environment,
industrial internships for graduate students and integrated summer research
opportunities for undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;
