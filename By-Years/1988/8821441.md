Divided governments are becoming the norm, rather than the exception in
countries where the executive and the legislature are both directly elected. In
the United States, for instance, the Republican Party appears to have a solid
grip on the Presidency, while the Democratic Party appears to have an advantage
in Congress. In this project the investigators explain this phenomenon as the
result of a process where moderate voters bring about a balance of power that
insures a moderate policy outcome. The investigators start from the presumption
that the two political parties have different objectives. That is, when in
office, the two parties follow different policies because they pursue the
interests of different constituencies. However, the final policy outcome is not
only a function of which party is holding the Presidency, but also of the
composition of Congress. Moderate voters, that is voters who prefer policies in
between the policies most preferred by the two parties, have two opportunities
to"moderate" the President. In Presidential election years some voters may vote,
Republican for President and then "balance" by voting for a Democratic candidate
for Congress. This explains the common observation of split.ticket voting.
Second, in mid.term Congressional elections some additional moderation can take
place. In these elections there is no uncertainty about the identity of the
President. This makes "moderation" easier relative to Presidential election
years when there is uncertainty about the outcome of the Presidential race.
Thus, some additional moderation can take place in mid-term. This explains a
second widely observed phenomenon: the mid-term cycle. That is, the party
holding the White House almost always loses votes and seats in mid-term
elections relative to the preceding Congressional elections held in Presidential
election years. The researchers have developed a model of this process and
consider a specific policy issue: the inflation/unemployment tradeoff. The
researchers generate several testable propositions of the correlations between
economic conditions and electoral outcomes. Using aggregate voting data for
Congressional elections for the period 1950-1984 the researchers assess the
extent to which the model predicts aggregate Congressional election outcomes in
terms of incumbency effects and state of the economy.
