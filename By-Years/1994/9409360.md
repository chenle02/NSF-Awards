In this project, compiler algorithms for the enhancement of data locality on
parallel computer systems are developed. These algorithms are implemented in a
compiler for a data parallel extension to C targeted to MIMD systems.
Enhancements to data locality improve the run time performance of programs by
reducing the need for communication and/or synchronization. This work extends
compiler design and implementation work on data parallel extensions to FORTRAN
(e.g., FORTRAN 90 with extensions) targeted to SIMD systems. Both language
extensions and compiler optimizations are investigated. The language extensions
are aimed at improving the expressiveness of data parallelism. Generalizations
of data locality representations and algorithms to a wider class of
architectures and languages are designed and implemented. Automatic techniques
for localizing data are investigated with programmer directives.
