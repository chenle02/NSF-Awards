Unique structures called pit plugs are associated with intercellular
connections in the red algae. Variation in the structure of pit plugs (layering,
shape, and chemistry) among species of red algae provides valuable characters
that have contributed to improved classification of these plants. In this
project, Dr. Curt Pueschel of the State University of New York at Binghamton
will examine components of the pit plug, especially the outer cap layers, using
histochemical tests in conjunction with electron-microscopy to resolve features
of cap construction. Morphological variation of the pit plug within the order
Acrochaetiales will be studied and features correlated with other characters to
determine primitive and advanced conditions. These studies will contribute to
understanding the evolutionary relationships among families and orders of red
algae.
