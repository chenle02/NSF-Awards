This project explores the potential of narrow bandgap semiconductors such as
rhenium(Rh) molybdenum(Mo) silicide for use as a silicon microelectronics
compatible wavelength adjustable infrared sensitive detector material.
Determining the compositional (Rh, Mo) dependence of the bandgap value, and the
influence of epitaxial crystal growth parameters on the microstructure of the
films are major goals. Thin films of Rh and Mo will be deposited in
stoichiometric proportions by e-beam evaporation onto silicon substrates.
Silicide formation will be completed through thermally driven solid state
reactions by two distinct modes--reactive deposition epitaxy, and solid phase
epitaxy. The films will be evaluated by electron and x-ray spectroscopies, and
the type of bandgap and its value will be determined by comparing optical data
to theoretical models. This work, by providing information on fundamental
materials synthesis, processing, and physical properties, is expected to lay the
foundation for development of monolithically integrated silicon based intrinsic
infrared detector prototypes suitable for use in the 8-14 micron wavelength
range.
