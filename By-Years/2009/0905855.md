This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A four-pixel prototype heterodyne focal
plane array based on Monolithic Millimeter Integrated Circuit technology will be
built. The purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable focal plane
array technology based largely on technology developed for commercial
applications. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an array of
hundreds of pixels supporting fractional bandwidths as great as 20% at
millimeter wave frequencies.
