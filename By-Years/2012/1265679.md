In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis and Chemistry of Life Processes
Programs of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Eric Block of the
Department of Chemistry at the University at Albany, SUNY, will conduct basic
research on several areas of organo-sulfur and -selenium chemistry, e.g., 1)
Research on low molecular weight organoselenium compounds related to
methaneselenol, a central player in human Se metabolism and the anticancer
activity of dietary Se; 2) Research on olfaction, following up on the discovery
of the role of copper in smelling volatile sulfur compounds; 3) Research on
thiacorannulenes, unusual, bowl-shaped compounds with potential utility in
design of metal catalysts and materials for energy storage; 4) Research on the
chemistry of garlic and onion, emphasizing discovery of novel, biologically
active sulfur containing, natural-products.

The project seeks to answer fundamental questions on the chemistry of these
important elements in synthetic organic and pharmaceutical chemistry, and
biochemistry. Each aim was chosen because of the broad intellectual challenge
presented in the execution of the work, the paucity of knowledge in each area
(e.g., metabolism of small organoselenium compounds; olfactory receptors for
volatile sulfur-containing molecules; metal-coordination to unusual ligands;
garlic-inspired drugs), and the likelihood of significant discoveries resulting
from work in each area. In addition, this project will provide excellent
training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those
from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
