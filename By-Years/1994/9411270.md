Mr. Carl-Henry Geschwind, working under the direction of Dr. Sharon Kingsland,
is examining the emergence of seismology as a powerful scientific tool for
controlling the threats posed by earthquakes to modern civilization. In treating
the history of American seismology during its formative period (1880-1935), Mr.
Geschwind is focusing on three broad topics: the interactions between those
seismologists primarily interested in protecting the public from earthquakes and
those more interested in studying earthquakes for purely scientific purposes;
the relative importance of natural events, scientific developments and broader
cultural changes in bringing about the gradual emergence and popular acceptance
of seismology; and the overall place of seismology within larger political and
cultural trends on both the local and the national level. This dissertation
promises to be of interest not only to environmental historians and historians
of science, but also to geologists, environmental scientists, and science policy
makers seeking to enhance the social relevance of science.
