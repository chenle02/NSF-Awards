This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a high-density plate washer for very high-density microplates (1536 or
more wells per plate). Currently, there are automated plate washers for 96 or
384 well plates that are heavily used for ELISA assays or most other biochemical
or cell-based assays. However, there are none for plates with ultra-high
density. This is because currently available washer technology cannot be made
reliable enough so that dispense and aspirate nozzles consistently reach within
each of the many, very small wells, and so that the many thin nozzles needed do
not clog. This project will incorporate a wholly innovative design to get around
these problems. The proposed technology will allow scientists to wash the 1536
well plates. The implications are that fluoroscent chemical compounds can now be
used for screening because they are removed before the measurement of the
samples. This will mean cost savings and efficiency in the screening process for
both academic and commercial scientists.

The commercial application of this project will be a new product that can be
used by the research community involved in screening programs for drug
discovery.
