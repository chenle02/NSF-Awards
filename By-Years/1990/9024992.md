Significantly higher quality heat-capacity data for substrate-free two-
dimensional systems require constructing a high-resolution free-standing liquid
film calorimeter to investigate the thermal properties of two-dimensional
systems, including the effect of the free surfaces, and the cross-over from
three dimensions to two dimensions.
