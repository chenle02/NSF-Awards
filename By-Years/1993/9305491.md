The focus of this research involves a systematic reinvestigation of the
mechanism of the Pauson-Khand reaction which will give a better understanding
this important process. Second, the Pauson-Khand reaction will be used as a key
step in the synthesis of the natural product asteriscanolide and, third,
Professor Krafft will probe electrophilic addition to unactivated alkenes. %%%
With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Marie E. Krafft of the Department of Chemistry at Florida State
University. Professor Krafft will focus her work on the chemistry of cobalt-
alkyne complexes. Both mechanistic studies and synthetic applications of the the
Pauson-Khand reaction will be carried out in order to develop new strategies for
the construction of carbon-carbon bonds.
