ABSTRACT

31 July 2012 Proposal Number: 1219431 Institution: San Jose State University,
Moss Landing Marine Labs PI: S. Lamerdin Co-PI: J. Harvey

The proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items
for the San Jose State University, Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) for use
aboard the R/V POINT SUR; namely a new global distress communication suite
(GMDSS), a forward-looking sonar, an oily water separator, and a night vision
thermal imaging camera. These items will either allow the vessel to meet
regulatory requirements or enhance operational safety; particularly for the
planned Antarctic deployment.

Broader Impacts: The R/V POINT SUR supports federally-funded scientific
research in the Pacific Northwest in order to expand human knowledge of the
ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved
through the State?s Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and
Education program (CI-CORE) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program
(ACT), real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events. The POINT SUR is scheduled to complete over 60 NSF sponsored days in
2012.
