This study expands our scientific understanding of how release from holding
centers affects the wellbeing of individuals and their families. The COVID-19
pandemic marked a change in some communities in the United States, such that
holding facilities for transitory individuals were depopulated to allow for
social distancing and protect health. This project takes advantage of the
release of tens of thousands of such individuals to investigate how release from
holding centers affects household wellbeing, including economic stability,
health and wellbeing, engagement with key societal institutions, and children’s
educational outcomes. The findings from this study will inform decision-making
on holding practices at the federal, state, and local
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use a longitudinal, mixed-methods,
and multi-perspective research design to follow up to 300 households that
experienced changes to the holding status of a household member. First, the
project will conduct multiple waves of telephone surveys with formerly held
individuals to capture individual and household impacts over time. Second, the
project will survey and interview family members (e.g., spouse, child) of
formerly held individuals. Third, the study will compare a subgroup of study
households residing in California to a similarly-situated, representative sample
of households observed in the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) during
the same time period. This allows the study’s findings to make population-level
comparisons, including accounting for concurrent challenges faced by communities
during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
