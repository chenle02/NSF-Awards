ENAM04: Fourth International Conference on Exotic Nuclei and Atomic Masses
ABSTRACT

ENAM is a triennial international conference series devoted to the physics of
nuclei far from stability and radioactive ion beams (RIB). RIB science is
extremely broad and diverse. It spans the gamut from nuclear structure to
astrophysics, tests of fundamental laws of nature, and myriad applications.
Nevertheless, it is characterized by several encompassing themes that reflect
the major challenges facing modern science today, and it has deep links to many
other fields.

The scientifing challenges discussed at ENAM will include the following
compelling questions: * How are the heavy elements created and how do nuclear
properties influence the stars? * What is the structure of atomic nuclei and how
do complex systems derive their properties from their individual constituents? *
How can complex many-body systems display such astonishing regularities and
which new symmetries characterize exotic nuclei? * What are the fundamental
symmetries of nature?

Worldwide, the study of exotic nuclei is in rapid advance. With the large number
of radioactive ion beam facilities that are operating, under construction, and
proposed, ENAM is a unique forum to discuss the exciting developments in the
field, including experimental discoveries, theoretical modeling, technological
advances, and applications. The Fourth Conference will be at Callaway Gardens in
Pine Mountain, Georgia USA. The timing of the meeting is excellent. The recent
Nuclear Physics Long Range Plan has identified the Rare Isotope Accelerator as
the highest priority for new construction in nuclear physics for the United
States. For the RIA community in the USA, and for the RIB community worldwide,
ENAM is the single most important meeting.
