The primary goal of this project is to connect the ecosystem of disparate
community practitioners and researchers within the growing, cross-disciplinary
field of Secure and Trustworthy CyberSpace (SaTC) by conceptualizing, designing,
building, hosting, and maintaining an open source website. This website will
advance community building, education, and collaboration in the SaTC and related
research and development (R&amp;D) program areas. These services will be enabled
via the provisioning of wide-ranging information repository and collaboration
services made possible via a robust content management system. The rich
assortment of SaTC historic, current, and future multi-disciplinary, multi-
institutional, user-provided and administrator-collected content will be
provisioned into a customizable, easy to use, searchable, and interactive online
format. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SaTC Community Forum will connect different
science and engineering disciplines, R&amp;D, and researchers and will provide
robust data repositories, open collaboration services, and a rich set of virtual
communication tools that currently do not exist under one roof. The SaTC
Community Forum repositories could advance the state of SaTC knowledge and
learning by advancing the collection and dissemination of educational materials
to better prepare early career researchers; stimulate collaboration via the
development of professional networks around shared resources of mutual interest;
and advance the rapid publication of research findings, tools, and techniques
for use by the broader SaTC research community, including industry, as a whole.
These resources will be made available to users and visitors globally.
