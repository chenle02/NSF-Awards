9318232 McLaughlin Among the estimated 16,000 species of basidiomycete fungi,
the familiar mushrooms and puffballs and bracket fungi of the world, are forms
without conspicuous fruiting bodies but possessing microscopic spore-bearing
structures. The taxonomic relationships of these numerous fungal forms are
little studied, although many economically important crop pathogens and
ecologically significant saprobic groups are included here. As well, the
phylogenetic or genealogical affinities of these fungi, among themselves and
with the ascomycete fungi, are poorly known. New molecular methods of DNA
sequencing promise large quantities of comparative data for integration with
current morphological and ultrastructural findings for eventual taxonomic and
phylogenetic synthesis. Dr. David McLaughlin at the University of Minnesota and
postdoctoral associate Dr. Eric Swann have started a major project to acquire
DNA sequence data for numerous representatives of the simple septate groups of
Heterobasidiomycetes, and to integrate these new molecular data with traditional
taxonomic characters. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the fungi hold great
promise for improving taxonomic recognition of the major lines of evolution and
for resolving longstanding controversies about the origin and morphological
diversification of saprobic and pathogenic groups of basidiomycetes.
