This project is mathematical research in Banach space theory. Professor Dilworth
plans to investigate linear topological properties of certain Banach spaces of
broad interest in analysis. Some of this work concerns the infinite-dimensional
subspace structure of the Lebesgue and Lorentz function spaces. Probabilistic
matters, such as inequalities for sums of independent random variables and of
martingale difference sequences in function spaces, will also be investigated.
Another research direction has to do with the finite-dimensional structure of
the Lebesgue spaces with exponent less than unity.
