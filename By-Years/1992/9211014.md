Senescence is the decline in reproduction and survivorship with advancing age.
There are two major evolutionary theories of senescence: pleiotropy and mutation
accumulation. Both of these theories seek to provide an explanation for the
observed patterns of reproduction and mortality. Both theories suggest that
senescence is an example of the failure of natural selection to act against
genes with late age-specific effects. This study will investiage these two major
theories using selection experiments with Drosophila melanogaster. Through a
series of contrasts, between selection lines, the relative ability of either
theory to explain changes in late-life history patterns will be examined. There
have been previous studies which have examined one or the other of these
theories, but this will be the first time they will be tested simultaneously.
The results will contribute to a general understanding of animal aging.
