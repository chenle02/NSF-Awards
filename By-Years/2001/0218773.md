Mathematics (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A National Agenda for Advancing the
Undergraduate Mathematics Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports
a major initiative to stimulate and direct curriculum development and
collaborative multidisciplinary relationships for the undergraduate program in
the mathematical sciences. The project creates a set of curricular
recommendations and an agenda for implementing them, and these are disseminated
to mathematics faculty and department chairs, deans, and faculty in partner
disciplines. The goals of the project are &lt;br/&gt;1. To expand the numbers of
students undertaking substantial study of the mathematical sciences, majoring in
the physical sciences and technology as well as in the mathematical sciences,
and continuing to graduate study in these areas;&lt;br/&gt;2. To better prepare
students for teaching, scientific careers, employment in business or industry,
and other jobs for which mathematical preparation is needed;&lt;br/&gt;3. To
improve curricular offerings for students who might take only one college-level
course in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outcome of the
project is a publication of recommendations and models of good practice for the
undergraduate program in the mathematical sciences that are based on extensive
consultations with mathematicians and users of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Undergraduate Education and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences jointly funded this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
