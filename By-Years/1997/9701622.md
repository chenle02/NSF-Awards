Professor Woerpel's research focuses on the development of new methodologies for
the construction of carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds through the (3+2)
annulation reactions of functionalized allylsilanes. Use of allylsilanes with
strategically-placed electron-donating substituents permits rapid 1,2-silyl
migration in the initially formed beta-silyl carbocations, leading to more
stable carbocations which then undergo annulation with a variety of reactive
functionalities. In addition to providing synthetic access to a variety of
cyclic structures, these studies also permit the assessment of the role of
electronic factors in these annulation reactions. Portions of the research
program are particularly designed to encourage participation by undergraduate
research students. Professor Woerpel will also examine the effectiveness of new
pedagogical tools for improving student comprehension of organic chemistry,
focusing on three central themes, stereochemistry, conformational analysis and
inductive effects in determining acidity. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic
Organic Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor
Keith A. Woerpel of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
Irvine. Professor Woerpel's research efforts are focused on the development of
new approaches for the synthesis of cyclic compounds. These studies, exploiting
unique reactions of silicon-containing molecules, promise access to a variety of
carbocyclic (containing only carbon) and heterocyclic compounds (containing
elements such as nitrogen in addition to carbon). Such cyclic structures form
the basis of numerous pharmaceutical compounds and other important products.
Professor Woerpel's educational activities include the involvement of
undergraduates, recruited both from his home campus and through outreach
programs, in his research program. Professor Woerpel will also incorporate new
laboratory- and computer-based approaches and implement a learning cycle
approach to the teaching of undergraduate organic chemistry.
