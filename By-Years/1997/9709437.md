Sarah C. Rutan is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
the Chemistry Division to perform studies aimed at developing a better
understanding of solvation in condensed phases through the use of spectroscopic
measurements and chemometrics. She and her group at Virginia Commonwealth
University will use solvent sensitive dye probes to investigate the solvation of
bonded alkyl silica phases used in reverse phase liquid chromatography. Other
studies will involve solvation of probe molecules in non-ideal binary solvent
mixtures and characterization of the solvation of alkyl phases based on
variations in light transmittance caused by changes in refractive index. Linear
and non-linear chemometric treatments of the data will be performed to develop
models which can be used to predict retention behavior. The process of removing
one solute from among others dissolved in a liquid phase involves transfering
that solute into another phase. This is the process of chemical separations and
is important from a practical viewpoint for pollution control, production of
pure pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, and many other applications. This work
involves a fundamental study of the solvation process to enable a better
understanding of the chemistry involved. This could lead to significant
improvements in these practical applications.
