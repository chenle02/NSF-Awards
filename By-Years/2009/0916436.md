&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In future high-performance microprocessors, memory system
organization and management is perhaps the most critical looming issue. Accesses
to memory will incur long delays and energy overheads in various queuing
structures and in long wires. Each access will experience non-uniform delay and
energy overheads based on the location of the stored data. Efficient layout of
data within the memory hierarchy is therefore essential for high performance and
low power. In this proposal, the PIs put forth a comprehensive hardware/software
strategy for data placement in cache/memory structures with non-uniform delay
and power. Novel mechanisms are proposed to cost-effectively migrate pages
within the memory hierarchy. These mechanisms will attempt to leverage hardware
structures, OS support, compiler hints, and compiler transformations. The PIs
also plan to engage in broader impact activities that encourage minority
participation and augment research infrastructure.
