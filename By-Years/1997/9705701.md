9705701 Means Fibrous views and pressure shadows in rocks are essential tools
for reconstructing kinematic histories in deformed rock bodies, yet the origin
of these features is not well-understood. This casts uncertainty on their
reliability and applicability. This project will conduct a series of laboratory
studies to grow fibers under a variety of stress and strain rates using a rock-
analog material. Preliminary work has demonstrated the feasibility and utility
of this technique. Results are expected to shed light on the origin and growth
of fibers and to test concepts that fibers record displacement histories,
incremental strain and strain amounts. Successful results will widely apply to
may tectonic studies using fibers as strain indicators.
