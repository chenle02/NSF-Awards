This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase Iresearch project addresses
the need of business and government organizations to monitor and protect their
high-speed electronic networks. Current network intrusion detection technologies
are based on software or network processors, both of which are essentially
serial in nature, and cannot meet the speed requirements of 10 Gbps networks.
The proposed research intends to demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel,
massively parallel architecture specifically designed for high-speed intrusion
detection. The objective of this project is to take an existing intrusion
detection acceleration design implemented for 1 Gbps network, and extend it to
meet 10 Gbps requirements. Specifically, this research outlines a path to (1)
determine the proper architecture extension needed to achieve 10 Gbps
throughput, (2) create the actual logic design, and (3) perform simulation to
prove that the design can indeed handle 10 Gbps. It is anticipated that the
research will show that an extension of the architecture can indeed handle 10
Gbps. An eventual application is to deploy the hardware detection engine in a
complete intrusion detection solution and enabling the solution to operate in a
live 10 Gbps network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's networks are still vulnerable
to hackers, cyber criminals, and cyber terrorists. An architecture which can
scale with both (1) the increase in the number and complexity of signatures and
(2) the increase in network speeds, is needed not only to meet today's security
needs, but also to lay out the groundwork for future intrusion detection and
other network surveillance systems. Network managers will be able to upgrade the
security of their networks in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost.
