0854354&lt;br/&gt;Schlaf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current wet-chemical approaches
used for the fabrication of capture based immunoassays are often time consuming,
and can result in inconsistent results due to the necessary multi-step process.
This research program focuses on the exploration and application of a rapid
preparation method for immunoassays recently demonstrated by the PIs. This
method utilizes direct electrospray deposition at atmospheric pressure of
affinity capture reagents (such as antibodies) on solid supports. The method is
able to fabricate ready-to-go sandwich immunoassays during a deposition time of
a few tens of seconds. This contrasts with a longer than 48 hours preparation
time for conventional wet-chemically prepared assays. The assay sensitivity and
specificity of Escherichia coli (E. coli) immunoassays prepared with this method
have already been demonstrated to be similar or better to that of conventional
wet-chemically prepared assays. Encouraged by these preliminary results a
systematic investigation of the adsorption process will be carried out, while
also pursuing an optimization the deposition process for potential applications
in biosensor manufacturing. In addition to these efforts, a direct patterning
device based on electrospray deposition will be designed and built in
collaboration with a small business, Elion systems, Inc.. The goal is to enable
rapid computer-controlled fabrication of patterned biosensor coupons in a bench
top or field environment. This will enable the small scale ad hoc fabrication of
multi-capture reagent biosensor coupons capable of parallel detection of a
variety of pathogens.
