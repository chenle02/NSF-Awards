Underground openings are regularly made in rocks for mining, for tunnels to
convey vehicles or fluids, for power plants near dams, for storage of wastes,
and a variety of other purposes. Analyses used to determine the types of
supports needed to prevent caving, begin with a specification of the original
state of stress in the rock. Unfortunately, the horizontal stresses in rock
cannot be determined analytically and no generally useful technique exists for
economical measurement of these stresses. This project will involve an attempt
to use a combination of a hydraulic fracturing technique with recently developed
thin-film piezoelectric trans- ducers to determine the stress state. The goal of
the project is to develop the technique so it can be widely used and to
demonstrate its economic feasibility.
