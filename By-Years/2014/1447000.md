The goal of the proposed project is to broaden the participation of the
individuals from underrepresented groups in the "First Hands-On Workshop on
Leveraging High Performance Computing Resources for Managing Large Datasets".
This one-day workshop has been accepted by the 2014 IEEE Big Data conference,
and is tentatively scheduled to be held on October 27, 2014 in Washington DC.
The objective of the workshop is to engage its participants in using the
national Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Big Data management activities, thereby
enhancing the possibilities of making discoveries in the areas of data-driven
and data-intensive computing. Through the proposed project, 20 students from
underrepresented groups will be funded to participate in the aforementioned
workshop, and will also be supported to participate in additional activities at
the conference.
