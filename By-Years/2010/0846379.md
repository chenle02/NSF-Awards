This CAREER proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER
proposal describes a research plan focused on closed-loop stabilization of
parametrically-amplified micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and a teaching
plan focused on hands-on experimental learning at the high-school,
undergraduate, and graduate levels. MEMS resonators have important applications
as sensors and as communication devices. Parametric amplification, a nonlinear
phenomenon occurring within the micromechanical element, has the potential to
enhance the sensitivity and reduce the power consumption of these devices.
Although parametric amplification is a well-known phenomenon, it has seen little
practical use in MEMS due to instability and gain-variation issues, problems
which arose because previous researchers studied only open-loop resonators.
Intellectual merit: This proposal addresses gaps in the current knowledge about
parametrically-amplified MEMS resonators. Building on earlier work studying the
open-loop dynamics of parametric resonators, control strategies will be
developed to stabilize nonlinear oscillators and to produce resonant sensors
with stable transduction gain. Broader impact: The methods developed to achieve
stable, high-gain nonlinear resonators will have broad applications in
micromechanical force sensors, such as atomic force microscopes, gyroscopes, and
magnetometers, as well as in communication devices such as oscillators and
filters. The centerpiece of the proposed teaching plan is to develop and teach a
hands-on summer course on MEMS and microfabrication for high-school students.
Research opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented minority and
economically disadvantaged groups will be provided in cooperation with existing
programs on the UC Davis campus.
