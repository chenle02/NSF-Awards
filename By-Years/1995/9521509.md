ABSTRACT Georgiadis The proposers plan to investigate complex laminar flows
involving chaotic stirring with applications in porous heat exchangers and screw
extruders. A lattice-Boltzman numerical technique will complement experimental
measurements using magnetic resonance imaging to produce a fundamental
understanding of the character of the flow.
