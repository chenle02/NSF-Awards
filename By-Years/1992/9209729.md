Recognizing objects from a single view is hard, because their appearance
depends crucially on the direction from which they are viewed. Curved surfaces
are particularly subject to this effect. This research concentrates on
recognizing curved surfaces from their outline in a single perspective image,
using both theoretical studies and practical implementations, along two lines of
investigation. The problem has already been solved for generic algebraic
surfaces by the Principal Investigator. The result indicates that an image
outline contains substantial amounts of information about an object's shape. The
research will investigate extending this result to a wider range of popular
surfaces, and will also investigate the practicalities of applying the resulting
algorithms. Recent work by the PI and colleagues suggests that there is a large
range of surface models which are intrinsically easy to recognize. These results
suggest building a surface modeller oriented specifically towards computer
vision applications, where the resulting models would be a fortiori easy to
identify from any view. The research will investigate theoretical issues
involved in constructing such a modeller, and will implement simple modelling
system with these properties.
