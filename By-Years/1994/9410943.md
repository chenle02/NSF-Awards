9410943 R. O'Handley This research involves a series of measurements directed
toward a more thorough and fundamental understanding of giant surface
magnetostriction. Effective magnetoelastic coefficients can take on anomalously
large values near the surface of magnetic thin films. The thickness dependence
of the principal magnetoelastic coefficients is examined in epitaxial single
crystal nickel/copper, nickel/silver, cobalt/copper, iron/silver, and
iron/tungsten thin films. A fundamental understanding of surface
magnetoelasticity is sought, particularly concerning its correct magnitude,
symmetry, temperature dependence, and the physical significance of the Neel
coefficients. First principle calculations for the surface magnetoelastic
coefficients of materials will be compared to experimental values measured in
this program. This work should provide a sound fundamental basis for creating a
predictive capability with respect to the effects of different interface
materials on surface magnetoelastic effects. An exchange interaction model for
the extended range of the highly localized surface effect will be tested by
comparing the range of the surface magnetoelastic anomaly for different metals
at different temperatures. %%% These observations have important technical
consequences, since it appears that the surface conditions of thin film magnetic
devices are of enhanced importance in controlling magnetic properties,
especially anisotropy, permeability, and noise, even in compositions of
nominally zero magnetostriction. ***
