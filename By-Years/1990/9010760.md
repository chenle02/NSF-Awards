This research is designed to determine if the amygdala, a brain structure
located deep wihtin the cerebral hemisphere, contributes to the establishment of
an increased state of arousal (i.e. non-specific attention), particularly during
the presence of meaningful environmental stimuli. The effects of manipulations
of the amygdala on these measures of arousal will be assessed, as will the
effects of such manipulations on learning and on the processing of sensory
information. The results should yield new and important information concerning
the brain circuits which enhance the processing of sensory information and which
contribute to the most optimal conditions for learning.
