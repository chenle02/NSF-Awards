This research aims to understand and automate the mechanisms by which language
can emerge among artificial, knowledge-based and rational agents that interact
in open, heterogeneous, and distributed environments. The intent is to design
and implement agents that, upon encountering other agent(s) with which they do
not share an agent communication language, are able to initiate creation of, and
further are able to evolve and enrich, a mutually understandable communication
language. The novelty of this research is that it enables the agents to develop
and evolve, on their own, the capacity of communicating via a common language,
as opposed to relying on this ability to be pre-designed and built into the
agents by their designers. This research is supported by two streams of
research, 1) the design of rational, socially competent artificial agents, and
2) the mechanism of negotiation as developed in game theory and automated in
artificial intelligence research. This work will contribute to fundamental
research in heterogeneous and open multiagent systems, effective communication
among artificial agents in realistic settings, practical multiagent system
design and the training of undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
