The Scholarships to Enhance Mathematics Learning and Research (SEMLAR) program
at Wilson College awards scholarships to qualified students and enhances
academic and support services already available to students majoring in
mathematics. This project provides funding for 16 scholarships. The objectives
of the program are to: 1. Increase the number of women (especially low income
and minorities) enrolled in and successful in completing a baccalaureate degree
in mathematics. 2. Enhance the educational opportunities for students in
mathematics. 3. Improve retention of students within mathematics. 4. Enhance
academic support for scholarship recipients. Intellectual Merit Statement: The
program effectively supports students in their study of mathematics and attract
new mathematics majors to Wilson College by virtue of the PI.s expertise, which
spans middle and high school levels as well as collegiate; the access that
students have to student service, financial aid, and career placement
professionals; and the depth of experience brought by off-campus mentors,
employed in mathematics-related careers. Broader Impact Statement: Sixty-seven
percent of women at Wilson College majoring in mathematics advance to post-
graduate studies leading to careers in mathematics-related fields. Wilson
College successfully prepares women for fields in which they are
underrepresented.
