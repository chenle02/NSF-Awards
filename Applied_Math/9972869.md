This project addresses a number of problems in the general area of nonlinear
wave propagation. Most of the problems considered are attempts to assess the
effects of random inhomogeneities in the medium of propagation on nonlinear
structures such as solitons. In the case of linear media, it is well known that
the effect of random inhomogeneities is to inhibit the propagation of waves, an
effect known as Anderson localization. The proposer will study the competition
between the effect of the inhomogeneities, which tend to destroy a localized
pulse such as a soliton, with the effect of nonlinearity, which acts to hold a
pulse together. In earlier work he found interesting and complicated behavior,
with different ``phases'' in which one effect or the other is dominant. He will
also begin a project involving the application of some of the tools of wave
propagtion, most importantly the Feynman path integral, to problems of the
transport of a passive scalar, such as a dye or tracer, by a fluid flow.

The kind of problems addressed in this project are best illustrated by one
important application, that of laser light propagating in an optical fiber. Very
intense light in an optical fiber has the somewhat surprising property that it
can interact with itself, and can actually focus itself. This process of self-
focusing leads to the formation of bright spots, called solitons, which
propagate along the fiber without changing shape. These solitons are of great
interest due to the possibility of using them as the basis for optical
communications systems. This project studies how these kinds of structures are
effected by variations in the fiber properties. The fundamental question is
this: Do these solitons persist when the properties of the fiber are allowed to
vary, or are they destroyed?
