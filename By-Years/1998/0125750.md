The Huntington Library will develop the Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for
Botanical Science to engage visitors of all ages in the study of plants.
Conceived as a synthesis of a traditional conservatory and an interactive
science center, the Conservatory will be a 16,000-square-foot permanent
exhibition featuring spectacular plants in a family-oriented setting. Using a
living collection of plants from around the world, visitors will explore the
diversity of plants. Interactive exhibits will encourage visitors to make
observations and comparisons of plant structures.
