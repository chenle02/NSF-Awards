The proposed research has three components: (a) The study of direct and inverse
problems for acoustic pulse reflection from randomly layered media, (b) the
study of the focusing singularity of the nonlinear Schroedinger and related
equations, and (c) convection enhanced diffusion. In pulse reflection a
statistical theory will be developed for reflected signals generated by pulses
emitted by a point source located on the surface or above a randomly layered
half space. The range of validity of the theory, based on the asymptotic theory
of stochastic equations, will be explored with numerical simulations. For pulsed
plane waves incident on a randomly layered half space, a number of statistical
inverse problems will be formulated and solved, where properties of the medium
are based on the statistics of the observed reflected signals. The work on pulse
reflection is of direct interest in exploration seismology and to a lesser
extent in connection with the detection of seismic events that are natural or
man-made. The work on the nonlinear Schroedinger equation is useful in nonlinear
optics for laser surgery, for example, and in laser fusion. The work on
convection-diffusion is useful in the study of dispersion of pollutants in
various environments such as the ocean and the atmosphere.
