Fractal analysis of Lagrangian drifter data from the Atlantic will be compared
with that from the Pacific. This fractal technique provides a geometrical
measure of an aspect of the process underlying the trajectories. The present
study will use the technique for oceanographic data, and if the results are
consistent, for the output of models of ocean circulation in which Lagrangian
trajectories can be determined
