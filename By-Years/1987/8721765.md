The objective of this research is to provide an improved method of grinding
anti-friction bearing outer and inner race rings at lower cost but of higher
quality. Current production practice requires an external grinding machine to
grind the outside diameter (OD) or raceway, and an internal grinding machine to
grind the inside diameter (ID) or internal raceway. This study seeks a method of
grinding the OD and ID on one grinding machine, thereby eliminating the tooling
cost, setup, maintenance, and capital required for one grinding machine. This
method focuses on a device for securely holding and driving the thin-walled
rings without distortion while providing access for the OD and ID grinding
wheels to grind the OD and the ID of the bearing ring. This project covers a
study of the out-of-roundness produced by asymmetrical rigidity in the clamping
system. In addition, the propagation of initial stock runout to cause roundness
errors in the finished bearing ring when grinding with fast, high-production
cycles will be investigated. The work-holding and driving method coupled with
force- adaptive control, using force sensors, provides a means for improving
grinding performance and reducing production costs in the antifriction bearing
industry.
