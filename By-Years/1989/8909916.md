This is a grant for block travel funds for scientists to attend the Third
International Conference on Southern Hemisphere Meteorology, to be held November
13-17, 1989, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Costs are shared by NSF, NOAA, and NASA.
This somewhat irregularly held conference (3-4 years) is the only conference of
its type, and attracts scientists from all over the world interested in the
Southern Hemisphere. As such, it provides a unique opportunity for American
atmospheric and oceanographic scientists, and, especially graduate and
postdoctoral students, to interact and learn from this international research
community.
