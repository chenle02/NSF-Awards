This project, sponsored by Indiana State University, will offer 25 teachers
each summer a three week workshop covering meteorology, climatology,
geotectonics, natural hazards and applications in remote sensing. Teachers will
prepare teaching modules, implement the content in their classrooms and carry
out inservice activities in their districts. The project is being supported by
the University and local school districts by an amount equal to 75% of the NSF
award.
