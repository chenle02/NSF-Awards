Steps and pools are characteristic bedforms that dominate the channel morphology
of steep mountain streams, regulating the flow and sediment dynamics feeding
into lowland rivers and larger water bodies. In summer of 2012, several
catastrophic wildfires spread across the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and burned
numerous watersheds containing step-pool channels. These events provide
opportunities to monitor the impacts of wildfire as a major disturbance on step-
pool streams, and to ultimately develop predictive understanding of the
resilience and potential recovery of such systems. This project seeks to quickly
establish baseline conditions in step-pool channels before significant changes
occur in response to the Waldo Canyon Fire. The Waldo Canyon Fire started on 23
June 2012 and was fully contained on 10 July 2012. It burned 18,247 acres of an
area just northwest of the city of Colorado Springs, mostly on national forest
land. Channel conditions in burned step-pool streams within the Pike National
Forest will be documented at selected reaches. Temporary benchmarks installed in
the study sites will provide bed elevations. Physical measurements include
longitudinal profiles, cross-sections at pools, suspended sediment, and
turbidity. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples will also be collected for analysis
of wildfire impacts on benthic communities, particularly in relation to the
impacts of changes in sediment regime in the streams.

The project will generate information that can be used by environmental managers
who manage water resources for communities such as Colorado Springs while also
working to protect residents from flood and sediment hazards. Because step-pool
streams are important habitats for many sensitive aquatic species, results of
this study are also expected to have implications for ecological management. The
project will engage graduate and undergraduate students, and develop a
collaboration with the US Geological Survey.
