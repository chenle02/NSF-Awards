ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0218646&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will continue the reference material program which for the last three
years has made low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reference material available
to ocean chemists. During this three year renewal, the PI will collect deep
ocean water from the Sargasso Sea, prepare the water samples and have the DOC
analyzed via consensus by a group of six independent laboratories. Two of these
consensus laboratories also will provide total nitrogen values for this DOC
reference material. Lastly, this program plans to double the number of users of
the product to 150 laboratories worldwide. The broader impact of this proposal
is that of furnishing a DOC reference material to the scientific community
involved in making DOC measurements which ensures that consistent, high quality
DOC concentrations will be obtained by marine chemists both in the U.S. and
abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
