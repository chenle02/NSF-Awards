The State University of New York at Buffalo's National Center for Case Study
Teaching in Science (NCCSTS) is further developing the use of case studies to
teach STEM subjects by including the development and use of materials and videos
to facilitate a "flipped classroom" design, a teaching method that has shown
promise to engage students in a variety of STEM disciplines. In this approach,
students learn the subject basics at home by watching short interactive videos,
then apply these principles in class to case studies and learn the material in
depth. Some video material for this purpose exists from sources such as the Khan
Academy, but for the most part new videos are needed that are tailored to the
specific goals and content focus of the crucial cases. The project is generating
videos for existing cases in key subject areas of general biology that are
commonly taught. These subject areas include experimental design, biological
molecules, cell structure, DNA structure and function, genetics, evolution,
animal and plant anatomy and physiology, health, ecology, and conservation.
These topics make up the core of the general undergraduate biology curriculum in
this country and are represented by case studies in our peer-reviewed case
collection at the NCCSTS. The use of the videos with (or without) the case
studies is allowing a diversity of educational and scientific communities to
promote active learning, content mastery, and problem solving by students at
various academic levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded
jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of
Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of
their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.
