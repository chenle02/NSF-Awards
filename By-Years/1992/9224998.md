production and distribution activities for perishable commodities where the
total time available for production and distribution is constrained. Tradeoffs
between production and distribution times are modeled and analyzed based on the
investigators, experiences with production distribution problems in the
newspaper industry. Newspapers are produced and distributed in the period of
time from the start of the press run to the time the last paper is delivered to
a subscriber's home. Since several geographically zoned editions or products are
produced and distributed, sequencing is important. Newspapers are tracked from
the production facilities to regional distribution centers where they are
completed, rebundled and tracked to drop off points to be picked up by home
delivery carriers. Given the daily requirement, location, and edition of each
home delivery route, the location of the printing facility(ies), and the total
time available for production and distribution, the problem is to determine the
cost minimizing combination of production and distribution system inputs
including the number of presses and inserting machines; the number of vehicles
serving distribution centers and drop off points; the number, location, and
capacity of distribution centers and drop off points; and the routes taken by
each vehicle.
