9420620 Berridge A region at the top of the brainstem known as the locus
coeruleus sends nerve cell processes to a number of locations throughout the
forebrain and is believed to modulate behavioral and cognitive functions. It is
already known the locus coeruleus cells change their rate of electrical
signaling during different behavioral states, and it has been presumed that as
the cells change their electrical activity they change the amount of the brain
chemical norepinephrine which the secrete onto forebrain sites. Dr. Berridge's
group will test the exact relationship between state-dependent changes in locus
coeruleus electrical activity and norepinephrine secretion. This work will
provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling the release of
norepinephrine and should therefore provide a better understanding of the
natural processes that modulate functions such as learning and memory, and
reactions to stress. ***
