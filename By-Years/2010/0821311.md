The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is presently creating a
campus-wide, shared, interdisciplinary facility for high-performance computing
with the initial purchase of a distributed-memory cluster with 33 compute nodes
connected by a state-of-the-art low-latency InfiniBand interconnect. In
following years, the campus aims to purchase 32 new compute nodes annually to
create a 128-node cluster. The initial purchase was jointly funded by
institutional seed money and contributions from individual faculty and several
departments. This award provides funding to be used by these researchers from
the Department of Mathematics and Statistics to contribute money for 16 compute
nodes to this facility for a total of $80,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
