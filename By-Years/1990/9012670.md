This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will provide a workstation, software
environment, and research funds for Dr. Fraser to study vector-quantization
approaches to feature extraction from speech waveforms. He hopes that recent
advances in chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic system estimation can be applied
to isolated-letter recognition without expensive phonemic segmentation and
labeling of the training set. Dr. Fraser and a graduate student will acquire a
copy of the speech-recognition software tools being built by Dr. Ronald Cole at
the nearby Oregon Graduate Institute.
