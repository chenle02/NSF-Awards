This work will focus on defining the biological and hydrodynamical constraints
to sediment selection by invertebrate animals living in muddy, estuarine
sediments -- specifically polychaetes and clams. Our understanding of the way in
which invertebrate larvae are affected during the settlement and metamorphosis
process now reveals the importance of physical forces on the ability to recruit
to adult populations. Dr. Judith Grassle, in collaboration with Dr. Cheryl Ann
Butman, will define the physical and biological limits on the ability of the
larvae to select settlement sites. This will provide predictive insights into
the adaptive significance of invertebrate larval types and the ability of larvae
to respond to perturbations to there natural environments. The wealth of
invertebrate species of commercial importance (e.g., clams, oysters and
scallops) and the ever-increasing impacts upon both natural and cultured
populations will make this fundamental research on recruitment timely.
