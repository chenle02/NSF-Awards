This project considers both theoretical and applied aspects of computational
geometry. The geometric structure of, and efficient algorithms for, problems in
a variety of areas are being investigated. Some particular areas of interest
are: applications of Davenport- Schinzel sequences, generalized Voronoi
diagrams, probabilistic techniques, and triangulations. This work has
implications for robot motion planning, graphics, solid modeling and computer
vision. A major emphasis is on the cross-fertilization between the basic
research in computational geometry and the various applications areas.
