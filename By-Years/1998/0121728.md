Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 0121728&lt;br/&gt;Proposal type:
Investigator Initiated for &lt;br/&gt; Conference Support&lt;br/&gt;Principal
investigator: Azelia Cutts&lt;br/&gt;Affiliations: American Chemical
Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Annual Green Chemistry and
Engineering Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
partially the expenses for participation by 15 graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows, and young faculty in Fifth Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering
Conference, which will be held at the National Academy of Sciences in
Washington, DC, on June 26-28, 2001. The subtitle of this conference " A New
Generation of Professionals---A New Generation of Processes". Like its
predecessor conferences, this meeting is organized around the Presidential Green
Chemistry Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate the adoption of cleaner
processes in all sectors of industry. In addition to presentation by award
winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics are given. This year's
conference is also putting emphasis on improving education to support the
development of clean processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support is given
to expand exposure and participation of young scientists and engineering and
thus to contribute to education and expansion of research activities in this
important environmental area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
