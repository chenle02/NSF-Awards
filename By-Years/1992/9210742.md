This research involves a comparative investigation of the effects of campaign
information on voting in elections for the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency.
More specifically, it will examine how differences in the information generated
in these different elections, in combination with voter differences in partisan
values and in political attentiveness, account for differences in both
individual-level voting patterns and aggregate level election outcomes. The
central theoretical idea is that voters who are more attentive to politics are
more heavily exposed to campaign information, but that different voters
encounter different campaign messages, depending on the relative intensity of
the opposing campaigns. The major purpose of the project is to investigate the
effects of differences in campaign intensity across and within different types
of elections. The researchers are particularly interested in the effects of
differences in information flow between campaign and non-campaign periods, the
effects of changes over the past 40 years in the amount of information reaching
voters, and the effects of different kinds of information on different kinds of
voters. The researchers expect to be able to accommodate these various effects
within a framework that explicitly models the diffusion of two competing and
highly variable information flows (one for each candidate) through an electorate
in which voters vary greatly in their political values and political
attentiveness. The project, based on National Election Studies data, develops
models of how changes in the flow of campaign information from 1952 to the
present have affected different types of voters and elections.
