In spring 1989, a new and unique fossil deposit was uncovered in the Pinecrest
Beds at the Richardson Road Shell Pit, Sarasota County, Florida. This deposit is
composed primarily of complete bones and articulated skeletons of one species of
cormorant (Phalacrocoracidae) as well as hundreds of bones and otoliths of
marine fish. Such a complete sample of one species of bird is rare, and only one
other locality in North America (Bone Valley, Florida, 4.5 Ma; see Becker 1985)
has produced a large sample of complete (but no associated) bones of cormorant.
Funds from the NSF SGER grants program will allow excavation of this unique
fossil site before it is lost to erosion, looting and mining operations. Because
this site is in imminent danger of total destruction, a grant from the SGER
program will allow immediate action to ensure that the deposits are properly
excavated and studied. these excavations will result in the recovery of
substantial fossil material and provide taphonomic information on how this
assemblage formed.
