The Boolean Microgrid (BM) emulates the Internet by supplying discrete power and
discrete data over a network link that follows Boolean logic and is not
continuous as in a conventional 60-Hz-ac or dc microgrid. BM is thus a highly
integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that features the convergence of control,
communication and the physical plant. BMs realization poses the following
research challenges that we plan to address: a) what is the most efficient,
economic, power-dense, and reliable way of integrating the distributed energy
sources and loads to the BM, and the BM to the utility grid, using power-
electronic interfaces for seamless and on-demand distributed power delivery? b)
what is the control-communication mechanism that optimizes BM nodal and network
control performances under conditions of varying power generation and load
demand and communication-network throughput and reliability? Our unique
approaches to address these research challenges will encompass novel mechanisms
based on high-frequency-link power conversion, dynamic-pricing based optimal
network capacity and resource utilization, event-triggered sampling and
communication, and optimal switching-sequence control.&lt;br/&gt;BM has the
potential to influence next-generation systems including smart grid, vehicular
microgrid, electric ships, military microgrid, electric aircraft,
telecommunication systems, and residential, commercial, and critical-
infrastructure (e.g., hospital) power systems. On the educational front, the
proposed project will provide graduate- and post-graduate-level education to
four researchers. Further, multiple undergraduate (including minority) students
and middle-school students will be provided research/educational opportunities.
The results of the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate
courses at the collaborating universities including a dedicated course on CPS.
