A conference on biochemical engineering will be held. The objectives of this
conference are to bring together from all over the world biochemical engineers,
chemical engineers, microbiologists, biochemists, geneticists, biologists, life
scientists, and other engineers and to share and assess the most recent advances
and future needs in such rapidly expanding areas as recombinent DNA, genetic
engineering, tissue cultures, biochemical engineering and biotechnology. The
topics to be covered are: basic advances in biological sciences; basic advances
in physical sciences; bioreactors for tissue culture; bioreactors for
immobilized biocatalysts; bioreactors for systems with spatial heterogeneity;
mixed cultures and genetically unstable populations; estimation, biosensors and
reactor state estimation; integration of reaction and recovery; current status
and near-term research needs in biochemical engineering.
