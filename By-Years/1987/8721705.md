Preliminary results of the measurement of distances of galaxy clusters in the
southern hemisphere suggest peculiar velocities of 500 to 1000 km/sec. These
relative distance measurements are based on the infrared Tully-Fisher relation,
in which the luminosities of galaxies correlate with their 21-centimeter neutral
hydrogen gas (HI) line widths. The clusters are mostly contained within the
Hydra-Centaurus supercluster region of the sky. A program to carry out and
extend these measurements will be completed. There are four elements in the
plan: 1) to optimize and better understand the Tully-Fisher relation as a
distance indicator, 2) to carry out detailed surface photometry of the galaxies,
3) to extend the number of clusters currently under study, and 4) to complete an
all sky sample of clusters of galaxies. The current preliminary results tend to
support those of Drs. Burstein, Davies, Dressler, Faber, Lynden-Bell, Terlevich
and Wegner, and suggest that elements of the Hydra Centaurus supercluster share
the motion of the Local Supercluster. With the completion of this program, the
frequency of such peculiar velocities larger than 250 km/sec on scales from 5-30
h-1 Mpc will place important constraints on the spectrum of the initial density
fluctuations from which galaxies and clusters have grown.
