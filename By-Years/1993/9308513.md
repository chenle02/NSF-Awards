9308513 Alaghband The analysis and prediction of performance of parallel
programs is the topic of this research proposal. The measure of how well a
correctly running parallel program will perform on a given architecture is a
complex task which requires an in-depth knowledge of parallel algorithm design,
programming language, and the underlying system and architecture. The focus of
this work is on generation of a model based software tool for analyzing and
extrapolating the performance of programs written in a specific parallel
language.
