New experiments will be developed for the laboratory portion of the
introductory sequence and into the junior laboratory course that are
particularly relevant to students interested in physical oceanography. These
include, specifically, the use of ultrasonic waves in water to study wave
properties such as refraction and diffraction and, in the junior laboratory, the
study of nonlinear acoustic interactions that are important in sonar design.
These experiments will provide the students in this unique program a strong
introduction to the world of physical oceanography.
