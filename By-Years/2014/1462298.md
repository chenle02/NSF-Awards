Medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) are wave-like
variations in ionospheric density and altitude that are widely observed from
high to low latitudes. This project addresses questions of their origin and
evolution by carrying out multi-site, multi-instrument investigations and
applying tomographic reconstructions. The project will include outreach
activities to students and the public in Puerto Rico. The tomographic technique
will enable a deeper understanding of the electrodynamics of MSTIDs by creating
wide area maps of the field-line integrated Pedersen conductivity independent of
magnetic-field geometry. The following questions regarding the three-dimensional
airglow structure will be addressed: (1) How does MSTID structure relate to the
spatial/temporal distribution of field-line integrated Pederson conductivity?
(2) Is MSTID plasma transport dominated by neutral winds or electrodynamics?
