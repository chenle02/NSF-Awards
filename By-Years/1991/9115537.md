This project explores a new immunomagnetic method for rapidly and efficiently
separating cells or biological macromolecules from a mixture. T he method uses
vesicles with antibodies Fc-receptors attached on them and with magnetic
nanoparticles encapsulated within the aqueous vesicles cores. The vesicles then
bind selectively on the antibodies attached to specific cells, which are then
separated magnetically. The magnetic vesicles are separated from the cells and
can be 'recycled'. A second method using ferritin molecules conjugated with Fc-
receptors, rather than vesicles with Fc-receptors, is also explored for
comparison. A model system of sheep red blood cells and chicken red blood cells
has been successfully separated. The mechanism of binding is investigated by
light and electron microscopy. Various separation schemes are explored. The
results are potentially applicable to clinical separations - e.g. cancer cells
from healthy cells, - biomedical research, and biotechnology.
