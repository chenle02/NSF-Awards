Algebraic geometry focuses on the study of solutions of polynomial equations.
Guiding questions in this fields are to understand the geometric objects, called
algebraic varieties, arising from polynomial equations and to classify such
shapes. This project also concerns applications to number theory, with hopes to
understand what the geometry of these shapes can tell us about the rational
number or integral solutions to these polynomial equations. These problems have
applications to other fields of math (e.g. differential geometry) as well as
physics (e.g. string theory).

Moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties are not as well
understood as their curve counterparts. The first overarching question in this
project is to the understand compactifications of moduli spaces of higher
dimensional algebraic varieties. The approaches taken will be a combination of
techniques arising from, e.g. the minimal model program (MMP), as well as
K-stability. In particular, the PI plans to understand explicit
compactifications in specific cases (e.g. K3 surfaces), and to study how to
interpolate between various compactifications in a modular way. The second
overarching question, is to investigate how geometry of higher dimensional
varieties and their moduli influences arithmetic, studying the rich interplay
between algebraic geometry, hyperbolicity, and arithmetic geometry.
