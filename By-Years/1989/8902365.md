Drs. Dolores Piperno and Deborah Pearsall will collaborate on a three year
project to develop the application of phytolith analysis to archaeological
materials. Phytoliths are small bodies of silica which are deposited within
plants and are usually preserved in soil after death and decomposition occurs.
Although one species of plant may produce phytoliths of many shapes, and very
few shapes are restricted to a single species, it is possible to examine
phytolith assemblages and make some species identifications. Drs. Piperno and
Pearsall will conduct a multistage research project to further archaeological
application of phytolith analysis. They will examine taxonomy, determine the
best methods of soil processing to extract phytoliths, develop improved
identification criteria, and finally work on quantification procedures. The
result will be a series of tools of direct archaeological use. Only under the
most unusual conditions are plant remains preserved in archaeological sites.
Thus, because plants play such an important dietary role, it is extremely
difficult to reconstruct prehistoric diets. In tropical areas of the world,
where preservation is extremely poor, this problem is particularly acute.
Phytoliths, because they are so durable, provide a potential way around this
problem and therefore merit attention. However, because of the lack of one to
one correspondence between phytolith species, analysis poses difficulties. This
research should help to solve this problem. The project is important because it
will provide archaeologists as well as paleobiologists with a valuable tool
which should be useful in many parts of the world and periods of time.
