This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal. The
proposed research is in the field of mathematics and will be concerned with
graph transformations. In this study, a generalization of the line graph and the
r-partial line graph will be considered. These studies have applications to the
development of efficient computer programs for finding the components of a graph
and computing the r-partial line graph. The Planning Grant will first allow the
principal investigator to broaden his scientific horizons by providing funds for
travel and release time so that he may visit other universities and attend as
many conferences as possible. In addition, the planning process will include
preliminary studies of problem formulations and solutions. These experiences
will be incorporated, overall, in the development of a competitive proposal for
submission to the MRI research initiation component.
