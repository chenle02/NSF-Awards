This Small Innovation Technology Transfer (STTR) project will demonstrate the
utility of infrared planar array technology to study water pollutants such as
industrial contaminants and biological impurities. It proposes to optimize the
design and construction of a compact, high-sensitivity, double beam infrared
instrument based on focal plane array detection, which meets or exceeds
performance standards of commercially available Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR) solutions and is able to operate in ambient environments to
provide measurements of dilute concentrations of organic and biological
contaminants.

If successful the outcome of this project will enable real time effluent
detection from a manufacturing site such as that found at chemical companies who
could realize tangible and intangible savings from being able to pro-actively
identify and measure the presence of pollutants. A portable Planar Array
Infrared (PA-IR) spectrograph could be used to measure contaminants in rivers,
streams and ponds, thereby providing ?real time? feedback on changes in the
environment. The World Laboratory Analytical Instrument Market is estimated to
be $9.36B in 2008. IR spectroscopy is estimated to be $738MM.
