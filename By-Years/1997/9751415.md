In 1993, a new approach to introductory Cellular and Molecular Biology
laboratories was initiated in the Department of Biology. In 2-week modules,
students learned assay methods, then designed and executed experiments. This
generated material for work on scientific communication skills, culminating in
either research poster sessions or papers in the style of the primapy research
literature. The opportunity to design and test their own hypotheses generated
considerable enthusiasm among biology majors for open-ended investigation. This
has been evidenced by above-capacity enrollment pressures in related courses and
increased student research production, particularly in cell biology and in
immunology. Interest and enrollment in these courses has continually increased,
challenging faculty to create laboratory experiences that take students to a
higher level of independence, and straining the limits of departmental space and
available equipment. A new science building offers an opportunity to expand
independent investigation within these courses. This project creates a cell
culture facility in the new instructional laboratory space for Cell Biology and
Immunology and equips it for microspectrophotometry, thermal cycling, and
computer analysis. New laboratory experiences at the junior and senior level
involve more students, working in small groups, in increasingly sophisticated
and up-to-date preparation. Cell Biology is a prerequisite for Immunology;
changes in the laboratory curriculum are designed to improve this linkage as
students develop laboratory investigation skills. An emphasis on cell culture
and cellular /molecular techniques is expected to reduce the need for vertebrate
animal experiments in Immunology. The improvements to instructional laboratory
facilities also has significant benefits for student research involving cell
culture, including a special January-term Introduction to Biological Research,
which targets beginning biology majors for hands-on research experiences. *
