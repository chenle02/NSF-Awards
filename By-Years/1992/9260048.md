The objective of the proposed research will be to experimentally determine the
usefulness of solid oxide fuel cells for promoting the efficient electrochemical
conversion of methane base fuels to electricity over the temperature range of
600-900 degrees C. Experimental emphasis will be on anode electrocatalysts which
incorporate lattice substituents which have shown previous evidence for direct
oxidation of methane and their steam reform products in the absence of carbon
deposition. Fuel cells will be based on perovskites and a perovskite related
brownmillerite.
