This dissertation project investigates the relationship between technology and
culture by examining the development and transfer of electronic automatic
control technology between the United States and Japan in the period of
1920-1965. Although Japanese business imported large quantities of control
technology from America during the 1920's, the material, managerial, and
scientific circumstances under which engineers used these technologies differed
substantially between Japan and the United States. Different conditions produced
different technologies appropriate to these societies' technological
capabilities. In addition, in each country industrialists, bureaucrats, and
academics created distinctive interpretations of control suitable to their
particular social, cultural, and political situations. This study will use
control technology as a vehicle for understanding the material and sociocultural
transformations necessary to move technologies between societies. The central
hypothesis is that for imported technology to be useful, its recipients must
reorganize and adapt it to suit their particular needs. At the same time,
however, the recipients must reevaluate the technology in light of its new role
in their society, creating a new set of meanings that define the terms under
which the technology will be applied. In so doing, the users transform their
relationships to themselves, to each other, and to the technology itself.
