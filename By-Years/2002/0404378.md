The objective of this research is to achieve direct excitation of surface
plasmons (or surface plasma waves) from quantum dots. The approach to
accomplishing this task starts with the high quality quantum dots grown using
the Stranski-Krastanow self-assembly mechanism occurring during molecular beam
epitaxy of the InAs/GaInAs/GaAs materials system in our laboratory. Combined
with available e-beam lithography and imaging interferometric lithography,
nanophotonic structures and devices investigating coupling will be grown,
fabricated and characterized. Modeling using rigorous techniques evolved from
coupled wave approaches will help in understanding of physical mechanisms such
as dipole-dipole interactions coupling quantum dots and surface plasmons.
Successfully achieving such a device structure may allow direct electrical
excitation of surface plasmons and make possible several new devices replacing
plasmon sensors based on attenuated total reflection. Furthermore, the approach
taken by this program requires a level of understanding by the researcher of the
interplay between materials, device, and electromagnetic properties that offers
exceptional opportunities for the broad-based education of graduate students and
postdoctoral associates. The University of New Mexico fulfills a key
responsibility in the successful education of underrepresented groups at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our program strongly aligns with the
outreach efforts of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure network node
recently established at the University of New Mexico that serves as a conduit
for outreach to local public schools, but also has strong ties to local media
that should aid in furthering public awareness and understanding of important
developments in nanophotonics.
