Volcanic Conduit Processes and Strombolian Eruption
Cycles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207734&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Harris &amp;
Houghton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our aim in this project is to
understand the driving forces behind volcanoes that display persistent,
strombolian activity. Such activity is characterized by repeated, mildly
explosive events. For such repetitive explosive activity to be maintained over
hundreds-to-thousands of years, as it has been at Stromboli Volcano (Italy), a
volcano must be fed by a stable supply of magma and gas. It has not yet been
determined, however, whether this supply occurs by the repeated rise of discrete
magma batches or by a continuous stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial
measurements by us at Stromboli during May 1999 indicated that the magma supply
to the shallow system may indeed be variable over minutes-to-hour long periods
(i.e. it may be batch-like). These supply variations may in turn drive observed
variations in the style and frequency of explosive activity. This has led us to
develop a working hypothesis that fresh, gas-rich magma batches do rise from
depth as discrete pulses, causing fluctuating levels of degassing and hence
explosive activity upon their arrival. Our current project builds on those
initial measurements by adding new geophysical instrumentation together with
more detailed examination of volcanic products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
particular, we will use thermal and infrasound measurements, plus studies of the
textures of the erupted lava bombs to examine explosive activity at Stromboli
and infer variations in magma level within the conduit. Thermal data acquired
during the persistent degassing that occurs between strombolian explosions will
be used to characterize periods of enhanced gas escape. Finally, we will use
vesicle (gas bubble) and crystal size distributions in the bombs to constrain
the extent of mixing between newly arrived magma batches and long-resident magma
within the shallow system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
