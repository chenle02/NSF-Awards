Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number DEB-0108417&lt;br/&gt;H. F.
Howe&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois - Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRB:
MECHANISMS OF VOLE SUPPRESION OF TALL GRASS
DICOTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental restoration uses land reclamation
techniques to test fundamental ecological theory, and thereby inform management
practices. Here, we propose to maintain a highly successful example of such an
attempt to (1) determine the mechanism of suppression of tallgrass vegetation by
voles, and (2) follow the study for sufficient time to detect an anticipated
numerical response by prairie species. Selective herbivory by voles can reduce
the biomass of preferred forage species and reduce plant diversity. Subsequent
increases in voles to peak densities can have an ungulate-like effect, with up
to a 98% reduction in standing crop in vole-accessible plots compared to the
situation in vole-protected areas. To evaluate the mechanism of suppression that
explains why target species are reduce to rosettes in some plots but manage to
grow, flower, and seed in others, we will use individual hardware cloth
exclosures that protect shoots of target species as they emerge, with a
scheduled removal of protection at two week intervals. The experiment will be
maintained for three years, thereby allowing an asssessment of the numerical
response of prairie species./&lt;br/&gt;
