Homologous chromosomes exchange segments with each other via "generalized
genetic recombination." This process is especially accessible in the bacterial
virus lambda because of its physical simplicity and our intimate knowledge of
that virus. Our work has established that each of the four identified enzymatic
pathways that effect recombination in lambda is stimulated by DNA double-chain
breaks and suggests the view that all spontaneous generalized recombination is
dependent upon such breaks. The role played by these is not the same in all the
pathways. In three of the pathways ("Red-like pathways") the breaks participate
directly in the recombination event while in the other pathway (RecBCD) the
break acts as an entry site for an enzyme that moves along the DNA effecting
recombination after it is activated by a specific nucleotide sequence (Chi) at
an arbitrary distance from the break. For both types of pathway highly defined
models have been offered. This grant seeks to test those models and alternate
versions of them. A unifying model supposes that in both types of pathway
homologous pairing is established between duplexes at arbitrary distance from
the double chain-break. In Red-like pathways, these regions of pairing are
committed to recombination by degradation of one chain of the cut molecule from
the cut to the region of pairing. In the RecBCD pathway, the RecBCD enzyme,
which enters at the cut, resolves these regions without recombination, unless
the enzyme has lost the D subunit as a result of passing Chi or a Chi-like
sequence.
