The Mathematics Department at Western Piedmont Community College requires
extensive use of calculators in all transfer mathematics courses. College
algebra students and calculus students are required to have graphing calculators
while other students are required to have scientific calculators with linear
regression capability. The integration of computer usage into the mathematics
curriculum is the next logical step in the evolution of the College's
mathematics program. To achieve this goal, the Western Piedmont Community
College Computer Enhanced Mathematics Instruction Project (CEMIP) will enable
the department to equip a multipurpose instructional computer laboratory by
providing matching funds for the purchase of 21 microcomputers, four printers, a
VGA liquid display panel with-an overhead projector, and site licenses for three
commercial software packages DERIVE, MAPLE, and MINITAB. The lab will be used as
a teaching classroom, an assigned computer usage lab, and limited-access lab
open for selected mathematics students. Initially, the project will concentrate
on incorporating computer usage into calculus and statistics instruction, with
the ultimate goal of having computer usage integrated into the entire
mathematics curriculum.
