9528954 Meltzer This grant provides partial support for the costs of acquiring
hardware and software to upgrade the Lehigh seismology laboratory. Specifically,
a new IBM 3CT RS/6000 workstation with mass storage system, Power MAC 9500,
color plotter, OMEGA 3-D imaging software for analysis of seismic data, and
other peripherals will be purchased for use in the PI's research using high
resolution seismic reflection and refraction data for interpreting upper crustal
structure. Powerful new workstations with an abundance of memory and data
storage capabilities are required to begin to analyze seismic data three
dimensionally. 3-D seismic data processing will be immediately useful to the
PI's current research which includes analyses of the crustal structure around
the Mendocino Triple Junction where a transition occurs from subduction to
transform tectonics and studies of crustal faulting during active orogenesis in
the northwest Himalayas. It will also provide new insight into the structure of
the uppermost crust for studies of environmental and societal significance such
as fluid migration along shallow faults and high resolution stratigraphy. ***
