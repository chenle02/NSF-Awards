After an initial buildup in the number of firms, new industries commonly
experience a ~shakeout~ in which the number of firms declines sharply. Shakeouts
reflect an abrupt change in market structure, and thus explaining them promises
to illuminate the forces shaping market structure. Following a long tradition of
theorizing about the connections between market structure and technological
change, recent theories featuring technological change have been proposed to
explain shakeouts. This project focuses on the development and test of a new
theory of shakeouts featuring technological change that has quite different
implications regarding firm survival than the competing theories. A preliminary
version of the new model is developed and its distinctive implications
concerning firm survival are derived. These are contrasted with the firm
survival implications of the competing theories. In order to test the alterative
theories, data are collected on the entry and exit dates of all the producers of
five products that were subject to considerable innovation and experienced
severe shakeouts: autos, tires, televisions, typewriters, and penicillin. In
addition to studying products that experienced severe shakeouts, two
technologically progressive products that have not yet experienced shakeouts are
analyzed: lasers and petrochemical styrene. Hypotheses are advanced for why
these products have not experienced shakeouts and a plan is laid out to test
these hypotheses using detailed data on entry and firm survival for lasers and
styrene.
