Shaffer and Rank will use a willow leaf beetle (Chrysomela aenicollis) to study
the effects of local environment conditions on the costs and benefits of animal
social behavior. These beetles feed on high elevation willows in the Sierra
Nevada mountains of Eastern California. The larvae use a chemical, salicin, from
the willows to protect themselves from potential predators. Additionally, these
beetles cluster their eggs and feed in groups as larvae, which probably makes
the chemical defense more effective. They will study how the costs and benefits
of larval social behavior depend on the leaf chemistry of their host plants. To
do this, they will conduct experiments in nature measuring larval and egg
survivorship among groups of different sizes on willows with different amounts
of salicin in the leaves. They will also use a biochemical technique, gel
electrophoresis, to study the evolutionary relationships between beetle
populations in several mountain canyons. Their results should contribute
substantially to the field of plant-herbivore interaction.
