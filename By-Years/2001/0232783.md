This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
process to generate bulk quantities of Metallo-Carbohederenes (met-cars). The
project will use a particle and deposition technology, called Laser Assisted
Molecular Beam Deposition, which is ideal for producing met-cars on the
nanoparticle size scale. The unique structure of the met-cars makes them
applicable for a variety of applications requiring activated metals. However, to
date, in spite of several attempts, no one has been able to produce bulk
quantities of this material for study and commercialization. The commercial and
broader impacts of this technology will be the production capability for Met-
cars nanopowders, which will have a market in the areas of activated metal and
catalysis and promising applications in the field of nanofabrication.
