9451606 Campbell A high-resolution germanium photon detector and associated
electronics will be acquired for use in a variety of experiments in the advanced
undergraduate laboratory as well as for independent studies. Among the
experiments to be done are the study of characteristic x rays from various
elements, determination of gamma-ray absorption coefficients, gamma-ray
spectroscopy of radioactive isotopes from environmental sources, Compton
scattering, and neutron activation. These experiments will give undergraduate
students hands-on experience with radioactivity and with modern high-resolution
spectroscopy applied to x rays and gamma rays.
