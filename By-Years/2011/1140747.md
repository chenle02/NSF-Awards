This proposal is for support of the US participation in the meeting Probability
and Analysis which will be held at the Stefan Banach Mathematical Research and
Conference Center of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of
Sciences located in Bedlewo, Poland on June 10-16, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;The
conference will center on a number of topics that lie on the interface of
Functional Analysis, Probability, Harmonic Analysis, and applications. The
organizers expect about 20-25 participants from USA, out of the anticipated
total number of 80-110 participants. This proposal seeks funds to provide
partial support for 15-20 US participants, with priority given to graduate
students, junior researchers, and, once the needs of those groups are met, to
other US participants without sufficient sources of support.
