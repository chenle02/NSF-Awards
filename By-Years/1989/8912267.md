Research programs of five principal investigators at the University of Wisconsin
(Madison) focus on the secondary chemistry (allelochemicals) of plants. These
programs involve studies of: 1. Effects of genetic factors and environmental
stresses plant secondary chemistry. 2. Consequences of variation in plant
chemistry for plant resistance to insect and mammalian herbivores. 3. Genetic
engineering and in vitro production of unique organic compounds by plants. The
requests HPTLC system is essential for expeditious progress in these research
areas because it is the only analytical system capable of rapid chromatographic
analysis of the large numbers of samples required. Moreover, it is ideally
suited for analysis of labile compounds, which are central to the work of
several of the research programs. Without the capabilities offered by HPTLC,
progress in the respective research areas will be seriously impeded.//
