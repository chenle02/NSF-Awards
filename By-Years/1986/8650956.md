The field of biochemistry has advanced significantly in the last decade. Much of
the progress is directly attributable to the development of techniques with
greatly enhanced power of resolution and speed of analysis. Integration of
computer-assisted data collection and data analysis capability in modern
equipment has further revolutionized the conduct of biochemical experimentation.
The Mount Holyoke faculty provides a rigorous biochemistry curriculum with heavy
emphasis on laboratory experience -- one that is regularly reviewed and updated.
Thus in the upper-level biochemistry courses, the lecture coverage in general
has kept pace with the rapidly advancing field. In contrast, the laboratory
exercises, although sound and current in design, had been poorly implemented due
to old instrumentation. This award provides funds for major equipment
acquisitions needed to drastically upgrade the laboratory facility. The improved
facility makes possible the rigorous probing of experimental questions by modern
means of analysis. Furthermore, the use of computer-enhanced analytical
capability is being emphasized. The College enjoys an enviable record for
producing women scientists -- a record that should be further enhanced through
this project.
