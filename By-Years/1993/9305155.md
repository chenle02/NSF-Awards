9305155 Wong This award provides partial funding to construct a servo-
controlled pressure generation system and to purchase equipment to upgrade an
experimental facility for the study of brittle rock deformation under confining
pressure. The upgraded testing apparatus is to be installed and operated in the
Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the State University of New York in
Stony Brook. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
for the equipment upgrade. The apparatus is needed for research in the Principal
Investigator's laboratory on the mechanism of rock rupture as the cause of
earthquakes. ***
