The study will attempt to answer the question whether planktonic foraminaferal
productivity and isotopic composition accurately record seasonal variations of
surface water temperatures. Stable isotopic analyses will be performed on
planktonic foraminafera samples collected earlier and the PI will continue
sediment trapping for additional annual cycle by deploying sediment traps in the
equatorial Atlantic on other funded cruises of opportunity.
