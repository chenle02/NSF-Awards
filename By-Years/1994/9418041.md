Guckenheimer 9418041 In this multidisciplinary project, the investigator and
his colleagues at Cornell University together with Peck at Ithaca College focus
upon studies of the stomatogastric ganglion. This small neural network with
approximately 30 neurons is a central pattern generator that coordinates
movement of the gastric mill and pylorus of crustacea. The investigators
construct compartmental models of individual neurons based upon experimental
measurements and amalgamate these into models for subnetworks. These systems
provide a testbed for the development of algorithms to explore the bifurcations
of dynamical systems. Particular attention is given to those aspects of the
systems that involve multiple time scales. The goal of the project is to improve
understanding of dynamical processes in biological systems, with an emphasis
upon neural systems. The investigators work in a multidisciplinary setting,
combining experiment and mathematical modeling, giving due attention to both
mathematics and neuroscience, and ensuring that the two interact at all times in
the work. The larger goals are pursued in the context of specific qystems,
namely the study of a small neural circuit that controls rhythmic motions in the
foregut of lobsters. This model system has been chosen for its modest size and
accessibility for experimental manipulation. The project aims to understand how
neural systems switch among motor patterns and how they regulate these patterns.
