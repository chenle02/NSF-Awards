The project is supporting a workshop to explore the opportunities and challenges
that are presented by the use of games and game-based solutions in engineering
and computer science education. It addresses a critical need to assess the
current state of video game use in these disciplines and identify future
research directions. The workshop is bringing together a diverse group of
twenty-five participants from engineering, computer science, science and
instructional design who share a common interest in the use of games and related
technologies in education. The workshop is working to identify challenges facing
educators and researchers when it comes to the design, development,
implementation, and assessment of games and game-based solutions in engineering
and computer science education. The investigators are posting workshop materials
on a website and preparing conference presentations and a review article for
publication.
