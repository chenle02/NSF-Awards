This project constitutes a three and one-half day workshop on interfacial
phenomena in new and emerging technologies to be held in August 1985, at the
University of Colorado in Boulder. The purpose of this workshop is to create an
awareness in the research community in interfacial science as to where research
can be applied in new and emerging technologies, and to assist NSF management in
the possible focus of its program planning and assessment in this area of
fundamental research. Specific topics to be addressed at this workshop include
interfacial phenomena in the microelectronics industry; in material corrosion,
fatigue and failure; in polymeric membrane technology; in biotechnology and
biomedical technology; in energy conversion; in interfacial phenomena in space
processing; and in other areas.
