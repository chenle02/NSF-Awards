In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, theoretical and experimental studies of small clusters will be made in
order to derive potential energy parameters which might form the basis for
functional group transferable intermolecular potentials. One of the main
objectives of this study is to develop a quantitative understanding of hydrogen
bonding. Quantum and semiclassical simulation methods will be used to predict
cluster spectra and determine accurate potential energy surfaces for several
organic molecules. High resolution infrared spectra of clusters formed from
these molecules will be measured using laser-molecular beam techniques. The
experimental and theoretical results will be combined to develop group-
transferable potential energy surfaces that can be used in studies of energy
relaxation and in molecular modelling codes. %%% One of the most fluorishing
areas in physical chemistry is the study of the formation, structure, and
dynamics of clusters in small molecular systems. Such species are important in
atmospheric and combustion chemistry and their properties can more easily be
calculated with present theories. The proposed studies will provide data which
can be compared with existing theories to test their validity and to stimulate
more sophisticated models. These models will ultimately lead to a detailed
understanding of environmentally and biologically significant systems.
