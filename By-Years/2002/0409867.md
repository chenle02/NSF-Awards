This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is
entitled "Applications of spatially explicit models to the sustainable
harvesting and restoration of tropical forest ecosystems." The biological wealth
of tropical forest ecosystems is threatened by the selective harvesting of
timber and non-timber products (NTFPs) such as fruits and leaves. Sustainable
management of harvested species requires balancing harvesting and the ecology of
tropical forests, in concert with knowledge about spatial arrangement of
populations and landscape features with respect to patterns of human resource
use. The research objective is to inform the sustainable management of tropical
forests by creating models of the harvesting of tropical forest products that
consider the spatial arrangement of harvesting regimes in relation to the
disturbance-mediated spatial distribution of the tropical forest resource using
mangroves as models for timber and under-story palms as models for NTFP
harvesting in Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;
