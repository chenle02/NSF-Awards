This is a travel award for exploratory visits to the Imperial College Center for
Population Biology in England and to the Rockefeller University Laboratory of
Populations to visit faculty and examine facilities. Initial contacts have been
made with Professors John Lawton and Bob May at the Imperial College, and with
Professor Joel Cohen at Rockefeller Graham Walker, all of whom have expressed an
interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor for Mr. Martinez. Travel is also
planned to present a paper at the Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of
America, which will provide additional opportunities for contacts with potential
mentors.
