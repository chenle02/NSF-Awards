This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
continues support for studies of catalytic reaction mechanisms by Dr. Richard R.
Schrock of the Chemistry Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Four
areas of investigation will be pursued. Efforts to synthesize molybdenum
catalysts that produce enantiomerically pure products for ring closing
metathesis of dienes will be continued. Second, the organometallic chemistry of
complexes containing a new boryl-substituted diamido ligand will be studied in
order to test the activity of such species for the polymerization of alpha-
olefins. The third area of investigation compares the reactivity of
triamidoamine complexes containing molybdenum to those containing tungsten. The
fourth project involves the synthesis and reactions of new complexes containing
a planar triamido ligand. Catalysts are important in the synthesis of specific
reaction products and their use can result in significant energy and chemical
savings. The goal of this work is to systematically design groups attached to
active metal centers in order to control their catalytic effects. The specific
systems studied contain nitrogen-based (amido) ligands and early transition
metals.
