Abstract

Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure Title: CRI:
Developing the Lemur Toolkit into a Community Resource Proposal: CNS 0454114 PI:
Russ Miller Institution: SUNY at Buffalo

This project builds on the Western New York Bio-informatics and Life Sciences
initiative headquartered in Buffalo, NY. Partners include SUNY-Buffalo, Niagara
University, and SUNY-Geneseo. Collaborators include the Roswell Park Cancer
Institute, the Center for Computational Research at SUNY-Buffalo, and the
Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute The project will focus on the
design, analysis and implementation of a computational and data grid serving the
research, teaching, education and outreach needs of computer science,
technology, bioinformatics, and life sciences in western New York. Research will
include enabling technologies for lightweight, efficient monitoring of a the
grid, methods to allow subsets of processors to seamlessly join and leave the
grid, data collection and mining to support predictive scheduling, improve
backfill usage, and providing a ubiquitous interface to users. Applications
supported include bioinformatics, structural biology and life sciences. Broader
impacts include outreach activities to the K-16 programs, a certificate program
in high-performance computing, and diverse recruiting.
