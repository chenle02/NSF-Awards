This project is developing enrichment materials and methods that use the power
of Web-based tools to enhance students' preparation in science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology via a new hands-on virtual learning environment for
information technology (IT) networking education.

Online features are supporting teachers in leading IT networking courses and
supporting students in their learning. The goal is for innovative and scale-up
applications of new, low-cost technologies, such as console port Telnet session
sharing, to strengthen network training in a sample of community colleges and
secondary systems. Network equipment configuration activities rich with student
inquiry assignments are accessible through an online teacher and student support
Web site. Support to teachers and students in the form of mentoring and
moderated discussion is available. Innovative software is making possible remote
classroom sharing of multi-vendor network routing and switching equipment hosted
on the Internet. Flexible curriculum activities and pedagogical guidance are
enabling real-time instructor-led mentoring in the virtual classroom and virtual
laboratory environment. Students are benefiting by having multi-vendor access
experiences via remote connections, a typical "real world" professional work
mode. The pairing of realistic case problem curricula with Internet classroom
delivery tools is saving money for school systems while providing the most
realistic educational settings and scenarios. The reduction in laboratory
equipment costs is encouraging networking program start-ups at resource-limited
schools.
