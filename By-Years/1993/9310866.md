9310866 Holzwarth The mechanisms by which the central nervous system controls
growth and development of cells in endocrine organs is not well understood.
Since there is an extensive growth in the number of cells in the remaining
adrenal gland following unilateral adrenalectomy, this physiological system may
provide an excellent model to examine these underlying mechanisms. While it is
known that the compensatory growth of the remaining adrenal is mediated by
afferent and efferent autonomic adrenocortical nerves, the cellular mechanisms
by which these autonomic nerves initiate and regulate cell proliferation have
not been elucidated. During previous NSF support, Dr. Holzwarth identified a
potent growth factor in adrenal glands, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).
She will now determine whether the adrenocortical nerves activate this local
factor which then initiates the cell growth. Using state-of-the-art anatomical
and molecular techniques, she will assess the mechanisms responsible for the
proliferation of adrenocortical cells in vivo. Dr. Holzwarth will determine
whether the cell proliferation is inhibited by immunological blockage of the
growth factor. She will also measure how much bFGF is formed and where it is
localized during the initial stages of compensatory growth. Finally, Dr.
Holzwarth will determine whether cellular receptors present are altered during
this proliferation. These experiments will provide new insights into how the
nervous system controls cellular processes of non-neuronal cells as well as the
mechanisms by which cells process and utilized their endogenous growth-promoting
factors. Information gained from this work may eventually prove important in
developing methods to prevent abnormal cell proliferation. ***
