The goal of this project is to investigate the signature of mental states, using
the induction of transitions among states as an experimental strategy. The work
is driven by a novel network theory -- Network of Networks (NoN) -- that
emphasizes the importance of weak links. The project will identify a new network
paradigm with the concomitant identification of network markers and computations
that confer specificity and robustness to information transmission and gating
between different processing modules. The prospective interventions are designed
to provide strong empirical constraints on theories of brain network structure
beyond the specific NoN hypothesis tested here, including alternate network
models, e.g "scale-free" and "rich-club," in order to obtain falsifiable
predictions for the prospective interventions. The results can also be readily
applied to other systems ranging from metabolic, protein and genetic networks to
social networks and the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present study will
test specific predictions of network theory with regards to the correlation
structure of in-vivo functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and local field
potential (LFP) recordings. The investigators will determine network structure
and location of key nodes in the brain network topology by analyzing the
structural connectivity based on Connectome data from rodents combined with
functional connectivity. The proposed NoN framework will reveal the location of
such key nodes -- "superspreaders" and "superinhibitors" -- and make predictions
on cascading neural activity, robustness and vulnerability of the brain network.
