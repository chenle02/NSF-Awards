9400029 San Andres A combined experimental and analytical study will be
conducted of the flow mechanics of squeeze film dampers and their interaction
with the dynamics of a rotor-bearing system. Operational regimes with dynamic
cavitation will be emphasized. Linear and nonlinear interactions between the
rotor and dampers will be quantified in the frequency domain. ***
