Finding numerical solutions is most efficient when the points where the
function is to be evaluated are well-chosen; often this means using an adaptive
plan where each choice may be modified based on the previous choices and
calculations already made. The object of this project is to develop an efficient
new methodology for generating the sequence of choices of points adaptively. The
development of an adaptive strategy involving direct control over grid size
should improve the accuracy of numerical solutions while reducing computer time
and storage. This project will develop such an adaptive grid procedure which
also ensures entanglement-free grids.
