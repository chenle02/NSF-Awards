The study of the cosmological Dark Ages is gaining momentum, fueled by recent
observational breakthroughs and strides in computing power. This project has
three main themes. Firstly, observations now suggest that the reionization
history of the Universe progressed in a non-monotonic manner, and simulations
and semi-analytic models will be developed and used to test possible
contributing effects. Secondly, optical depth effects and photon trapping will
be added to simulations of early star formation, to try to make those studies
more realistic. Finally, brightness temperature fluctuations due to the free-
free contribution from the reionization epoch will be modeled in detail, for
comparison to planned observations. This research could significantly alter the
standard picture of how early star formation is thought to proceed. It has a
direct impact on the interpretation of recent observations, and bears upon
future instruments, possibly influencing their design and observational
strategies.

Collaboration meetings will strengthen ties with researchers on the East Coast
and in Japan. The Dark Ages is a glamorous subject, ideally suited for its
intended use in public talks and journalism, planned in conjunction with the
host institution's strong outreach program.
