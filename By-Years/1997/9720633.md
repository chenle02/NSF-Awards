9720633 Olster The energetic costs of reproduction for a female mammal are
enormous. Thus, it is not surprising that in many animals, reproduction is
influenced by factors related to energy balance, such as food intake, body
weight, energy expenditure, and metabolism. Animals that are undernourished or
obese often suffer from reproductive abnormalities. The experiments described by
Dr. Olster will use the genetically obese Zucker rat to explore the interaction
between obesity and abnormal reproductive function. Females of this strain
overeat, expend less energy than normal and are obese. These animals exhibit
many other abnormalities, including overproduction of insulin and corticosterone
(hormones related to the use and storage of nutrients obtained from the diet),
insulin resistance, and higher than normal concentrations of neuropeptide Y, a
hypothalamic neurochemical that stimulates food intake. Finally, obese Zucker
females are infertile. Previous research from this laboratory has demonstrated
that these animals have delayed puberty, do not ovulate regularly, and show
minimal mating behavior with males. When normal (i.e., lean) rats are
experimentally given extra neuropeptide Y, they exhibit a syndrome that is very
similar to the abnormal metabolic and reproductive physiology of obese Zucker
rats, namely overeating, obesity, oversecretion of insulin and corticosterone,
insulin resistance, aberrant reproductive cyclicity and impaired sexual
behaviors. The experiments in this proposal are designed to explore the roles of
neuropeptide Y, insulin and corticosterone in reproductive dysfunction in obese
Zucker rats, with an emphasis on sexual behaviors. These substances will be
experimentally manipulated in an effort to improve the reproductive capacity of
obese Zucker rats and/or induce reproductive abnormalities in lean females. The
knowledge gained from these studies will provide new, exciting information about
the signals (of brain, endocrine and/or metabolic origin) that convey i
nformation regarding energy balance to the systems regulating reproduction. This
cross-talk is of critical importance in allowing animals to reproduce only when
it is energetically appropriate to do so.
