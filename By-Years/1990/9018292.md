When a unidirectional current passes over a bed of coarse mixed-size sediment,
a variety of bed forms are generated, and there is segregation of particle sizes
among the load, the bed surface layer, and the substrate. There is a strong and
complex interdependence between the bed forms, the transported sediment, and the
substrate. Many studies in well sorted sands, both in the laboratory and in the
field, have led to fairly good understanding of the behavior of the familiar
dune bed forms and the interaction between bed forms and transport. More
recently, features variously described as bed-load sheets, gravel waves, and
clast jams have been reported in flows over poorly sorted sand-gravel mixtures.
The relationships among these seemingly diverse bed features, and their
dependence on size segregation in the bed, is unclear. This is an experimental
study of the nature of bed features in unidirectional flows as a function of
flow strength and sediment sorting involving several sediment mixtures with the
same mean size of about 4 mm but with widely varying sorting and making series
of runs at several mean flow velocities over each sediment mixture. The
objective is a unified picture of the fundamental characteristics and
interrelationships of the various kinds of bed features produced in these flows.
The work will be done in cooperation with Prof. Hiroshi Ikeda, Prof. Shigemi
Takayama and Dr. Fujiko Iseya of the Environmental Research center at the
University of Tsukuba. This proposal covers salary and travel for the PI and a
Graduate Research Assistant for two years. A companion proposal with identical
scientific text is being submitted by Prof. Peter R. Wilcock (The Johns Hopkins
University). The Japanese group already has funds for building the experimental
apparatus and conducting the experiments.
