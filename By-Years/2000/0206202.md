AST-0206202&lt;br/&gt;Deliyannis, Constantine&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Deliyannis is awarded funds at Indiana University in
Bloomington, Indiana to study the abundance of lithium (Li) in the members of
open star clusters. He will use the multi-object spectrograph on the Wisconsin-
Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5m telescope to make spectroscopic observations of up
to 100 stars simultaneously. Dr. Deliyannis is participating in the WIYN Open
Cluster Study (WOCS), a collaboration already underway by WIYN Consortium
members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will make detailed observations of the
Li abundance of stars of different ages in an attempt to understand the failures
of our current stellar structure and evolution models. Observations of 6 to 10
clusters of different ages will be made. Dr. Deliyannis will work to determine
the metallicity dependence of Li depletion, the development of the Li "gap" with
age, and the Li peak and plateau. &lt;br/&gt;
