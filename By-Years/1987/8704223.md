This research, part of the Physical Chemistry Experimental Program, will use
carbon-13 NMR to study orientational ordering of liquid crystals. The method to
be used involves the removal of proton-proton couplings, rapid sample spinning
near the magic angle and reduction of carbon-proton couplings, coupled with the
use of Fourier transform techniques to resolve peaks of different carbon atoms.
Several systems will be studied by this method including nematic liquid crystals
in the mesogenic core. The effects of substituents in the side chain of
ferroelectric liquid crystals will be correlated with their spontaneous
polarization. Orientational ordering of side chain liquid crystal polymers with
polyacrylate and polysiloxane backbones will be investigated. Chain ordering
calculations based upon molecular field theory will be performed to analyze the
experimental results.
