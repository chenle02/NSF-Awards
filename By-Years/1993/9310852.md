9310852 Melloch The School of Electrical Engineering at Purdue University will
purchase a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system that will be dedicated to
support research in engineering. The CVD system will be used for several
projects related to research and development of silicon carbide (SiC) devices
and integrated circuits. Two SiC researchers in the School of Electrical
Engineering at Purdue University are investigating, in which the CVD system wil
play an important role, are development of SiC charge-coupled ultra-violet
imager and a joint research effort with Cree Research, Inc. to develop a
1024-bit non-volatile one-transistor random-access memory chip. ***
