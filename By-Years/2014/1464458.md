The project will examine the seasonal composition of ambient aerosols at an
urban site in Maryland to better understand the contribution of aqueous-phase
reactions occurring in aerosols as a source secondary organic aerosol (SOA).
SOA, in contrast to gas-to-particle conversion, constitutes a major fraction of
fine (PM2.5um) particle mass in the atmosphere. However, an under-prediction of
SOA concentrations by state-of-the-art models indicates that a mechanistic
understanding of SOA formation pathways is lacking. The uptake and reaction of
soluble organic gases in aqueous aerosols is argued to be an important source of
SOA formation that traditional models have neglected. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SOA
constitutes a major fraction of fine (PM2.5um) particle mass in the atmosphere,
and impacts atmospheric visibility, radiation balance, and also human health.
This investigation meets the EAGER criteria because a key part of the analytical
work (i.e. fast switching of a tandem PILS ? particle into liquid sampler) the
proposal depends upon is exploratory in nature, and the approach largely
untested. If successful, this would also provide the foundation for a broader,
more comprehensive definition of the composition and the reactivity of water
soluble SOA transformation.
