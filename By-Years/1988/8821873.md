The timely production of quality braille greatly enhances blind people's access
to educational, work place, and other activities. The current level of
production of braille does not meet the need, particularly in the areas of
mathematics and science at all levels, beginning with early elementary grades.
The increasing existence of written material in machine readable form and the
availability of braille printers provide an opportunity to greatly automate and
increase the production of braille. The research will develop prototype software
which simplifies the production of both mathematical and non- mathematical
braille. It will require creating and integrating software tools for translating
print to its braille equivalent; properly showing format information in braille;
and making use of text files which were prepared for other purposes. Results of
this research and prototype development will lead to implementation and
distribution of flexible, easy-to-use braille translation implementation
software working on several microcomputers. Without any knowledge of the braille
rules, the software user will be able to produce quality braille, either by
typing in text for that purpose or by using existing computer files from other
software. Availability of braille translation software will provide blind
persons with more comprehensive access to the flood of readily available
information accessible to the sighted community and do so in a more useful time
frame.
