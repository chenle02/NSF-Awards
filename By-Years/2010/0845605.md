CCF - 0845605 &lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Design Framework for Organic Transistor
Based Integrated Circuits&lt;br/&gt;PI: Chris H. Kim&lt;br/&gt;INST: University
of Minnesota-Twin Cities &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Organic Field-
Effect-Transistors (OFET) have recently drawn much attention as their unique
attributes make them attractive for emerging large-area electronics such as
flexible display panels, organic ID tags, and electronic paper which were not
achievable using traditional silicon-based devices. Although the last decade has
seen a tremendous progress in OFET performance, there has not been any
significant research effort from the design community addressing challenges
associated with OFET systems. The goal of this project is to develop a
comprehensive design framework for future OFET systems in which the circuit
design knowledge, device compact models and design tools will be developed and
integrated into an OFET process design kit. The research and education
activities will be carried out in collaboration with the organic transistor
group at the University of Minnesota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is structured to maximize the impact on several sections of the general
scientific and engineering community, as well as on society, education and
outreach. The proposed research will produce prototype designs showcasing new
innovations in OFET electronics. Key achievements will be disseminated to the
public through the PI's research webpage. This project will proactively recruit
and nurture minorities (Afro-Americans, Hispanics, native Americans), women,
under-represented groups and members of K-12 organizations, as well as strongly
leverage existing university-wide efforts for diversity, service, and outreach.
New course materials on OFET electronics design will be developed for
undergraduate and graduate curriculum with special emphasis on training future
scientists and engineers with creative problem-solving skills in cross-
disciplinary areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
