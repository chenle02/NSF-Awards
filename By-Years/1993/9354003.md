9354003 Parks The University of Tennessee proposes to extend the Faculty
Enhancement Workshop entitled "Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory Experiments
Using Lasers" for two years, 1994 and 1995. The workshop emphasizes the
development and implementation of experiments utilizing lasers primarily
suitable for advanced undergraduate physics and chemistry laboratories. It is a
practical, hands-on experience where the participants perform approximately ten
unique laser-based experiments. It also features three construction projects,
holography, computed-aided instruction in laser safety, and field trips to
several nearby federal, state and private laser labs. ***
