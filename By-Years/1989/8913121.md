The investigator will study systems of partial differential equations which
describe the behavior of elastic materials. Particular emphasis will be on the
Reissner.Mindlin theory and related models for the bending of elastic plates and
shells. The investigations will include a qualitative analysis of the solutions
of the plate equations, design and analysis of numerical schemes for their
solution, and both analytical and computational studies of the relation between
solutions of the Reissner.Mindlin equations and the equations of three
dimensional elasticity. Specific goals include an analysis of the boundary layer
for the Reissner.Mindlin model near free and simply.supported edges, the
implementation of a recently developed optimal order finite element method for
this model which is uniform with respect to the plate thickness, and the design
and analysis of uniformly optimal order finite element methods of higher degree.
In addition the investigator will continue work on boundary element methods for
the numerical solution of time.dependent partial differential equations, with an
emphasis on applying recent theoretical advances to practical computation, and
will study applications of the boundary element approach to exact control
problems for such time.dependent equations.
