A suite of high-temperature creep experiments will investigate the rheology of
single crystals of clinopyroxene (diopside and hedenbergite) and orthopyroxene
(bronzite and enstatite) under carefully-controlled thermodynamic conditions at
1 atm. total pressure, to determine intracrystalline flow laws and mechanisms of
deformation appropriate to these minerals for extrapolation to upper mantle
conditions. In particular, the dependence of creep rate on oxygen partial
pressure and on the activity of silica will be measured. Olivine is generally
regarded as both the most abundant and weakest mineral in the upper mantle, so
that the rheology of the upper mantle is usually modelled using the results of
high-temperature deformation experiments on olivine single crystals and
polycrystals. However, in a chemically heterogeneous mantle, deformation in
regions with a locally high pyroxene content, such as subduction zones, will be
controlled by the deformation of pyroxenes.
