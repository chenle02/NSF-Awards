In this National Science Foundation New Young Investigator (NYI) project of the
Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division Prof. Yongqin Chen of the
University of California at Berkeley will investigate the transition state
chemistry in photodissociation and chemical reactions in real-time. This will be
accomplished with a new technique of his design, transient stimulated emission
pumping (TSEP), which enables the probing of chemical processes on a femtosecond
time scale. These investigations will be performed on gaseous systems as well as
on supercritical fluids. %%% Chemical reaction dynamics is at the forefront of
present research in chemistry. The details of how a chemical reaction proceeds
can only be studied on time scales which are of the order of the period of one
molecular vibration or less. To carry out such investigations requires
experimental techniques with ultra fast time resolution, on time scales ranging
from pico- to femtoseconds. The new TSEP technique possesses considerable
advantages over other, currently used techniques by, for example, generating an
entire stimulated emission spectrum simultaneously rather than by point-by-point
scanning.
