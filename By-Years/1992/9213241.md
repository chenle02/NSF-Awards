This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University to acquire Sparc II
workstations and some ancillary equipment. The areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1. Chemistry of Highly Reactive
Mononuclear and Polynuclear Transition Metal Cations 2. The Study of the
Molecular Basis of Procaryote/Eucaryote Interactions 3. Organic Ferromagnets and
Odd-Electron Sigma Bonds 4. Chemistry of Soluble Metal Polychalcogenides %%%
Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The workstations which will be purchased with this grant are
not only powerful and cost effective computers by themselves, but will serve
also as communication links to allow transfer of data to and from other
workstations and to provide access to remotely located more powerful computers.
