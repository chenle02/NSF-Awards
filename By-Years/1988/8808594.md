This work investigates the use of arrays of sensors for passive ranging. In
particular, it focuses on the use of a priori knowledge of assumed multipath
propagation conditions to improve range accuracy in the distant region where the
curvature of the wavefront is only slight. Significant performance gains have
been demonstrated in the past in a simplified underwater acoustic setting. This
study is evaluating the impact of incomplete a priori knowledge on the ability
to achieve theoretical gains. The study also is attempting to extend the method
to inverse mapping, i.e. determination of the channel parameters from signal
measurements.
