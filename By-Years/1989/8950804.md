The HPLC is integrated into the laboratory curriculum of the Chemistry, Civil
Engineering, and Computer Engineering Technologies. The students are provided
with "hands-on" experimentation with computer interfaced instrumentation and
with the use of HPLC for chemical analysis. This increased awareness of modern
methods of instrumental analysis prepares the students for the challenges they
face in industry and in continuing their education. This instrumentation is also
used for laboratory offerings for technicians and science teachers who enroll in
evening certificate programs. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
