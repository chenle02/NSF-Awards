This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project
competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research
through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding
organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global
environmental change challenges and opportunities. It aims to accelerate
delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical
barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources.
Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium
to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach
facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent
research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational
approach, recognizing that global challenges need global
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research
Action, the partner agencies have provided support to foster global
transdisciplinary research teams to address critical issues in ocean
sustainability including, conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas
and marine resources for sustainable development. This complex challenge
required that the projects utilized integrated, transdisciplinary and cross-
sectoral approaches and bring together natural and social sciences as well as
policymakers, resource managers, industries, citizens and other societal
partners. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in
consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating
countries to increase our knowledge of the complex linkages and pathways needed
to accelerate sustainable use of oceans and minimize the effects from global
change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing, merging and
synthesizing transdisciplinary, global knowledge for understanding the
consequences of human actions for coastal and ocean sustainability and produce
strategies and tools for effective management. Data analysis and model
development of coastal marine ecosystems will be conducted utilizing both
natural and social science expertise with the goal of defining the feedback
loops within different aspects of biodiversity change and Natureâ€™s Contributions
to People. This project will develop, merge and synthesize transdisciplinary,
global knowledge for understanding the consequences of human actions for coastal
and ocean sustainability and produce strategies and tools for effective
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
