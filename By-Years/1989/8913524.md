This grant will support research in the processing of new high temperature
ceramic superconductors. New techniques for processing these brittle ceramic
materials are needed in order to optimize the superconducting properties in
forms and shapes that are useful. This grant was selected from more than 260
proposals submitted in response to a solicitation for proposals in High
Temperature Superconductivity in April, 1989. The research is supported through
the Ceramics and Electronic Materials program with a significant contribution
from the university.
