CyberGIS, defined as geographic information science and systems (GIS) based on
advanced cyberinfrastructure, has emerged during the past several years as a
interdisciplinary field to improve research productivity and enable scientific
breakthroughs. CyberGIS represents a new-generation GIS in the era of big
compute and data for advancing data-intensive knowledge discovery, visualization
and visual analytics, and collaborative problem solving and decision-making.
While cyberGIS research is making advancements in a number of domains, it has
become increasingly important to understand broad education and workforce
development needs for cyberGIS across various communities.

This project will investigate curriculum aspects of cyberGIS and engage domain
experts and stakeholder representatives to develop a roadmap leading to
curriculum guidelines and resulting in recommendations for adoption in
undergraduate and graduate core courses in the U.S. and internationally. This
workshop effort will employ a community-driven approach to understanding how to
synthesize interdisciplinary education materials revolving around cyberGIS and
cyberinfrastructure. Therefore, the workshop will build on previous community
efforts and focus on community engagement, particularly in assessing new models
of curriculum development and adoption. The project intends to engage interests
from industry.
