This NSDL Services project is exploring how to increase the number and quality
of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education learning objects
by facilitating virtual communities of content developers. It is prototyping
support services for collaborations of teachers and researchers who are
developing learning objects in their discipline with an emphasis on open and
non-proprietary materials. An open course application service provider (ASP)
hosts the collaboration tools needed for each community. Services provided for
all communities include a directory of open course projects, a collection of
Web-based tools for student use, a consultant database to connect projects with
skilled experts, and a set of licenses suitable for open course learning
objects. The underlying concept of this project is rooted in the academic
tradition of open sharing of ideas and results of scholarly inquiry. This
project is enabling the NSDL to explore an infrastructure to support future
content acquisition for its collections.
