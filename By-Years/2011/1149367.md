This CAREER award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program of the
Division of Chemistry supports work by Professor Hao Chen at Ohio University for
the development of microsecond time-resolved mass spectrometry based on
ionization of a flying liquid jet generated from ultrafast mixing of reactant
solutions by an ambient ionization method. The proposed method is expected to
improve sampling resolution from current millisecond sampling to micro-second
time resolution. The sucessful development of the described technology will
facilitate the investigation of kinetics and mechanisms of fast biochemical
reactions, which may lead to a better understanding of protein
folding/unfolding, enzymatic catalysis and protein/DNA oxidation processes.

The work provides research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate
students, including members of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. Dr.
Chen is also actively involved in educational outreach activities, including
ChemShows/Workshops/Seminars for pre-college students to learn about modern
instrumental analysis and to develop enthusiasm for scientific research.
