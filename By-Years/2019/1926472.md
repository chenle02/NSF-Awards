This grant will provide partial travel support for 35 junior US-based
researchers (assistant professors, postdoctoral associates and graduate
students) to attend the 2019 Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design
(FOCAPD-19) Conference that will be held from July 14 to 18, 2019, in Copper
Mountain, Colorado. FOCAPD-19 will bring together the most important
international researchers in the field of process design. Process design is
being profoundly impacted by the convergence of high-performance computing and
advances in machine learning and optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
field of process design the demand is for cost-effective, energy efficient and
highly functional designs. This is coupled with an increased desire for rapid
innovation to translate advances in science into engineered products.
Furthermore, the demands of society are for zero-accident chemical production
combined with a low tolerance for product faults, particularly in the
pharmaceutical industry. The design process itself is also being driven to high
performance by global competition and adoption of streamlined digital
information management systems that link every increasing scope of design
problems, from the initial molecular discovery to process implementation. The
junior US-based researchers supported by this grant will have the opportunity to
interact with academic and industrial researchers from around the world and
exchange ideas on the latest advances on process design research and education.
The organizers expect to attract members of under-represented groups that they
may otherwise be unable to attend the Conference. The junior researchers will
have an opportunity to interact with each other and with more experienced
researchers in the field, which will positively influence their future
professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
