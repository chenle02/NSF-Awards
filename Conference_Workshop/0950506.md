This award is to support an international conference on several topics of active
current interest in noncommutative algebra, with broad connections to analysis,
combinatorics, geometry, mathematical physics, and topology. The focus of the
conference is recent exciting developments and emerging future directions,
particularly in such areas as representations of algebras, noncommutative
algebraic geometry, homological and categorical techniques for Hopf algebras,
and von Neumann regular algebras. One purpose of the conference is to generate
new research in noncommutative algebra and related areas.

The conference will bring together a large number of participants, including
the leading experts from different specialties within noncommutative algebra,
encouraging interactions between participants from a broad range of perspectives
and approaches. The organizers intend for this conference to create
opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, young researchers,
and mathematicians from underrepresented groups to communicate and receive
feedback on their ideas. This conference will emphasize new ideas and new
developments and help to identify new directions in noncommutative algebra.
