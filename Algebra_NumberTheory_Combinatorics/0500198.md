The main aim of the proposal is to study interactions of algebraic geometry with
differential geometry and with number theory. First, the proposal aims to
explore further the connections between Kaehler--Einstein metrics on Fano
orbifolds and Einstein metrics on odd dimensional manifolds that can be realized
as orbifold cicrle bundles over algebraic varieties. Another aim is to study the
interactions between the geometry of a variety (for instance group actions or
Gromov--Witten invariants) and arithmetic problems about the existence of points
and rational curves defined over special fields.

If we make a banana or a box out of stretchable material and we start blowing it
up, eventually it starts to look like a sphere. This happens because the sphere
is the most symmetric way of realizing this shape in space, where the surface
tension is most evenly distributed. For arbitrary shapes and in higher
dimensions, Einstein wrote down certain conditions for the optimal realizations.
These are now called Einstein metrics. Recently (with Boyer and Galicki) I have
discovered a new method to contruct such Einstein metrics for many different
shapes. A main aim of the proposal is to understand the applicability, scope and
limitations of this method.
