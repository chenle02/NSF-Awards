The Show-Me Lectures is a series of meetings in mathematical analysis organized
by the following four institutions: the University of Missouri-Columbia, the
University of Missouri-St. Louis, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and
Washington University in St. Louis. Several lectures have been delivered in
previous Show-Me meetings on many topics of Analysis, such as analysis on
groups, Banach space theory, differential equations, harmonic analysis, and
probability theory. These lectures were presented by prominent mathematicians
from all over the world. Attendance was not restricted to specialists from one
field or another but was amimed at a general audience who wanted to learn more
about another area and explore possible connections with theirs. Such
connections have certainly appeared in many instances and in several occasions
have led to fruitful discussions and collaborations. Many quality collaborations
have been accomplished as a result of these meetings and several more have been
initiated. It is our belief that these collaborations benefit not only the
researchers involved but also strengthen and unify the field of mathematical
analysis as an entity.



Mathematical analysis can be viewed as the part of mathematics whose primary
roots lie in calculus. Its principal concepts are derivatives and integrals,
which appear in a multitude of different settings. Mathematical analysis
provides the foundation for applied mathematics, physics, astronomy and other
areas, and is one of the more dynamic, viable, and applicable areas of
mathematics today. Among the many subspecialties of analysis of importance to
science and pure mathematics, one may cite the theory of integral transforms,
which plays a major role in tomography, the theory of wavelets, which in recent
years has revolutionized the study of signal processing, and the theory of
Banach spaces, in which mathematicians have constructed a richly endowed
universe with infinitely many dimensions. Recent Showme seminars have included
principal lectures on each of these subjects, and on numerous other topics in
analysis, by distinguished mathematicians, some from various of our four
universities in Missouri and some from further afield. The primary objective of
the Showme meetings is to stimulate, promote, and enhance interaction between
the different groups of mathematical analysis. In addition to the stimulating
lectures, these meetings are providing splendid opportunites for the analysts in
Missouri and nearby states to learn about each other's work and to initiate
collaborations. We anticipate many more fruitful seminars in times to come.
