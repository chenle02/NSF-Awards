Susan Atlas of the University of New Mexico and Steven Valone of Los Alamos
National Laboratory are supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop novel theoretical
methodology to treat charge-transfer effects in molecular motor systems. This
Nanoscale Exploratory Research grant will enable construction of potentials
designed for self-consistent, dynamical charge transfer simulations in nanoscale
biophysical systems ranging from glycine to kinesin and myosin using
parallelized molecular dynamics simulation computer
codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This high risk/high impact research will aid in
developing a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which molecular motors
convert chemical energy into directed motion. It represents an important initial
step in verifying the methodology of charge-transfer potentials on a small but
biochemically relevant molecular system.
