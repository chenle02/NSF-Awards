The PI?s request funding to provide partial support for the Interagency Ocean
Observation Committee (IOOC) support office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean
Leadership (COL). The IOOC Support Office will continue to provide project
management by drafting updates to the SOST, drafting responses to SOST taskings,
tracking interagency progress related to IOOC projects, developing reports, and
coordinating IOOC actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interagency collaboration is essential to achieve
ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and
coordination of an ocean observation system. The IOOC support office provides
administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning
activities. An IOOC that is able to effectively support these goals will make
meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime
operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and
natural resources.
