High precision temperature and salinity profiles are some of the most commonly
collected and important data in many ocean science investigations. This work
will develop a capability to solve a long standing problem in collecting such
data at sea. The response times of temperature sensors and conductivity sensors
are significantly different, so data mismatches commonly occur when these
sensors are simultaneously mounted on a CTD profiler. A new calibration
capability will investigate the dynamic response of commonly used thermometers
and conductivity sensors. Results will be used to improve present techniques for
removing salinity errors arising from the mismatch in sensor time constants. The
facility will be useful in testing probes prior to deployment and for developing
new sensor systems.
