Quantum physics and Einstein's General Relativity (GR) describe nearly all known
physics quite successfully. However, physicists conjecture that there exists a
theory of everything that would unify these two theories. One popular approach
of late is to identify features of such a unified theory that could result in
experimental signatures or evidence of new physics in sensitive experiments and
observations. Fundamental principles of GR such as the lack of any special
direction in space (isotropy of space) could be violated in proposals for a
unified theory of physics. The PI will investigate new types of signals for the
breaking of isotropy of space that could be measured in sensitive observations
of astrophysical systems like pulsars and measurements of the ripples in
spacetime known as gravitational waves. This award will support undergraduate
research opportunities in theoretical physics.

The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP), a vital foundation of GR, includes the
spacetime symmetry called local Lorentz symmetry. Some candidate models of
quantum gravity contain the possibility that minuscule violations of spacetime
symmetry may occur in nature. Generic violations of spacetime symmetry are
described using an effective field theory framework. The PI will study the
effective field theory framework, seeking solutions for signals for spacetime-
symmetry violations in gravitational wave observations and other astrophysical
systems like pulsars. Researchers involved in precision tests of GR, in
particular gravitational wave tests, will find motivation and additional areas
in which to search for novel effects and new physics beyond GR.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
