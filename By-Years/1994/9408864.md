Abstract ATM-9408864 Clark, James S. Duke University Title: Sediment Records of
Biomass Burning Biomass burning profoundly affects atmospheric chemistry, the
carbon cycle, and climate of biomass burning may have been greater in the past,
before large increases in fossil fuel combustion. A principal obstacle to
progress on understanding the past role of biomass burning rests with the
interdisciplinary nature of the problem. This award supports a NATO Advanced
Research Workshop to assemble the paleo records of past combustion and
atmospheric and terrestrial expertise needed to interpret the effects of
emissions on past global changes. Specific goals of the workshop are to: i)
Better characterize sedimentary constituents and parameterize transport to
sediments; ii) Calibrate lacustrine, marine, and ice-core records of biomass
burning; iii) Identify the Data sets that could be used to quantify past biomass
burning; iv) Estimate past mass fluxes of combustion-derived particulates and
organic tracers; and v) Estimate past rates of biomass burning The program
includes a balanced representation of fire ecologists, paleoecologists, and
atmospheric chemists.
