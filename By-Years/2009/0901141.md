The objective of this research is to build a smart nanosystem with the
capability of autonomous motion, recognition, and actuation through the
orthogonal functionalization of heterostructured nanorods. The approach is to
use glancing angle deposition to design heteronanorod backbones, where each
functional unit will be integrated onto different spatial locations along
backbone in a selective and efficient manner using orthogonal self-assembly.
Smart materials and recognition molecules will be used to functionalize the
nanomotor backbone to perform autonomous motion and controlled release.

Intellectual Merit: This project aims to develop a generic methodology to
fabricate and design smart nanosystems that starts to mimic the complex behavior
of biological systems. The approach involves: designing heteronanorods with
different inorganic and polymeric materials; exploring autonomous propulsion
mechanisms that allow for directed motion and photo-responsive polymers for
controlled release; and integrating the backbone and functional units.
Propulsion mechanisms that are catalytic, photoresponsive, and dissipative will
be used to control autonomous motion.

Broader Impact: The methodology for nanomotor fabrication and selective
functionalization allows the creation of smart nano-functional components and
will catalyze rapid and innovative advances in designing and integrating
autonomous nanomachines. With further control, implications of those nanomotors
in nanoelectromechanical systems, drug delivery, disease treatment, and other
areas are anticipated. In addition, the lab-based nanotechnology course module
under development by the PIs will help undergraduate and high school students to
obtain hands-on experience with nanofabrication. This project also establishes a
rigorous physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology education and training
opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students.
