A near field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) will be designed and constructed
which will have at least 500A spatial resolution (using visible light) and
spectral selectivity. It will be based on the near field collimation of
radiation and on recent demonstration of techniques to transmit visible light
through apertures as small as 1/16 the wavelength. Contrast and resolution tests
will be completed on patterns generated with the electron beam lithographic
capabilities at the National Research and Resource Facility for Submicron
Structures at Cornell. Various modes of illumination and detection will be
investigated to maximize the contrast and signal to noise in this new form of
super-resolution light microscopy. The working scanning optical microscope that
will be constructed will have a spatial resolution comparable to that of a
scanning electron microscope but will be inherently non-destructive since it
does not use ionizing radiation and does not require the sample to be placed in
a vacuum. It will have enormous potential in biology and medicine since it will
be able to view living systems at a resolution between 80A (the limit of
chemical labeling methods) and 2500A (the limit of fluorescence microscopy).
Such an instrument will permit non-destructive measurements for integrated
circuit metrology.
