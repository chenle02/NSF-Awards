ABSTRACT 9504402 Thevanayagam The prime objectives of this workshop are to:
review historical development; assess current state of practice; discuss
potential future innovative applications; and, identify technology transfer
opportunities and research needs in order to accelerate and implement vacuum
consolidation technology in engineering practice in the United States and
abroad. The results of the workshop will significantly accelerate the rate at
which this technology is implemented in practice, bringing about a more rapid
realization of the productivity gains and reduced environmental impacts offered
by vacuum consolidation technology. Current challenges faced by port authorities
in the U.S. and abroad offer a test bed opportunity and will enable preparation
of successful feasibility pilot programs to evaluate this technology under
various site conditions. It is anticipated that different design approaches
could be tested and shared with the participants of the workshop at a later
stage. ***
