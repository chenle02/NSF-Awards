Work will be carried out in three different areas: 1) in the area of growth
kinetics efforts will be continued to understand the universal features
associated with the growth of order after deep temperature quenches from a
disordered state to a temperature where the system of interest would show long
range order if in equilibrium. New analytical and numerical tools will be
developed; 2) using the method of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics new
mechanisms related to glass formation and crystalization will be investigated;
3) the evolution of the early universe using models and techniques inspired by
work in condensed matter physics will be studied. Progress has been made in
connecting the "inflationary" exponential expansion time regime to the later
"Standard Model."
