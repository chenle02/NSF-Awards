Divine Word College will use this grant to connect its Epworth campus to the
Internet using a Dubuque, Iowa based ISP called Midwest Communications. Divine
Word College is a four-year college and seminary wholly owned and operated by
the Society of Divine Word, a Roman Catholic missionary order. There are
approximately 125 full-time students from countries around the world. The
college needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.
The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
