Improvement in the quality, size and cost of indium phosphide (InP) single
crystals is necessary in order to realize the high performance benefits of InP-
based microwave and millimeter wave monolithic integrated circuit technology. To
meet this need, the project will implement a novel modification to the Vertical
Gradient Freeze (VGF) crystal growth method. The modification will enhance the
VGF technique by enabling active control to be exerted over the defect-inducing
thermal stresses that degrade the quality of InP crystals. The VGF technique is
well suited to economical, large-scale production as it combines simplicity of
design with low operator attention requirements. The physical processes of VGF
are well understood which forms a solid foundation for the practical engineering
approach. If the approach proves feasible, development of sources for the
desired InP material will be straightforward.
