The project is concerned with problems of flame propagation in nonuniform flow
fields and in confined environments. The investigator will derive and analyze
appropriate mathematical models and will study the dynamics of flames in such
configurations. The methods to be used are asymptotic and perturbation
techniques combined with numerical computations. The primary goal is to
construct solutions that permit a fundamental understanding of the relevant
physical mechanisms involved in these processes and to enable qualitative
comparison with experimental observations. Combustion in closed vessels is a
commonly encountered problem, but it is not well understood. The results of this
project will provide a better picture of the physics involved and can be used to
validate numerical simulations of confined combustion.
