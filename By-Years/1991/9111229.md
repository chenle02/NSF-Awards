This research seeks to develop a technology for IC- processed, piezoelectric,
diaphragm transducers; particularly a microphone, a speaker, and an IR sensor.
Characterization and modelling of the microphone will be performed, and optimum
performance will be sought. Various designs and structures of the microphone
will be fabricated and characterized. CAD tools for analysis, simulation, and
optimization of the piezoelectric diaphragm will be developed to aid the design
process, and to support generic microelectromechanical structures built on a
diaphragm, a bridge or a cantilever with composite layers. The proposed IR
sensor will use the pyroelectric effect of ZnO that is sitting on a very thin
and large diaphragm (a few microns thick and a few millimeters square).
