A central issue in modern statistics and machine learning is overfitting. Many
successful techniques have been developed under this mathematical framework
known as regularization, which penalizes or adds constraints on the underlying
model parameters to avoid overfitting. This project focuses on a Bayesian
framework for effective regularization. The Bayesian framework is especially
appealing for many applications since it provides a conceptually easy but
principled way to coherently incorporate prior assumptions/knowledge, address
overfitting and quantify uncertainty. The main goal of this project is to
develop fast and scalable computational tools, as well as providing theoretical
guarantees, to assist with the implementation of Bayesian inference for
practical problems arising in many application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on a Bayesian framework for learning dependence structures among
a large number of variables. In particular, the PI will develop a unified
framework for Bayesian regularization for conditional Gaussian graphical models,
mixed graphical models, and latent graphical models. The proposed research
focuses on designing a family of sparsity inducing priors, deriving efficient
algorithms to explore the posterior modes and to approximate the posterior
distribution, and providing theoretical guarantees such as estimation error
bounds and selection consistency for the obtained estimators. The proposed
activities will generate research results that will be immediately applicable to
many other statistical models beyond graphical models, and computation tools
that will be made available via open-source statistical software packages in R
and/or Python.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
