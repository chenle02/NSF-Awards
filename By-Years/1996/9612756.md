Compiler infrastructure is a key and enabling component of cutting-edge
computing systems research. Whether the research is focusing on developing new
optimization algorithms, designing a new programming language, creating new
software tools, developing and analyzing real-time systems, or exploring new or
experimental architectural features, a complete, robust, and flexible
compilation system is required to perform realistic experiments in a timely
fashion. This research project will develop a compiler infrastructure, called
Zephyr, to meet the current and future needs of computing system researchers.
The leitmotiv of Zephyr's organization is the separation of the representation
or form of Zephyr's intermediate languages from their content. Decoupling the
content of an intermediate language from its representation permits researchers
to use an intermediate language most appropriate for their needs, to extend an
existing intermediate language, or to develop a new HIL, yet still use Zephyr
infrastructure and leverage off the efforts of other research groups also using
the infrastructure.
