There is compelling evidence that diversity among students and faculty is
crucially important to the intellectual and social development of all students.
This project aligns with the National Science Foundation's goal to promote a
more diverse engineering workforce by promoting LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and queer) equality in engineering -- a group that has been
underserved by other efforts to increase diversity in the profession.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there has been a gradual positive change in campus
climate for LGBTQ individuals, engineering departments have proven more
impervious to inclusive practices than other disciplines. By linking diversity
research with a faculty development initiative, this project explores the
aspects of engineering culture that serve as impediments to LGBTQ equality and
uses this knowledge to design training to promote LGBTQ equality in engineering
departments. Through face-to-face and online training coupled with an online
community of practice, this project will build a network of LGBTQ-affirming
faculty who are aware of strategies to foster an inclusive environment and are
empowered to advance LGBTQ equality in their departments.
