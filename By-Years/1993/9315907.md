9315907 Nelson This grant renewal will continue theoretical studies of the
electromagnetic response of crystals to external fields using a Lagrangian
approach. Four topics will be explored. (1) An entirely new mathematical method
of solving wave propagation problems in bounded media will be studied. This
method operates in wavevector space where there are no boundaries and so uses no
boundary conditions. (2) A new solution for the optical reflectivity near an
exciton resonance of a half-space of matter will be studied. (3) A macroscopic
Lagrangian formulation of spin using Grassmann algebra will be used to explore
the properties of magnetic media. (4) Finally, research will be conducted on the
form of the electromagnetic energy flow vector in a material medium. %%% The
research proposed is in an area of solid state physics called crystal physics. A
macroscopic approach is taken to determine the effects of external magnetic and
electric fields, and their interactions, on the properties of crystals. Thus,
optical and magnetic properties can be understood and new phenomena predicted.
These new phenomena can then be verified by experiment and studied in more
detail using more microscopic approaches. In addition to its fundamental
interest, the work may be of importance to the field of photonics. ***
