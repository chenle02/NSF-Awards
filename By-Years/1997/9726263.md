The general hypothesis that the foraging behavior and distribution of high
level marine predators (sea otters and shorebirds) under natural conditions are
mediated by benthic prey toxicity due to harmful algal blooms (HAB's) will be
tested in two geographic regions regions (California and Alaska). Because
benthic community structure is often controlled from the top down via predation,
the influence of phytotoxins in these habitats will be further amplified if key
predators avoid entire regions or prey populations regularly exposed to toxic
blooms. In southeast Alaska, the general hypothesis that sea otter foraging is
regulated by paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSPT) distribution will be
tested by determining: 1) whether or not the expanding southeast Alaskan sea
otter population has occupied inside passage sites where butter clams are
abundant but contain biologically significant levels of PSPT year round, and 2)
if so, whether the sea otters have either shifted their diet away from their
primary butter clam prey to alternate non toxic species, or are continuing to
eat butter clams, but perhaps while discarding the most toxic body parts. The
second research component will focus on the response of three common northern
California shore birds (Godwits, Dowitchers, Oystercatchers) to the predictable
seasonal increase in the PSPT content of two major intertidal invertebrate prey
(mole crabs and mussels). The general hypothesis that the foraging strategies of
these avian predators is also mediated by PSPT will be tested by monitoring and
correlating seasonal changes in invertebrate prey toxicity levels with changes
in the foraging behavior and distribution of the birds at several widely
separated sites along the California coast.
