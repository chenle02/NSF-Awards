The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to provide a theoretical foundation for defining design targets and
conducting design assessments to improve the design of products, tasks, and
environments, enabling accommodation of populations that are increasingly
diverse. Three research tasks will contribute to achieving this objective.
First, in collaboration with an industry partner, methods will be developed to
adapt existing anthropometric databases to new populations to account for
changes in the population due to aging, obesity, and distributions of ethnicity.
Second, multivariate and univariate modeling techniques will be explored and
compared to assess the validity of these methods for modeling human variability.
Third, a methodology for conducting "virtual fits" using large populations of
simulated users will be developed and validated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the results of this research will overcome limitations in existing
design methods that do not adequately consider the differences in human
variability that occur in certain user subgroups such as the elderly, people
with disabilities, or people of a particular ethnicity. Designers will have the
tools they need to design products to accommodate specific populations. This
research will have an immediate impact on undergraduate students by providing
them with design tools and a series of web-based teaching modules to be used in
project-based design courses. Through these experiences, students will gain an
appreciation for the need to design to accommodate various populations and the
skills to do this. Other activities, including academic/industry workshops and
an annual weeklong design experience for graduate, undergraduate, and high
school students will disseminate the results to members of industry and
academia.
