We are working to improve a lower division general physics (electricity and
magnetism) laboratory which is taken by about 260 science and engineering
students each semester at San Jose State University. We are developing
experiments on magnetism by having students measure the magnetic field with Hall
probes interfaced to a personal computer in a wide range of situations, and also
observe the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. We are
also improving and reorganizing some of our existing experiments on electricity
and electrical circuits. The new and improved experiments help students develop
better understanding for the abstract concepts of electric and magnetic fields,
reinforce classroom lectures, and provide to students hands-on experience in
working with modern instrumentation. Funds were obtained for the acquisition of
12 transverse and longitudinal Hall probes, 12 personal computers, and 12 Pasco
e/m apparatuses with Helmholtz coils and power supplies.
