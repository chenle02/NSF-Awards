9408670 Fritzsche Technical abstract: The research is aimed at understanding how
light produces defects and other changes in the local structure of amorphous
semiconductors. These changes can be beneficial such as in chalcogenide glasses
used for photolithography or in Indium oxide films for controlling the
electronic properties of transparent electrodes. On the other hand, they can be
detrimental leading to photodegration of amorphous silicon solar cells. These
photo-induced changes occur during recombination of photo-excited electron-hole
pairs. The study of the temperature dependence of the recombination and
transport of photocarriers and of the defect generation-kinetics will help us to
understand the microscopic mechanisms of the light-induced changes. Use will be
made of spatially confining the photocarriers in ultra-thin layers of amorphous
semiconductors to explore the effect of reduced dimensionality. The light-
induced changes will be used in Indium oxide to explore changes in electronic
conduction ad the electronic states become localized. non-technical abstract:
