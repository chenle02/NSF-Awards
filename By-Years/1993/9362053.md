9362053 Bliss There is a large and growing number of persons with visual
diseases, such as age-related maculopathies. The proposed investigation is to
develop efficient methods of evaluating an individual's vision to determine the
parameters for design of a corrective spatial filter and to implement the filter
and to implement the filter in a practical system for reading and writing. The
individual's contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is to be used in determining
the filter design parameters for image enhancement to be used in the system. The
system that is envisaged would make use of low cost, high performance PCs (such
as the 486). One part of the system will provide for image acquisition, image
enhancement, and image storage for easy access. The other part of the system is
to access portions of the stored enhanced image, zooming, and display.
Successful results from the investigation will provide for significantly
improved reading performance than provided by magnification alone. ***
