This project improves the undergraduate education in Civil Engineering through
implementation of two new laboratory experiences, in which Non-Destructive Test
(NDT) methods are applied to Steel and Reinforced Concrete structures. Civil
Engineers must understand the capabilities and limitations of NDT techniques in
order to undertake the rehabilitation of the United States' aging
infrastructure.In the Steel NDT laboratory experience, weld quality and the
location of cracks will be explored using fluorescent penetrant, magnetic
particles, and ultrasonics; all of this equipment will be acquired through this
proposal. In the Reinforced Concrete NDT laboratory experience, the location of
reinforcement and flaws, and the concrete integrity will be investigated using
impulse radar, a Schmidt hammer, and an ultrasonic pulse meter. A new high
frequency (1 GHz) antenna will be acquired for the radar system and five Schmidt
hammers will be obtained.The NDT laboratories will significantly improve the
quality of Clarkson's Civil Engineering education by giving approximately 100
students a year the opportunity to use state-of-the-art NDT equipment in hands-
on laboratories.
