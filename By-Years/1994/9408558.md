9408558 Myers Free energies of phase formation of binary solid silicide phases
of the Group VIII (Iron, Cobalt, Nickel) transition metals will be measured by
means of a reactive effusion scheme coupled with mass spectrometric analysis of
the effusing vapors. Silicides will be equilibrated with solid Silicon Dioxide
at temperatures in the range of 800-1500 K. The gibbs free energies of formation
will be calculated from the measured Silicon Mono-oxide(g) pressures combined
with literature data for the equilibrium between these components. These results
will be combined with heat capacity and entropy data to compute standard
enthalpies of formation at 298 K. The results are expected to be useful in the
modeling of a variety of metallurgical problems, in the verification of phase
diagram features, and in the development and modeling of chemical vapor
deposition processes used in the electronics industry. %%% The stabilities of
compounds of silicon with cobalt, nickel and iron (i.e. strengths of chemical
bonds) will be measured by high temperature techniques involving a study of
reactions between these materials and silicon dioxide. Results are expected to
be useful in development and modeling of processes used in the electronics
industry and in modeling of metallurgical problems. ***
