West Geogia College is taking advantage of new hardware and software technology
to improve the instruction in the laboratory part of the first course of a
3-quarter, calculus-based introductory physics series. Smaller, more powerful,
less expensive microcomputers are placed at twelve two-person lab tables. The
computers and associated hardware and software are being used to better take
data, analyze the data, and present and graph the data. In addition, tutorials
and simulations are being used to enrich and enhance the laboratory experience.
The college will provide 50% matching funds.
