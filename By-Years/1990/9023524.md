Research is proposed in the development of novel numerical algorithms for the
solution of partial differential equations arising in computational fluid
dynamics. Issues of interest include the use of novel adaptive grid techniques
for compressible and incompressible flows in two and three dimensions, the
inclusion of chemistry terms for combustion and hypersonic flow and the
suitability of SIMD architectures, such as the Connection Machine, for any type
of adaptive grid algorithms. Computer science techniques will be combined with
the mathematics of numerical computations in carrying out the proposed research.
