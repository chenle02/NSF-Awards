&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to understand the
fundamental mechanisms for the surface self-sorting of single-walled carbon
nanotubes. The approach is to combine systematic experiments and ab-initio
theoretical modeling to understand the nature of interactions between organic
functional groups and single-walled carbon nanotubes. &lt;br/&gt;The combination
of superior electrical and mechanical properties in single-walled carbon
nanotubes continues to advance applications including flexible electronics,
bio/chemical sensors, and solar cell technology. Despite enormous progress
achieved exhibiting potential applied uses of SWNT devices, such applications
will not be realized unless fundamental issues concerning the controlled
reproducible placement, alignment, and chirality/diameter separation can be
solved. This work builds on the previous experimental findings of Bao that
properly functionalized surfaces can selectively absorb either primarily
semiconducting or primarily metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. This work
will lead to better understanding of the nature of interaction between SWNTs and
surface functional groups. &lt;br/&gt;The results from this work will have great
impact in bringing single-walled carbon nanotubes closer to practical electronic
devices. With the combination of both experimental and theoretical approaches,
the students involved in the project will have exposure to an interdisciplinary
approach for problem solving, applicable to a wide class of problems, beyond
those tackled in this proposal. This research will expose both graduate students
and undergraduates to organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, surface chemistry,
quantum simulations, materials and thin film characterization, device
fabrication, and device characterization. Both PIs are greatly committed and
have been actively involved in outreach and education, which will be continued
in this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
