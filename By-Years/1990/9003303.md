The objectives of this study are the identification of intermediates in the
partial and total oxidations of olefins on silver (110) surfaces, and
quantification of the energetics of elementary steps in these processes. This
includes, for partial oxidation, the production, identification, and
characterization of the metallocycle intermediates relevant to catalytic
oxidtion by both atomically and molecularaly adsorbed oxygen, and, for total
oxidation , the investigation of the mechanism of propylene combustion. Electron
energy loss spectroscopy is used to identify adsorbed intermediates and to
measure the rates of reactions in which they participate, and temperature-
programmed desorption is used to identify desorption products and to measure the
rates of desorption. Partial oxidation of olefins, the process involved in this
study, is of great commerical importance, but as presently practiced, can be
applied only to a very few olefins. The results of this study could lead to
better control and improved yields in the existing process. More significantly,
it may point the way for extending this approach to additional olefins, which
would represent a technological breakthough.
