9319928 Roberts Living cells regularly cycle through periods of mitotic
activity, and recent work has suggested that this is related to the rhythmic
association between members of two protein families that control the division
process. Interestingly, members of these protein families have been found in a
tissue whose cells no longer divide: the brain. In this proposal Dr. Michael
Roberts will attempt to determine the function of these proteins in nervous
tissue. Dr. Roberts will test the hypothesis that circadian rhythms (changes in
physiological functions that have a cycle with approximately a 24 hour period)
are generated by periodic interactions between the same proteins that otherwise
regulate cell division. The experiments will be conducted on a circadian
pacemaker in the marine mollusk, Bulla. In this model system, correlated
physiological and biochemical information can be obtained and the results should
allow us to understand the control of endogenous rhythms in a wide range of
living organisms.
