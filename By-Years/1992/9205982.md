Due to the constraints of parallel computation environment, efficient parallel
algorithms often drastically differ from their sequential counterparts. The
study of parallel computation often leads to the discovery of new properties of
the problem being solved. Therefore the study of parallel algorithms is
particularly fruitful for the graphs having special properties. This research
develops efficient parallel algorithms for the following classes of special
graphs: cographs, permutation graphs, comparability graphs, and planar graphs.
These graph problems find broad applications in computer science. The sequential
algorithms for solving them have been extensively studied. However, it appears
difficult to solve them in parallel. The research is focused on the discovery of
new properties of these graphs that can be use in designing efficient parallel
algorithms. In addition to design efficient algorithms for specific problems,
new techniques that can be used for solving more general problems are developed.
