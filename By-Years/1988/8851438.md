Western Illinois University will purchase six air track systems, six photogate
systems, six rotational dynamics systems, six measurement interfaces, and six
microcomputers. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in
introductory physics laboratory courses. Physics and pre-engineering students
will receive a systematic introduction to the laboratory applications of
microcomputers including data acquisition, instrument control, data analysis;
and data display. Western Illinois University will match the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
