The Career-Awareness Experiences in Science and Mathematics for High- Ability
Junior High Students Project is a cooperative effort between Western Illinois
University (WIU); Educational Service Centers; regional business/ industry; and
regional school districts. The project will consist of a series of instructional
and experiential activities conducted during a combination of two weeks on the
WIU campus during the summer, internships with practitioners in the field, and a
one-day fall semester session in November 1988. The major objective of the
project is to introduce 24 high-ability 8th grade students from rural western
Illinois to science and mathematics disciplines and careers. The instructional
components include hands-on laboratory work related to a research area in each
discipline, ethical and philosophical questions relevant to science research and
technology, and information relating to career opportunities in science,
technology, and mathematics. Project staff will include WIU faculty, with
assistance from junior high school science teachers and representatives from
business and industry.
