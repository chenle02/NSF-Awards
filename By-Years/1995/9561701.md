This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop via
displacement reactions a novel composite for use in high-speed cutting tools.
The ability to increase machining speeds as well as metal removal rates will
lead to increased productivity at reduced manufacturing cost. A new composite
cutting tool insert, made of SiC whisker-reinforced alumina (Al203-SiCw), has
resulted in a breakthrough for machining nickel alloys to speeds of 15 m/s and
feed rates up to 0.5 mm/rev. Dramatically improved ceramic composite cutting
tool inserts are possible through optimization of the ceramic matrix for thermal
conductivity, hardness, coefficient of friction, toughness, and strength,
coupled with a new whisker that enhances these properties though chemically
inert. The new optimized ceramic composite will also expand the range of metal
alloys, including cast iron, that can be machined at increased speeds and feed
rates, which will also result in increased manufacturing productivity at reduced
cost. A new class of in situ composites with high strength and fracture
toughness and low production costs open up many new markets where advanced
ceramics are not as yet cost effective. Potential commercial applications
include cutting tool inserts for machining nickel, iron, and other alloys; heat
exchangers; pump seals; abrasive jet nozzles; wear plates; and engine components
e.g., cam followers, brakes, etc.
