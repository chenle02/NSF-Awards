In the past several years, there have been successful bridge workshops and
conferences through which were developed excellent communication and cooperation
not only among the `U. S. bridge community` but also within the `international
community`. This opportunity for international communication and for development
of cooperative efforts between researchers of both continents is extremely
valuable. This international meeting on bridge engineering, involving
researchers for the U. S., Canada and Europe, will be held in Switzerland during
the summer of 1997. The leading European organization for this meeting is the
EMPA (the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research.) The
U.S. participants are selected by a Steering Committee based on submitted
abstracts and would focus on practicing engineers and engineering faculty early
in their careers. Preceding the workshop, the U. S. team will participate in a
two-day technical bridge tour prepared in consultation with the workshop
organizers.
