Interdisciplinary (99) A model that integrates interdisciplinary experiences
relating to sustainability across the science curriculum and throughout all four
of a student's college years is being developed and tested. Interdisciplinary
learning across the sciences is advanced through laboratory experiences in
sustainability for four different audiences: 1) first-year non-science students;
2) science students in introductory courses; 3) science majors in intermediate
level courses; and, 4) junior and senior level students majoring in the
sciences. The goal for the introductory and non-science students is an
initiation to the science and technology of sustainability, drawing connections
between multiple disciplines and enhancing quantitative, thermodynamic, and
sustainability literacy. At the intermediate level, concepts of sustainability
are integrated within existing science laboratories to heighten interest and
student awareness of energy issues and to make interdisciplinary connections.
Finally, the project encourages synthesis of the science and technology by
science majors as they approach graduation with interdisciplinary sustainability
projects and service learning projects. Seminars with a sustainability focus
enhance the effectiveness of the program by highlighting the interdisciplinary
nature of the topic, as well as helping to build a cohort of students interested
in it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating sustainability across the science
curriculum is a means to educate students about this important area while
teaching quantitative skills and increasing interest and enthusiasm for science.
Studies suggest that students retain more knowledge and develop better logical
and analytical skills if they have a more active role in the learning process.
It is clear that students have a better attitude toward learning science and
learn more when the scientific material is connected to real world issues
affecting their lives.
