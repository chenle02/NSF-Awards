ABSTRACT JAY FRANKEL UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, AT KNOXVILLE CTS - 9510441 This
proposal is to fund innovative exploratory research on inverse analysis of
materials in which freezing or melting are occurring during heat transfer.
Potential application is to metal casting, where control of the freezing rate
can help control crystal size during the freezing process. Inverse problems are
typically ill-posed in the mathematical sense, and solution for the boundary
conditions that will provide a given freezing rate are often unstable and
sensitive to initial conditions or input data. The PI seeks a SGER to explore
mathematical techniques that have shown initial success in providing stable
solutions to this type of problem. If successful, he will then apply for further
support.
