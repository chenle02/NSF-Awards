An Anasazi Instruments FT-NMR conversion package for the current EM-390 NMR has
been purchased and is providing enhanced learning opportunities for students. In
Organic Chemistry, students are able to quickly and effectively characterize
reaction products by H-1, C-13, and two-dimensional methods. A change in the
fundamental pedagogy of this course is also being instituted based upon the
adaptation and implementation of a similar program developed at Albion College.
Research problems selected by the faculty are segmented into smaller research
questions that are being addressed by student teams during three-to-seven week
projects. Students are learning to design and carry out their own experiments in
response to a research problem, are learning to evaluate resultant data and to
draw their own conclusions. Upon completion of the research projects, oral
presentations by each research team are critiqued by other members of the class.
The FT NMR is also being used in other courses in the curriculum with
experiments from both the research and educational literature being adapted and
implemented.&lt;br/&gt;
