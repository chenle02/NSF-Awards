The Calumet region (East Chicago, Gary, Hammond, and neighboring parts of
Northwest Indiana and Illinois) has a very large minority student population
with a low rate of enrollment in post-secondary education. The objective of this
program is to demonstrate to these students that there are excellent job
opportunities in engineering and science where graduates can earn a good living
while doing work they enjoy with interesting people. The focus is on a five-week
summer program for students entering grades 8 or 9, with follow-up activities
for succeeding summers. The program is a cooperative activity of Purdue
University Calument with the Gary and East Chicago school systems; it is
administered by Purdue Calument and guided by a steering committee made up of
representatives from Purdue Calument, Gary, East Chicago, and the Companies
supporting the program. The key feature is the structure which ties science,
math, and applications together; thus topics are chosen so that the participants
see the importance of math as a basic tool, and its application to engineering
and science. The mornings are primarily lecture/discussion/demonstration; the
afternoons are hands-on (laboratory and computer usage) sessions or industrial
tours. A topic that demonstrates the format is DC electric circuits (science and
hands-on lab),along with simultaneous linear equations (math) PSpice (computer
program to simulate electric circuits), and Northern Indiana Public Service
Company (plant visit to observe and meet engineers for an electric utility
distribution system). ***
