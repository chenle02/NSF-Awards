Lazarsfeld will work on a number of problems in algebraic geometry. A first
series of questions concerns the algebraic properties of large degree embeddings
of projective varieties. The equations defining curves have been studied
intensively over the last twenty-five years, but until recently little was known
about the algebraic behavior of more general varieties. In this direction,
Lazarsfeld will continue his work with Ein on the asymptotic structure of the
syzygies of higher-dimensional varieties as the positivity of the embedding line
bundle grows. Lazarsfeld will also work on a number of questions concerning the
positivity properties of higher-codimension algebraic cycles. Growing out of his
work with Debarre, Ein and Voisin, the idea here is to explore the higher-
codimension analogues of classical notions of positivity for cycles of
codimension one.

Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest and most central fields of mathematics,
studies geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in
several variables. It makes connections with many other fields of mathematics,
ranging from number theory to topology, algebra, and complex analysis. Algebraic
geometry has also found important applications to problems in such diverse areas
as coding theory, theoretical physics and the mathematics of computation. In a
first series of problems, Lazarsfeld will study the properties of the equations
cutting out a fixed geometric locus. It is hoped that this research will open up
new points of contact between the fields of algebraic geometry and commutative
algebra. Lazarsfeld will also work on some conjectures concerning the manner in
which smaller geometric loci can sit inside larger ones.
