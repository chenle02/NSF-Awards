In this project, the PI plans to investigate the `continuation' properties of
the invariant subspaces of the backward shift operator on various spaces of
analytic functions on the unit disk. In 1970, Douglas, Shapiro, and Shields
showed that functions belonging to these invariant subspaces of the Hardy space
posses special continuation properties to the exterior disk. In more recent
investigations, this idea of `continuation' has been shown to be ubiquitous in
that it appears to take place, in one form or another, in many other settings
belong the Hardy space case. This proposal plans to get at the heart of the
nature of these continuations and why they occur in the first place.

This project falls under the broad heading of the field of mathematical analysis
which, besides its beauty and elegance, makes many connections and has its roots
in problems connected with physics and engineering. In fact, the concept of
`continuation' properties of analytic functions has been recently studied by the
engineer S. Darlington who connected these `continuations' to properties of
electrical circuit design.
