A Comprehensive program of research is planned that is centered on the oxygen
isotope analyses of phosphate from both natural materials and various forms of
apatite that will be synthesized in the laboratory. Specific goals are (1) the
refinement of the method of preparation and isotopic analysis of phosphatic
oxygen, (2) the experimental determination of the equilibrium oxygen isotope
fractionation factors between dissolved phosphate and water and between various
crystalline apatites and water over a very large range of temperatures from near
Oo to 8OOoC, (3) the development of a single mineral oxygen isotope thermometer
based on hydroxapatite and application to natural systems, (5) the use of 18O
contents of teeth and bones to make important distinctions between marine and
fresh water fish. Some novel techniques will be employed in conducting this
research. The extraction of oxygen from very small samples of phosphate will be
made with a laser fluorination system recently established at the University of
Michigan. Catalysts will be used to obtain exchange equilibrium between
phosphates and water at relatively low temperatures. Well crystallized hydroxy-
and fluorapatite will be synthesized by a bacterial reaction in which enzymatic
activity should promote attainment of isotopic exchange equilibrium. Obtaining
reliable equilibrium fractionation factors in these systems over a large
temperature range will be extremely useful in the resolution of a variety of
petrological, paleoclimatological and paleoecological problems.
