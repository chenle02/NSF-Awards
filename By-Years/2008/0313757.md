This group proposes a research program involving collaboration with the HiRes
cosmic ray project in Utah, and the ASPIRE K-12 outreach program which will
expand to Montana. &lt;br/&gt;The HiRes experiment is designed to study high-
energy enigmatic cosmic rays. The observation of these cosmic rays whose energy
exceeded the Greisen-Zetsepin-Kuz'min cut-off led many to postulate that some
fundamental processes may be responsible for particles of extraordinary energy.
&lt;br/&gt; Fly's Eye, supported by NSF, made the first and the most convincing
observation of the highest energy of the enigmatic cosmic rays. HiRes, the
successor of Fly's Eye, is now in operation. &lt;br/&gt; The Aspire Project
(Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education) is an NSF
supported outreach project involving HiRes scientists, K-12 teachers, state
education administrators, education specialists, and programmers. The goal of
this project is to infuse recent discoveries made in fundamental astrophysics
research into everyday science lessons and laboratories by utilizing
interactive, inquiry-oriented, web-based technology.&lt;br/&gt;This project is
an example of the NSF initiative of integrating research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;
