The logic group at Notre Dame is well established. This grant is a renewal; a
continuation of our successful three year RTG grant in 2004 (NSF-
EMSW21-RTG-0353748) and a one year RTG "bridging" grant in 2008 (NSF-
EMSW21-RTG-0739007: Research Training in Mathematical Logic at Notre Dame). In
five years we have more than doubled the number of US nationals working in
logic; going from 5 to 12. This grant will allow us to continue the successful
practices we have developed over years of interactions with students and
postdoctoral associates as described below. In addition, we will add some new
activities focusing engaging in mathematics more of Notre Dame's talented
undergraduate students.

Our graduate training program produces doctorates who have experienced the many
dimensions of research, teaching, and mathematical communication. At Notre Dame,
the students develop a solid independent research record. They make themselves
known to the international mathematical community by participating in
conferences and workshops and giving talks, in addition to writing papers. They
have the opportunity to discuss research with specialists from around the world,
and to participate in collaborative research. By the time they graduate, they
are full members of the international community of mathematicians. Notre Dame
offers graduate students opportunities to teach and training to help them be
successful. Our students have experienced a greater variety of teaching
experiences.

Our logic postdoctoral associates have been allowed significant time to develop
a research program of their own. They have taught students of all levels, from
first-year liberal arts undergraduates to advanced graduate students. They have
been involved in mentoring graduate students, in leading small group learning
activities, and other more advanced aspects of faculty life. With each
postdoctoral associate our mentoring skills are improving.

An exciting new focus for this grant is our effects to broaden our mathematical
community to include more of Notre Dame's talented undergraduate mathematics
majors. We plan to start an biweekly "undergraduate mathematics seminar".
Hopefully, this seminar will attract more of our talented non-honors mathematics
majors to enter mathematical careers.

This grant provides partial support for all of the US nationals studying
Mathematical Logic at Notre Dame. The grant partial support for the three
postdoctoral positions in logic, each lasting three years. In addition, it will
provide some travel money for the (both undergraduate and graduate) students and
postdoctoral associates, and some money for books for the students. The grant
will provide some travel money for outside visitors to come to Notre Dame to
interact with the faculty, students, and postdoctoral associates. A portion of
these funds will cover the expenses of the new Undergraduate Mathematics
Seminar.
