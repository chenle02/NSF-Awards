The overall purpose of the investigation is to identify features of the
glyoxysomal membrane electron transport (GMET) system which regulates oxidation
of NADH generated by fat metabolism within glyoxysomes during germination of oil
seeds. This metabolic process is regulated by the oxidation of the NADH
generated within the glyoxysomes. NADH is oxidized by the GMET system comprised
of a 32 KDa protein (gm32) and secondary transfer protein(s) in the membrane.
During the germination of an oil seed, glyoxysomes acquire membrane electron
transport activities at the same time that fat metabolism becomes active. The
first objective of this project is to identify the cytoplasmic electron
acceptors for GMET. The physical exposure of the proteins will be examined. We
will determine if GMET activity is regulated by the appearance of different
proteins in the glyoxysomal membrane or by modifications (e.g., phosphorylation)
of proteins. The amino acid sequence of gm32 will then be determined, to allow
comparison with other electron transport proteins. This work is being done with
glyoxysomes obtained from the endosperm of germinating castor beans. %%% This
project concerns fat metabolism, which is directly related to agriculture and to
human health. Many agriculturally important seeds (corn, sunflower, soybean,
peanut, cotton, castor bean) contain fat and depend on fat metabolism for
germination. Specific subcellular organelles, peroxisomes and glyoxysomes, are
involved in the metabolism of fats. Peroxisomes and glyoxysomes consist of a
concentrated solution of enzymes (proteins) enclosed by a membrane and fat is
metabolized by the enclosed enzymes. As fat is metabolized within a peroxisome
or glyoxysome, molecules and energy (as electrons) must pass in and out, through
the membrane. Thus the membrane must contain enzymes which regulate fat
metabolism inside the organelle. The specific purpose of this investigation is
to identify these membrane enzymes and to determine how they might be regulated.
The basic information of membrane transport can then be applied to understanding
fat metabolism in humans, as well.
