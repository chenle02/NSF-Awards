This research project is focused on the development of titanium-mediated
(silyloxy)enyne cyclizations and a two-step subunit coupling based on
Kulinkovich cyclopropanation / cyclopropanol opening. The application of these
new methods to complex molecule synthesis will be demonstrated by total
syntheses of amphidinolide J and spirolaxine. Multistep synthesis will be used
as a platform for the introduction of new material into the undergraduate and
graduate organic chemistry curriculum. In order to better convey the principles,
excitement, and significance of multistep organic synthesis to students, web-
based learning tools will be developed and lecture visits by industrial
scientists will be organized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this
CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Andrew J. Phillips, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
University of Colorado - Boulder, is developing new methods for the synthesis of
complex organic molecules. The pursuit of this research plan is underpinned by
the importance of further methodological and strategic advances in organic
synthesis. Advances in this area will represent a fundamental contribution to
the field of organic synthesis, and ultimately such advances have a broader
impact on society in diverse ways such as providing improved/cheaper medicines,
agrochemicals, and materials. Strategic advances in reaction design and
efficiency can also result in substantially decreased pollution and resource
expenditure. Professor Phillips will enhance the organic chemistry curriculum at
both the undergraduate and graduate levels through a multi-dimensional approach
involving the introduction of new and relevant course content, the development
of web-based learning tools, and the initiation of lecture visits by industrial
scientists.
