9451862 Bass The goal of this project is to bring important analytical tools in
contemporary chemistry, medium-performance liquid chromatography (MPLC), flash
chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), into the two-
semester organic chemistry and two one-semester advanced organic chemistry
courses. MPLC will also be used in the general science laboratories for the
separation of "real-life" samples to make the course more realistic and exciting
to the students. Liquid chromatography will be introduced progressively in the
four organic chemistry courses, so that students will gain experience with a
variety of chromatographic techniques. Experiments will be developed that use
MPLC, HPLC, and flash chromatography within the context of organic chemistry
where few undergraduate experiments have been published that use MPLC, HPLC, or
flash chromatography. The instructional experiments, many of which will
originate in the department, should be of interest to others.
