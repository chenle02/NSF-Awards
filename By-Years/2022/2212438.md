This NSF project aims to identify and apply societal context to the technical
design process for rural, remote microgrid and energy system design. The project
will bring transformative change to the practice of microgrid design, as well as
a paradigm shift to engineering design in general, by fusing non-technical data
of people and place with technical data of site and resources to create a more
sustainable and adoptable technical output. This will be achieved by developing
a robust decision-making framework that quantifies the relationship between
design parameters and a society’s unique identity, values, capabilities, and
limitations. The intellectual merits of the project include an interdisciplinary
approach that informs established technical design with ethnographic data
collection methods that identify a society’s particular context governing that
design. The broader impacts of the project include creating a more holistic
understanding of the engineering design process by demonstrating how social and
physical-technical conditions, when considered interactively, improve
infrastructure functionality and sustainability. This is crucial to ensure that
designed energy systems are appropriate, enduring, and operable by the intended
user population to provide equitable energy access to communities that live
beyond the grid edge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contextually informed design
framework that this project will develop uses observational techniques to
support optimization and analysis-based methods of designing rural-community
microgrids. Preliminary application of the developed framework will be in a
pilot project to design renewable energy systems in a US rural indigenous
community. Lessons learned from the pilot project will be used to fine-tune the
conceptualized framework. The finalized conceptual framework is expected to be a
systematic and descriptive process that guides the technical designer to
recognize the significance of societal context in mathematical design
formulations and decision making. Recognition that practitioner decision-making
is guided by their societal experience will assist designers to address
unfamiliar societal contexts in technical decision-making, resulting in a design
that targets user context rather than designer experience in rural remote energy
infrastructure. This acknowledgment will better align system design to both the
technical site conditions and the human capabilities, constraints, and
expectations of the communities for which it is being
built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
