This project is a combined experimental and modelling study of nucleation and
growth of fine powders in thermal plasma reactors. The modelling will include
such phenomena as reactor chemistry, particle growth by condensation, particle
growth by coagulation, and reactor nonuniformities. It should result in a
computer code coupling the thermal hydraulics in a RF plasma reactor to these
aerosol processes. The model will be guided and tested by an experimental
program in which size distributions of the particles are measured for several
species of technical importance as functions of flow rate, concentration, and
power input. Thermal plasma reactors are attractive candidates for the
production of fine powders to be used in ceramics, metallic alloys, and high
temperature superconductors. This research should help design such reactors to
control particle size, composition, and morphology.
