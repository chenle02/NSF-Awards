9522921 Silverman This research is to develop the first in situ glucose and
lactate sensors for bioreactor process control. These sensors will be designed
to meet reasonable specifications for operational lifetime, resistance to
fouling, and maintenance of bioreactor sterility. Multiple layeps of redox
enzymes will be electrically connected to electrodes through electron-conducting
hydrogels that are permeable to the substrates and the products of the enzymatic
reaction. This process of enzyme "wiring" is the basis of the sensors, and
allows them to control cell growth in bioreactors by monitoring substrates,
products, toxins, etc. The successful completion of this research will improve
the efficiency, reduce wastes, and lower manufacturing costs in bioreactors.
These sensors will also simplify the monitoring process, add to understanding of
control parameters, and begin the expansion of this technology to other
analytes.
