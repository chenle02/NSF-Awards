In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Janda will study the vibrational predissociation of rare gas-halogen van der
Waals complexes. This is a model problem which will serve as a test of the
current state-of-the-art experimental work and theory on clusters. A search will
be carried out of the time resolved sequential vibrational relaxation of argon-
chlorine complexes. State-to-state dynamics of intramolecular chemical reactions
and sequential dynamics of cluster evaporation will be investigated. In order to
help interpret the dynamics results, high resolution excitation spectroscopy
will be performed to determine the cluster geometry and vibrational structure.
