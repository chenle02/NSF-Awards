Damage to the freeway bridges in the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1,
1987 was one of the most significant aspects of damage to engineered structures
designed for seismic lateral loads. Of particular importance was the performance
of the I-605/I-5 separator, which was extensively damaged during the earthquake
and came perilously close to collapse at a time when freeway traffic was at its
heaviest and loss of life would have been extensive. The research project is
directed to a study of the performance of freeway bridges in the Whittier
Narrows earthquake. The research involves five stages: observed damage
assessment, component strength and deformation analysis, dynamic analysis of
selected bridge structures, recommendations on assessment and evaluation and
prioritization for retrofitting. The intention of the research is to obtain
maximum benefit from the lessons emphasized by bridge damage in the earthquake
in the form of improved understanding of the vulnerability of existing bridge
structures to seismic damage, calibration and assessment of analytical
techniques for analysis of seismic response of bridge structures, and in the
development and assessment of retrofit techniques to reduce the seismic risk of
freeway bridges.
