This award will support the training of graduate students in probability theory
at the University of Minnesota. The faculty consists of six well known
researchers in various areas of probability theory, who have a consistent tract
record of training strong students. This award will also support the post
doctoral research of Roger Tribe, who will conduct research in the area of
super-processes. These processes can be used to model the dispersion of certain
species of individuals.
