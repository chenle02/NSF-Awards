Through this project, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) is
recruiting undergraduate students majoring in Biology, Biotechnology,
Environmental Science, or Chemistry. With strong institutional support, the
project seeks to make a sustained impact on STEM programs at UNCP by
strengthening connections among UNCP's academic and student support programs,
while also reinforcing UNCP's connections with industry and local employers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical implementation of project activities begins
during students' sophomore year, when academically-talented cohorts of students
who demonstrate financial need receive scholarships, with the goal of increasing
the number of students earning STEM BS degrees and advancing to STEM careers or
graduate programs. To achieve its objectives, the project is guided by three
core strategies: (1) building a community of scholars, (2) close coordination of
program support activities with existing UNCP resources, and (3) a focus on STEM
career preparation. The project provides students with enhanced academic support
and career preparation services, which include intensive mentoring,
tutoring/supplemental instruction, scientific and career workshops, and
seminars. Career-oriented activities are all flexibly-designed to meet the needs
of the students. Rigorous data collection with assessment evaluates the
effectiveness of these interventions in meeting the unique needs of UNCP
students and to achieve successful student outcomes. Such data is helping to
establish a model for achievement that can be replicated in other STEM
disciplines at UNCP and sister UNC institutions.
