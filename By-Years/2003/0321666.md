This project supports the operations of the Plant Ontology Consortium (POC). The
goals of the POC are to develop a common set of controlled vocabulary terms to
describe anatomic and developmental stage terms in both experimental and
agronomically important plants. We have begun with Arabidopsis and cereals, and
will later extend this ontology to encompass legumes, Solanaceae, and other
families. Concurrently, we are applying these terms to the task of describing
the genes and mutants that are contained within the plant-specific databases
maintained by the participating institutions, thereby simultaneously refining
the ontologies, and providing points of reference with which to compare the
genes and mutants across these species.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
project is that it provides a framework of plant development to allow
researchers to make meaningful cross-database queries across the various
species-specific resources in order to discover patterns of similarities and
dissimilarities involved in plant development. For example, researchers will be
able to obtain a definitive list of genes whose action affects plant stem
development. The interaction between research communities will be facilitated by
a "Rosetta stone" that bridges their historical differences in terminology. This
will allow the fruits of research in one plant species to be more easily used in
the study of other species, leading to a greater understanding of plant biology.
This in turn will aid in the creation of new varieties of crop plants to meet
the food needs of an ever-growing world population, to the development of
pharmaceuticals to treat human disease, and the creation of new classes of
herbicides, pesticides and biological control measure to counter the growing
impact of resistant weeds and pests on world-wide
agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables from this
project include: (a) an ontology describing plant anatomy; (b) an ontology
describing plant developmental stages; (c) a web site that stores plant ontology
associations to strains, mutants and genes from multiple participant databases;
(d) a series of users group meetings that provide education and outreach
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
