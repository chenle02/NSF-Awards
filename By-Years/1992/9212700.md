This is an engineering research equipment grant for acquisition of a four-
channel modal analysis system and a real-time digital control system which will
be dedicated to interdisciplinary research in engineering. The equipment will be
used primarily at the present time to support an ongoing NSF sponsored research
effort between civil and electrical engineering on robust and nonlinear feedback
control of structures for earthquake hazard mitigation. The modal analysis
system will allow for accurate determination of mathematical models from which
appropriate control strategies can be developed and allow prescribed modelling
uncertainties and errors to be introduced to assess the robustness and
performance of the controlled structure. The real- time digital control system
will allow advanced control theories to be implemented and verified. This
equipment will accelerate development of control strategies that more
effectively compensate for the inherent uncertainty that can plague controlled
performance in full-scale structures. Further, the equipment will assist in
delineating between various promising control strategies and used to better
focus research efforts into facets of the problem which are most beneficial.
