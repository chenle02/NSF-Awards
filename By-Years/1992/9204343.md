In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, sponsored by the Chemistry
Division, Profs. Cross and Saunders (Yale University) will study reaction
dynamics of chemiionization using crossed molecular beams. These include Lewis
acid/base, Bronsted acid/base, electron transfer, and SN2 reactions involving
large molecules of general chemical interest. A novel feature of the project is
the catalytic absorption of photons by transition state species. %%% Profs.
Cross and Saunders (Yale University) will use molecular beams and ultraviolet
radiation to measure the rates and elucidate the mechanisms of gas phase
reactions of general chemical interest. Many of these reactions are well known
in solution but proceed by quite different pathways in the gas, where no solvent
is present. The nature of reactive intermediates in these reactions has been
difficult to determine and has generated much controversy. The successful use of
light to directly stimulate reactive intermediates is an important advance
because it removes a major source of ambiguity.
