The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will undertake an engineering
development and testing program to upgrade a suite of Ocean Bottom Seismometers
(OBS') for deployments of up to one year. Approximately thirty OBS' have been
made available to the ocean science community. Half of the instruments are
maintained on the East Coast at WHOI, and an equal number on the West Coast at
Scripps. The suite of instruments were designed to have common capabilities and
response characteristics, and modular design was use2d so various components
could be readily upgraded. The standard battery packs and data loggers allow for
deployments of only two months. Scientific requirements increasingly call for
longer deployments, lasting up to one year. Two of the standard OBS' will be
converted with new battery packs and corrosion preventative measures. One of the
units will be deployed offshore for a year, but checked on a regular basis.
Results of this development and testing program will be shared with other
institutions that use the instruments.
