AST-9619574 Analytical Explanations of Chaos and Order in Planetary Motions. An
understanding of the origin and evolution mf planetary systems and their
constituent bodies has to incorporate a clarification of the nature of chaos and
order in planetary motions. Drs. Varadi and Kaula, at the University of
California at Los Angeles, will investigate and clarify the causes of these
seemingly distinct types of behaviors. The work seeks analytical explanations
for the chaotic nature of the motion of the Jovian planets. A more complete
understanding of the role of chaos may lead to a better understanding of the
formation and clearing of the resonance gaps in the asteroid belt, the range of
possible stable orbits in and around the giant planet zones, and the long- term
stability of planets in the terrestrial zone.
