Abstract DBI 9750301 Lauren V. Riters This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Neuroendorcrine control of seasonal singing in starlings." For many
birds, lengthening days lead to elevation of testosterone levels and changes in
the area of the brain necessary for singing. But birds also sing during
shortening days when the level of testosterone and the brain regions required
for song are unchanged. This study uses starlings to investigate how changes in
day length modifies the responsiveness of the brain to testosterone and how
environmental factors affect the brain to produce seasonally relevant behavior.
