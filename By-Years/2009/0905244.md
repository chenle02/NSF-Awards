The research investigates a new method for detecting errors that occur at module
boundaries involving complex application program interfaces. The method first
dynamically observes running programs to obtain constraints that characterize
successful interactions at module boundaries. It then uses symbolic dynamic
taint tracing to obtain symbolic expressions that characterize how regions of
the input map to specific values that appear at module boundaries. A constraint
solver then generates new input regions that produce values at module boundaries
that violate the observed constraints. The final step is to run the program on
the resulting new inputs to see if the inputs expose errors involving
interactions between modules.

The significance of the research is that many reusable modules present complex
interfaces that are difficult for developers to understand. Module boundaries
therefore comprise a prime location for errors and security vulnerabilities in
software systems. The research promises to develop new testing techniques for
finding and eliminating these errors and vulnerabilities. Broader impacts
include more reliable software infrastructure for our society and the education
of a skilled workforce. Intellectual merit includes a better understanding of
errors in software systems and new techniques for finding and eliminating these
errors.
