This dissertation research will construct an experiment to test how the
encouragement of cheating has an effect on the frequency of subjects' cheating
and their tendency to encourage others to cheat. Two aspects of the situation
are varied: the person encouraging the cheating has high, low, or undefined
status; and the encouragement to cheat is endorsed or not by the subjects'
workgroup. The experimental test is derived from well established theories and
research on deviance that emphasize the importance of peers on deviant behavior.
The results should specify more precisely how this influence
operates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
