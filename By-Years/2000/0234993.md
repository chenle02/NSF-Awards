George Ewing of Indiana University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to carry out research that aims to quantify the unique
thermodynamic properties of thin film water on model insulator surfaces,
principally by infrared spectroscopy. These properties include free energy,
enthalpy and entropy values, freezing points (if indeed films do freeze), and
phase relationships in the formation of gas clathrate hydrates within the films.
In addition, spectroscopic studies, together with theoretical collaborations,
are expected to yield structural information on molecular orientations and
hydrogen bonding networks from submonolayer to multilayer adlayers of water. The
model insulator surfaces will include those associated with ionic (such as
magnesium oxide), covalent (such as silica), and molecular (such as
polyethylene) substrates. Ice near its melting point will receive particularly
close attention as a substrate. Surface melting studies of ice induced by
gaseous sulfur dioxide and formation of the sulfur dioxide-clathrate at the ice-
vapor interface could improve understanding of the nature of anomalous sulfur
dioxide uptake by snow in the Earth's polar regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin
films of water coat many common substances in the natural environment, including
ice near its melting point. Like other nanostructures, thin films of water
exhibit behavior that is different from that of bulk liquid water. This research
will explore significant properties of these ubiquitous films. Outcomes are
expected to impact fundamental issues in the properties of thin water films, and
will be relevant to many problems in environmental science. Examples of
applications where thin water films play an important role are in cloud
formation, soil properties, and caking problems in solids (such as salt,
detergents, and fertilizer).&lt;br/&gt;
