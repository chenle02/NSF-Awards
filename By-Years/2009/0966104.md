The WATer Engineering Research Scholars (WATER Scholars) program is supporting
financially needy students who exhibit academic promise and interest in water-
related research. Recruitment efforts are targeting students from
underrepresented groups from a variety of undergraduate engineering programs.
Each scholar is being supported for two years while earning a master's degree
from the Department of Civil Engineering or the Department of Biological and
Agricultural Engineering. To ensure scholars' success and eventual graduation,
the project is providing writing workshops, professional development seminars,
industry field trips, and mentoring of scholars by faculty and senior graduate
students. The goals of the project are to increase the quality, quantity and
diversity of the engineering workforce, with particular emphasis on building
workforce expertise in water-related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
