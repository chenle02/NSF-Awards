The proposal has two main goals. The first is a systematic development of
Lorentz dynamics. A major milestone would be a complete description of the
connected Lie groups that admit a nonproper action on a connected Lorentz
manifold. In the case of simple Lie groups, there are definitive results due to
N. Kowalsky, but the non-semisimple case is, for now, wide open. The second main
goal of the proposal is to extend known rigidity results from geometry to a
foliated setting with tangential geometry and with transverse invariant measure.
Much work in this direction has been done by many mathematicians, but the
procedures used have often been ad hoc in nature, with a different method
developed for each individual theorem. The goal here would be to find an
approach that would systematize the process and that would give, in some cases,
stronger foliated results than were previously possible. The proposal has two
main goals. The first involves understanding the ways in which chaotic dynamics
can happen in a space-time setting. It is a tenet of general relativity that our
universe is a space-time manifold and it should therefore be of some interest to
know which space-times have a complicated (that is, "chaotic") collection of
symmetries. The second main goal is to use a combination of some sophisticated
dynamical machinery and some sophisticated geometric machinery to understand a
collection of mathematical objects called "foliations." These objects relate to
dynamical physics, since the set of trajectories of a flow give rise to a
foliation. However, in the incarnation that I am using, a foliation carries an
enormous amount of structure, making it rich in a mathematical sense, but
probably more complicated than what would be studied (currently!) by most
scientists outside of mathematics.
