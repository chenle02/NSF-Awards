Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;The College is involved in an effort to transform
regular classrooms into "Learning College" classrooms across the institution. As
part of this institutional effort, the Chemistry Department is transforming
course material to contextual formats. In this project, the faculty in chemistry
are working together with Forensic Scientists from a regional crime laboratory
to incorporate GC/MS experiments across the two-year college chemistry
curriculum, including Organic Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry, College Chemistry,
and General Chemistry courses. The objectives of the proposal are to: 1. adapt,
adopt, and pilot test laboratory experiments in organic, forensic, general, and
college chemistry courses; 2. provide faculty development on the use,
calibration, and maintenance of the GC/MS; and 3. expand outreach to high school
chemistry teachers and students through a Sinclair program called the Friday
Visitation Program. The project is meeting the needs of high school and two-year
college students for GC/MS experience as they matriculate to universities and
enter the workforce as technicians. The results of the project will be
disseminated through presentations at professional conferences and articles in
journals. &lt;br/&gt;
