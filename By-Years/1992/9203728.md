Dimethyl sulfide is the major form of volatile reduced sulfur which is emitted
form the oceans to the atmosphere. The flux of DMS has an important impact on
atmospheric chemistry and possibly global climate. The biogeochemical processes
which control DMS concentrations in seawater are complex and poorly understood.
DMS is produced from the degradation of B-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a
natural product of certain marine phytoplankton. However, recent investigations,
suggest that only a small fraction. of the total DMSP-sulfur in seawater is
likely to escape to the atmosphere. This research will investigate several key
aspects of the seawater DMS cycle; 1) The mechanisms and rates of DMS
degradation in seawater, concentrating mainly upon biological processes, and to
a lesser extent photochemical processes; and 2) The production of DMS from DMSP
and testing whether two different pathways are involved in DMSP degradation.
