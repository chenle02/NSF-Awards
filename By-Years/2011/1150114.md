This project examines the professional development of graduate students in
emerging but contentious scientific fields, and the possible implications for
their future careers in science. For this project, contentious science is
science for which there are "substantive ethical concerns that may lead
scientists as well as the broader public to call the value of scientific inquiry
into question and inspire policy responses that hinder rather than advance
scientific progress." The project focuses on two specific fields of contentious
science: stem cell science and bio-nanotechnology. This work has potential to
inform training of future scientists for research in contentious fields and,
thus, to contribute to long-term efforts to stimulate innovative research in
these emerging areas of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's activities
will include two phases of research. In the first phase, the PI will conduct
interview studies with graduate students and early-career scientists. The
purpose of this phase is to refine a theoretical framework about the factors
that may influence graduate students' decisions to enter, stay in, or leave
research programs in contentious science. The findings will inform the second
phase, a three-wave panel survey of graduate students. This panel survey will
provide data on graduate students in contentious science fields, compared to
students in similar but non-contentious research areas. Results will be analyzed
to understand the relative influence of factors that influence career choices
and research decisions. The extent to which ethical controversy
disproportionately affects the graduate education and career development of
women and underrepresented minorities will also be addressed.
