BioCom, patterned after ChemCom, will focus on the study of a few, selected
biological concepts in an environmental, technological and community context.
Students will investigate an issue, discover appropriate biological principles
and apply their knowledge actively, in context, allowing them to construct
personal meaning in a setting where their explanation will be revealed. Students
will investigate, study and analyze what is necessary to resolve issues in
topics including Waste, Energy, Population Limits, Organismal Maintenance,
Population Maintenance, Behavior, and Evolution. Project 2061 themes for biology
and the human organism will be covered. The materials, the activities, and the
ancillaries will be developed by a team of scientists, biology educators and
high school teachers, guided by a national advisory board. The units will be
carefully pilot tested and field tested in diverse locations. The major products
of the project will be a student textbook, shorter than usual, a teacher
edition, a looseleaf teacher resource book with additional investigations,
project masters, test items, and a high-tech kit. The materials will be
published by Kendall/Hunt, who will also support teacher enhancement.
