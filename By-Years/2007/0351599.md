Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award the PIs will probe the nature of
high latitude influences on tropical oceanography during the late Pleistocene 41
kyr regime. The PI will increase knowledge of how high latitude processes
interact with the tropical oceans to produce large-scale changes. The PIs will
determine: Amplitudes of SST change at orbital frequencies in the 1.2-1.8 Ma at
various tropical lcations. Correlation of SST changes to thermocline proxies at
each site. Correlation of multiple proxies, where obtained (e.g. Mg/Ca, C37total
vs. F. profunda). Phase relations of SST change to benthic d18O and
presence/absence of a circa 100 kyr component to SST &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
