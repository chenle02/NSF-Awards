The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using fish
ventilatory behavior in a system designed to monitor quality of water. Research
during this initial phase involves determining the magnitude of the ventilatory
response of fish to presence of toxic substances and improvement of
instrumentation for determining the nature of the response and its magnitude.
This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31,
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR). The project addresses a significant
problem by proposing to develop instrumentation that can be used to detect the
presence and significance of substances of environmental significance in water.
The system may also be applied to screening of new products to determine their
potential effect on environmental quality during production and when released to
environmental waters.
