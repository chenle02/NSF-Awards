This project studies the power of quantum computers. The main goal is to
determine which problems have efficient quantum algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;which
ones remain hard in the presence of quantum computers. This is a fundamental
question in computer science. One objective is to find new applications for
quantum computers. A second objective is to understand which cryptosystems are
secure against quantum computers. These systems must be based on problems that
cannot be solved efficiently by quantum computers. The PI and his graduate
students are considering these types of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project considers new approaches for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. A
quantum algorithm for this problem, if found, would break some candidates for
quantum-secure cryptosystems. If more evidence is found that the problem is
difficult to solve, then it increases the confidence in the security of the
proposed systems. Another type of potential speedup is for optimization
problems. The work addresses whether certain settings for the approximate
adiabatic algorithm exist for which the quantum algorithm achieves a
better&lt;br/&gt;approximate solution than the best classical algorithm. The
last problem deals with understanding Hamiltonian complexity.
