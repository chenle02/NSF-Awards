Professor Kai C. Hulzsch of Rutgers University New Brunswick is supported by the
Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop novel rare
earth and group 4 metal based catalyst systems for the hydroamination reaction,
with particular attention given to stereochemical aspects of this
transformation. A key goal of this project is to identify catalysts that combine
high catalytic activity and consistent high stereoselectivity for a broad range
of substrates. A broad substrate screening with particular emphasis on
functional group tolerance will be accompanied by mechanistic and kinetic means
to elucidate the structure of reaction intermediates and develop models for the
transition states. &lt;br/&gt;The hydroamination reaction represents a highly
valuable transformation that promises to revolutionize the synthesis of nitrogen
containing molecules, with potential applications in the syntheses of nitrogen
containing basic and fine chemicals, as well as pharmaceuticals, directly from
petrochemical feedstock. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained in state of the art synthetic techniques, and will be exposed to a
variety of spectroscopic techniques including multidimensional NMR, and a mutual
exchange program with universities in Germany will be developed to increase
cultural and social exchange between US and German students.
