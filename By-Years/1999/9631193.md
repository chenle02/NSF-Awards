*** 9631193 Sriram This STTR Phase I proposal will demonstrate the feasibility
of novel integrated optical waveguide devices using the emerging technology of
electro-optic polymeric materials. Such devices would offer significant benefits
for optical communication, signal processing, computing and sensing
applications. The overall objective of Phase I is to incorporate an electro-
optic polymer on a silicon substrate to form integrated optic waveguide devices.
The program will investigate both electro-optic polymers with established
properties and electro-optic polymers at the forefront of development which have
potential for improved performance. Polymers developed in the polymer research
laboratories at the University of Cincinnati will be incorporated in the later
stages of the device fabrication process. To demonstrate feasibility in this
Phase I effort, new electro-optic organic polymers and novel optoelectronic
device technology will be combined to demonstrate a commercially viable electric
field sensor. Phase I will serve as a foundation for exploring in Phase II the
possibility of creating other device configurations, such as optical modulators
for optical communication and signal processing. Applications include external
modulation of lasers for communication and CATV, modulator arrays for data
networks, optical network units in Fiber-in-the-Home, hybrid integration of
silicon ICs and photonic circuits, A/D and D/A converters, voltage and electric
field sensors. ***
