A pair of large multilayer reflectors will be designed and fabricated, one to
operate just above, and one just below the K- edge of iodine for application to
dual-energy subtraction angiography using synchrotron radiation. The specular-
angular responses at the K-edge will be measured, and the performance will be
analyzed in a synchrotron angiography beam line, in this Phase II program.
Additional studies of fabrication parameters will be carried out with a view of
optimizing reflectivity.
