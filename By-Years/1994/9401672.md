9401672 DeHaan This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. David DeHaan to work with Dr. Frode Storda at the Norwegian
Institute for Air Research and Dr. Claus Jorgen Nielsen at the University of
Oslo. This research will focus on chlorine peroxide (ClOOCl), a compound
believed to be active in the destruction of ozone in the polar stratosphere but
never measured in situ. Recently, it has been shown that chlorine peroxide will
react with holide ions on ice surfaces. A flow-tube reactor will be interfaced
to spectrophotometric detectors in order to quantitatively identify all ClOOCl
reaction products and study the reaction mechanism in detail. A Knudsen cell
reactor will also be used to measure the sticking coefficient of ClOOCl on ice
surfaces. The newly-discovered reaction will be incorporated into state-of-the-
art "air parcel" atmospheric models. In addition, Dr. DeHaan will have an
opportunity to participate with scientists from all over Europe in the Second
European Stratospheric Arctic and Mid-latitude Experiment (SESAME), a field
measurement campaign studying the composition of stratospheric ice particles, in
situ ice-surface chemistry, and chlorine partitioning. ***
