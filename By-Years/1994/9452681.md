9452681 Seelke The University of Wisconsin-Superior will initiate a five-week,
residential, Young Scholars Project in aquatic and fisheries biology for sixteen
American Indian Students entering grades 11 or 12. Through a combination of
field, laboratory and classroom activities, three students will receive a
positive and supportive introduction to science. They will learn to monitor the
health of aquatic communities, and then use this background to evaluate a lake
or stream as a fish habitat. Their learning will culminate in group projects in
which they conduct environmental or fisheries assessments of a lake or stream,
presenting their results to their peers. The training that students receive will
enable them to develop independent study projects which will be completed at
their local schools during the following academic year.
