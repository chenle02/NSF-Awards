This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in the purchase
of a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Research projects which will benefit
from the new instrument include: 1. Cyclic Hydropyran Oligolides: Novel
Macrocycles as Ion Carriers and as Templates for Ion Channels; 2. Mechanistic
Organometallic Chemistry; 3. Boron Hydrides; 4. Non-Covalent Interactions; 5.
Radical Cation and Electron Transfer Chemistry; 6. Mitomycin Analogs,
Stereocontron in Organic Synthesis. %%% The research projects listed above
represent only a small sample of the total number of research projects which
will benefit from the purchase of the new instrument. Such an instrument is
essential to front-line research in synthetic chemistry, since it provides a
means of rapidly identifying known compounds among reaction products and of
providing structural information about new compounds.
