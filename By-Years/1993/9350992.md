9350992 Mitchell Students can be passive in their approach to learning
mathematics, and they too frequently are unmotivated to expend much effort on
learning this subject because they fail to see the relevance, importance, and
power of mathematics. This project is actively involving students in the process
of learning, and giving them a feel of the potential effect of mathematics on
their lives. In order to do this, they are establishing a networked computer
classroom/laboratory dedicated to mathematics. This is enabling students to
learn by discovery instead of by memorizing facts, to concentrate on concepts
instead of the details of arithmetic, to interact with one another and the
mathematics instead of struggling alone or withdrawing from the situation, and
to receive immediate attention from the instructor-via the network eye instead
of only discovering that their work is in error later, while doing their
homework or on an exam. ***
