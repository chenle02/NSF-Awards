PMSA-9453842 Jefferson County Public Schools Louisville, KY Podbelsek, Allen
"Partnership for Minority Student Achievement" Jefferson County Public Schools,
collaborating with a university, community agencies, and local businesses, will
implement a five year Partnership for Minority Student Achievement program that
will address the critical problem of preparing more minority students to enter
college and pursue mathematics/science/engineering careers. The project will
directly impact 2,900 of the district's 30,000+ minority students, their
parents, and 390 teachers in 155 schools. The project will replicate the
concepts and activities of the following successful models: AVID (Advancement
Vis individual Determination), SECME (Science Engineering Communications and
Mathematics Enrichment), Kentucky K-4 Mathematics Specialist program, SUM
(Success understanding Mathematics), and TEAMS (Teaching Elementary Assessments
in Math and Science). The project will use staff development, classroom
instruction, and student activity components to 1) prepare teachers to develop
new teaching strategies, 2) involve students in hands-on mathematics and science
activities, 3) encourage parents to take part in their child's education, 4)
improve study skills, 5) stress the importance of science and mathematics
education, and 6) expose minority students to minority role models in the
professional community.
