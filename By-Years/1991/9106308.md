This sample preparation equipment includes a state-of-the-art ion mill, a
specimen grinding system, and a new parallel electron energy loss spectrometer
acquisition system to be used for hard and brittle samples prior to study in the
existing transmission electron microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, and
scanning auger spectrometer housed in the Microstructural Analysis Facility. %%%
The Facility operates as a cost-center and includes two TEM's, two SEM's, two
hot-stages, an evaporator, an electropolishing unit, an oven and grinding wheels
for sample preparation. A new scanning Auger is being acquired. Two technicians
operate and maintain the instruments, which primarily serve Materials
Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry
Departments.
