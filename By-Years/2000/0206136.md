The New England Aquarium proposes to develop a traveling exhibition based on
recent research implicating human activities in the worldwide increase in
jellies. Humans are changing oceans so that they are becoming more suitable for
jellies than for fish. The exhibition is expected to reach 12 million people --
primarily families with school-aged children -- across the nation. No jelly
exhibit to date has shown jellies as important indicator species and ecosystem
linchpins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination will include materials and
programs for school and community outreach. A Sea Jelly Activity Kit and a
community art/science program will be developed. In each year of the project
approximately 100 urban teens will intern in the jelly culturing facility, where
they can learn about the science of culturing jellies and present their
experiences to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
