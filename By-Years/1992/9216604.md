This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in materials
science between Richard M. Laine of the University of Michigan and Jacques
Livage of the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France. The
investigators propose to explore the use of novel silicate and alumino silicate
as polymer precursors to oxide and oxynitride glasses and ceramics. The
University of Michigan laboratory will synthesize a series of related silicon
containing precursors, pyrolize them according to a matrix of heating schedules.
The Paris group will characterize the products' chemical composition, ceramic
phase and microstructural makeup through Magic Angel Spinning and solid state
NMR techniques. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
precursor polymer synthesis. This is complemented by the French investigator's
well-established program in sol-gel and ceramics analysis. The research will
advance understanding of the fundamental principles for design of precursors to
multi- component (metallic) oxide/oxynitride glasses and ceramics.
