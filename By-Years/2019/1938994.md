The broader impact of this I-Corps project will be to enable bio-sensing
earphones for personalized healthcare. It can benefit a wide range of systems
and applications that require continuous and long-term personal monitoring, such
as user behavior analysis, seizure suppression, sleep improvement, and
personalized education. Currently, there are 3 billion people without access to
healthcare who could potentially benefit from the device. Mobile healthcare is
rapidly growing, emerging industry in need of a socially acceptable, platform
technology to enable healthcare applications outside the hospital. This project
will directly support national level initiatives on improving healthcare
practices and enhancing future workforce capability. To make the broadest impact
possible, the project will initially focus on individual customers, to improve
lives in ways that were technologically impossible before. The potential
innovation enables a mobile healthcare platform for everyday use with high
accuracy, low cost, and high comfort to users.

This I-Corps project includes several innovations to enable previously
impossible mobile physiological sensing. This ear-worn device enables everyday
users to access the medically valuable physiological data from the human head in
a comfortable, small, and wearable form factor placed in or around the ears. The
project's algorithms, hardware, and software can infer the wearer's mental,
physiological, and physical states from the ears. The resulting innovation
enables immediate access to vital health information such as sleep deprivation,
attention, and even seizure onset without using obtrusive, expensive hospital
equipment. The team will evaluate the platform through customer discovery and
other commercialization focused evaluations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
