9504898 Wolfson The proposed research lies in the area of symplectic geometry.
This investigator uses techniques from nonlinear PDEs and complex geometry to
tackle certain problems in symplectic geometry. In particular, several problems
concerning Lagrangian minimal surfaces and the quantum cohomology group are to
be considered. Symplectic geometry provides a mathematical setting for many
problems in classical mechanics as well as quantum mechanics. The existence of
Lagrangian minimal surfaces, which are extremal objects in symplectic geometry,
is a fundamental problem with many possible applications to physics.
