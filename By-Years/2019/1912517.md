Although chip manufacturers continue to increase the number of transistors that
can fit into a single computer chip, making use of these additional transistors
to improve performance of new computers is increasingly more challenging. In the
past several years, the pace of performance improvements of each generation of
computer processors have come down, with the traditional techniques for
improving performance reaching diminishing returns. This work develops
Speculative Memoization, a new technique with potential to more effectively use
additional transistors for improving processor performance. Speculative
Memoization can enable significant increases in the performance of future
computers, increasing user productivity and providing more immersive user
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional ways of improving processor
performance targeted increasing the sizes of on-chip buffers, such as caches,
re-order buffers, and branch predictors. Increasing the buffer sizes offers some
performance improvement, but does not reduce the total work done by the
processor. Instead, Speculative Memoization offers a radical alternative,
identifying repeating work that the processor has already done and avoiding
redundant execution, therefore, improving performance by reducing the total
amount of work done by the processors. This work explores the limits of
performing memoization in hardware, proposes designs for the hardware
memoization mechanisms, and works to mitigate the compiler and system software
effects on such memorization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
