Why do scientists accept or reject new theories? The primary goal of this
research project is to determine the various background variables that influence
attitudes toward innovation in science. Professor Sulloway's research design,
which is multivariate and epidemiological in nature, encompasses 80 variables
and nearly 3000 participants in 28 highly diverse scientific controversies.
Based on preliminary research and multivariate modeling techniques, the most
significant predictors of attitudes toward scientific innovation include (in
order of importance): birth order, which mediates differential identification
with parents and authority; time elapsed since the announcement of the theory;
age; political and religious attitudes; personal contact with the originator of
the new theory; and national differences. Professor Sulloway is examining three
areas of further research. First, he is refining these statistical models by
obtaining questionnaire data on the nature of each scientific controversy and
the theoretical changes that ensued. His questions are also aimed at testing
various assumptions regarding the nature of scientific change that have
preoccupied philosophers of science. Second, he is developing specific models
for individual debates that will allow the rigorous testing of historical
hypotheses. Lastly, he is completing data collection for this project.
