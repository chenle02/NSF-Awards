The proposed research addresses fundamental mathematical issues in polymer
rheology and continuum mechanics. One area of research is the study of high
Weissenberg number asymptotics of viscoelastic flows. This concerns the limit
when elastic effects are strong. In this case, the mathematical solutions of the
equations often show singular features such as singularities at corners and
boundary layers at walls and separating streamlines. Failure to resolve these
singularities continues to be one of the major impediments towards successful
numerical simulation of viscoelastic flows. The proposed research will explore
the application of asymptotic methods in this field to clarify the analytical
nature of the solution. A second area of the proposed research concerns flow
instabilities. Specific problems to be studied are the process of fiber
spinning, and the related problems of film casting and film blowing. One aspect
of these flows which has received only scant attention in theoretical studies is
the liquid to solid transition and the associated dynamics of the freezing
point. The proposed research will study this problem with the objective of
elucidating stability boundaries and qualitative dynamics as well as basic
mathematical issues such as the well-posedness of the free boundary value
problem and the relation between stability and spectral properties. Another
topic of the proposal is the investigation of the nature of the spectrum which
arises in studying the linearized stability of viscoelastic shear flows.
Finally, the proposal addresses a question in control of linear elastic solids
by imbedded actuators, namely the question which configurations of the boundary
can be achieved with certain types of controls. This work is joint with David
Russell. The proposed research in fluid dynamics has significant implications
for materials science. In the processing of polymeric liquids, e.g. the
manufacture of plastics, the flow of the liquid during processing conditions
often has a major impact on the quality and properties of the product. The
understanding and simulation of these flows is therefore of importance. The
proposal addresses mathematical singularities in the high elasticity limit which
pose a major challenge to numerical simulations and need to be resolved at a
fundamental level if further progress is to be made. Another aspect of the
proposal is the study of flow instabilities. Such instabilities can arise in
processing operations where they often lead to unacceptable products. Finally,
the proposal addresses new mathematical questions which arises in the study of
"smart" materials.
