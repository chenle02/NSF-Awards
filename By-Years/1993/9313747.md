9313747 Garriott A grant is made to Volunteers In Technical Assistance (VITA)
for an innovative, low-cost approach to producing introductory video training
about the Internet. Students and staff of Barry University's Broadcast
Communications will videotape tutorial and other selected sessions at the
upcoming Workshop for Developing Countries which immediately precedes the INET
93 Conference (San Francisco, August, 1993). VITA will supervise the scripting
and editing of up to eight instructional sets of video tapes, based on the
workshop sessions. There is some risk that the non-interference restrictions
placed on the taping process could impair the usefulness of the recordings. If
the recordings are found acceptable for the intended instructional use, the
tapes will be made available (for no more than copying and distribution costs)
to the Internet community.
