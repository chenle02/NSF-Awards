9507829 Alvarez Quantum field theory is the primary tool for studying elementary
particle theory. It has several unresolved problems, a key one being the
relationship between fermions and bosons (supersymmetry). It is believed that
there are other symmetries which have not yet been discovered and that new
mathematical techniques will need to be found to analyze them. This research
seeks to address these problems in part directly and in part through knowledge
acquired in the study of statistical mechanics systems and of string theory. ***
