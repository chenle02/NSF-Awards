The Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy (CASA) will host
6-8-undergraduates for the summer of 1989. The students, half drawn from the
University of Colorado (CU) and half drawn from other institutions in Colorado
or adjacent states, will spend ten weeks in a program designed to maximize both
their educational and research experience. The program will begin with an
intensive, two-week training period in which students will be given a thorough
overview of the facilities and research tools available at CASA, and will be
introduced to the CASA faculty and the available research projects. By the end
of the training period each student will choose, or be assigned to, an
individual research project under the guidance of a CASA scientist. Throughout
the ten-week program, students will continue to meet for a daily seminar,
entitled "Research in Astrophysics", for which they will receive three units of
academic credit at the University of Colorado. The seminar will present students
with a theoretical framework in relevant astrophysical topics, provide a wide
survey of the astrophysical research at CASA, and offer advice and guidance on
graduate school or future careers in astrophysics' as a "final exam", students
will present oral and written summaries of their own research. In summary, the
Principal Investigators' program anticipates a progressive pattern of student
activities. Students begin by participating in CASA's summer program, in which
they will develop the background and skills needed for continued research
success. Following the summer program, it is hoped that students will continue
with independent support to the development of a senior thesis in astrophysics,
which in turn can lead into a successful graduate experience and career.
