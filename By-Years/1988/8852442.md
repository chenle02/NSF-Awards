The chemistry faculty are updating and expanding their chemistry and
biochemistry curriculum. A high-field Fourier transform NMR spectrometer is
being used in the teaching of organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and
biochemistry as well as in student-initiated studies and faculty sponsored
research. The capability of obtaining high-resolution proton and carbon-13
spectra of complex molecules is essential in structure determination of natural
products, verification of synthetic products, and the study of reaction
mechanisms. Hands-on student exposure to a technology as important to the
chemical and biological sciences as high-field NMR is dramatically improving the
teaching of science at Evergreen. The instrument is being use as the primary
analytical tool in organic chemistry, and is exposing students in physical
chemistry and biological sciences, through specific experiments and student
projects to the technique. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
