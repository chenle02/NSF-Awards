This award will fund a workshop to bring together media and education
specialists with environmental scientists to discuss new ways to engage the
public and further their understanding of environmental issues. The focus is on
complex system thinking and how to communicate better the notion of nonlinear
dynamics, tipping points and catastrophic change in coupled natural-human
systems. A special emphasis is finding ways to improve informal education
regarding the impacts of climate change. This workshop represents a first step
towards defining new ways to attract public interest and improve their
understanding of complex environmental problems. It brings together different
groups of people (media, education and environmental science) in an appropriate
venue to stimulate transformational thinking on the use of web-based technology
for informal environmental science education. The workshop combines two
compelling aspects: the learning potential of simulation and gaming software
that can be made widely accessible over the internet; and the concept of
surprise within complex dynamical systems. The participants will include
expertise from both of these areas. The workshop is expected to broadly impact
informal science education and environmental science literacy. There is also the
potential that this interdisciplinary meeting will catalyze new collaborations
across the environmental science, media science and education communities. The
workshop will include 25-30 participants and be held at the Exploratorium, which
is a science museum in San Francisco.
