A product is said to exhibit network effects if individual consumers value it
more when greater numbers of other consumers purchase or use it. The expansion
of social media and internet technology has led to the emergence of new products
that display network effects (for example, multi-player online games, group
buying opportunities). It has also served to strengthen network effects for
traditional products such as movies, television programs, and books by allowing
individuals to easily participate in online communities built around those
products. In the meantime, advances in information technology have enabled firms
that sell such products to collect large quantities of data in hopes of better
understanding how customers choose among multiple potential purchases. For these
firms, a significant challenge is to find ways of making product pricing and
assortment planning decisions that account for network effects. This research
project will address this challenge and, in doing so, will provide methodologies
that hold the potential to improve the profitability of firms engaged in
internet commerce. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the
project and will gain exposure to techniques of mathematical modeling and
optimization, thereby providing them with sophisticated technical skills as they
enter the workforce. Consequently, the research will benefit the United States
economy as well as society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will
study mathematical models of customer choice behavior with network effects, and
will use those models as the basis for multi-product pricing and assortment
planning optimization problems. The project will employ variations of the
multinomial logit choice model, suitably modified to incorporate network
effects. In these modified models, the utility functions that drive individual
customer purchase decisions are affected by overall consumption or sales levels
of the products. This feature of the choice models adds difficulty to the
optimization problems, because product purchase probabilities are not merely
functions of product attributes, but rather are endogenous. This project will
involve the development and analysis of approaches needed to solve these
problems and will study the structure and properties of the resulting solutions.
