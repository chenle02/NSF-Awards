This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of theory of interfacial processes. During the tenure of this
three-year continuing grant, Professor Garrison and her students will apply
molecular dynamics techniques to an understanding of three important areas of
surface processes, namely the molecular beam epitaxial growth of semiconductors,
the etching of silicon surfaces by fluorine, and the interaction of energetic
(KeV) particles with solid surfaces. This research, which builds on Professor
Garrison's accomplishments under NSF grant CHE-8713796, represents significant
practical applications of theory to complex, real-world problems of immense
technological importance. In concert with state-of-the-art experimental studies
of these systems in the laboratories of collaborators, Professor Garrison's
research provides a unique framework both for the evaluation of theoretical
constructs and for the theoretically guided execution of experiments.
Additionally, this project offers a unique environment for the training of young
theorists who will be well-equipped to address challenging problems in materials
chemistry. This research impacts broadly on the technologically important areas
of microelectronics fabrication, materials processing, and surface analysis.
