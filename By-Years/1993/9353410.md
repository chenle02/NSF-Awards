Abstract ESI-9353410 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Mare Taagepera INSTITUTION:
University of California at Irvine TITLE: Orange County Science, Technology, and
Society Network This five year project proposes to establish an infrastructure
in Orange County for the continuous infusion of science/technology/society
issues into the secondary curriculum. This will be done by the partnership of
technically-based corporations with both postsecondary and K-12 schools by
blending the expertise of educators with the scientific, technical, and
management skills of industry. The project will work with 110
Science/Technology/Society Fellows or master teachers in a Leadership Institute.
It is estimated that the Fellows will influence and estimated 2000 teachers and
through them 200,000 students. This Network will encompass over 20 corporations
dealing with energy, aerospace, and biotechnology; the Orange County Department
of Education; and 10 post secondary institutions and all of the school districts
in Orange County. The project has approximately 35% in cost share of the face
value of it.
