The architecture of aquifers is of key concern in hydrogeology because it
largely controls the transport of subsurface fluids. Although geostatistical
models can describe some aspects of aquifer heterogeneity, there is information
about geologic processes and environments that has not been accounted for using
models of spatial correlation and connectedness. Using sedimentary process
simulation, petrophysics, geostatistics, and groundwater modelling, this
proposal aims to develop a geologic perspective on aquifer architecture. This
simulation approach explicitly considers the geologic processes which control
the evolution of aquifers and their resulting patterns of heterogeneity. The
proposed work will focus on alluvial environments and study local facies within
them. Large-scale sedimentary process modelling provides complete three-
dimensional images. The effect of the alluvial architecture on groundwater
transport will be analyzed using three-dimensional groundwater flow and particle
tracking. Transport through simulated aquifers derived using geostatistical
models will be compared with those derived using geologic process simulation. It
is the ultimate aim of this work to develop a unified approach to describe
aquifer architecture by combining large-scale information developed from
geologic process simulation with geostatistical descriptions of local-scale
variability.
