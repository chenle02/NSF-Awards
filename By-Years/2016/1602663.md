Jia Liu is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at Princeton University. Liu will
develop theoretical models and use them to interpret observations that could
provide new insight into dark energy, as well as a way to measure the total mass
of neutrinos. "Dark energy" is the term for the unknown form of energy that is
accelerating the expansion of the Universe. By improving constraints on key
cosmological parameters, the proposed research would significantly improve our
understanding of the Universe. For the education component of her work, Liu will
serve as a volunteer instructor for Princeton's Prison Teaching Initiative
(PTI), where she will teach college level mathematics and science courses,
including a new preparatory physics and astronomy course aimed at helping
inmates discover their interest in science and acquire the skills and
credentials to succeed in life outside prison. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liu will
undertake N-body ray-tracing simulations to investigate non-Gaussian statistics
that are essential for a proper interpretation of the weak lensing of galaxies
and the cosmic microwave background. The proposed work has the potential to (1)
improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state nearly twofold, thereby
doubling the output of survey observations with Advanced Atacama Cosmology
Telescope and the Hyper Suprime-Cam; and (2) shed light on the neutrino mass
hierarchy, a long-standing problem in particle physics. It will also advance our
understanding of weak lensing systematics, including photometric redshift,
intrinsic alignment of galaxies, and shape measurements. Reducing noise from
these systematics will further improve cosmological constraints. As a volunteer
instructor at PTI, Liu will teach college level mathematics and science courses
to inmates, design a new preparatory physics and astronomy course, and train
other instructors to teach the newly designed course.
