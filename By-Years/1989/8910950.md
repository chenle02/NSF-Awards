One of the major changes taking place in practical econometric analysis is the
increasing use of diagnostic statistics which are used to critique econometric
models and to stimulate model revisions. The use of diagnostic statistics
presents a challenge to statistical theory, classical or Bayesian. Traditional
statistical theory deals with the evaluation of planned responses to
hypothetical data sets. Indeed, it is impossible to compute sampling properties
without a set of plans indicating the response to the data for every conceivable
data set. The use of a diagnostic statistic to criticize a model is an advance
announcement that the planned response is not fully committed and may be revised
when the actual data are observed. The purpose of this project is to formulate
diagnostic statistics. Most of the effort will be devoted to elicitation
diagnostics, but some work well also be done on criticisms. The approach will be
Bayesian. Progress has already been made on the formulation of elicitation
diagnostics for the problem of choice of variables. Extensions of this work will
be undertaken to deal with other serious statistical problems such as
heteroscedasticity, nonnormality and serial correlation. This work is important
because it will better methods for estimating economic relationships.
