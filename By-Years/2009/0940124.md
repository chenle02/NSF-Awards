The research project entails a modeling effort with the goal of better
understanding the role of energetic particle precipitation at mesospheric
altitudes on temperature and chemical composition at stratospheric altitudes.
The nitric oxide produced by the precipitation of energetic electrons has a long
lifetime to be transported downwards into the stratosphere where it can affect
ozone chemistry. This process is especially effective during the polar winter.
The different components of this stratosphere-mesosphere coupling path are not
understood at present. The research work will be directed toward the evaluation
and improvement of modeling of this coupling in the framework of National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
(WACCM). In particular, improved gravity wave parameterizations will be
developed for WACCM to more accurately describe the downward transport of nitric
oxide and nitrogen dioxide induced by the precipitation. Furthermore, the
sensitivity of WACCM simulations to changes in gravity wave parameterization
will be quantified as well as nitric oxide transport variability.
