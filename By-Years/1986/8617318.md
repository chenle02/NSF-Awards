This proposal deals with the synthesis and characterization of glassy forms of
titanium carbide and titanium diboride--compounds known for high hardness, low
friction and chemical stability. It is suggested that these advantageous
characteristics will be enhanced by eliminating grain boundaries and long-range
order, i.e., by preparing the materials in an "amorphous" rather than
crystalline state. Preliminary results show that such specimens can be prepared
in the form of thin films by chemical vapor deposition using an organometallic
carrier molecule and by thermal vaporization on a cooled substrate. Analysis by
various spectroscopies indicate some interesting differences in the local
electronic and atomic environment of Ti, C and B in the films compared with
crystalline forms. A major investigative tool in this project is analysis of the
extended fine structure above the characteristic x-ray edge, studied by EXAFS
for Ti and by EXELFS for C and B. It is proposed to extend the preliminary study
to complete the characterization of the local environment in the disordered
films, test theoretical models proposed for glassy metals, determine
crystallization temperatures, and compare corrosion rates and friction
coefficients with crystalline forms of TiC and TiB2. The technological
implications of this work including applications for cutting tools, bearings,
and corrosion resistant surfaces, etc., will be addressed.
