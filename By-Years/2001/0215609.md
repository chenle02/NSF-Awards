This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports state-of-the-art
nanoindentation equipment for Grinnell College to conduct research on the
fundamental mechanisms of friction at the molecular level. The specific
equipment, a Hysitron TriboScope nanoindenter, is a probe device that
simultaneously measures normal and lateral forces, probe displacements, and
contact area. It can be interfaced with the Digital Instruments control base
already existing at Grinnell College. Student researchers will make use of the
equipment. Grinnell College's Physics Department graduates 10 to 20 physics
majors per year and has attained unique success in bringing women and minority
students into physics. Half of Grinnell's physics graduates pursue graduate
study in the sciences. The department views student-faculty research as an
extremely valuable part of an undergraduate physics education, benefiting both
students and faculty alike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The self-assembled monolayer
systems to be studied using this nanoindenter show promise as lubricants for a
new generation of microdynamic devices. They are also well-controlled
experimental and theoretical model systems for investigating the energy
dissipation mechanisms underlying friction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
