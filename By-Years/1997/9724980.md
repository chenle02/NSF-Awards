on the subject of "General Circulation Model Development" which will be held at
the University of California - Los Angeles campus, 20-22 January 1998. The
symposium is in honor of Dr. Akio Arakawa, one of the pioneers and continuing
leaders in the field of general circulation model (GCM) development. The invited
papers will be published in a book which will serve as a valuable reference on
the history and state-of-the-art of GCMs. International participation will be
strong and partial support is being provided by the World Climate Research
Program, the Japanese Meteorological Agency, and several U.S. federal agencies.
