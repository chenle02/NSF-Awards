Frogs and salamanders are key contributors to many ecosystem functions. It is a
concern, therefore, that amphibian species are declining worldwide, some to
extinction. Among the suspected causes of amphibian declines is the emergence of
infectious diseases. The proposed research will answer a series of questions
designed to test how extinction, disease, and environmental change are linked.
Do novel, highly virulent pathogens increase the chance of extinction? Does the
health of the host change the risk of infection? Are there environmental
conditions that increase the likelihood animals become ill? Why do emerging
diseases drive some populations or species to extinction but not others? An
international team of molecular biologists, immunologists, pathologists,
population ecologists, and epidemiologists will use experiments and observations
in the field and laboratory to answer these and related questions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of species on Earth is diminishing, and these
losses affect the capacity of ecosystems to deliver the goods and services
required to sustain life. Infectious diseases are likely responsible for species
losses in some ecosystems, but relatively little is known about how pathogens
increase the risk of extinction. From time to time the decline of a key species,
for example the American eagle, signals a degrading environment that also
threatens many other organisms. It is important to understand how infectious
diseases and amphibian declines are linked if we are to ensure a high quality
environment for our generation and those that follow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
