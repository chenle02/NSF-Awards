9708146 Srienc Flow cytometric techniques have been developed which permit the
experimental determination of the rate, transition, and partitioning functions
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell populations growing in balanced growth
conditions. These fundamental physiological functions, in combination with
population balance equations, rigorously describe the growth dynamics of cell
populations. Synchronous cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used to
verify the single- cell dynamic properties predicted by the theoretical
framework. Green fluorescent protein will be used as a marker protein to
systematically evaluate the growth dynamics as a function of environmental
conditions. The concepts developed for growth rates will be extended to evaluate
metabolic rates of nutrient uptake and product formation as a function of cell
cycle position. direct interactions of individual cells with the growth
environment will be experimentally measured using novel single-cell secretion
assays. The experimental environment will be modeled using the population
balance equation framework. ***
