The research covers theoretical investigations, experimental work, and practical
techniques in logic programming and deductive databases. Research is conducted
on extending well-founded semantics of logic programs to general well-founded
logic programs and then to disjunctive well-founded logic programs. Their model
theoretic, proof theoretic and fixpoint semantics are investigated. Proof
procedures are planned for implementation. In deductive databases, alternative
definitions of null values and to develop their model theoretic, proof theoretic
and fixpoint semantics are investigated. Proof procedures that are developed are
considered for implementation. In the area of disjunctive deductive databases,
bottom-up and top-down computation methods are to be investigated, algorithms
that are free of implications are studied, and finally the general case with
implications is considered. Computing answers to negated queries and conditions
under which one might reasonably compute answers in disjunctive databases are
also investigated. In separate efforts, investigations into approximate answers
to disjunctive logic programs and research in parallel inference systems are
conducted. The research will be useful for the development of knowledge base
systems and deductive databases in which the application requires disjuncts as
part of the theory.
