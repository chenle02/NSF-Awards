The southern high latitude troposphere (south of 60o S), in contrast to the
Arctic troposphere, lies over an elevated ice- covered continent and is
completely surrounded by the extensive and biologically active southern oceans.
It links the rest of the global atmosphere and the oceans with the Antarctic ice
sheet and stratosphere that are the focus of intense global change research
today. Relatively few coordinated studies of Antarctic tropospheric chemistry
and its controlling factors have been undertaken, despite the immense potential
of tropospheric processes to affect climate, for example through changes in the
production of cloud nuclei, and hence cloud metaphysics properties, that may
ultimately and significantly affect the radiation balance over the high latitude
oceanic regions. The topics to be highlighted in this symposium are: 1. Aerosols
and gases in the troposphere: sources, sinks, and occurrence. 2. Air-surface
exchange. 3. Troposphere-stratosphere exchange. 4. Ice-snow chemistry related to
tropospheric composition and climate. 5. Chemistry and physics of clouds. 6.
Role of meteorological processes.
