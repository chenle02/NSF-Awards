Research Objectives and Approaches The objective of this research is to create a
new form of holographic polymer film that can redirect sunlight over daily and
yearly variations in order to enable passive solar concentrators for energy
generation and passive solar lighting for energy conservation. The approach is
to tailor the polymer reaction and diffusion rates such that the holograms can
grow to 25 times the efficiency typical of such materials, enabling many thin
and 100% efficient films to be stacked into a single sheet. Design tools for
these angle and color selective films will be created to guide the fabrication
and test of functional samples.

Intellectual Merit The research will advance soft materials science by
investigating optically-initiated, strong segregation of polymers in solid
films. Specialized theoretical and numerical design tools will exploit this
enhanced control over 3D material properties to enable new classes of polymer
optical devices with large refractive index gradients. High-throughput film
fabrication processes will be created to realize these designs in economically-
relevant costs and sizes. In cooperation with two industrial partners, the
program will then fabricate and test specialized films for solar generation and
conservation applications.

Broader Impacts The program will establish a satellite research hub at an
undergraduate liberal arts college. Undergraduates will investigate materials
during the academic year, then spend summers integrating results into the larger
program at the University of Colorado.
