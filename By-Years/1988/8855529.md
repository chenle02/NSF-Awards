Boston's Museum of Science will expand a scientific problem solving pen- pal
program for children grades 4-9. "Science-by-Mail", to a national audience.
"Science-by-Mail", to a national audience. "Science-by-Mail" is a mentorship
program between scientists and children (as individuals or in groups of up to
four) in which subscribers receive three science challenge packets each year,
create solutions to open-ended problems posed in the packets, and then submit
their solutions to individual scientists for review and commentary. Each
subscriber receives a personal response from a scientist for each submission.
The Museum of Science will expand this program to a national audience by
creating 12 scientific challenge packets, opening and supporting 20 chapters at
science-technology centers around the country with materials, training and
promotional materials, and by working with the AAAS to recruit scientist-
reviewers. The museum will strengthen its ties with other national organizations
as well to recruit both subscribers and scientists. Museum of Science cost
sharing of $185,299 is 40% of total project cost. An estimated 60,000 children
will participate in the program and subscription income should make "Science-
by-Mail" self-sufficient by its third year.
