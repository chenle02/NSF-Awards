An innovative union of Cognitive Neuroscience, Robotics, and Avatar scientists
are coming together for a NSF "Signing Creatures Workshop" on November 14-15,
2013 at Gallaudet University (Washington, D.C.). The goal of the Workshop is to
explore the feasibility of creating Robot and Avatar creatures that can sign and
engage in interactive communication with young deaf and hearing children during
critical periods of human development. Language acquisition research has
established that children must receive early language exposure to achieve
language and reading success. Despite research demonstrating the healthy brain
benefits afforded to deaf children with early sign language exposure, this is
not available to deaf children born to non-signing parents. Signing Robots and
Avatar virtual humans can provide sign language to deaf children in
communicative toys and games, similar to learning products for hearing children.
The Workshop stems from a NSF grant to Cognitive Neuroscientist, Laura-Ann
Petitto, PI, (and Science Director and Co-PI of the NSF Science of Learning
Center, VL2, at Gallaudet) and Avatar scientist, David Traum, Co-PI, University
of Southern California. Joining them is Robotics scientist Paul Oh of Drexel
University. Broader Impact: The Workshop brings together deaf and hearing
scientists from a broad range of disciplines to address critically important
problems for education, learning, and reading in deaf children. The Workshop
gives rise to new cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge and exciting
explorations into the development of groundbreaking translational learning and
reading products for deaf and hearing children. Additional broad applications
include language translation, and high school and adult education.
