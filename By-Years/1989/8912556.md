This project will support a Special Year in Biomathematics to be held at the
University of Arizona during the 1989-90 academic year. Activities will include
a series of colloquia, workshops, short- and long-term visitors, and
interdisciplinary courses, all involving the interface between mathematics and
the biosciences. Particular emphasis will be placed on the following areas: (1)
excitable media, (2) biological solitons, (3) flow and transport in the
microcirculation, and (4) population dynamics and population genetics.
