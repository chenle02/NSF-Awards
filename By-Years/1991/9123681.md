The 32nd Midwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference, to be held May
13-16, at the University of Dayton will provide an opportunity for established
investigators, graduate students and postdoctoral students in the midwest to
exchange ideas, both informally and formally, by presenting their most recent
findings on the platform, and by means of posters. This will provide an
opportunity for graduate and postdoctoral students to present their own work,
often for the first time and to also observe examples of excellence provided by
presentations made by veteran investigators, To ensure the latter, there will be
an invited keynote speaker for all platform presentation sessions. The extensive
interaction among students, faculty and invited speakers will promote the
exchange of new information and an enthusiasm for teaching and research in
developmental biology.
