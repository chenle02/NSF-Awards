This project includes a series of activities to conduct research and learn
research techniques relevant to the ecology of aquatic macrophytes (higher
plants). The P.I. will visit Dr. Titus' laboratory to learn techniques for
raising various life forms of aquatic plants and will gain experience from
rearing propagules from Lake George. Herbivore effects will be studied in
aquaria and through field sampling, and survey work will be done to locate lakes
in which future experiments can be done. Other planning work includes conducting
pilot trials on spot herbicide use, gathering field data on plant emergence, and
finding means to count individual (genetically identical) plants in stands of
clones. These ROW supported planning activities will prepare the P.I. for
developing a competitive research project on macrophyte ecology. The research
thrust will be on effects of reproductive structure (e.g., rhizomes, turions) on
plant success or on the effects of herbivores on aquatic plant community
structure. Both areas are promising avenues for future proposals.
