The New York Zoological Society/Bronx Zoo is requesting funds to bring together
in a conference zoo educators, university scholars, field biologists,
ecologists, and U.S. science school teachers from middle and secondary schools
who have participated in Bronz Zoo training programs or who have built a
relationship with a local zoo somewhere in the U.S. The conference,
international in scope, is to be held in Caracas, Venezuela 23-27 January, 1990
and will explore global perspectives on environmental issues and will catalyze
ideas to enrich wildlife and environmental education programs in the Western
Hemisphere. The five day conference will include workshops, papers, discussions,
and field trips to environmental locations and Venezuelan classrooms. The twelve
U.S. science school teachers will follow up their interactions and experiences
at the conference and in the field with projects which will bring the issues
into their classrooms and which will enhance their knowledge of the subject
matter and how to present it to their students and colleagues. Cost sharing for
this project is 340% of the National Science Foundation award.
