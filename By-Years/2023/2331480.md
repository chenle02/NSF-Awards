The Pelican Software Suite provides a platform that facilitates sharing of
research datasets. By federating their datasets across institutional boundaries,
research endeavors ranging from single Principal Investigator laboratories to
international collaborations make their local datasets accessible to remote
clients for viewing, caching, or processing. The flagship Pelican federation is
the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) which has the reach of the entire open
science community. Utilizing storage embedded throughout national and
international networks, the OSDF facilitates, independently or in conjunction
with distributed computing resources, effective access to remote datasets as
part of diverse scientific workflows.

Following Translational Computer Science methodology, the team from three
institutions develops the Pelican Software Suite so the OSDF can carry the
responsibilities of a national-scale pillar for dataset sharing. The distributed
computing principles of Pelican enable dataset providers to exercise data
sovereignty, access control, protection of storage and network capacity, and
observability of usage. Pelican clients can be embedded in web browsers, Jupyter
notebooks, or computing infrastructure. As a Pelican federation the OSDF can be
viewed as a “transport bus,” connecting clients to dataset providers that use a
diverse set of backend storage technologies.

With a focus on datasets relevant to the climate community and attention to the
evolving role of AI in research, the project enhances the user experience and
adds new backends to the Pelican Software Suite. This addresses the ever-growing
need to broaden the reach of the national Cyberinfrastructure ecosystem to new
users and a wider spectrum of colleges and universities. This effort is also
supported by National Discovery Cloud for Climate (NDC-C) resources.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
