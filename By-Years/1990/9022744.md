This award establishes a USA Study Group formulated to investigate engineering
research and education issues related to manufacturing industries. In
conjunction with a similar group funded by the Foundation for Research
Development in South Africa, the interaction of the two groups will allow for a
sharing of past experiences and visions for the future. The exchange focuses on
human resources development issues, including programs designed to increase the
number of educated engineers from population segments that traditionally do not
select technologically oriented careers. Two-week visits in each other's country
includes stops at representative educational institutions and the holding of
focused workshops to develop reports identifying areas of possible further
interactions.
