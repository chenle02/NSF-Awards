The number of computations needed to solve the chemical master equation tends to
explode because of the high number of potential states of the system and this
fact motivates the need to develop sophisticated computational techniques to
address this so-called "curse of dimensionality." This project seeks to address
the problem using a combination of techniques such as model reduction
techniques, efficient embedded techniques for the reduced problem, and inexact
or relaxed function evaluations in the integration
schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical master equation arises when
mathematical modeling is used to represent the biochemical reactions that
regulate the metabolism within the cells. Models of cellular processes allow
experimentalists to avoid costly trial-and-error laboratory experiments in live
cells . This sort of modeling poses a challenging problem because some key
regulatory molecules are so small in number that the cellular processes
associated with them seem random or stochastic and cells can change through a
myriad of pathways that are difficult to track even on the fastest
supercomputers. Thus the ability to use mathematical modeling to accurately
mimic key molecules and to apply computational methods to efficiently code the
simulations have important applications for fields of molecular biology and
medicine because there is a significant need to accurately simulate biochemical
reactions inside a cell in real time.&lt;br/&gt;
