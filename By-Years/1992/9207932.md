In collaboration with the Waksman Institute for Molecular Genetics at Rutgers
University, the DIMACs Center will run a research seminar in computational
biology in July and August 1992. Topics will centeraround molecular genetics,
and will include fragment assembly, artificial intelligence in molecular
biology, informatics, pattern identification for genetic regulatory regions, DNA
and protein structure predictions, the detection of distantly related proteins
by sequence comparison, protein folding, and self-organization and adaptation of
complex systems.
