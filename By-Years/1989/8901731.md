Symbioses between ascidians and the prokaryotic green alga Prochloron occur in
various marine coastal habitats in the IndoPacific tropics. The endosymbiont is
intermediate between oxygenic prokaryotes and green plant chloroplasts, and is
evolutionarily unique. It has not been successfully cultured. This project will
examine the acquisition of nitrogenous nutrients by the symbiosis and evaluate
the exchanges of nitrogen between the host and symbiont. The Principal
Investigators will also characterize the osmotic and compositional features of
the cell sap of Prochloron to direct the development of suitable culture media.
The study will promote new insights into the culture; add to our knowledge of
the role of symbiotic systems in the nitrogen cycling of tropical coral.reef
communities; elucidate the role of fluid dynamics on feeding in active
suspension.feeders; and provide data relating to inorganic nitrogen uptake and
utilization to the activities and levels of N.assimilation enzymes.
