This project supports the creation of four textbooks and four open-content
computer lab manuals with supporting materials for a new upper-division
undergraduate curriculum in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) that
will modernize the mathematics major and better integrate it with the broader
STEM community. The new curriculum is being piloted at Brigham Young University
as a new degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The textbooks are being published
by a national publisher, and both the lab manuals and supporting materials will
be made freely available online. The assessment and evaluation plans focus
primarily on student learning, student demand for the program, and employer
interest in graduates of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new curriculum
brings mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and mathematical modeling into
the forefront of interdisciplinary study in the pure and applied sciences.
Scientific computing is taught in the context of big data and high performance
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates a modern
undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation that students need to
become world-class problem solvers and interdisciplinary innovators. This should
increase student interest and participation in applied and computational
mathematics, and expand the pipeline of young scholars in the mathematical
sciences who are well equipped to face the challenges of the 21st Century and
become leaders in the globally competitive STEM workforce.
