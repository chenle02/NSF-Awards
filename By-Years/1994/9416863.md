9416863 Lohmann This study will analyze the radiocarbon in shells of
foraminifera in sediments from Little Bahama Bank, in order to determine whether
it is feasible to use this kind of data to study changes in upper-ocean
circulation under past climate states. Two competing hypotheses on what controls
radiocarbon differences in sediment components also will be tested. ***
