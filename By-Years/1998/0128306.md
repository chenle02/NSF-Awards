This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the
technology to perform Spectroscopic Imaging Polarimetry using Antenna Arrays
with Integrated Diodes (SIP-AAID) to measure both the amplitude and phase of the
light in an image at each pixel. Typically, visible and IR detectors / imagers
measure only the intensity of light, ignoring potential information in the
phase. Since antenna size and diode capacitance scales with electromagnetic
radiation wavelength for optimum collection, this SIP will require the use of
antenna's with features < 100 nm, and diodes with layer thicknesses < 5 nm and
geometric areas < 50 nm, for visible and IR light. The development of a high
resolution SIP-AAID that determines the complete polarization state of light at
each pixel over a broad range of wavelengths is expected to revolutionize the IR
and visible imaging detector industry. The relatively low cost and the unique
capabilities of the SIP-AAID, when compared to present IR detectors, will likely
provide a market pull for applications ranging from in/on-line process and
product control to surveillance with unmatched recognition and tracking
abilities. The commercial applications of this project will be in space and
defence related industries.
