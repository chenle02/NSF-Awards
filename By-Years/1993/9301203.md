9301203 Glander III This project will support research at an undergraduate
institution that will involve the collection and analysis of low energy electron
diffraction (LEED) data. The surfaces to be studied are copper (001) and
Si(111). The LEED data will be analyzed using a holographic technique that shows
great promise, but which has thus far only been applied to simulated LEED
patterns. If successful, the technique could lead to substantial reductions in
the time required for LEED analysis. The principal investigator will collaborate
with the theorist responsible for developing the holographic analysis method.
