This project involves student laboratory in comparative animal physiology that
incorporates learning into a modern experimental process. This may contrast with
instructional laboratories at other institutions that rely heavily upon
observational exercises to teach students about physiological concepts. Selected
topics of current interest in comparative physiology research are emphasized,
and the laboratories provide students with hands-on experience in the use of
modern equipment and techniques. Three sequences address major physiological
principles. These include informative and experimental laboratories, as well as
computer-interfacing microelectrodes, electrophoresis based analyses, and
computer-assisted data analysis. Also, students involved in the project are
encouraged to present papers and submit research articles for publication in
scientific journals.
