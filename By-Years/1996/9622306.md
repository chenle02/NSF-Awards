Sarker 9622306 The primary goal of this research is to develop a machine-
sequence and an optimal layout for a multi-product assembly or fabrication line
in which the analysis of the work-in-process (WIP) flow is a vital ingredient
for decision making. Similar products are usually grouped together to form part-
families along with the set of required machines, and these machines are then
assigned to locations along a transporter line within each cell to form a
flowline. Given the routings of jobs, the machines are assigned to locations
along the lines with the intention of minimizing the travel distance.
Backtracking is assumed as a base problem to solve a general case of sets of
unique and/or identical machines, with bi-directional flow of jobs in one or two
dimensional layout for each cell. The solution procedure consists of three
distinct phases: (1) cell (clustering) formation, (2) cell (flowline) location,
and (3) machine sequencing for multi-product flowline. The research has a
potential to contribute toward solving computationally intractable problems in
flexible/cellular manufacturing systems. This research is likely to lead to
efficient cell formations, better job routing, scheduling and process control,
and will cause an improvement in system performance measures such as machine
utilization, transporter utilization, throughput rate and makespan of jobs. The
research has strong theoretical underpinnings, as well as considerable potential
for cost and time savings in industry.
