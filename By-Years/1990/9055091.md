The University of Colorado at Denver will initiate a five-week, commuter Young
Scholars project in Chemistry for 10 students entering grades 9,10. The Young
Scholars will be matched in teams with undergraduate science majors and research
mentors. The students will work on research-style projects in chemistry under
the direction of the CU-Denver chemistry faculty. They will take field trips to
visit local industry and governmental laboratories and governmental science
advisory panel meetings. Outside speakers will be invited to engage in
discussion sessions with the students concerning research projects they are
involved in, careers in chemistry-related fields, pursuing a career in science,
and the philosophy and ethics of research. The students will present a traveling
science exhibition of their projects at their schools in the Fall. The project
director, accompanied by one or two of the undergraduate students, will provide
chemistry demonstrations for the highs schools throughout the Fall.
