Experimental investigations of electronic and magnetic properties of thin film
structures, surfaces, and interfaces. Approach combines novel materials
synthesis, advanced structure determination methods, and spin-sensitive
spectroscopic techniques. Molecular beam epitaxy, low-energy electron
diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, magneto-optical techniques, and
spin-polarized electron spectroscopies are employed. The principal scientific
objectives are to explore the relationship between atomic level structure and
magnetism, and to probe fundamental concepts regarding phase transitions.
