The focus of this research is on the solution of sparse least squares problems
on sequential and parallel computers. An important problem of interest will be
the solution of equality constrained least squares problems, or as they are
often posed, equality constrained minimization problems. Three different
approaches will be examined: (1) Null Space Methods, (2) Iterative Solution of
the Kuhn- Tucker Equations, and (3) Weighted Least Squares Methods. The methods
will be considered from the standpoints of error analysis, computational
complexity, and adaptability to high performance architectures. Graph
theoretical issues arise in the investigation of the null space approach to
equality constrained least squares, and solution of sparse least squares
problems. In particular, the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of a rectangular
matrix will play a role in the computational aspects of all the problems
considered.
