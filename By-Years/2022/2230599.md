The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a technology that enables rapid and cost-effective engineering of
proteins and cells. The technology has the potential to accelerate the
development of many types of biological products such as protein-based
biosensors, enzymes, therapeutic proteins, and genetic circuits. The technology
could results in more environmentally-friendly methods of producing existing
materials and faster development of pharmaceuticals. The bio-pharma industry
suffers from slow, expensive, and risky development of therapeutics and
diagnostics; The drugs that reach the market often require a lengthy discovery
and development process that takes over a decade with an average cost of $1-2
billion. This platform seeks to develop bio-products more
efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project seeks to develop a
microscopy-based bioengineering platform that can design spatial and temporal
properties of proteins and cells at unprecedented speed. This platform may
increase the speed of innovation by several magnitudes using custom computer
vision software and a light-mediated, single-cell retrieval method to conduct
single-cell level screening. The screening process and analyses can be tuned to
fit the needs of a specific workflow in different experimental contexts. The
platform's utility is demonstrated by optimizing fluorescent protein probes,
common visualization tools used by biologists. Using this platform, millions
protein variants are tested and variants are identified with the most stable
fluorescence output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
