A High-Field Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer System
including variable temperature, hard disk, and coprocessor accessories is being
used to introduce new experiments in the Physical, Inorganic, Advanced
Analytical, and Introductory Organic Chemistry Laboratory Courses. The
scientific productivity of the undergraduate research program is being
substantially increased. Examples of student research projects which are being
made possible by this instrument included: (I) studies of the stereochemistry of
augmented thermal and photochemical Cope rearrangements; (II) synthesis and
studies of the regio- and stereochemistry of dealkoxycarbonylation reactions of
thienyl substituted polyalkoxycarbonyl ethenes as possible polythienyl
precursors; (III) synthesis and conformational studies of Schiff base
coordination compounds as possible laser materials; and (IV) the synthesis of
silicone compounds of theoretical interest. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
