ABSTRACT A series of experiments aims to close the theoretical and empirical
gap between knowledge about the perception of simple acoustic stimuli and
knowledge about the perception of complex, structured speech and music stimuli.
One major goal of the research is to identify the principles which may govern
the perception of all complex acoustic stimuli. A second goal is to develop
several new procedures which will allow for a direct evaluation of specific
processing abilities and strategies. Use of these procedures in the proposed
research will either validate conclusions from previous research, or will
provide a better understanding of the exact nature of specific underlying
processes. The third, related goal of the research is to evaluate the role
played by general acoustic perceptual principles in the perception of speech and
music; identifying for general and specific modes of processing either (1)
common processing principles or (2) the exact nature of differences in
processing principles.
