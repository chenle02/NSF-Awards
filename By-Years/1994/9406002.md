9406002 Roberts The PI and post-doc will perform numerical simulations of core
turbulence and extract from them information on the turbulent diffusion
coefficients required to make the macroscale (dynamo) equations definite. In
parallel they will explore how different parameterizations affect the solutions
of the dynamo equations. Success in these activities will provide a significant
step towards the ultimate goal of developing a realistic model of the geodynamo.
