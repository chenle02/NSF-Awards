A series of nine regional, seven-day workshops are being held over a three-year
period. The workshops are designed for mathematicians who teach statistics but
who may not themselves have advanced degrees in the subject. Integral to the
project is structured electronic communication to network and support the
participants after the workshop. The goal of the project is to improve statistic
instruction by 1) increasing emphasis on data and concepts, 2) cultivating
statistical thinking, and 3) fostering active learning, through alternatives to
lecturing.
