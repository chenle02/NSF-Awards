This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to
develop a method of coating a substrate with a dense array of nanowires in order
to control surface properties for use in microarrays. This surface treatment
offers several interesting characteristics that could dramatically enhance the
performance of microarrays for genomic and proteomic analysis. The commercial
application of this project will be in the area of microarrays for use in
biological and biochemical research.
