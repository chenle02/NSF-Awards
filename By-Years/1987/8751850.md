Thirty outstanding secondary school science teachers, fifteen from middle
schools and fifteen from high schools, will be selected from around the nation
to participate in a two-week summer workshop. These teachers who have
demonstrated potential leadership abilities in science education will study
evolution, behavior, and unique hazards associated with the Cascade Range
volcanoes in general, and Mt. St. Helens in particular. The comprehensive two
week program will include formal classroom activities, discussions, computer
simulations, video, and field work. Participants will develop instructional
materials during and after the workshop suitable for use in their local setting.
School districts will support their teachers by contributing money for materials
and providing released time for the presentation of workshops to fellow teachers
and members of the local community. A long term, comprehensive follow-up and
evaluation program will feature involvement of participants administrators,
members of the academic community in participant locales and project staff. This
project brings together many elements of the science education community,
namely, a set of experienced teachers, academic community, federal agency and
private sector instructors, school district administrators and an exciting
environment as the setting for the project.
