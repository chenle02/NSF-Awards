An introductory physics laboratory has been equipped with 6 high speed,
networked IBM-compatible computers and appropriate software. The project is
designed to increase student interest and to render physics more intuitive. The
idea is to remove some of the abstraction from the subject, and at the same time
to replace pre-Newtonian concepts with more correct ones. In addition, the
equipment is being used, with appropriate simulation software, in lecture
sessions to accomplish the same ends. A third application of this equipment is
to enhance the natural science CORE lectures and to provide a lab exercise that
is more stimulating and motivating, in part through the use of up-to-date
technology. Present-day students do not have sufficient background to pursue
physics, because they have not internalized basic mathematics and have not been
challenged to solve problems by thinking, but only by parroting what they have
been drilled in. This laboratory is intended to evoke understanding and insight
through discovery, which has been the missing element in present day pre-college
education.
