A grant has been awarded to Indiana University under the direction of Dr. Keith
Clay to upgrade and expand the plant growth facilities to facilitate research
and teaching activities in the Plant Sciences Program. Air conditioning and high
intensity lighting will be provided for ten greenhouse rooms totaling 6,537 sq.
ft. To make the most efficient use of improved greenhouse space, rolling benches
will be installed in these rooms. Additionally, one walk-in growth room and
three reach-in growth chambers will be acquired on this grant. Sixteen Plant
Sciences faculty, directing a total of 56 graduate students and 30 postdoctoral
fellows, will make use of the improved greenhouse facility. Teaching in the
plant sciences at the graduate and undergraduate levels is currently impeded by
limited plant growth space. Highly controlled growth facilities with more
useable space will enhance research programs in several areas of the plant
sciences at Indiana University including Plant and Ecosystem Ecology, Plant-
Microbe Interactions, Plant Evolutionary Genetics and Plant Molecular Biology/
Biochemistry. Moreover, improved plant growth facilities will enhance teaching
activities and facilitate several new educational and recruiting initiatives
instituted by the Biology Department, including the recruitment and training of
under-represented groups in the life sciences.
