This project is using nanotechnology to recruit new science majors and prepare
them for careers in this field. Students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in
Applied Physics or in any science discipline with either a minor in
Nanotechnology or an AAS in Nanotechnology as a second degree, receive
scholarships based on financial need (mean = $5632/year), and a one-time
scholarship to attend the Nanomanufacturing Technology Semester at Pensylvania
State University's Advanced Technical Education Center ($4110). Through the
First Year Excellence Program students (n=21) participate in a tightly knit
learning community built around small, dynamic classes and weekly discussion and
activity groups led by upper division honors students. The program supplements
existing recruitment and student support services for populations
underrepresented in science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inherently
interdisciplinary, nanotechnology offers opportunities for collaboration across
disciplines and is an ideal focal point to attract students to all sciences.
Peer mentors, faculty support from the interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Group,
and research opportunities provide the societal and implementation context that
science courses often lack.
