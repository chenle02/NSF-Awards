Chen 9603081 Tooth development provides an excellent model for studying
epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions leading to organogenesis during
vertebrate development. While teeth have been missing from Aves for nearly 100
million years, in the avian oral cavity there does exist a residual structure
resembling the tooth rudiment at the lamina stage in reptiles and mammals. This
arrest of tooth development in Aves is believed to be due to the failed
interactions between the presumptive dental epithelium and mesenchyme. A similar
phenotype is observed in the mouse Msxl and Msx2 double mutants in which tooth
development is also arrested at the lamina stage. To date there is no
information available on the arrest of tooth development and its underlying
molecular mechanisms in Aves. This proposal is aimed at defining the failure of
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and to determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying the arrest of avian tooth development, with a goal of generating an
avian tooth bud in vitro and in viva. In situ hybridization, in vitro tissue
recombination, in vitro organ culture will be employed to examine the expression
of important genes, to localize the odontogenic defect to the tissue compartment
in the chick presumptive tooth germ, and to verify the conservation of signaling
pathways in the dental mesenchyme between mouse and chick. A possible
conservation of signaling pathways in the formation of tooth and limb will be
also verified by replacing chick limb AER with mouse dental epithelium and vice
versa. Chick CAM culture and mouse intraocular graft techniques will be used to
enhance chick tooth germ development. Effort will also be made to generate a
chick tooth germ by restoring gene expression in the chick presumptive tooth
germ in vitro and in viva with retroviral infection. The long-term goal of this
study is to substantiate our understanding of the molecular basis of epithelial-
mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis.
