Academic Industrial Teachers Internship Program focuses on the premise that if
teachers know and understand they will do a better job of directing students
into the courses required to succeed in an engineering program. For each of two
summers, twenty-four high school teachers from minority schools nationwide will
come to the University of Wisconsin for a two week workshop learning about
engineering disciplines, engineering opportunities, and the correlation between
engineering concepts and classroom instruction in mathematics, chemistry, and
physics. A six week internship will allow the participants to work side by side
with engineers, technicians, and computer specialists. This project offers the
opportunity to specifically address several items of significance. Namely, the
concern for increasing minority participation in the fields of engineering. The
collaborative effort between industry and higher education; the need to better
prepare teachers to counsel students into the proper mathematics, chemistry and
physics courses; and to achieve a balance between the theoretical and the
practical. This project can serve as a model of a kind of enrichment program for
enhancing minority participation in science, mathematics, and engineering.
