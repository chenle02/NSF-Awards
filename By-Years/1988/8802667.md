This group of researchers will work on various aspects of Markov processes and
infinite particle systems. Specific problems include first passage and bond
percolation, particle systems in random environments and functionals of Markov
processes. Percolation and particle systems in random environment provide many
useful models to problems in physics and biology. The tools used involve partial
differential equations, random graph theory and Markov processes.
