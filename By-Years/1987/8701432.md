This research will look at the economic, political, and social position of a
traditional landowning elite in northeastern Brazil. The researcher will analyze
the changes that have taken place within this group as a response to increasing
industrialization, the concentration of money, and the development of
regionalism in the market that are occuring in Brazil. Specifically the student
will look at how the landowning elite has changed in its relationship to other
groups in the region and in the nation as a whole. This research is very
relevant to the situation in developing countries all over the world with
special emphasis on South America. The researcher will be able to answer
questions about how families and groups have strategies for resource investment
and their use, and will look at the political implications, especially the
impact of new democratic structures, on such strategies. This project will have
implications for developmental projects by focusing on the groups that control
regional resources.
