The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Donald
Darensbourg of Texas A&amp;M University and Dr. F. Joo of Kossuth Lajos
University, Debrecen, is to study the use of aqueous solutions as a media for
reactions catalyzed by organometallic complexes. The researchers will use
transition metal complexes with sulphonated tertiary phosphine ligands in these
efforts. Their examination will focus on ligand exchange processes, hydrogen
transfer reactions and interaction of carbon oxides, especially carbon dioxide.
Results should contribute to our understanding of the effects one may expect
when water is used as a solvent in organometallic catalytic processes. This
project in organometallic chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
