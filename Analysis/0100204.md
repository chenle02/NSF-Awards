The PI proposes to study problems in three subjects of fluid dynamics: the
motion of the interface of general two layered flow, the boundary layer problem,
and the motion of water wave. The motion of the interface of general two layered
fluid flow includes vortex sheet motion as a special case. In a recent work, the
PI shows that arbitrarily specifying independent position and velocity data
generally will yield no Sobolev class vortex sheet for any positive time. Some
crucial assumptions in this work are: the fluids are inviscid, there is no
surface tension, and the interface remains a regular surface at positive time. A
problem of interest is therefore a well-posed model for the vortex sheet motion.
The PI proposes to reintroduce viscosity into the fluids, and to understand the
effect of the viscosity near the interface. This leads to the study of the zero
viscosity limit of two layered viscous fluids. A related problem of both
mathematical and practical importance is the boundary layer problem. The
question is to find the zero viscosity limit of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
flow in a domain with a fixed nonempty boundary. It is well-known that the
difficulty is in the boundary layer, within which the normal velocity gradient
generally becomes very large. The PI's approach is different from the usual one,
in the sense that the PI will assume no knowledge of the possible limit
equations. The PI proposes to analyze directly the Navier-Stokes flow, and to
obtain the qualitative behavior of the boundary part and the interior part of
the solutions of Navier-Stokes equation. The method will be from harmonic
analysis. It is expected that the techniques and results developed in solving
the boundary layer problem will provide insight in finding a well-posed model
for the vortex sheet motion.

The PI proposes to continue her study in the water wave problem. Recently, the
PI proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions locally in time for the
Water wave problem. The proposed research concentrates on issues relating to the
long time behavior of the water wave: the global existence and uniqueness of
solutions, the lifespan of the water wave before singularity, and the
singularity profile of the solution. The method will be from harmonic analysis
and Clifford analysis. The methods and techniques developed by the PI in solving
the water wave problem has found applications in the vortex sheet problem.
Success in this project will enhance our understanding of the wave motion, of
the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary layers, generation of sounds and
coherent structures in turbulence models.
