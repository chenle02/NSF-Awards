The principal investigator will study the behavior of solutions to nonlinear
dispersive partial differential equations, in particular, to the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation (NLS). The latter equation is representative of a large
class of dispersive models, of which it provides the simplest example. The NLS
exhibits various types of solutions: some exist in finite time (nonlinear
effects dominate over linear); other soliton-like solutions exist globally but
may not decay with time (nonlinear and linear effects balance each other), and
global-in-time solutions completely disperse with time (nonlinear effects are
negligible compared with linear ones). The project will study the dynamics of
all types of solutions for the class of dispersive equations with focusing
nonlinearities. In particular, a new phenomenon of the contracting-ring blow-up
solutions will be explored both analytically and numerically. The concentration
phenomenon will be analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the blow-up
behavior of such solutions.

Results of this project will advance our understanding of various physical
phenomena that arise in nonlinear optics, quantum and plasma physics, and fluid
dynamics. Talks and mini-lecture series on methods of harmonic analysis and
differential equations developed from the proposed research will be delivered at
several scientific organizations. As an immediate educational consequence, the
project will increase the scientific and mathematical awareness of the Arizona
State University student body and thus, in the long run, will enhance the
scientific awareness of society. A significant pool of female and minority
students at Arizona State University will enable the principal investigator,
with her previous experience, to educate a diverse scientific community for the
future. She will engage graduate and undergraduate students in her research
program. The education of a new generation of problem-solving mathematicians,
the dissemination of new methods and techniques, and general scientific
advancement will be some of the benefits of this project.
