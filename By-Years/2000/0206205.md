AST 0206205&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Nice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulsars are
strongly magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron stars, the collapsed remnants of
supernova explosions. They are extraordinarily stable natural clocks, in some
cases approaching or exceeding the long-term stabilities of the best man-made
clocks. Well over 1000 pulsars are now known, and several dozen of them are
gravitationally bound to another star, with orbital velocities up to a
thousandth of the speed of light. For these and many other
reasons,&lt;br/&gt;high-precision observations of pulsars offer unique
opportunities for research in stellar evolution, gravitation physics, cosmology,
fundamental astrometry, and even time-keeping
metrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will extend and improve a series of
very-high precision timing measurements of binary and millisecond pulsars as
refined tests of relativistic effects, and in the search for perturbations in
pulse times series due to passing gravitational waves. They will also search the
sky for new pulsars, particularly those with very short periods, and they will
accumulate timing data for more than 100 slow pulsars, as a service to observers
at other wavelengths and to study pulsar rotation
irregularities.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
