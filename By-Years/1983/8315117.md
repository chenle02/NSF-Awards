This research program will investigate the mechanical deformation of metals such
as occurs in hot-forging, as well as the analytical modeling of the observed
behavior and the computational procedures for obtaining solutions with the
analytical models. Specifically, the research will consider: (1) the development
of large deformation constitutive equations for isotropic thermo-elasto-
viscoplasticity; (2) the development of large deformation, coupled, thermo-
mechanical computational procedures; and (3) the experimental evaluation of the
constitutive equations and the computational procedures.
