To improve the scope and relevance of high school chemistry, physics, and
biology laboratory instruction, a centralized pool of portable instruments will
be established and experiments developed suitable for use with these
instruments. These will be made available to high schools in the area around
Canisius College, which will serve as the permanent home for the equipment pool.
Cooperating industrial laboratories will offer teachers both short-term
supporting hands-on laboratory training and full-time summer employment in their
facilities. The portable equipment is being donated by industry and the college.
Summer teacher enhancement programs emphasizing effective integration of the
instrumental experiments into high school curricula will be offered by the
college. Cost sharing by the college and industrial firms will equal 79% of the
NSF funding.
