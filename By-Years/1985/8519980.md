This project investigates the application of acoustic emission techniques to the
detection of martensite and ultimately of cracks in the welding of high strength
steels. This project quantitatively relates the emission signals generated to
the weld transformation process. Signal processing is used to enable
identification and subsequent characterization of signals generated by
martensite and to differentiate them from signals from other sources of the
welding process. The ultimate goal of the research is to detect conditions that
would lead to crack formation and to feed the results back to reset the welding
reference inputs (welding speed, current, or voltage) and permit real-time
process control of the welding process.
