Professor Glass will lead a collaborative project involving the research groups
of Professor Potapov (Irkutsk, Russia) and Professor Glass (Tucson, AZ, USA) on
the synthesis and redox chemistry of tetrachalcogentetraasteranes (sulfur,
selenium and tellurium) is proposed. The synthesis of these "star-shaped"
molecules is based on the photodimerization of 1,4-dichalcogenins. The oxidation
of these materials will be studied using the electrochemical technique of cyclic
voltammetry and chemical oxidants. One-electron oxidation of these compounds may
provide stable radical cations with novel structures in which the charge and the
odd electron are delocalized equally over all four chalcogen atoms.
Spectroscopic methods, especially EPR spectroscopy, are proposed for determining
the structures of these materials. Two-electron oxidation of the heteroatom
asteranes will be investigated to evaluate the theory of a-aromaticity. The
dications may show unusual properties if they are a-delocalized. This
possibility will be evaluated by spectroscopic methods, especially NMR
spectroscopy. This proposed collaborative work combines the research strengths
of Professor Potapov's group in synthetic heteroatom chemistry with that of
Professor Glass' group in structural and redox chemistry in a mutually
beneficial project which may extend our understanding of multicenter bonding and
structural factors that affect electron-transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
Award, The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Central and
Eastern Europe Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering
will support the research and international collaboration of Professor Richard
S. Glass of the University of Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;
