The early Paleozoic plate configurations, as determined by paleomagnetic
investigations, indicates that North America occupied equatorial paleolatitudes
with its Appalachian margin facing south. Across the Iapetus Ocean lay the
Gondwana super- continent along with the Avalon-Armorica microcontinent.
Previous work on this project has resulted in considerable progress in tracking
the positions of plates and microplates in the ensuing closure of Iapetus. This
renewal will expand this work by supporting additional sample collections from
rock sequences from suspect terranes and the adjoining margin of North America,
and the completion of the paleomagnetic analysis of these and previous
collections. Results should allow a synthesis of the movement histories of the
oceanic terranes during closure of Iapetus and the relationship to Early
Paleozoic orogenic events on the margins of North America.
