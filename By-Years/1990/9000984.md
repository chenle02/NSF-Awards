This award provides continuing support to the Department of Biology at Hope
College to carry on with the Research Experience for Undergraduates Site that
was established in 1988. The program will provide ten undergraduate students
with an in-depth summer experience in research in environmental biology. In
order to provide research opportunities to individuals who are not well
represented in science, the department will recruit women and members of
minority groups to participate in the program with the goal of having at least
50% of the student participants being women and 50% being members of minority
groups. Five students from Hope College and five students from other schools
will be selected for participation on the basis of academic record, research
ability and potential, professional objectives, independence and initiative.
Students will select a research project from five different areas related to
environmental biology: 1) Molecular Biology of Nitrogen Fixation, 2)
Environmental Biochemistry and Physiology, 3) Genetic Toxicology, 4) Plant and
Animal Parasitology and 5) Ecology and Systematics and will work under the
supervision of twelve Ph.D faculty members. Students will perform independent
research projects, give oral presentations on their work in progress, and
prepare a research poster and research paper summarizing their work.
