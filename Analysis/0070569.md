This is a proposal to develop general methods to study nonlinear, hyperbolic and
parabolic/elliptic partial differential equations. More precisely using
techniques from analysis, partial differential equations and probability, the PI
plans to continue his program working in the following four general areas: A.
Fully nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations of first-and second-
order . B. Phase Transitions. C. Turbulent reaction-diffusion equations and
combustion. D. First- and second-order fully nonlinear, degenerate, elliptic and
parabolic equations.

Most of the partial differential equations considered in this proposal arise as
models in continuum and statistical physics. These models appear in a variety of
topics ranging from material sciences and phase transitions (motion of fronts,
mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, homogenization), in fluid flows (turbulent
reaction-diffusion and combustion), and in stochastic analysis (interacting
particle systems, flows in random environments and with random velocities, and
stochastic control). The qualitative analysis of these models contributes to the
better understanding of the actual physical problems, and provides, in many
cases, the foundation for the development of efficient numerical algorithms.
