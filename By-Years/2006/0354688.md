Processes of interaction of low-energy electrons with molecules play an
important role in gaseous and plasma environments such as discharges, arcs, gas
lasers, and gaseous dielectrics. Recent studies have revealed the importance of
interactions of low-energy electrons with biological molecules (DNA and RNA
bases) and molecules of environmental interest. The research
is&lt;br/&gt;focused on dissociative electron attachment to complex molecules
where intermediate resonant electronic states play a critical role. The nonlocal
complex potential theory and the resonant R-matrix theory will be applied to
investigate the interaction of these states with the nuclear degrees of freedom
to understand the dissociative process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
