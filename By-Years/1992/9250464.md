Computer equipment and videodisk stations expand an open-ended anatomy and
physiology laboratory into a learning center designed to supplement classroom
activities. The facility is open and staffed from 9AM to 9PM Monday through
Friday and 9AM to 5PM on Saturday. Students use the stations to drill and test
themselves on course material from a library of Hypercards. In addition the
stations are used for mastery based testing modes and for students and faculty
to keep track of student progress. The center serves a large population of
students with diverse backgrounds; students in the health sciences and
education.This
