Interdisciplinary (99) This project is building comprehensive team skills via
use of a Hierarchical Learning Ensemble (HLE). The team-model, an adaptation of
Problem-Based-Learning (PBL) to a multi-level-team of graduate, undergraduate,
and secondary-level students, aids the students learn how to function within
heterogeneous teams. Protocols for preparing students to enter the workplace are
being produced by assigning the HLEs the task of designing a novel biomaterial.
The HLE experiences benefit all three academic levels of participants in
appropriate ways. The project is disseminating products that increase science
content knowledge, pedagogy, and allows students the opportunity to experience
how research is done in the modern workplace.
