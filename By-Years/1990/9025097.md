The aim of this study will be to derive large-scale, fully 3- dimensional
descriptions of both the magnetic field and the distribution of plasma in the
lower corona. The model is to be constrained by coronameter measurements of
white light that has been scattered by coronal electrons. To model the large
scale structure, which does not change substantially over a solar rotation, a
magnetospheric model (Bogdan and Low, 1986) which describes both the coronal
magnetic field and density distribution in terms of a set of multipole
coefficients and other parameters, will be employed. The underlying assumptions
of the model will be tested, and standard inversion techniques will be adopted
to solve for model parameters which best fit the data set. The ultimate goal is
to find a quantitative description for changes in the solar corona over time
scales such as the solar cycle. The work will be developed with emphasis on (a)
further development of the inversion technique, (b) comparison with measurements
of the photospheric magnetic field, (c) extending the inversion to a larger data
set.
