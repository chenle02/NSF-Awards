9727631 Morrow The NSF Geosciences Education Working Group recommended
providing training in education for geoscientists. The SSI and the Aspen Global
Change Institute (AGCI) will collaborate on planning, implementing, documenting,
and evaluating a pilot workshop on K-12 education for geoscientists who attend
AGCI's two-week scientific meeting in the summer of 1998. The goals of the
workshop are: 1) to raise awareness among leading geoscientists about why
scientists' attention and involvement in K-12 science education is so important,
and to equip them to share new knowledge and perspectives on education with
their colleagues; 2) to inform geoscientists about important educational topics
(e.g. National Science Education Standards (1995), cognitive psychology, and
constructivist learning theory), and to pique their interest in learning more
about science education reform; 3) to allow geoscientists the opportunity to
examine potential roles they might play in support of K-12 science education,
and to reflect on how they might best be able to serve (e.g. as an advocate of
educational reform, resource of scientific information, or partner in
educational product development). The workshop will draw upon the expertise and
support of key scientists and education professionals as planners, advisors,
workshop presenters, and evaluators. The workshop model could be instituted as a
regular part of AGCI summer science meetings, and also as a part of other summer
science institutes related to the geosciences.
