9512926 Bigelow This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
between Nicholas P. Bigelow at the University of Rochester and Michele I. Leduc
at the Kastler Brossel Laboratory, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France. The
main objective of this project is to generate and explore high density samples
of ultra-cold, trapped metastable helium atoms. Their aim is to expand,
accelerate and diversity the current state of laser cooling research on the
helium system through a series of coordinated experimental and theoretical
efforts. This research will benefit from U.S. and French expertise in quantum
optics, laser studies, atomic optics and laser cooling.
