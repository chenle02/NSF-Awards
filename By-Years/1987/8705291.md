This research seeks to develop a theory for recursively updated models for
stochastic processes based on covariance data. A general pole-zero structure for
the modeling filters is being considered while the order of the filters is
permitted to increase with the number of covariance samples. The structure of
the filters and the identification schemes to be developed rely on a certain
approximate separation principle that applies to the tasks of identifying poles
and zeros of a power spectrum. A second issue to be investigated concerns the
development of fast algorithms for spectral factorization. Recent advances hold
the promise of giving rise to novel and fast spectral factorization algorithms.
