This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at
developing a novel low-cost method for the preparation of Multi-Walled Carbon
Nanotubes (MWCNT) for Field Emission Displays (FED) applications. Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) are characterized by high aspect ratio and small radius of
curvature at their tips. This structural property, together with high electrical
conduction, chemical inertness and mechanical strength makes them promising
emitters for field emission flat panel displays. CNTs have been conventionally
prepared by high-pressure, chemical-vapor-deposition processes, but these
approaches have serious limitations owing to high cost of production. Recently
suggested alternative methods of CNT preparation include plasma activation and
catalytic growth, but they are limited by low yields or metal contaminations. In
this Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. proposes to synthesize carbon
nanotubes from readily available raw materials by combining a pyrolysis and
chemical process. The CNT thus produced will be chemically pure since no metal
catalyst is used in the process and any side-products formed are in vapor state
and will not contaminate it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial
applications include display aided flat bedded control panels, all types of
touch screen facilities, flat panel monitors for both professional and
entertainment displays, and naval and air surveillance systems.
