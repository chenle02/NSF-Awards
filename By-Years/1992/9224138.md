9224138 Bander This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research
in theoretical particle physics between Myron Bander of the University of
California at Irvine and Hector Rubinstein of the University of Uppsala in
Sweden. The objective of their research is to study hadronic phenomena in the
presence of very large magnetic fields. These fields may be connected to
astrophysical phenomena such as superconducting cosmic strings and are
associated with the early universe. Previous collaborative efforts examined
instabilities, proton decay in large magnetic fields, and the screening of
fields by chiral symmetry breaking. The investigators propose to extend their
collaboration to a study of quark spectroscopy in the presence of intense
magnetic fields and explore the cosmological consequences of large magnetic
fields. They hypothesize that large magnetic fields may occur in the early
universe. Their presence could explain how the early universe evolved. The
proposed collaboration takes advantage of complementary expertise and will
advance fundamental understanding of quantum cosmology and particle physics. ***
