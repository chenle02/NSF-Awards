This project involves the dissertation research of a student in cultural
anthropology in a rural area of Cameroon. The research will investigate how
people's perceptions of illnesses and treatment alternatives, and their
evaluations of treatment results, influence their health-seeking behavior. Most
studies of health-seeking behavior examine how isolated beliefs correlate with
treatment behavior; in contrast this project analyzes the medical decision-
making process. The project will examine social networks and group consensus
using ethnography, formal and informal interviews, and relatively new analytical
procedures in cognitive anthropology to study how group agreement on
categorizations and evaluations influence behavior. This research is important
because lay people in all societies have divergent "popular models" of illness
and treatment, which sometimes support but often conflict with scientifically-
derived treatment regimes. Understanding the importance of cultural factors in
medical decision making in this one case will advance our theoretical knowledge
about compliance and health seeking behavior in general.
