Time-domain system identification method is used to analyze the Whittier
earthquake records. The objectives are (1) to study the building behavior during
the earthquake, (2) to identify energy dissipation capabilities of the building-
foundation system, and (3) to correlate and calibrate the degree of building
damage during the course of ground shaking. New features of the investigation
include (1) nonlinear analysis in terms of time-varying segments of equivalent
linear systems, (2) use of a nonclassical modal synthesis approach, and (3) use
of a multi- variate system identification technique (SID). The research is
expected to bring closer the development of SID and its practical use in
earthquake analysis and design, such as prediction of structural response and
damage as a function of time.
