The proposed research considers several problems in the higher-order asymptotic
theory of likelihood-based inference. Many higher-order approximations apply
only to the case in which the underlying data have a continuous distribution.
The proposed research considers the extension of these results to the case in
which the underlying data have a lattice distribution. A second aspect of the
research is the development of methods for models with a hierarchical structure.
Likelihood methods are generally derived under the assumption that the
likelihood function is correctly specified. Of course, in practice, the
probability models used are often only an approximation to the true, but
unknown, models. Hence, the proposed research considers the development of
methods that are based on more limited assumptions, such as moment conditions.

Statistical methods based on the likelihood function play a central role in
statistical theory and methodology. Many of these methods are based on
approximations which may have questionable accuracy in certain cases. The
proposed research develops methods of approximation with generally higher
accuracy. The result is statistical methods that offer an improvement over those
currently available.
