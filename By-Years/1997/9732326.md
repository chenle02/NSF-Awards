Submillimeter Polarimetery at the CalTech Submillimeter Observatory. Dr.
Hildebrand will carry out an observational program at sub-mm wavelengths of the
polarization that is produced by grains aligned by magnetic fields in the
interstellar medium. By observing sources at a large range of length scales, he
hopes to characterize the orientation, percentage polarization, and overall
systematic order in the magnetic field geometry of the source. The observations
will be carried out using the California Institute of Technology Submillimeter
Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. ***
