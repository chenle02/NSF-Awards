The research team will collaborate with museums to develop new Augmented Reality
(AR) applications for memorialization and communication. The project will
contribute to our understanding of the risks and benefits AR poses to digitally
representing human experiences. The project will use a co-development process to
conceptualize collaborative technology research frameworks that engage
practitioners with expertise in the ethical media representation of sensitive
narratives. The outcomes of the project will be of interest to educators, policy
makers, technology developers, practitioners and citizens.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on Augmented Reality development
while working to formulate socially-responsible research frameworks that are
generalizable to other domains of immersive technology including virtual and
mixed reality. Through a methodology of case studies, collaborative design
partnerships, and design workshops and hackathons, the project is expected to
inform future research in socially-responsible AR by: 1) providing a descriptive
baseline of models for socially responsible information technology development
within museums, cultural centers, and human-rights organizations; 2)
investigating how AR technology can create public engagement with sensitive
nonfictional narratives through co-developing AR memorialization applications
with human rights organizations; 3) developing educational curricula to teach
students how to conduct ethical and accountable STEM research; and, 4)
facilitating the development of interdisciplinary networks between early stage
faculty and graduate student researchers with policy experts and human rights
institutions for future co-development research, potentially extending to other
technologies and their social impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
