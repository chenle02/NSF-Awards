The investigator has two objectives to accomplish in this research project. The
first objective is to develop theory of statistical inference for a new class of
semi-parametric odds ratio models that include both the generalized linear model
and the Cox regression model as special cases. The second objective is to apply
this class of models to solve a number of theoretical problems that are of
importance in applications. These applications include (1) addressing issues in
parameter identifiability, estimation, and inference in biased sampling designs
in studying the association of a disease with gene and environment factors, (2)
introducing a new approach for testing goodness of fit of generalized linear
models, and (3) developing a new flexible semi-parametric procedure for
multivariate density estimation and survival analysis with complex dependence
structures.

Flexible and easily interpretable stochastic models are very useful in
extracting information from data with complex structures. Such data are often
collected in studies exploring the causes of diseases and other socio-economic
problems. The investigator proposes a new class of models for the statistical
analysis of such data. Results from this research will have broad applications
in a variety of scientific fields. When applied to epidemiological studies,
results from this research will be able to facilitate the design of more
powerful statistical tests for detecting genetic and environmental causes of
disease. When applied to sociological studies, results from this research will
be able to facilitate the understanding of underlying causes of complex socio-
economic problems so that better solutions to the problems can be found.
