9303706 Ermentrout The proposer continues his work on the modelling of central
pattern generators with particular application to the lamprey spinal cord. He
collaborates with several physiologists on modelling of the propagation and
genesis of electrical activity in muscular and nervous tissues. Techniques for
reducing complex membrane models to ``connectionist'' models and the requisite
numerical routines will be developed. Interactive computational tools for
solving of parabolic PDES and integral equations that arise in biological models
will also be developed. The formation of regular patterns of muscular
contraction activity is critical in many living systems. This proposal aims to
study the common features of this organization. The rhythmic waves of
contraction as food moves down the small intestine, the small regular changes in
diameter of blood vessels, and the regular beating of the heart are all
controlled by oscillating electrical activity of cells. Understanding such
patterned oscillators is critical in developing a fundamental understanding of
physiological structures and functions. Moreover, irregularities in these
activities can lead to diseased states and in some cases even death.
Mathematical models of interacting rhythmical units can shed light on how the
units normally behave and interact, how irregularities in the units arise, and
sometimes on how to reset them to their normal mode. The proposer continues his
work on such models as well as the development of computational tools to aid in
this type of modeling. ***
