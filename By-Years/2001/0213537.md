Professor McGrath and his group will work on developing new methodology for the
controlled degradation of dendritic materials. The acid lability of the benzyl
aryl ether subunit found in many dendrimers will be used as a trigger for
degradation. Dendrimers with depolymerizable backbones will also be prepared and
degraded. Release of degradation fragments which have been covalently
incorporated into the dendrimer will be monitored so that the process can be
understood and modified as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Dominic V. McGrath of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona.
Dr. McGrath and his students will work on the controlled degradation of
dendritic materials. Controlled degradation of dendritic materials could have
potential applications in controlled release of pharmaceuticals for drug
delivery and as precursors for photoresists for microlithography. The students
trained during the course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed
by the pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries.
