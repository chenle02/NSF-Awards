This is a continuation of a research program involving numerical simulations and
observations of extragalactic radio sources. The theme of this research is to
study the interaction between ex- tended radio plasma the surrounding medium.
Numerically, the capabilities of the MHD code ZEUS will be significantly
extended to operate in three dimensions. This code will be used to study the
propagation of radio jets in both two and three dimensions in a variety of
galaxy and cluster atmospheres. In particular, a hydrodynamical mechanism for
the confinement of hypersonic jets will be studied. The disruption of jets in
cooling flow clusters will also be analyzed, as well as the bending and
disruption of radio jets associated with tailed radio sources. Observational-
ly, new VLA images of the middle and inner lobe regions of Cen- taurus A at 8
and 0.3 GHz and of the peculiar classical double 0816+526 will be made. Survey
work will include an investigation of the properties of cD galaxies in rich
clusters, observations of selected x-ray clusters and rich southern clusters,
and high dynamic range mapping of a sample of luminous 3CR radio galaxies.
