The investigator develops more effective and efficient Newton iterative
(truncated Newton) methods, i.e., implementations of Newton's method that use
iterative linear algebra methods. A concomitant objective is to develop improved
Krylov subspace methods and associated techniques for linear problems; this work
supports the primary objective and is important in its own right. The project
centers around recently developed globally convergent inexact Newton algorithms,
improved implementations of GMRES, and new applications of Lanczos-based methods
and "residual smoothing" techniques. A specific goal is to construct high-
quality codes for Newton iterative methods and for GMRES that are suitable for
public distribution. Newton iterative methods and Krylov subspace methods have
many important scientific and industrial applications; examples include aircraft
dynamics modeling, semiconductor modeling, climate modeling, oil reservoir
simulation, and contaminant transport in aquifers. The large-scale problems to
which they are usually applied often require high-performance vector and
parallel computers and, indeed, have provided significant incentive for their
development. This research contributes to improved computational modeling
techniques for scientific and industrial applications and more effective
utilization of high-performance computers.
