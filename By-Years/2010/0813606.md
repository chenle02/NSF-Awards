ABSTRACT

04 August 2008 Proposal Number: 0813606 Institution: Oregon State University PI:
P. Zerr

The proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support items for Oregon State
University for use aboard the R/V WECOMA; namely a replacement deck crane. Two
additional items were initially requested (mooring recovery winch and
replacement A-frame), but the panel felt there was not enough justification to
support a dedicated mooring recovery winch at OSU, and the A-frame design was
not sufficiently advanced to support award. The replacement deck crane will
replace an aging unit and will provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.

Broader Impacts: The R/V WECOMA, as part of OSU?s College of Oceanic and
Atmospheric Sciences, supports federally funded scientific research throughout
the north Pacific. The operation routinely exposes students and the general
public to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea? program and open
houses such as ?HMSeaFest?. In 2007, WECOMA supported eleven NSF-funded cruises
for a total of 140 days. Eight NSF-funded cruises totaling 85 days are planned
for 2008.
