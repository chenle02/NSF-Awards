&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study is about
collaboration and joint research in the area of particle physics, between the
Korea Detector laboratory (KODEL) in Seoul, Korea and Iowa State University in
Ames, Iowa. The scientific goal of the collaboration is the understanding of the
origin of mass. This fundamental property of matter is postulated to come about
because all particles interact with a field, called the Higgs field, which
permeates the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
