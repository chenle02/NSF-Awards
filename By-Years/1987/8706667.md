The dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thought to be a key component
of the energy budget of stream ecosystems, will be investigated in streams
draining deciduous forest ecosystems of the northeastern United States. The
major goal of this research is to develop a state-of-the-art synthesis of carbon
cycling in these stream ecosystems, with an emphasis on DOC and microbial
processes. Results from previous NSF-funded research will provide most of the
data needed to complete the synthesis. New field and laboratory research will be
conducted to supply data that is essential to the synthesis effort, but is
unavailable either in the existing data sets developed by Dr. Bott and his
colleagues, or in the literature. For the past eight years Dr. Bott's research
group has studied carbon cycling in streams draining hardwood forests in
Pennsylvania. They have conducted many pioneering processes studies on carbon
cycling in these streams. In this new research they will synthesize information
from previous studies and interpret it in the context of ecosystem disturbance.
The data- synthesis effort will culminate in a detailed conceptual model of the
structure and function of streams of the northeast and an in- depth analysis of
how these streams respond to, and recover from, disturbances such as changes in
storm discharge patterns associated with land use changes like expansion of
agriculture and development of suburban housing tracts. The new laboratory and
field research will have the primary objectives of: 1) refining and validating
experimental techniques pertinent to the assessment of DOC utilization in
streams: and 2) obtaining a few key measurements of DOC availability and
turnover rates using these techniques. These activities are essential to further
studies of the carbon cycle in streams. The research team that will conduct
these studies is highly qualified. The Stroud Water Research Center will provide
excellent institutional support for the research. The Ecosystem Studies Program
recommends award of this grant.
