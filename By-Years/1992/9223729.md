The goal of this research is to study the structure and dynamical behavior of
liquid crystal phases using optical microscopy, light and x-ray scattering, and
scanning tunneling microscopy. Systems to be probed include planar freely
suspended liquid crystal films, ultrathin preparations between solid substrates,
liquid crystals confined to an aerogel matrix, and liquid crystal-solid
interface. The research is directed toward elucidating the effects of surfaces
and reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal fluctuations, ordering and phase
transitions. The proposed studies are important because of their fundamental
impact on condensed matter physics and due to technological interests. %%% This
research is focused on freely suspended liquid crystal films, ultrathin
preparations between solid substrates, liquid crystals in porous media, and
scanning tunneling microscopy of adsorbed liquid crystal layers. The research is
directed toward elucidating the effects of surfaces and reduced dimensionality
on liquid crystal fluctuations, ordering and phase transitions. Freely suspended
liquid crystal films are structures of fundamental interest in condensed matter
physics because they are the thinnest known stable condensed phase structures
and have the largest surface-to-volume ratio of any condensed phase preparation.
The weak ordering and strong interface interactions of liquid crystals makes
them ideal materials for studying the physics of condensed phase transition in
porous media. This area is emerging as an exciting extension of liquid crystal
phase research of the past two decades. Ultrathin liquid crystal films between
solid substrates are not only of broad technological interest but they continue
to generate a variety of interesting basic physics problems.
