9317527 Lindstedt The experiments outlined in this proposal are to look at the
mechanisms of maintaining muscle energy balance and sustained performance.
Muscle contraction is dependent upon energy supply which in turn is dependent
upon a number of metabolic and physiological processes. In this proposal the
investigators will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the
contractile demand and oxidative potential of the rattlesnake tail- shaker
muscle during continuous contractions. The tail shaker muscles are sustaining
high frequencing for over 30 minutes continuously and thus have high oxidative
capacity to supply ATP for these contractions. The investigators will use a
range of body temperature from 5 - 35 o C for rattling to look for demand under
maximal conditions. In vivo muscle energetics will be determined using a test
which involves 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure ATP breakdown and
recovery changes in phosphocreatine content during muscle activation. The
hypothesis is that energy flux during rattling changes as a simple temperature
effect on the underlying rates of demand supply. This a model system for non-
invasive evaluation of rate processes and the coordination of metabolism in
vivo. ***
