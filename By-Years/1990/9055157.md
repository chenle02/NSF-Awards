Clemson University will initiate a 4-week, residential Young Scholars project
in Manufacturing Engineering for 30 students entering grade 12. The project will
introduce young scientists and engineers to the manufacturing process. Topics
include Statistics and Quality Control, CAD, CAM Robotics, Physical Modeling,
Rapid Prototyping and System Simulation. Lectures, laboratories and industry
trips will introduce the students to these manufacturing methodologies using
"hands-on" techniques and will emphasize the importance of basic scientific,
mathematical and engineering principles in the development and operation of
manufacturing systems. Project assignments will involve creating prototype
videotapes of their project work and final presentations. These tapes will be
part of a follow-up program allowing participants to present their manufacturing
expertise to their school classes.
