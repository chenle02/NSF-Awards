A Silicon Graphics workstation is requested to create a local supercomputing
environment dedicated to the computational research programs in fluid dynamics,
combustion, surface science and catalysis, and polymer science. It will provide
the essential computing and graphics power for studies such as modeling of
turbulent combustion, simulation of blood flow in artificial hearts, modeling of
geometrical effects in capillary systems, and Monte Carlo simulations of surface
diffusion in adsorption and polymeric systems. At the same time, its advanced 3D
capabilities will allow real time visualization of inherently multidimensional
numerical results obtained from these studies. The combination of powerful
analysis and graphics performance in this system will improve the quality and
broaden the scope of numerical simulations by allowing continuous graphical
interaction between the researchers and their applications. Moreover, this
workstation is an invaluable tool for parallel algorithm development, and will
be used to teach students to make effective use of parallel computing in
research.
