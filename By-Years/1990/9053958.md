This project, entitled "MS WIZ," is designed to motivate young girls to be
prepared to select a mathematical, scientific or technical field for their
professional major in college. Hopefully, this will bring a substantial number
of women into the fields of science and technology in the near future. MS WIZ is
a summer intensive two week program to help girls believe that it is acceptable
to be bright, interested in science, and to be a female. The purpose is
threefold: first, to help girls be exposed to the curriculum content in a way
that gets them excited about this subject matter; second, to help girls
experience values such as choice; intellectual risk-taking, decision-making and
power; and third, to create a community in which young girls have positive role
models in these fields and have a personal opportunity to speak, to question and
work with women in the sciences at many levels.
