Five community colleges are adapting a calculator-based curriculum for calculus
developed at Clemson University. Workshops are being conducted to introduce the
ten faculty to the new curriculum and implementation begins in the Spring
Semester. The ten core faculty will then introduce the new approach to their
colleagues as the new approach is implemented in all calculus sections.
