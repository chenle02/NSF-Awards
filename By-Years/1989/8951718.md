A unique approach is taken for enhancing theoretical course work in statistical
process control (SPC). By introducing laboratory work into the course using
simulated scenarios of actual processes, students will learn the implication,
demands, and constraints of SPC tools . A new Quality in Manufacturing
Laboratory (QIML) is created to improve the learning process in our quality
control course. The primary goal of this project is to provide a realistic
manufacturing environment for students to investigate the effectiveness of SPC
techniques. This is achieved through discrete event simulation with a graphics
display. The QIML consists of a set of ten student computer workstations,
instructor workstation, and system station on an Ethernet local area network.
Students can perform a variety of functions at their workstation through the
course of the experiment. A large screen projector displays an overall picture
of the system so that students maintain a wide-scope perspective on the problem.
Experiments include process capability, SPC monitoring, experimental design,
acceptance sampling, and total interaction. The equipment provides for
interaction between the instructor and students as well as among students.
