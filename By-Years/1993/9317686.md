Abstract University of Illinois - Chicago - K. DahlenID,u Connection to NSFNET
Proposal No. NCR-9317686 The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) needs to
significantly expand its intra-campus connections to resources available through
the NSFNET. At the same time, the University needs to provide a means of
integrating Internet resources and networked connectivity into its existing
information services. An integral part of this plan is to educate nursing
students, educators, researchers, and practitioners to the advantages of campus
and Internet resources by promoting access and networked connectivity and
mechanisms for improving communication, increasing information access, and for
sharing knowledge. The long-term goal is to extend this prototype to the other
health professional schools and to the campus as a whole. The main objectives
are: to streamline library operations and connectivity; to improve patron
service; to develop new forms of collaboration and knowledge-sharing among
nursing practitioners in the field; and to test educational strategies to
integrate Internet resources into both the curriculum and practice of nursing.
