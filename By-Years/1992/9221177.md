Three research areas will be pursued: (1) New photochemical reactions that
proceed by way of alkyl propargyl, alpha-acyl-substituted alkyl propargyl, or
acyl propargyl biradicals will be explored. This study will include a
consideration of the multiplicity of the biradical intermediates and the
consequences to the course of reaction. (2) Independent preparation of carbonyl-
substituted biradicals that are intermediates in intramolecular Ä±2+2!-
photocyclization will be carried out. (3) The role of triplet energy and
specific structure on the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction by heteroaromatic
nitrogen triplets will be investigated. Intramolecular abstraction of primary,
secondary, and tertiary nitrogen in pyridines, pyrimidines, and pyrazines will
be studied. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
continuing work of Professor William C. Agosta at Rockefeller University.
Molecules that contain a light absorbing group, and in addition, a carbon-carbon
double and triplet bond will be irradiated. The intermediates in these reactions
will be investigated by observing the final products of the reactions. These
intermediates will be generated by other methods to provide more insight into
the electronic state and nature of the intermediates. The role of energetics of
excited states and structure of certain nitrogen containing molecules in the
intramolecular transfer of a hydrogen will be studied as well.
