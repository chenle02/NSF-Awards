This project is providing scholarships to allow students to pursue degrees in
mathematics or engineering. The project is also designed to impact two year
terminal and transfer computer science programs. The overall objective of the
program is to provide a firm foundation in skills necessary for students to
transfer from the community college to a four-year university and successfully
complete a Bachelor's Degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four main
goals :&lt;br/&gt;1) to recruit students to major in computer science,
engineering, or mathematics (CSEM).&lt;br/&gt;2) to provide students the needed
faculty and facilities support to major in a CSEM discipline.&lt;br/&gt;3) to
use proven educational techniques in combination with effective use of
instructional technology in a positive atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;4) to retain
students as CSEM majors by providing tutoring, mentoring and peer
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on another NSF supported
project "Improving Student Learning in PreCalculus and Calculus Through
Effective Implementation of Technology." This project is enabling the college to
install a mathematics computer lab which permits the math faculty to incorporate
lab exercises into precalculus and calculus courses. The grant also provides
funds for math faculty professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is designed to recruit and retain students that have the academic
ability but lack the financial means to attend a university as CSEM major. In
particular this project is targeting financially needy students from small rural
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
