This award is being used to convene a two-and-a-half-day planning workshop to
establish the foundations of a new partnership between the Centers for Ocean
Science Education Excellence located in Florida (COSEE Florida) and the Upward
Bound program. COSEE Florida is designed to engage Florida's ocean scientists in
education and outreach through professional development activities, while Upward
Bound's goals are to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary
education and enroll in and graduate from post-secondary institutions. The
ultimate goal of this project is to develop and implement effective strategies
and programs for connecting role models from the ocean sciences community with
>1000 college-bound students involved with Upward Bound each year. By working
with the Upward Bound program, there is an opportunity to support students from
underserved communities as they make the critical transition from secondary to
post-secondary education. For the planning effort, a steering committee of 6
professionals from the scientific and education communities will select 20
representatives from the ocean sciences academic community, Upward Bound
program, minority undergraduate and graduate student populations, and higher
education administration officials focused on diversity efforts, to participate
in the workshop and help to develop a path forward. This project serves the NSF
and GEO Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM fields, in
general, and in the geosciences, specifically.
