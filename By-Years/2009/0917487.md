The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the Institute for Learning Innovation, and
several environmental organizations are merging existing bird-focused citizen
science programs with gardening and online social networking activities to
provide older adult learners (age 35 and up) with opportunities to investigate
the environmental impacts of implementing landscaping and carbon-reducing
practices in their backyards, community gardens, and parks. The YardMap Network
project is developing learning resources that will help gardeners, birders, and
novices learn bird-habitat improving and carbon-reducing living practices by
joining a nationwide ecological social network composed of more than 100,000
people. The goal of the project is to create online learning communities that
move people from basic and intermediate levels ecological understanding to
advanced levels of understanding by providing experiences whereby YardMappers
learn about, design, evaluate, share, and invent conservation practices in their
backyards and other green spaces.

While developing the network, the project will gather data to test the
hypothesis that coupling citizen science activities with social networking
technologies to create online learning communities improves participants'
understanding of project-relevant science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics. The project will track learning outcomes using standard evaluation
techniques and by following individuals' routes of entry, network interactions,
mapped garden practices, carbon-neutral behaviors, and their bird monitoring
activities. YardMappers will divide naturally into treatment groups, creating a
quasi-experimental design to test the importance of social networking for basic,
intermediate, and advanced learning outcomes.
