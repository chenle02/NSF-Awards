This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics. Possible student
research areas include atomic and molecular physics, deutron magnetic resonance
of liquid crystals and binary mixtures, intermediate energy nuclear physics,
molecular spectroscopy in support of atmospheric sciences, MuSR and NMR solid
state experiments, particle experiments, relativistic heavy ion theory, solid
state theory, ultrasonic interactions with materials. An undergraduate colloquim
provides a forum where students describe their work to each other. This project
is supported under the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to
help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
