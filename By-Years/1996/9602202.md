University, Sacramento which will convene engineering faculty from several
universities in the United States with their counterparts from universities in
Viet Nam. The workshop will have several objectives. These includes discussions
of technical education in both countries including possible student and faculty
exchanges and a study of potential areas of joint research as well as
professional society cooperation. The workshop is planned for 5 days in November
1996.
