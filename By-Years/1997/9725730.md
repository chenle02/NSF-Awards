9725730 Bromwich This award is for support for a study of accumulation rate
variations over the Antarctic ice sheet for the last two decades, the period for
which reliable atmospheric analyses are available. The twice-daily precipitation
rate will be calculated for the 21 years on a 50-km grid using a diagnostic
model developed for similar studies over Greenland. Estimates of the sublimation
rate will be developed from the best available sources including the atmospheric
analyses. The impact of drift snow redistribution on the precipitated snow will
be evaluated by combining simulations of the Antarctic surface winds with
formulas relating drift snow transport to surface wind speed. The precipitation,
sublimation, and drift snow transport divergence estimates will be merged to
depict the estimated accumulation rate. The derived accumulation variations will
be examined in relation to a wide range of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena to
uncover the governing mechanisms. The results will be relevant to studies of
Antarctic mass balance and the ice sheet contribution to present global sea
level rise, and the interpretation of ice core records covering recent to paleo
environments.
