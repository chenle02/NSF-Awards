This is a U.S.-Polish collaborative research project that deals with the
development and application of very accurate quantum-mechanical methods for the
description of molecules. The principal investigators are Prof. Ludwik Adamowicz
from the University of Arizona and Dr. Maria Barysz from the University of
Torun, Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will combine their expertise
to provide a unique view of molecules, their structures and properties without
resorting to the clamped-nucleus model and without neglecting the relativistic
effect. The proposed calculations will deliver the most accurate calculated
standards ever produced for testing other more approximate methods developed for
Quantum-Mechanics calculations of larger molecular systems. Comparison of these
standards with high-resolution experiments will facilitate an "ultimate test" of
limitations of the non-relativistic and relativistic Quantum
Mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in chemistry research fulfills the
program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
