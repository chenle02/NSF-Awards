9453790 Eichinger The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry is requesting
$971,288 over three years for the development, formative and summative
evaluation of two traveling exhibits. The 5,000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit is
designed for children ages 3-8 and their families, using the context, setting,
characters and challenged portrayed in the books of Richard Scarry, a noted
children's author. A 2,000 sq. ft. mini-version traveling exhibit will be
produced for use in smaller venues. Parent, teacher, and staff guides will be
prepared and distributed. This exhibit gives strong emphasis to facilitating
parent interaction with their children, and has activity areas for parents built
into the exhibit. There is also an emphasis on anti-bias content within the
exhibit.
