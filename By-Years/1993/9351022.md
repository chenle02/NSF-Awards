9351022 Mills The laboratory offerings for students in the first calculus-based
introductory physics course is being upgraded to include the use of computer
techniques in the experiments. The students are interfacing equipment to enter
data directly into files for analysis. Spreadsheets are being used for data
analysis and graph preparation. The exercises have been selected to fulfill some
of the functions of a traditional recitation session as well. It is expected
that this will improve both the levels at which the experiments are done and the
students' comprehension of the concepts. The experience gained is providing a
basis for planning modernization of the other introductory laboratories.
