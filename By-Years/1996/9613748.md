Abstract ATM-9613748 K.Y. Kim and G. R. North Texas A &amp; M Univ. Title:
Studies and Applications of Cyclostationary Empirical Orthogonal Functions This
study proposes to investigate climate related Cyclo Stationary (CS) processes by
methods developed by the PIs in an earlier pilot project. The aim here is to
provide relevant understanding and tools for analyzing CS processes. CSEOFs are
the basic ingredients of this work. These are like Fourier basis functions for
stationary series. Here the PIs intend to develop the theory and construct
simple algorithms and apply the methods for some applications. CSEOF method of
climate data analysis assists in better detection prediction and interpolation
of climate signals that are generally mixed up with noise.
