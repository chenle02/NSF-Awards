9629343 Verlinde Much of the energy that drives atmospheric circulations is
obtained through exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum with the surface.
Lake-effect events, where cold air masses are rapidly modified over the Great
Lakes, are excellent natural laboratories for studying these exchanges. The
Lake- Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple- Principal
Investigator project which seeks to use this natural laboratory to determine how
boundary layer growth processes are controlled by mesoscale boundary layer
convective structures and how the modified boundary layer effects the production
of precipitation and the larger scale meteorological conditions The Principal
Investigator will use a variety of in situ and remote measurements to attack the
following objectives: Determine the extent to which mesoscale circulations
modulate the entrainment processes at the top of the boundary layer; Determine
if entrainment occurs through engulfment associated with large-eddy circulations
n the boundary layer or through small-scale interfacial mixing and determine
sensitivity of the processes to large and mesoscale conditions. Determine the
impact of entrainment events on the drop size distribution at cloud top. These
objectives will be accomplished by: Compiling a statistical data base of the
spatial extent of entrainment events; The identification of cloud-top
entrainment processes through analysis of radar derived vertical layer profiles;
Categorizing the statistical data base according to large-, meso- and cloud-
scale conditions; Case studies of the microphysical impact of entrainment
events. The final products of the study will be a composite two-dimensional
reflectivity and vertical velocity structure of a mesoscale band, with
corresponding cloud-scale and cross-inversion turbulence intensity, and several
descriptions of detailed case studies. These will provide a better quantitativ e
physical understanding of the interaction between these different scales of
motion. ***
