Steve Choi is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to conduct a program of research and education at Cornell University. He will
play a lead role in developing and deploying an instrument to measure the
scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by hydrogen atoms in
space. The measurements will advance our understanding of the physics of the
early universe. Along with this research, he will conduct physics enrichment
activities for underserved elementary school kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will test and integrate arrays of kinetic inductance detectors on the
CCAT-prime telescope under construction in the Atacama Desert. The arrays will
allow measurements of Rayleigh scattering of CMB photons, which depends on the
frequency of the photons, and is thus a potentially more sensitive probe of CMB
anisotropies than Thomson scattering. The measurements could significantly
improve constraints on cosmological observables including the number of
relativistic species, the current expansion rate of the universe, and the mass
sum of neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
