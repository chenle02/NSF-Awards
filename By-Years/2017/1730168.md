This award funds research in economic theory. The research team seeks to use
tools from game theory to model and analyze situations in which persuasion,
credibility, and information design are important. In many different kinds of
economic (and social) interactions, one or more parties provides information to
others, but also has an interest in the outcome. For example, a firm marketing a
new product provides information about the product's features and benefits to
possible buyers, but obviously the firm also wants to make the sale. In these
kinds of situations, careful buyers will consider not just the information
provided but also the source before deciding what to believe and what
conclusions to draw. The two investigators plan to develop a framework that
could be used to analyze these kinds of credibility and persuasion issues across
a broad class of applications. This has the potential for suggesting practical
methods that business, governments, and individuals can use to credibly transmit
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is aimed at understanding
credibility's role in optimal persuasion. The team will analyze three connected
environments with varying degrees of credibility. The first part focuses on
studying the limits of cheap talk persuasion. The researchers build and analyze
a general model in which an informed sender communicates with a receiver at no
cost. The model assumes that the sender's preferences over the receiver's
actions are state-independent, and this assumption allows for a geometric
characterization of the model equilibria. The second project focuses on the
effect of intermediate credibility in persuasion by allowing for a messaging
protocol. Since credibility enables effective persuasion, there is a tradeoff
between today's effective communication and tomorrow's persuasion. The last part
of this research considers how concern for future credibility affects ongoing
persuasion.
