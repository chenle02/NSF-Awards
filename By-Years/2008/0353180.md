The likely detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources will open
a new window for astronomy and provide new tests of Einstein's theory of general
relativity. Interpreting the observations and advancing this new field will
require accurate theoretical gravitational waveforms calculated from the theory.
This project will endeavor to provide the needed waveforms, by solving
Einstein's equations systematically in an approximation known as the post-
Newtonian method. Development of a novel diagnostic tool, based on higher-order
post-Newtonian methods, to elucidate the physical content of numerical
simulations of black-hole and neutron-star binary inspiral will be continued.
Ways to use gravitational-wave data to test alternative theories of gravity will
also be studied. This includes testing the scalar-tensor alternative theories
and theories in which the graviton has a mass, by observing gravitational waves
from inspiralling compact binaries. Such tests could provide verification of
Einstein's theory in entirely new regimes.

Education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and of a post-
doctoral researcher will be integrated into the research program. The PI will
continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing
understanding of the validity and implications of Einstein's ideas to the
broader community. He will prepare an update of his comprehensive review article
on experimental gravitation for the web-based journal Living Reviews in
Relativity, update his popular book ``Was Einstein Right?'' and enhance his
current website with web pages providing information on testing fundamental
physics with gravitational waves. The work on equations of motion and
gravitational wave forms will impact the field of astronomy, as gravitation-wave
observations, which rely upon these calculations, become a reality. The research
on post-Newtonian diagnostics will foster closer ties between the post-Newtonian
experts and numerical relativity experts, leading to more realistic simulations
of the important final phase of binary inspiral.
