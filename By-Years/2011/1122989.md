Research conducted under this grant will address two broad areas in the field of
climate dynamics. The first consists of identification and interpretations of
the atmospheric variability pattern associated with MJO in terms of variability
in thin cirrus clouds, aerosols and geochemical tracers. The second consists of
an analysis of time varying patterns of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level
pressure (SLP) and surface air temperature over land (SAT) to explore (1) the
interrelations between the fields and in particular, the processes that shape
the dominant patterns in the SST field, (2) a prominent pattern of wintertime
SLP variability, with maximum amplitude over Eurasia, and (3) patterns of SAT
and SLP variability whose time-varying indices project upon hemispheric and
regional-mean temperatures. The second research area is of interest for
understanding recent climate change and determining the anthropogenic
contribution to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will have broader impacts
through the education of two graduate students. In addition, the work on climate
change detection and attribution to anthropogenic or natural causes may benefit
decision makers seeking to understand and respond to climate change and its
impacts.
