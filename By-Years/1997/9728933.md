IBN-9728933 Spirou In the brainstem, which is the part of the brain just above
the spinal cord, are centers involved in early processing of auditory
information. These cell groups, called nuclei, show different kinds of
physiological specialization, and receive and send projections to several other
parts of the brainstem and higher centers. One of these centers is called the
medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO), from its location and shape. The MSO is
thought to have a major role in the ability to localize sounds in space, by
analyzing the time of arrival of signals coming from the two ears. Part of this
specialized processing is done by converging excitatory nerve inputs, but an
important and largely unknown role is played by inhibitory signals that also
converge on single cells in the MSO. This project uses physiological recording
from an isolated brain slice to study activity produced in the MSO by inputs
from the two sides of the brainstem; to establish basic information about the
structure, pharmacology and kinetic properties of inhibitory inputs to MSO; and
to study the sensitivity of the MSO cells to small differences in arrival time
of signals from the two sides. Results will be important to understanding how
temporal processing of high resolution occurs in the auditory system, and will
also lead to better computational models of how sound localization is done. Such
models may be applied to design of instruments with improved ability to
discriminate sounds in complex environments.
