9723529 Chen Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins are mitogenic
and anabolic peptize hormones that play an important role in growth and
differentiation of vertebrates. Results of numerous studies in mammals suggest
that while IGF-II is produced in the liver and several other pre-natal and
neonatal tissues, IGF-I is primarily produced in the post-natal livers under the
modulation of growth hormone (GH). Although the molecular mechanism underling
the regulation of IGF-I and IGF-II genes has been extensively studied in
mammals, very little has been done in lower vertebrates like fish. The PI's
research objectives are to investigate else regulation of IGF gene expression
and the involvement of IGF-I and -II in somatic growth, using rainbow trout as
model experimental animals. In the previous funding cycle, the PI has isolated
and characterized IGF-I and cDNA ahead their genes, and has shown that
expressions of these two genes are regulated by growth hormone (GH). In the
present application, the PI proposes to study: (1) the biological relevance of
IGF I and II mRNA expression during the early embryonic development, and (2) the
involvement of CCAAT cis-acting element and its hepatic nuclear binding protein
(C/EBP) on the regulation of IGF gene expression. Fish represent the largest and
the most diverse group of vertebrates and their unique evolutionary position
relative to other vertebrates and their ability to adapt to a wide variety of
environments make them ideal for studying the molecular mechanisms of growth
regulation. Therefore, results of these proposed studies will advance the
knowledge of vertebrate JGF gene regulation and expression in a way that is both
easily generalized to vertebrate models, and will provide a phylogenetic
perspective that has proved useful in the studies of other complex biological
phenomena. Furthermore, results of these studies will be applied to commercial
aquaculture.
