The goal of this Expedited Award for Novel Research project is to carry out the
preliminary analysis of a special computational system for solving petroleum
reservoir simulation. The governing equations will be scaled in such a way that
binary computations will be used instead of the usual floating point operations.
The could result in considerable computational efficiency. Furthermore, multi-
processor algorithms will be developed for 'stiff' systems of equations
permitting the use of large time steps for integration. Finite state system or
cellular automata will be explored for petroleum reservoir simulation.
