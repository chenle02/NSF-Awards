This project is motivated by the need in the mathematics program for a single
focus that can direct mathematics majors' learning throughout their
undergraduate education and ultimately prepare them to be independent and life-
long learners. As a capstone experience, the previous senior seminar has been
intended to display this independence by having students pull together 3 years
of instruction into a single presentation. Unfortunately students have not been
prepared to meet this challenge. This project has therefore chosen as its
organizing principle the need to improve undergraduate research capabilities at
every stage of the program. This project improves students' research experiences
by improving mastery of mathematical content, creating opportunities to complete
extended assignments and self-directed inquiry, and providing modern
technological capabilities that facilitate creative investigations. This project
identifies courses for which extended assignments and projects are used, creates
assignments and projects that are stimulating and relevant to course objectives,
increases the expectations for student accomplishment as they advance through
the program, and tracks students' progress according to projects completed and
mastery levels reached at each stage. The benefits of this project are described
in terms of student gains: (a) students learn that mathematics is a dynamic
subject that is constantly changing and expanding; (b) students understand how
mathematics is created and how mathematical research is conducted; and (c) by
attending conferences and giving presentations of their work, students become
connected to the greater mathematics community and gain greater appreciation for
the beauty and elegance of mathematics. *
