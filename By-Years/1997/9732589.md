The objective is to conduct a workshop to survey and assess accelerated-testing
and simulation-modeling methods available to determine the long-term performance
of infrastructure materials and components. Both conventional and nontraditional
materials will be addressed as well as the performance of conventional materials
in innovative applications. Related work in materials and life-cycle simulation
from other fields will also be considered. The workshop will 1) define
objectives for infrastructure-based research that exploits accelerated testing
and computational simulation methods to determine life-cycle performance; 2)
assess the state of the knowledge base to identify gaps and overlaps in research
activities; 3) establish outcome-oriented metrics for setting research
priorities; and 4) identify potentially promising lines of research and
collaborations.
