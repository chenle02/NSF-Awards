Several topics in complex phases of condensed matter will be studied. The
revision of classical crystallography necessitated by the discovery of
icosahedral quasicrystals will be extended and completed, in parallel with
efforts to extend two- and three- dimensional tiling theory to provide templates
for the new non- crystallographic space groups. A new numerical approach to the
computation of the equilibrium blue phases of chiral nematics will be explored,
based on the exact solutions of the infinite chirality limit down to physical
values of the chirality.
