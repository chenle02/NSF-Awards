This project involves the use and development of microlocal techniques to study
three categories of nonlinear wave phenomena: diffraction by smooth obstacles,
diffraction by nonsmooth obstacles, and transmission from one medium to another.
In all three cases we are concerned with the behavior of singularity- bearing
rays as well as with progressing waves. The aim is to produce propagation of
regularity theorems along with examples demonstrating the optimality of those
theorems. In the latter two categories, the research addresses some basic
questions concerning existence which remain open even in the linear case.
