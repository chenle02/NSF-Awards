9406689 Smith PI and an interdisciplinary team, including Mexican collaborator
Miguel Tellez (UNAM-BC), will integrate old and new sedimentologic and
biostratigraphic studies to produce a comprehensive geologic map of the Vizcaino
fore-arc basin. Compiled data, including strain analyses, will be used to
interpret basin history and tectonic evolution of the southwestern North
American plate edge. Paleo-magnetic evidence for long-distance translation will
be evaluated. Combined with prior studies, this work will provide a broad
evaluation of this plate margin for the last 100 million years.
