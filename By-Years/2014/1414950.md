Predicting earthquakes is a difficult task, due largely to a limited
understanding of the complex physical processes involved. Computer simulations
allow researchers to better understand such processes, but the current models
are limited in terms of the problem size that they can handle. Improving these
computer models could provide insight into seismic events, such as earthquakes,
and possibly aid in prediction. This project will focus on improving an existing
software package for modeling Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. This
research will be conducted at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in collaboration
with Dr. Zongyan Cao, an expert with the Xeon Phi Coprocessor, Intel's new chip
that will be used in the computer simulations.

ETS events occur where continental plates meet, and they are characterized by
weak, long-term tremors with acute seismic events occurring periodically. A
novel mathematical model has been proposed to describe ETS, and subsequent
computer simulations closely match observed GPS data. This model describes a
system of shearing and fluid release. As two plates slide along each other, heat
is produced, ultimately causing a dehydration reaction to occur. The result is a
release of high-pressure fluid, which acts as a lubricant, resulting in a slip
event. Additionally, the fluid absorbs heat, and the whole system cools and
returns to it's original state. The code for this chemo-mechanical oscillator
model is limited in size and scale; it currently only runs in one dimension and
in serial. This research seeks to develop a parallel version of the code that is
capable of handling multiple dimensions and multiple time and length scales.
Intel's Xeon Phi Coprocessor will be used, in part due to its ease of
programmability, but also because the next generation of HPC systems will make
use of accelerator technologies like the Xeon Phi. This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
