This award supports theoretical research on reactions involving few-body nuclei
at intermediate energies. This includes continuing work on meson photo-
production, inelastic electron scattering, and studies to test hyperon-nucleon
interactions. This work will be supportive of on-going and planned electron
scattering experiments at Bates and CEBAF.
