Cal Poly Pomona is developing a plan leading to the synergistic integration of
service-learning in an engineering pedagogical framework for all of the programs
in the College of Engineering and is providing leadership to other CSU campuses
in implementing service-learning in engineering disciplines. The Engineering
Service-Learning Institute (ESLI) is being established and is providing
integrated support for identifying community partners, developing long-term
partnerships, and defining realistic service-learning projects that fit an
engineering pedagogical framework. They are building on several service learning
workshops conducted in the past year and significant engagement with the EPICS
program at Purdue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Cal Poly Pomona is a Minority
Serving and Hispanic Serving Institute, underrepresented groups will directly
benefit from the successful implementation of this plan. They plan to share the
results with other CSU campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
