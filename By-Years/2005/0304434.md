0304434&lt;br/&gt;Soboyejo&lt;br/&gt;Travel support is provided for a workshop
on materials engineering and manufacturing to be held in conjunction with the
first meeting of the African Materials Research Society in Dakar, Senegal. The
workshop will bring together US and African researchers in the topic areas to
exchange information and explore areas of potential future research
collaboration. Breakout sessions on infrastructure materials systems,
biomaterials, and manufacturing are planned.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the
resulting collaborative research will help attract minority students to the
topic areas involved.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
