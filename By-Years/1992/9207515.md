This project will continue the design process for an Arctic Research Vessel. The
concept design, completed in spring 1991, received wide distribution and comment
from the scientific community. As a result, a larger, more capable ship
including consideration for alternative hull forms is under examination.
Incorporating science operational profiles, the first phase of the project will
redefine the science mission requirements and decide on the appropriate hull
form. Phase two will complete the preliminary design after NSF review of the
phase one results. A subcontract to the Glosten Associates will provide naval
architectural assistance during both phases. The project directors are fully
qualified to conduct this project having had considerable experience in Arctic
research and Arctic research ships.
