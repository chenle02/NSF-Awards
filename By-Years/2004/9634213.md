CTS - 9634213 Mark Weisner Rice University ABSTRACT This Project is an
investigation of the effects of particle size and fluid flow on the morphology
of colloidal deposits. Experiments will be performed to evaluate particle
attachment on granular porous media and directly observe particular disposition
using microscopy. The deposit morphology will be characterized by power-law
relationships of mass distribution as determined by light scattering,
sedimentation and image analysis. Theory will be developed to predict trends in
deposit morphology based on physical-chemical characteristics. Monte Carlo
simulation results will be compared to theory. The results may lead to an
improved understanding of liquid-solid separations used in various manufacturing
and environmental applications.
