This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Mohsen Sultan of
the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to conduct collaborative
research with Dr. Kazuhiko Kawashima for 12 months at the Public Works Research
Institute in Japan. They will conduct research on seismic design methods of
highway bridges, comparing the California and Japanese methods. Since the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake, the importance of accurate prediction of structures'
behavior during large magnitude earthquakes has been reemphasized. An expert in
bridge design and Project Manager of the Division of Structures, Caltrans, Dr.
Sultan investigated the structural damage caused by the 1989 earthquake as a
member of the Caltrans Post Earthquake Investigation Team. Dr. Sultan's
expertise in the ductility method in seismic design will complement Dr.
Kawashima's expertise in a seismic design method of rigid foundations as they
compare designs of several bridges. Yielding a much better understanding of the
differences between the two systems, the research will help in retrofitting
existing bridges, in designing new bridge projects, such as a long span bridge
to cross the Carquinez Straight, and in evaluating the seismic safety of
existing bridges such as the San Francisco Bay Bridge.
