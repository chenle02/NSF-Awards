The komatiites of the lower formations of the Barberton greenstone belt have
been extensively studied, but little is known of the widespread komatiites of
the upper portions of the Barberton greenstone belt. This project will be a
comprehensive study of these upper komatiites, including: 1) geochronology,
stratigraphy, and correlations with other upper greenstone belt structural
units; and, 2) petrogenesis, especially of the volumetrically important, though
very unusual, high Al/Ti komatiites. The proposed work will be conducted in the
ICM-MS lab at MIT, and in southern Africa while the PI is on sabbatical leave
from LSU. Analytical procedures for REE, and PGE analyses by ICP-MS will then
take place at the new ICP-MS facility at LSU.
