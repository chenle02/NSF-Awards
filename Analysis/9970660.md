Abstract: This research will focus on problems in harmonic analysis, subelliptic
partial differential equations, and spectral theory. A circle of problems
related to the interplay between curvature, finite type conditions, Lebesgue-
space norm inequalities, precise smoothing properties of Radon-like transforms,
oscillation, sizes of images of mappings, and sublevel sets will be
investigated. Those aspects of partial differential equations to be investigated
concern subelliptic operators, and the d-bar Neumann problem for smoothly
bounded domains. Long-term goals include a deeper understanding of global
regularity and irregularity, and of analytic hypoellipticity. The possible
relevance of a certain metric in phase space to these issues will be further
studied. Lastly, the existence of absolutely continuous spectra for Schroedinger
operators with slowly decaying potentials, and the asymptotic behavior of
generalized eigenfunctions in dimensions greater than one will be explored.
Multilinear analysis will be applied to this problem, and space-time estimates
of an as yet undetermined nature will be sought.

Fundamental physical laws are often formulated in terms of partial differential
equations. The mathematician's task is to analyze such equations and their
solutions, which generally cannot be computed explicitly, and moreover to
develop general techniques useful in such analyses. The harmonic analyst, in
particular, seeks to combine dual time/space and frequency analysis to gain
insight into issues such as the possible singularities of solutions or
eigenfunctions, how such singularities reflect the structure of the underlying
differential equation or linear operator, and what properties of the operator
influence singularities or asymptotic behavior. In particular, curvature in
various guises plays an important role for hyperbolic partial differential
equations, and for geometry in complex space. This research project focuses on a
number of interrelated fundamental questions concerning harmonic analysis and
its applications to partial differential equations and to spectral theory, in
which curvature and time/frequency analysis play leading roles. The aim is to
develop basic methods of analysis, through the investigation of several concrete
problems, that may lead to a better understanding of underlying mathematical
phenomena and, ultimately, of any physical laws that the mathematics
