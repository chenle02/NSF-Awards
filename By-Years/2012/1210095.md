This action funds Dawn Elizabeth Barnes of Emory University to conduct a
research project, entitled "how protein structure plays a role in the
contraction and relaxation of heart muscle," during the summer of 2012 at Nagoya
University in Nagoya, Japan. The host scientist is Yuichiro Maeda.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the new knowledge being
generated about the mechanism of regulation of heart muscle contraction at the
level of single molecules. Using a model system, the nematode C. elegans, allows
the use of genetic techniques for studying function of myofilaments in the
absence and presence of key proteins. Also being used is cryo-electron
microscopy to compare the calcium sensitivity of thin-filament proteins in wild
type and mutant forms. Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing
the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to
the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective
location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These
activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early
in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a
globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.
