This grant supports costs associated with a planning conference to be held at
the Granlibakken Conference Center in Tahoe City, CA on 25-26 July 2002. The
intent of the planning conference is to develop the foundation of a community-
supported and accessible science center/computational facility proposal to be
submitted in the future to the Division of Earth Sciences. Approximately 40
participants representing leading scholars in the fields of geophysical
modeling, seismology and geodynamo theory from U.S. and international academia
and government laboratories will attend. In principle, the center would focus on
open development and implementation of complex numerical algorithms for
simulating the dynamics of deep earth processes, many of which are difficult if
not impossible to verify experimentally. The facility would enable more
realistic and complex models of mantle and core convection and geomagnetic field
behavior to be developed and run than is currently possible due to limited
and/or dedicated computational and personnel resources of individual
investigators, academic institutions and supercomputer centers. The ideal
facility would also ensure sharing and standardized benchmarking of important
geodynamic codes not only across the U. S. academic community, but also
internationally. Further, such a facility would ultimately provide access to
investigators and their students who are currently hampered by insufficient
resources, both computational and intellectual, to become involved in state-of-
the-art theoretical geodynamic research. ***
