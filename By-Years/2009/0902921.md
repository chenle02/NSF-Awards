With this award the PI will develop highly resolved records of mean annual
surface temperature and d18O(water) variability from the Northern Gulf of Mexico
over past 3000 years. The PI will document the magnitude and spatial character
of variability, and explore the results in the context of previous work that has
shown spectral peaks in geochemical and faunal variability linked to solar
output. The proposed work will test several hypotheses: 1) that significant
changes in mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) occurred in response to the
Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods, 2) that mean annual SST approached
modern levels several times over the study interval, and 3) that surface ocean
variability in the Gulf of Mexico is linked to solar variability. Broader
impacts include generation of records of natural climate variability on human
timescales (i.e., the last few thousands years), and graduate and undergraduate
involvement in research and fieldwork.
