This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop an
innovative, ultra-fast, self-reactive laser eye protection (LEP) device. Made
from vanadium dioxide (VOx) nano particles, this novel LEP will best protect
human eyes and optical sensors from laser injury in the visible to short wave
infrared (SWIR).

Since the new LEP device has an extremely low optical limiting threshold as
compared to the state-of-the-art carbon nanotube based LEP, it would not require
a focal lens array for application. Another advantage is that the device is
solid state and can be fabricated on ballistic proof polycarbonate (PC)
substrates. Lastly, the LEP device doesn't need external power, thus eliminating
the concerns about possible power failure.
