Initial results of deep mantle electrical conductivity studies underway suggest
that a localized jump in electrical conductivity is present at midmantle depths,
with a peak in the conductivity gradient roughly coincident with the 670 km
seismic discontinuity. The PI will obtain higher resolution models of the
electrical conductivity of the whole mantle. This involves calculating
equivalent scalar magnetotelluric impedance functions from ratios of magnetic
field Fourier coefficients. The transformation of spectral ratios into
impedances is made possible by knowledge of the magnetic field source structure.
He will apply concepts of robust statistical parameter estimation to the problem
of spherical harmonic analysis.
