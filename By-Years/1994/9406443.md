9406443 Williams The tectonics of the early earth is controversial and difficult
to study. The snowbird tectonic zone is a long boundary between northern
Saskatchewan tectonic provinces, that has recently been tecontized in the mid-
Archean (3.2 Ga). These rocks contain unusually well perceived high pressure
minerals and fabrics presumably due to Archean collisions. This project will
study three distinct terranes within the Snowbird zone to unravel how each
formed and how they came to be joined by Archean tectonic displacement. Results
have considerable significance to the early development of cratons, especially
deep crustal processes.
