The Tampa Bay Robert Noyce Master Teacher Fellows (MTF) program is a partnership
between the University of South Florida (USF), Hillsborough County Public
Schools (HCPS), and Helios Education Foundation (HEF). The project is recruiting
and selecting 20 content knowledgeable mathematics and science teachers with a
proven track record of effectiveness who participate in a program for developing
teacher leaders. Selected Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) participate in a
jointly developed Teacher Leaders for Student Learning graduate certificate
program, a four-course sequence that examines the links between teacher
leadership, job-embedded professional learning, and student learning. MTFs also
participate in a Teacher Leader Academy, a two-year professional development
program designed to enhance their mentoring and leadership skills so they can
support mathematics and science programs at both institutions. The Master
Teaching Fellows (MTFs) assume leadership roles within their schools and school
district enabling them to mentor and support beginning and veteran inservice
teachers. In addition, the MTFs support prospective mathematics and science
teachers at USF by serving as mentors, supervising teachers, guest presenters,
and co-instructors in preservice courses. This project builds capacity within
the Tampa Bay Educational Partnership (TBEP) by training highly effective
mathematics and science teachers to become teacher leaders who support
prospective, new, and veteran teachers as they implement new standards for
mathematics and science. Mathematics and science teachers, supported by MTFs,
are influencing the STEM pipeline significantly as they teach the approximately
200,000 students in HCPS.
