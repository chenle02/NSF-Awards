Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will provide the Antarctic
Earth Science research community with the opportunity to debate and prioritize
scientific goals. The PI proposes to convene a workshop, the Antarctic Geologic
Drilling Workshop, with approximately 42 U.S. participants at various stages of
their careers, all of who bring scientific questions that could be addressed by
geologic drilling in the Antarctic. After the workshop, the steering committee
will complete a report summarizing the drilling targets of interest to the U.S.
Antarctic community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will foster a variety of interdisciplinary drilling studies targeting
paleoclimate research and glacial modeling. This workshop will emphasize
participation of early career scientists and the PI will use the outreach office
at the University of Houston to promote the workshop and its outcomes. The
workshop will be held at the University of Houston, described as the second-most
ethnically diverse campus in the U.S. All interested students will be invited to
the poster session to learn about the range of scientific research being done in
the Antarctic and to meet the researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
