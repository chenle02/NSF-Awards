This grant supports development of an advanced computer science laboratory
which supports undergraduate research activities in the areas of programming
languages, compilers, and software design. The laboratory supports a required
senior research project, which is a full year of independent research conducted
by the students in close consultation with the computer science faculty. It also
services two junior level software- oriented computer science classes. A major
goal of this project is to significantly increase the participation of
undergraduates in interesting and important computer science research with the
idea of making graduate study in computer science more attractive. The
institution is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than
the funds provided by the Foundation.
