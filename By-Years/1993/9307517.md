The research entails further investigations into the geometry of partial
differential equations in the broader framework of the calculus of variations.
Studies on minimality of hypersurfaces have applicatons to geometric models
arising in physics and biology. A particular case to be studied is the Gibbs-
Thomson effect relating surface interfacing and curvature. Other applications to
materials theory and crystallography are intended.
