Ryan Steele of the University of Utah is supported by an award from the Chemical
Theory Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to
develop new approaches to the computational simulation of chemical processes.
Such simulations currently exhibit the potential to unravel critical details of
societally relevant chemistry challenges, including renewable energy. They also,
however, are impeded by computational cost hurdles which limit the applicability
of these methods. This research program seeks alternative approaches which
dramatically extend the range of applicability of these methods and the
development of new simulation methodology. Specifically, this work will address
the motion of molecules and the manner in which this motion dictates chemical
reactivity. The computational tools developed in this project will be made
available to the broader research community. In concert with these developments,
integrated education components of this program strive to improve the manner in
which students and educators view chemistry -- both literally and conceptually
-- by using newly developed simulation/visualization tools and pedagogy. These
education aims will facilitate a change in pedagogy, as well as increase access
for underserved students and their
educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key proposed methodology -- and
the unique aspect of the research in this funding period -- is a new algorithmic
interface which marries ab initio electronic structure theory with sampling and
on-the-fly dynamics. This work seeks to exploit the inherent spatial and
temporal separability of the inner workings of electronic structure methods for
new, dynamics-specific simulations of large, reactive chemical systems.
Application to water oxidation complexes, where unique electronic structure and
nuclear motion abound, will be enabled by this new methodology.
