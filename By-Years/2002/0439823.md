Seismological studies are producing new and detailed images of the three-
dimensional structure of the Earth's lithosphere and mantle. These advances
offer the possibility to map variations in temperature and chemistry of the
planet's deep interior in unprecedented detail. A key component for such studies
is knowledge of the elastic properties of mantle minerals, and how these respond
to changes in structure, composition, pressure, and temperature. For many mantle
minerals, current knowledge of high-pressure elastic properties is fragmentary
at best. &lt;br/&gt; In this project, the elastic tensors of a number of
important mantle minerals will be measured at high pressures using Brillouin
scattering in a diamond anvil cell. A primary focus will be on hydrous phases
that are relevant to understanding the effect on seismic wavespeeds of
metamorphic processes operating in subduction zones. Brillouin scattering will
also be used to study the high-pressure elasticity of natural orthopyroxenes
with variable iron content. These results are needed to understand how pressure
and composition simultaneously affect elastic properties in this major upper
mantle constituent. This research program will provide fundamental new knowledge
about the physics of materials at high pressures and the structure and
composition of planetary interiors. &lt;br/&gt;
