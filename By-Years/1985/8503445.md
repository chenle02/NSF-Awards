This research considers the problem of stochastic control of queueing networks.
There currently exist tractable models of stochastic queueing networks that
allow multiple customer classes, but they permit only very simple scheduling
rules. Thus, extant theory gives little guidance as to how or how much system
performance can be improved through intelligent routing and sequencing of jobs.
This research will examine a class of network scheduling problems and derive
simple heuristics that are asymptotically optimal under conditions of heavy
loading. A simulation study will be undertaken to compare whatever heuristics
emerge from the theory against others appearing in the literature. In both the
theoretical development and the simulation study, special network structures
characteristic of semiconductor manufacturing systems will be emphasized.
