Research is underway to study the dissolution of calcium carbonate particles on
the ocean floor. The laboratory diffusion-cell study is designed to determine
the effective diffusion coefficients of the dissolved carbonate species
sediments. This effort will help to determine whether the dissolution rates are
limited by diffusive exchange between seawater and pore waters or by reaction
kinetics. The field experiment is designed to determine rates of recycling of
benthic organic carbon and calcium carbonate carbon above and below the calcite
saturation horizon in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean. A primary goal of
the research is to determine to what extent the dissolution is enhanced by the
oxidation of organic matter within surface sediments. In situ high resolution
pore water profiles of pH and pCO2 will be made using newly perfected
microelectrode techniques. The field work is planned for the Ceara Rise area in
conjunction with benthic chamber flux measurements by R. Jaknke and with in situ
whole core squeezer methods by Martin and Sayles. Preliminary testing and
intercomparison of methods is being done in the southeastern U.S. continental
margin.
