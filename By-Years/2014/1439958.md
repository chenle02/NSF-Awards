1439958&lt;br/&gt;Egbert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for the 22nd International Workshop on Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in
the Earth to be held in Weimar, Germany August 24-30, 2014. Funds will be used
primarily to support participants (early career faculty, students and postdocs)
from the USA, with any residual funds used to support attendees from
underdeveloped countries. The EM workshop will allow for focused presentations
and discussion on the methodological advances, including instrumentation, data
processing, inversion, and interpretation practice for electromagnetic Earth
imaging. EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the
sensitivity of electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and
lithologic variations. This sensitivity makes EM methods useful in a wide range
of investigations, addressing both applied and basic science questions, from the
very near surface to the deep mantle. EM methods are increasingly used for off-
shore petroleum exploration and find application to, waste site assessment,
aquifer mapping and vulnerability studies, exploration for construction
materials, building and utility investigation, and unexploded ordinance (UXO)
detection and discrimination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
