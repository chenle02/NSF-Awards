The PI will work on longstanding problems in the structure theory of Banach
spaces, many of them either originating or being related to other areas of
mathematics such as set theory, harmonic analysis and approximation theory. A
main theme of this proposal is the investigation of certain ``coordinate
systems'' for Banach spaces, e.g. bases, frames, and dictionaries. One of the
problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the
space of square integrable functions has a basis formed by translates of the
same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory
of Banach spaces. Another prominent question deals with the structure of the
(complemented) subspaces of the space of p-integrable functions. The PI intends
to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he has
developed in collaboration with E. Odell. Several parts of this proposal deal
with other issues originating from signal processing and data compression. Here
one looks for bases, frames, or, more generally dictionaries of spaces, in which
(certain) vectors can be approximated by vectors with few nonzero coordinates,
using easily implementable algorithms, so that the representation satisfies
certain stability conditions, and/or can be ``quantized''.

Banach spaces, their geometric and topological structure provide a natural
framework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, multi-
resolution analysis, in particular if one wants to model complex and high-
dimensional structures. A main goal of this proposal is to study several types
of coordinate systems on these spaces. The techniques to be employed will
involve a combination of analysis, infinite combinatorics, and logic. The
proposed work could also spur further development in these areas.
