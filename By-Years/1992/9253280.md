Teachers will be recruited to participate in a year long enhancement project.
The program will have two summer workshops coupled to activities spaced
throughout the year. Two-hundred forty high school teachers from Massachusetts,
New York, and Texas may participate in the workshops that will be held in the
state of New York. This project will develop partnerships between high school
teachers, ecologists, and pedagogy experts in an effort both to enable teachers
to experience the process of science and to implement effectively a
constructivist curriculum in their classrooms. Teacher and ecologist
participants will be selected from the three states in an effort to establish
long-term collaborations between these groups. Approximate cost-share for the
project is 3.5%.
