9553841 Greenberg Image processing has been shown to be a powerful medium for
engaging diverse learners, whose needs have not been met in the past, in the
study of science and mathematics. The technique is an effective and engaging way
to study the applications of science and mathematics to real-world situations as
represented by digital imagery. It brings science research to the classroom;
science is learned as science is done. Students and teachers are lead into
exploration, inquiry and analysis using real data sets and state-of-the-art
computer tools. These supplemental materials, useful in middle and high schools
are based on successful materials developed in teacher enhancement programs and
provide a context for changing traditional classroom structure to a learning
community. Teachers are supported by on-line services and a network of
professional development opportunities. Subject specific CDROMs are produced in
physics, biology and Earth science. The standards-based activities are designed
to meet specific learning goals and lead to creative student-generated products
for performance-based assessment of student achievement. Students also learn
about mathematical concepts that underlie image processing such as coordinate
systems, slope and intercept, measurement and statistics.
