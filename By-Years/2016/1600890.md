The PIs proposed to deploy 20 broadband seismic stations for one year in the
rupture zone of the Mw 8.3 Illapel, Chile earthquake. The instruments will
enable locating and characterizing thousands of aftershocks from the large
earthquake. This data can be used to better understand the Nazca-South America
plate interface as well as the processes behind the megathrust rupture and
postseismic activity. The ability to capture the high seismicity rate
immediately after the earthquake will enable both a finer picture of the
subduction structure, as well improve our understanding of seismic hazard in the
region.

The vigorous aftershock series now occurring in the wake of the 2015 Illapel,
Chile Earthquake provides a rare opportunity to study syuduction zone
segmentation, as delineated by adjacent megathrust ruptures. While the
aftershock seismicity rate is high, researchers can take advantage to illuminate
the Nazca and South American interplate interface, looking for evidence of
differences in slip regime as discernible from aftershock locations and
characteristics such as focal mechanisms, slip speed and spectral and
attenuation characteristics. The deployment will produce a high quality, open
access data set that will capture time-limited phenomena.
