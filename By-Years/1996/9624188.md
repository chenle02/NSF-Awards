9624188 Tsiotras This CAREER project integrates the research and educational
aspects of dynamics and control of nonlinear systems. Specifically, a special
class of nonlinear systems, namely those with rotating components is emphasized.
A wide variety of engineering systems such as aircrafts, robots, lathes, milling
machines, and underwater vehicles fall in this category. An in depth analysis of
the dynamics and kinematics of the chosen system is carried out including
effective modeling of system equations, stabilization and optimal control of
each subsystem, synthesis of individual controllers at the subsystem level into
a complete controller for the original system, and controller implementation
under actuator/sensor failure. The research results are verified experimentally
in the rotating machinery and controls(ROMAC)laboratory. The educational
activities include introduction of new courses at the undergraduate and graduate
levels, participation in a minority mentoring program, outreach activities at
local schools, and development of a dynamics and controls laboratory for both
research and teaching.***
