This action will provide funds for continued support for research in elementary
particle physics. Three faculty, two research associates and three graduate
students will continue their investigations of particle interactions at
Fermilab. There they will collaborate in the operation of a particle detector
just coming into operation (the D0 detector). They will study phenomena
associated with proton-antiproton collisions at the highest laboratory energies
currently available. Among their collaborators is a large number of other
investigators supported with National Science Foundation funds. The research
will contribute to our understanding of the "standard model" of elementary
particles, its and perhaps its limitations and domain of completeness.
