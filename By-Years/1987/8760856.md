Finite element methods (FEM) applied to computational fluid dynamics open up
the possibility of numerical simulation of highly complex fluid flows occurring
in industrial situations. The state-of-the-art limitation on the use of FEM is
computer resources: the method requires the solution of a very large system of
algebraic equations, currently effected by inverting the Jacobian matrix, a
process involving very high costs in computer time, IO and peripheral storage.
This research project aims to investigate and implement a new matrix-free
solution technique that obviate the costly matrix inversion; this technique is
based on a variant of the conjugate gradient method. Recent research and testing
on simple problems has indicated the prospect of a dramatic saving in costs.
Successful implementation in a FEM, fluid dynamics context will vastly expand
the range of flows (turbulent, non- Newtonian, three-dimensional) that can be
simulated with currently available hardware.
