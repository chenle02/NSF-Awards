Polynomial systems govern processes in many diverse fields ranging from computer
science to physics and economics to biology. The PI specializes in algebraic
geometry, the field which studies solutions of polynomial systems. Such systems
can often be simplified by varying the coefficients of the polynomials
appropriately. As a result, properties of a more complicated system can be
deduced from the simpler system. The PI will apply this principle to study the
geometry of spaces that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, namely moduli
spaces of vector bundles. Using a novel technique called Bridgeland stability,
the PI will investigate fundamental geometric properties of these spaces. The
results will have a wide range of applications in algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra, topology, and mathematical physics. The PI is also
dedicated to educating the next generation of mathematicians and building a
strong workforce in STEM in the US. Towards this goal, the PI actively
supervises numerous PhD students and postdocs, as well as high school students
and undergraduate students in related research. The grant will provide partial
support to the graduate students.

The moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces play a fundamental role in mathematics
and physics. They carry essential information about linear series and Chow
groups and are key players in Donaldson?s theory of four manifolds,
combinatorics, representation theory and mathematical physics. In the last
decade, Bridgeland stability has revolutionized our understanding of moduli
spaces of sheaves. Using this novel technique, the PI will advance understanding
of moduli spaces of sheaves. Specifically, the PI will compute the cohomology of
the general stable sheaf on a surface using Bridgeland stability and wall-
crossing. In cases where the generic cohomology is already understood, such as
minimal rational surfaces and K3 surfaces, the PI will initiate a systematic
study of the cohomology jumping loci and compute the cohomology of the tensor
product of two general stable sheaves. In addition, the PI aims to prove a
conjecture due to the PI and Woolf that states that the Betti numbers of the
moduli spaces of sheaves stabilize as the discriminant tends to infinity and the
stable Betti numbers are independent of the rank and polarization. Finally, the
PI will also study the stability of normal bundles of curves on algebraic
varieties with a view towards applications to hyperbolicity, Lang conjectures
and separable rational connectedness.
