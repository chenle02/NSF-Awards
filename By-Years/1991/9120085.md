This grant is intended to study the basic nonlinear physics of pure electron
plasmas in crossed-field amplifiers (CFAs) and in Micro-Field Emitter Arrays
(MFEAs). The study includes in situ measurements in the interaction region of a
low frequency (100- 200 MHz) CFA which has been designed specifically for making
such measurements. These include three-dimensional measurements of the electron
density, rf field, plasma potential, electron energy distribution functions, and
noise mechanisms using a variety of standard and newly developed diagnostic
probes. The study of MFEAs concerns the emission from vacuum field-emitters
which will have many innovative applications in electron devices such as the
CFA. This emerging technology also requires a study of the electron beam
dynamics in a very small scale which represents a new area of plasma research.
New miniature diagnostics will be developed for these studies. For the proposed
three year program, both the macro and micro aspects of pure electron plasmas
using the existing CFA and MFEAs as our experimental vehicles will be studied.
MFEAs will be further used in the CFA as a cathode and as a controllable
distributed emitting-sole in order to evaluate their effectiveness and to study
their effects on CFA physics.
