This three year mathematics project will develop and evaluate a model
professional development program for high school mathematics teachers from
twenty schools in three districts in the San Jose, California, area. The project
is designed to provide 80 teacher leaders with the knowledge, skills, and
understandings necessary to lead implementation of curriculum innovations in
their schools. Participants will be involved in three levels of summer
institutes and extensive academic year follow-up sessions that involve
leadership training, staff and peer coaching, demonstration lessons, micro-
teaching, reflection about teaching and learning mathematics, and development of
site-based Professional Development Centers. Participants will refresh and
enhance their content knowledge, teach and evaluate innovative curricula, work
to integrate technology into their teaching, and use analysis and application of
mathematics education research, reflective essays, journals, peer coaching,and
discussions to reflect on and broaden their beliefs about teaching and learning
mathematics. The participants will present inservice to other teachers and will
become coordinators of the Professional Development Centers, which will serve,
after the project ends, as the site for the school's ongoing program for staff
development and curricular and instructional change. Contributions by the
university and school districts will provide a cost share of approximately 39%.
