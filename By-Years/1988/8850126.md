This project will provide an exhilarating summer science experience for 30
American Indian students from the Four Corners region of the Southwest. High
school juniors, who rank in the upper thirty-three percent of their class and
have demonstrated science/math interest and aptitude, will participate in a
Young Scholars Program during the summer of 1988 at Northern Arizona University.
The project will cover several discipline areas including life, physical and
earth science, math and computer sciences, speech pathology and engineering. A
variety of experiences will be offered including hands-on laboratory
experiments, extensive personal interactions with research scientists, science
seminars, field trips and, motivational and public speaking workshops. Students
will live and eat on campus, matriculate with other students and attend classes
on career education, academic skills development and physical education. In the
second year, ten of the thirty students will participate in an extensive
research experience with select faculty members. These ten would also serve as
role models and "big brothers" and "big sisters" to incoming new (30)
participants.
