This project analyzes the function of rooms within architectural complexes at
the site of Pacatnamu, Peru in order to reconstruct the social organization of
the Chimu (A.D. 1000- 1400). The researcher will test two models that will
explain the extent and intensity of the integration of the culture on a
community, regional, and societal basis. Evidence for reconstructing social
organization is available to archaeologists from several sources. In this
project the researcher will use two independent sources of information-- formal
architectural analysis and study of access and context analysis of the artifacts
recovered during excavations--in a new and novel way in order to identify
artifact function and status indicators. The project thus promises to make
significant methodological contributions to the study of complex societies,
processes of social organization, and architecture.
