Everything about the world surrounding organisms is perceived through senses.
The sense of touch, or mechanosensitivity, is the ability to feel mechanical
force through skin. Like the other senses, mechanosensitivity is vital for all
aspects of everyday life in humans and other animals. It endows animals with the
capacity to feel and explore the infinite richness of the tactile world. It is
through mechanosensitivity that one perceives forces and textures that convey
information about material properties, confer pain or evoke pleasure. Yet of all
the senses that humans and other organisms possess, mechanosensitivity remains
the least well understood from the cellular and molecular perspective. Only a
very rudimentary understanding presently exists of how a breeze is felt and
confidently identified, or how it is distinguished from a gentle touch, a blunt
object or a mother's caress. This proposal seeks to shed light on the inner
workings of mechanosensitivity, and then to disseminate this knowledge to
schoolchildren. The results of this research will uncover fundamental principles
of mechanosensitivity in vertebrates at the cellular and molecular level, and
will be used further to incite interest in physiology in young
audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will approach its scientific goals
from an unconventional perspective: through studying mechanosensation in species
which have taken the sense of touch to the extreme - tactile foraging ducks. It
is well known that the ducks can find food in murky water relying almost
exclusively on the sense of touch in their bill and tongue. These organs are
richly innervated by mechanosensory nerve fibers, which originate in the
trigeminal ganglia and terminate in microorgans analogous to the mammalian
Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. The proposal focuses on uncovering the
molecular prerequisites that enable the mechanosensitive neurons to convert
mechanical force into electrical impulses, which then propagate to the brain
signaling a physical contact. To accomplish this, differential transcriptomics
will be employed to single out molecules that are enriched in the
mechanosensitive nerve fibers of tactile foraging birds. Each of the candidate
molecules will undergo electrophysiological tests for the ability to detect
mechanical contact. The end-goal of this proposal is to uncover the molecular
machinery through which neurons sense mechanical stimulation. These results,
along with other aspects of sensory physiology, will be made available to young
audiences through the Sensory Physiology Club - an extracurricular initiative
conceived by the researchers of this project to promote scientific education
among schoolchildren.
