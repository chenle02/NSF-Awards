EcoSim is a set of stand-alone software modules for Windows 95 personal
computers that will satisfy the needs of biologists for null models. "Null
models" are simulations that deliberately exclude a mechanism of interest, and
provide benchmark tests for patterns in nature. Initial funding from an NSF SGER
grant resulted in the development of a graphical user interface and the
prototypes for two modules of EcoSim. This project will expand EcoSim and
develop nine software modules to answer broad questions in community ecology.
Each module will contain a number of simulations and statistical tests that are
most appropriate for addressing the question. The modules will test patterns of
(1) species diversity, (2) niche overlap, (3) body size ratios, (4) co-
occurrence, (5) incidence functions, (6) species-area relationships, (7) range
overlap, (8) shared species, and (9) cluster formation. A tenth module will
allow the user to construct customized null model tests with a minimum of
programming. This tenth user-module will greatly expand the utility of EcoSim
for problems in population genetics, demography, and behavior. EcoSim is written
in Delphi, a high-level programming environment for Object Pascal. Data can be
easily imported and exported, provided full compatibility with other graphics
and statistics software. Pull-down menus, checkboxes, and a powerful data editor
allow users to select a variety of simulation options. Output is fully
documented and can be exported to text files. An extensive online Help system,
which includes a tutorial and sample data sets, guides users through the steps
of null model analysis. The expanded EcoSim will be demonstrated in seminars,
presentations, and workshops. As with the current version of the program, the
expanded EcoSim will be distributed free via the Internet.
