Abstract:

The PI proposes to study issues in Hamiltonian turbulence such as growth of
higher Sobolev norms in smooth solutions of Schroedinger equations. Considering
for instance the 2D defocusing cubic NLS with periodic boundary conditions, what
can one say about transition of energy to higher modes for large time? Only
power like upper bounds seem presently known. The PI proposes to explore
dynamical systems methods in this context.

In linear Schroedinger equations, things are better understood, partly due to
progress in quasi-periodic localization. For instance the PI established
recently the absence of chaotic diffusion for the quantum kicked rotor for small
kicks and almost all values of the parameters. He proposes here to study further
the problem of large kicks and estimating localization lengths.

Most partial differential equations studied by mathematicians originate from
Physics or elsewhere. They are supposed to model certain phenomena and their
relevance here is often confirmed numerically. But while this stage of
development from phenomenology to mathematical modeling is by most scientists
considered satisfactory, it is usually only the beginning of purely mathematical
exploration. The aim now is to study these equations rigorously as mathematical
objects, independently of any a priori assumptions, and to try to recover the
expected behaviour as mathematical theorems. On one hand, this line of thought
has in the past led to some of the great mathematical theories of modern days
(integrability, turbulence, etc.). But even so, much more challenges remain, as
well in the dissipative as conservative regime. The emphasis in this proposal
lies on diffusion in Hamiltonian equations, in particular the Schroedinger
equation.
