The main goal of the project is to develop embedded contact homology (ECH) and
its applications to three-dimensional contact geometry and four-dimensional
symplectic geometry. ECH has recently been used to obtain refinements of the
Weinstein conjecture in three dimensions, to prove the Arnold chord conjecture
in three dimensions, and to define "ECH capacities" which give new and sometimes
sharp obstructions to symplectic embeddings in four dimensions. One aim of the
project is to obtain further refinements of the Weinstein conjecture and chord
conjecture, giving better lower bounds on the numbers of Reeb orbits and Reeb
chords as well as additional qualitative and quantitative information about
them. Another part of the project is to study the recently introduced ECH
capacities in order to better understand when symplectic embeddings are
possible. A third part of the project is to prepare for future applications by
continuing to develop the foundations of ECH, in particular to develop cobordism
maps and TQFT structure, the sutured version, and the extension to stable
Hamiltonian structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The embedded contact homology
developed in this project provides a bridge between low-dimensional topology and
dynamics. Low-dimensional topology is concerned with the global structure of
curved spaces in three and four dimensions, while dynamics studies the
development of physical systems over time. Embedded contact homology encodes
deep topological information which can be used to obtain new concrete
information about dynamics, such as the existence of certain stable
configurations.
