We shall develop the tools for introducing genes into the plastid genome of
higher plants using Nicotiana tabacum, a suitable model species. Lack of plastid
transformation in higher plants has been due to problems of a large plastid
genome copy number in a cell, lack of appropriate selective markers, and an
effective way of DNA delivery. First, we shall transform wild-type plastids with
plastid 16S rRNA genes that confer resistance to antibiotics. Introduction of
DNA will be by bombardment with DNA-coated tungsten particles. Transformation
will result in gene replacement. Research will be extended to study the
requirements of inserting foreign DNA into the plastid genome. Oligonucleotide,
and gene- size segments of DNA will be linked to the selective markers.
Incorporation of oligonucleotides will be used to select suitable sites for gene
insertion. Larger segments of DNA will include chimeric genes. Involvement of
copy correction will be determined in the formation of stable transgenic plastid
genomes. Information derived from proposed research will make feasible the study
of plastid gene regulation and function in transgenic plants. This research will
develop a plastid transformation protocol for higher plants. This is a very
important tool for further genetic engineering of plants.
