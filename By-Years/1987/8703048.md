Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has become the primary analytical
tool in organic and bioorganic chemistry, and of major importance in inorganic
and biophysical chemistry as well. Acquisition of such sophisticated
instrumentation greatly increases the ability of a department to carry out front
line research. Recent advances in two-dimensional (2-D) NMR (COSEY and NOESY
techniques, etc.) have dramatically enhanced its application in these fields, in
spite of the fact that such experiments are very time-consuming. This award,
when coupled with an instrumentation award from NIH, will enable the acquisition
of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer capable of carrying out 2-D spectroscopy and other
techniques requiring state-of-the-art equipment and large blocks of time. The
instrument will also complement the present capabilities of the department and
maximize the overall utility of the present facility. Programs involved in
studies of organometallic chemistry, organic synthesis, biorganic synthesis and
bioorganic mechanisms will be enhanced by acquisition of the instrument.
