This award provides one-half of the funds required to assemble an alternating
field demagnetizing system. The equipment will be used by members of the
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis University for
laboratory investigations of paleomagnetism in geological samples. The
University will provide the remaining 50% match for the cost of the project. The
research in paleomagnetism that will utilize the new demagnetizing system
includes projects in ocean crust magnetization and investigations of the basic
causes of rock magnetism.
