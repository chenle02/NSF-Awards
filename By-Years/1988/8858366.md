C.V. Hollot's research interests are in the systems and control area. In
particular he is concerned with the performance evaluation and control of
uncertain dynamical systems; i.e., robust control. His objective is to develop
techniques which are non-conservative - techniques which ensure system
robustness without sacrificing system performance. To illustrate, consider a
robotic arm which handles payloads varying between one pound and a hundred
pounds. The payload is uncertain and a control law based upon a nominal payload
of one pound may perform poorly (perhaps become unstable) when lifting the one
hundred pound payload. One way to cope with this payload variation is to make
the robot arm massive - this helps minimize the relative impact of the payload.
However, this "margin of safety" comes at the expense of performance - increased
controller effort and reduced response time. Professor Hollot's research is
aimed at reducing such conservatism. He is developing analysis and design
techniques which exploit the complex manner in which uncertain parameters affect
the behavior of differential equations.
