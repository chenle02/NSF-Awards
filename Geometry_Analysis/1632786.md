This award supports participation by mathematicians from the United States in
the Sixth Workshop on Differential Geometry, which is being held near Cordoba,
Argentina, August 1-5, 2016. The workshop brings together experts from around
the world to present recent advances in differential geometry and to facilitate
further progress on major open problems. A series of minicourses will expose
participants to a broad spectrum of subdisciplines. The majority of the
researchers who will receive travel support through the award will be graduate
students, recent doctoral degree recipients, and members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics. The minicourses and research lectures, as well
as the opportunity to interact with participants from around the world, will
help to broaden and deepen the research trajectories of junior participants. The
workshop is the sixth in a series of workshops on differential geometry held in
the environs of Cordoba, Argentina. These workshops have facilitated very
fruitful and mutually beneficial collaborations between Argentine and U.S.
researchers.

The workshop will focus on applications of Lie transformation groups to several
central areas of differential geometry, including geometric flows and solitons,
holonomy and its applications, special geometric structures, and dynamics on
Riemannian manifolds. The workshop will foster the cross-fertilization of ideas
across these areas as well as facilitate new collaborations to advance research
in each of the individual areas. Minicourses will address Kahler geometry,
Yamabe invariants, calibrations and minimal volume submanifolds, Ricci solitons,
spectral geometry, and dynamical aspects of geodesics. Further information can
be found at the workshop web site: www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/egeo2016
