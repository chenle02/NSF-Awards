This research focuses on extending logic programming beyond first order logic.
One kind ofextension allows more kinds of clauses in the knowledge base. In
particular, indefinite clauses are allowed to exist in the knowledge base, and
processing strategies are developed so that inference takes not significantly
longer than a multiple of the time required in the case of definite clauses
only. A second extension permits the use of variables in place of predicate and
function symbols in definite clauses. The importance of this work is in
developing automatic program transformation and verification systems, and in
illuminating the fundamental processes required for logic programming in
knowledge based systems.
