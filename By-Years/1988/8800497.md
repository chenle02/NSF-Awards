This is a project to use statistical methods applied to multi-beam and wide-
beam data to investigate seamount distributions in the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans. The statistical methods have in large measure already been developed by
the PI and applied to several data sets from regions in the eastern Pacific. The
analyses will be extended to other regions in order to address scientific
questions relating to (1) seamount size distributions (e. g., what are
characteristic size-frequency distributions, what do these distributions tell
one about source bodies, magma production and mantle dynamics?); (2) seamount
shapes (e.g., how do shape parameters vary with size, geographical province,
ocean basin, etc., and what do shapes tell us about seamount construction?); (3)
mapping variations in seamount abundances and distributions (e.g., what is
relative importance of off-axis production, sediment cover, lithospheric
thickness, etc.?). This project should provide important new information on
seamount statistics and how those statistics can be used to develop on models of
seamount production and magmatic processes in the oceanic lithosphere and
asthenosphere.
