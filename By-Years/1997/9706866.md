9706866 McCormick The main thrust of the proposed research is the development of
efficient numerical techniques for simulation of a wide variety of physical
processes. Important applications include aerodynamics, meteorology, elasticity,
electromagnetics, porous media, and particle transport. The general goal is to
develop accurate discretization methods and fast algebraic solvers for the
partial differential equations that govern these and other applications. The
research topics include: multilevel first-order system least squares, which
involves reformulation of partial differential equations as well-posed
minimization principles to allow for robust and efficient solution methods;
porous media problems, which will be treated by Eulerian-Lagrangian localized
adjoint methods that have been successful for such multiparty and reactive
flows; transport phenomena, which will be simulated using efficient and robust
least-squares methods for the three-dimensional Boltzmann transport equations;
and iterative methods, which is aimed at developing effective algebraic solvers
for the equations that arise in many applications. The focus of this project is
research in the field of computational mathematics. The purpose is to improve
our understanding of the mathematics behind computer simulation of complex
physical phenomena. Such simulations are key to the study and control of many
important processes, including groundwater flow, global change, energy
production, and material science. One of the challenges in such simulations is
the development of improved mathematical methods for solving the equations that
arise in these models. The basic aim of this research is dramatic improvement in
our ability to model increasingly more complicated and sophisticated processes
with much greater accuracy and efficiency. This will pave the way for
simulations that can provide scientists, engineers, and policy-makers with much
more powerful tools to understand and improve our industry, science, and
environm ent.
