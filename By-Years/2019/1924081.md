This is a grant in partial support of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage
(CCUS). The aim of GRC-CCUS and GRS-CCUS is to create a forum for discussing the
latest scientific and technological efforts at the forefront of carbon
management encompassing the development of novel materials, integrated reaction
and transport pathways in natural and engineered environments, and the
implications of these developments for CCUS deployment at the process and field
scales. The emerging role of negative emissions technologies such as Direct Air
Capture and Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage in the context of carbon
management will be discussed. In this context, system-level assessments of the
role and potential of CCUS systems in decarbonizing electricity, transportation,
and heating networks is an integral aspect of this meeting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organization of the GRC Power Hour and the poster
sessions dedicated for scientific presentations by early career researchers,
postdoctoral research scientists and graduate students are intended to foster
engagement and the development of a future pipeline of talent capable of
handling emerging challenges in the area of CCUS. The interdisciplinary nature
and the openness of GRC/GRS format in terms of sharing unpublished data will
ensure the broader impacts of this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
