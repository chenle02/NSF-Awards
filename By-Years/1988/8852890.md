Funds are provided for equipment to improve an existing instructional plasma
dynamics laboratory. The first objective is to obtain the necessary equipment to
introduce several new experiments which are of current interest and relevance to
plasma science. The second objective is to modernize existing experiments. The
first objective will be met by obtaining equipment to be used in new experiments
which will demonstrate either new plasma diagnostics or modern uses for
traditional plasmas. Acquisition of a radio frequency generator will be used in
new plasma processing experiments on semiconductors and other materials. An
important laser-induced fluorescence diagnostic which gives information about
plasma chemistry will be implemented by acquiring a dye laser. The second
objective will be met by modernizing the existing experiments. A personal
computer (PC) with an analog to digital plug-in board will be used to digitally
acquire and store data from experiments. This PC will be used in conjunction
with several other new pieces of digital data acquisition equipment: a
spectrograph with a motorized grating for emission spectroscopy, a sweep voltage
supply for digital Langmuir probe measurements and a microwave sweep generator
for cavity perturbation (electron density) measurements. A turbo-molecular pump
will provide experience with modern vacuum technology.
