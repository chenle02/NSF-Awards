This award provides funds to the Northeast Missouri State University (NMSU)
Science Division to establish an NSF-REU program. During the summer of 1992
eight undergraduate students will be given financial support to allow them to
participate in an intensive, full-time research experience. As demonstration of
its strong commitment to undergraduate research, NMSU will provide a number of
commitments, including: clerical support, free on-campus room and board and a
waiver of tuition and fees for 3 college credits to student participants.
Students, 4 from NMSU and 4 from off-campus, and faculty mentors will form a
research team, focusing on the study of a single system: grass/fungi
endosymbioses. Students will be selected based on their research potential and
capability, their independence and motivation, and their professional goals.
Discussions between student and mentor will form the basis for matching students
to specific research areas. Students will work in research areas that range
widely from chemical analysis of fungal alkaloids, to ecological implications
for grasses of harboring a fungus, to effects of fungal alkaloids on insect and
mammalian consumers of the fungus. The central focus will integrate study at
different levels of biological organization and will help foster unity and
community among group members. The program includes several opportunities for
students to communicate about their work, including a required oral presentation
of their findings, and is aimed to develop project ownership by the student.
