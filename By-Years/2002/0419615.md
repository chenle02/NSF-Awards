Wild Arabidopsis strains are a rich source of natural genetic variation not
present in common laboratory strains. One way to exploit this variation is to
incorporate wild stocks into genetic mapping populations called Recombinant
Inbred Lines (RIL). These lines allow researchers to finely map all the plant
genes affecting any quantifiable trait. Mapping these Quantitative Trait Loci
(QTL) indicates how many genes affect a trait and how strongly each gene acts,
and places them on a genetic map. Mapping must precede the molecular
identification of the genes, a main goal of the Arabidopsis 2010 initiative.
Alan Lloyd's project will construct five new RIL populations (300 lines per
population, 200 markers per line). All will be publicly available from the
Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. Mapping data
will be on-line through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). The first
two sets of medium-density maps will be available in 2004, the last three in
2005. High density maps will be released in 2005 and
2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QTL analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana will contribute
to understanding the genetics of such crop traits as yield, disease resistance,
and drought tolerance. This research provides opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate students to learn modern biotechnology and creative thinking, and
undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to get first-hand lab
experience.&lt;br/&gt;
