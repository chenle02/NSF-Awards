The object of this program is to teach students the fundamentals of knowledge
based systems and artificial intelligence (AI) and then allow the students to
develop an expert system to demonstrate their skills. The students will
participate in an eight-week workshop at LSU. During the first four weeks they
will learn the fundamentals of AI. They will also participate in a seminar that
will introduce careers in agricultural and life sciences, ethics in science and
engineering, and research methodology. During the second half of the workshop,
the students will work with a faculty mentor to develop an expert system in one
of the agricultural or life sciences. The students will have the opportunity to
work in the LSU Knowledge Based System Development Laboratory utilizing state-
of-the-art AI workstations. The participants will choose from a wide array of
projects in the agricultural sciences. The expert system may be a diagnostic
tool, an identification guide, a trouble shooting program or an interpreter to a
simulation model. This approach to a young scholars program not only allows the
participants to work with scientists in a field of study, but they will also be
able to study decision making processes and learn the concepts of uncertainty in
decision making and logical steps in the process.
