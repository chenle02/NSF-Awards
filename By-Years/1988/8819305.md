Dr. Ohnishi is continuing to explore the relationship between the structure and
function of the redox components in biological electron and proton transfer
processes. Standard and advanced EPR techniques will be used in conjunction with
state-of-the-art genetic engineering. These multidisciplinary studies are
expected to enhanced the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the energy
transduction in the Site II region of the respiratory chain. During the past few
years a wealth of new information has been obtained from the study of
mitochondria, photosynthetic bacteria and chloroplasts cytochrome bc type
complexes leading to the consensus that all of these complexes function by some
type of quinone cycle mechanism. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of
proton and electron transfer is still not completely understood.***//
