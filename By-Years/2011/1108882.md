This project seeks to improve modeling of the final stages of planet formation
by probing how planetary orbits change over time due to two possible physical
causes: planet-planet gravitational scattering and tidal interactions.
Gravitational interactions between planets can induce significant orbital
changes, such as increased eccentricities, collisions between planets, and even
ejection of planets from the system. Orbits may be also altered due to tidal
forces between closer-in planets and their host star. Since the scattering and
tidal effects depend critically on the planetary masses involved, the PI will
also model the mass-frequency distribution of planetary systems. In particular,
he will study the relationship between the initial planetary mass function
(before scattering), and the observed planetary mass function of known planetary
systems. The PI's modeling effort will run a series of N-body simulations of the
gravitational interactions between planets, and tidal evolution to constrain how
well these effects can explain observations of known exoplanet orbits and their
current mass distributions. The PI will mentor undergraduate students in
research who are participating in the University of Washington's ''Pre-Major in
Astronomy Program.''
