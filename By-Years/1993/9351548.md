This project proposes adds state-of-the-art hardware and software to teach
computer-aided drafting/design, and computer- aided drafting/ computer-aided
manufacturing, enhancing the Drafting and Design programs at Western Iowa Tech
Community College. The equipment (hardware/software combination) proposed here
would enable the college faculty to develop tutorials on disk accompanied by
manuals for CADD/CAM instruction; to enhance efforts to train trainers...that
is, to provide training for instructors at the secondary and collegiate level
who in turn teach computer assisted drafting in a program of applied math and
science; to improve access to the handicapped and other special populations who
have the ability to compete successfully in drafting occupations but need
special equipment in order to keep pace with other students. To enable the
Drafting and Design department to be designated as a national beta test site for
CADD/CAM hardware and software manufacturers, which would not only enhance
learning opportunities for students, but also their employability. to provide
enrolled undergraduate students more efficient educational opportunities that
reflect the technological advances in industrial engineering technologies.
