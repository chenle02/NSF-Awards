The goal of this project is to develop new computational methods to study the
gravitational waves generated during the inspiral and merger of co-orbiting
black holes. The approach uses techniques for solving Einstein's equations which
have been recently developed in collaboration with computational mathematicians
and thoroughly calibrated on test problems. They have been implemented as a
community resource in the Einstein toolkit, which is used by the many research
groups involved in black hole simulations. The techniques will be further
developed to measure the loss of energy and angular momentum carried off by the
gravitational waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waves, such as water, sound and
electromagnetic waves, are a prominent feature of physical systems. A
revolutionary prediction of Einstein's gravitational theory is that accelerated
bodies produce gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges
produce electromagnetic waves. At present, gravitational waves have only been
detected indirectly by the way they deplete energy from two co-orbiting pulsars.
A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been constructed
that is expected to open up a new form of astronomy by direct detection of these
waves. The most powerful source of gravitational waves is the inspiral and
merger of two co-orbiting black holes. Computer simulations provide the
theoretical details necessary for LIGO to tune in on the gravitational signal
and monitor the dynamics of the merger.
