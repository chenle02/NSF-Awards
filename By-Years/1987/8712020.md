The snow on top of the Arctic pack ice is an important factor of the summer
climates in the northern high latitudes, with implications for the long-term
mass balance and stability of the ice and potential impact on other parts of the
world. Its state may also serve as an indicator of climatic change induced by
increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. This effort will focus
on production of a gridded ten-year data set of snow melt and surface albedo in
the Arctic Basin from DMSP satellite imagery. The project is important because
such a data base would be invaulable in scientific studies of the complex ice-
albedo feedback effects and may eventually lead to better formulation of such
processes in numerical models of the climate system.
