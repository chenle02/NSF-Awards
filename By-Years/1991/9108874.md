The country of Ghana possesses a long tradition of democratic political thought
vigorously defended by a small number of Ghana's most prominent families. When
Ghana achieved its independence from Britain, democracy was not established and
these families faced severe economic and political adversity. Nevertheless the
families survived and remain an influential force for democratic reform. This
doctoral dissertation research will undertake extensive field research in Ghana
in an attempt to understand how these families have survived in post
independence Ghana. Drawing upon theories of rational choice it will attempt to
understand the ways in which these individuals acted to advance both their
private and group interests, how they withstood the attacks by the government,
and what strategies they used. In addition to expanding our knowledge of African
politics, this study promises to increase our understanding of the relationship
between individual rights, egalitarianism, and economic development.
