This project focuses on the physical layer of digital
communication&lt;br/&gt;system design - in particular on the design of graph-
based error&lt;br/&gt;control coding techniques for noisy, fading channels, such
as those&lt;br/&gt;encountered in wireless communication systems. The
research&lt;br/&gt;addresses those issues that have made practical
implementation of&lt;br/&gt;graph-based coding techniques problematic. Those
issues include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of LDPC and turbo codes
with algebraic structure,&lt;br/&gt;suitable for high speed
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;The development of LDPC and turbo codes with moderate
block length,&lt;br/&gt;suitable for practical real-time
applications.&lt;br/&gt;The design of bandwidth efficient coded modulation
schemes&lt;br/&gt;incorporating these new code constructions in order to "fatten
the&lt;br/&gt;bit pipe" in high data rate applications.&lt;br/&gt;The adaptation
of these new coding schemes for use in the fading&lt;br/&gt;environment that
characterizes wireless channels.
