ABSTRACT CTS-9413838 Herbert Giescher The School of Ceramic Engineering and
Sciences will purchase powder and porosity characterization equipment dedicated
to supporting research and education at Alfred University. The equipment will be
used for several research projects, including: particle size characterization as
a means of studying and controlling the precipitation, synthesis, and
application of advanced submicron, nano-sized, ceramic powders; processing
properties of concentrated powder dispersions; and the analysis of pore
structure and porosity of consolidated compacts before and during the sintering
process. The instrumentation will also be used to enhance the educational
program through several hands-on laboratory classes. Future research interest is
moving towards smaller particle sizes. Preparation and processing of those
materials is very important for the development of the next generation of
advanced ceramic materials. The requested instrumentation will be necessary for
future research activities within the school, for collaboration with other
universities, and will be essential for an adequate education of students at the
New York State College of Ceramics.
