9706171 Creager This research is to analyze seismic phase data already gathered
that relate to anisotropy of the inner core and the structure of the lowermost
mantle. Earlier work was instrumental in the discovery of the anisotropy of the
inner core. Refinement of the structure with more data will allow more details
of the velocity structure to be seen and to investigate time-dependence of
models of motion of the inner core relative to the mantle. Refinement of
structure in the lowermost mantle will be done using a combination of core
seismic phases and ScS-S and sScS-sS differential times. ***
