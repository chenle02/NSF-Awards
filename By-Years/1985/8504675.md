Queueing theory and simulation have for some time provided the main analytical
tools in the study of discrete-event-dynamic systems (DEDS). Such systems evolve
in accordance with the occurrence of distinct events which occur at unknown,
irregular intervals and which are associated with a change in the state of the
process. Perturbation analysis has shown promise for overcoming some of the
limitations associated with both classical queueing theory and simulation
techniques. This approach adopts a dynamic system viewpoint of queueing networks
and essentially linearizes the state equations, characterizing them by
exploiting their discrete-event-driven nature. The aim of this research is to
investigate wider classes of queueing networks, where infinitesimal parametric
perturbations actually create finite queue length perturbations. This is the
case in networks with state dependent routing strategies used to provide
flexibility and enhance reliability. For a parametrized class of such dynamic
routing strategies, perturbation analysis will be used to optimize the strategy.
Validation of the results will be accomplished through the use of appropriate
simulation models. For simple queueing systems where closed-form results are
available, work will be done to develop analytical evaluation of the statistical
properties of perturbation analytic performance gradient estimates.
