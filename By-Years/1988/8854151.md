Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will operate a comprehen- sive course in
polymer chemistry for university faculty who may wish eventually to teach this
subject or to incorporate it into courses in analytical, organic, physical, or
biochemistry. The approach aims to overcome much of the reluctance to consider
polymer chemistry as an important aspect of undergraduate training in chemistry.
The four-week course will be composed of lectures, lecture demonstrations, and
laboratory experiments. In addition to preparing faculty to teach polymer
chemistry comfortably and enthusiastically, the course will encourage faculty to
consider supervising undergraduate research in polymer chemistry. In addition to
NSF funds, participants' institutions will contribute about 15% in travel costs
toward the cost of the project.
