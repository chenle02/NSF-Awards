The focus of this project will be a conference on the impact of the work of
Professor Hans Rademacher on recent mathematical research. The major topics of
this conference will include modular functions, additive number theory, and
Dedekind sums and analytic number theory. Rademacher's successful extension of
the circle method to obtain exact, convergent series representations for the
Fourier coefficients of modular forms of nonpositive weights (including the
important example p(n)) has provided the crucial step linking the results of the
number-theoretically oriented school to the developments initiated by
researchers using the perspectives of Riemann surface theory and function theory
and to the contemporary Eichler cohomology theory. His work on the more
combinatorial aspects of additive number theory is related to recent
developments, including the Garsia-Milne bijection for the Rogers-Ramanujan
identities, Baxter's solution of the Hard Hexagon Model, and Hickerson's proof
of the Mock Theta Conjectures. Finally, his work on Dedekind sums is related to
recent work on class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, values of zeta-
functions of real quadratic fields and totally real cubic fields at integral
arguments, random number generation, and others. This project will support the
Hans Rademacher Commemorative Conference to be held from July 21-25, 1992 at
Pennsylvania State University. The major topics of the conference are modular
functions, additive number theory, and Dedekind sums and analytic number theory.
The conference will include both invited talks and contributed paper sessions.
