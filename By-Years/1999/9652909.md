The Caltech Chemistry Animation Project combines the technical skills of
faculty and students at Caltech with Emmy-award winning sound editors, Oscar-
winning sound supervisors, Emmy-winning film editors, professional narrators,
film score writers, computer graphics personnel from the Hollywood special
effects industry, and advanced computer workstations to prepare instructional
materials that are being used worldwide, at the high school and college levels,
to allow students and teachers to understand better the fundamental concepts in
their chemical world. The initial stages of this project have been highly
successful, with distribution currently proceeding in five countries to
audiences in excess of one-half million students. The continuation of NSF
support allows the completion this project so that a series of approximately 10
video tapes, comprising a library of fundamental concepts in the chemical
sciences, can be provided to teachers and students worldwide. Specific topics to
be dealt with in upcoming video titles under the proposed project continuation
include: Atoms, Molecules, and Moles; Lewis Dot Structures and Bonding; Binary
Crystals; and Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution. These will complement the
existing video titles covering the topics of atomic orbitals, VSEPR, crystals,
stereochemistry, nucleophilic substitution, the Diels-Alder reaction, and will
also complement the soon-to-be-released videotapes on periodic trends,
hybridization and resonance, and molecular orbitals.
