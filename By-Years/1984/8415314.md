Some understanding has been gained on the role of submicron particle systems
both as a vehicle for magnetic separation and as the object of a separation
process. This project investigates new collection schemes and further develops
the theory of collection of systems utilizing fine particles (micron and
submicron-sized), either as a vehicle or in the collection process. Further
studies on the collection and especially the removal of particles in high
gradient magnetic separation are planned, covering the entire range of magnetic
properties from ferromagnetic to diamagnetic. Further development of a small
cell magnetic separator for diagnostic as well as analytical purposes which may
lead to medical and biological applications also are planned. The experimental
and analytical investigation of other magnetic separation methods such as
magnetic seeding will be carried on with strong emphasis on the underlying
science (interparticle forces including Van der Waals and electric double-layer
forces as well as magnetic forces).
