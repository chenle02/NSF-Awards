This study will help us understand the exchange of carbon dioxide and water
vapor between the biosphere and the atmosphere. We will explore factors
affecting the rates of gas exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) for
representative ecosystems in the southwestern US. We will determine if remote
sensing (optical and thermal measurement from a distance) can detect subtle
alterations in the rates of photosynthesis and respiration. This "breathing of
the planet" helps regulate our atmosphere and influences our climate, and is
further being affected by human impacts on the atmosphere and climate in ways
that are not yet fully understood. In addition to the science goals of
understanding terrestrial gas exchange, we will provide training opportunities
for undergraduate and master's students. Findings from the project will be made
available to the larger community using the internet, and can be used to help
validate data products emerging from new aircraft and satellite sensors.
