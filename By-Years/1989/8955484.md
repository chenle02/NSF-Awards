The Center for Excellence in Education will initiate a six-week
multidisciplinary residential Young Scholars project for 52 students in grades
10-12. The Research Science Institute (RSI), sponsored each summer by the Center
for Excellence in Education at a university on the East Coast, nurtures 50-70
academically talented high school students to pursue careers in science and
mathematics, and will be offered to more students in 1990 at a West Coast
university. The six-week intensive Institute includes one week of morning
classes by leading professors of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology;
as well as afternoon classes of research methodology, quantitative analysis, and
communicative skills by top high school teachers assisted by prior RSI
participants. Humanities classes concerning the philosophical and ethical issues
of science are also included. Four weeks are then devoted to one-on-one research
work in a laboratory setting with a scientist in each student's respective area
of interest. During the last week students present their papers orally to a
plenary session; final papers are published by the Center. Alumni activities
such as recommendations to colleges and universities, summer job opportunities,
and travel to foreign countries as Junior Ambassadors of Science continue
throughout the student's undergraduate and graduate careers.
