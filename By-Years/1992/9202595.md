The equilibrium phases and thermodynamic stabilities in transition metal
silicide systems of importance in micro electronics will be studied. The
titanium-silicon system will be investigated by high temperature knudsen cell
mass spectrometry, and the cobalt-silicon and copper-silicon systems will be
studied by means of high temperature solid state galvanic cells. Enthalpies of
reaction of metals with amorphour silicon in multilayer composites and
enthalpies of reaction of metals with crystalline silicon in bilayers will be
studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Heat capacities in all three
systems will be measured between 14K and 1000K by differential scanning
calorimetry in order to obtain standard molar entropies and other thermal
functions for the titanium, cobalt, and copper silicides. The titanium and
cobalt silicides are materials of choice for interconnect applications in micro
electronics. The results are expected to be of the importance in dealing with
questions of stability and compatibility in both the fabrication of devices and
in their use.
