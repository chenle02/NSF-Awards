This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to
implement a new computational method to study the properties of gravitational
waves generated by black holes. The approach uses techniques for solving
Einstein's equations which have been recently developed in collaboration with
computational mathematicians and tested on model problems. These techniques will
be further developed to serve as a community tool available to the many research
groups involved in the computer simulation of black holes
collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waves, such as water, sound and electromagnetic
waves, are a prominent feature of physical systems. A revolutionary prediction
of Einstein's gravitational theory is that accelerated masses produce
gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges produce
electromagnetic waves. Gravitational waves have only been detected indirectly by
the way they deplete energy from two co-orbiting pulsars. A Laser
Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has recently been constructed
that will potentially open up a new form of astronomy by directly detecting
these gravitational waves. Computer simulations of black hole collisions can
provide the theoretical details which are necessary for the LIGO observatory to
tune in on the gravitational signal and monitor the dynamics of the colliding
black holes.
