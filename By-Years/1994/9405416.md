campus networks to the midlevel network in West Virginia, WVNET, and from their
to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United
States. It will provide operations management and information services and it
will give Bethany College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The college has experienced a growth in auxiliary programs that has
added value to the basic mission that the college serves to aid the education of
all persons of all ages. The networking plan at Bethany College is the
foundation for uniting all the disciplines and campus groups.
