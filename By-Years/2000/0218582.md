Experiment Station&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient Decoherence Control
Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates general classes of
quantum error control codes and associated fault-tolerant operations to prevent
derailing of computations on a quantum computer due to decoherence effects. The
topics being explored in this project include i) the structure of nice error
bases, ii) extensions of stabilizer codes, iii) Clifford codes, iv) efficient
encoding, recovery, and decoding algorithms for quantum error control codes, and
v) methods for the realization of fault tolerant operations.&lt;br/&gt;
