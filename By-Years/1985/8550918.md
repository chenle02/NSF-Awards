This project will strengthen the mathematical background of teachers, grades
K-12, of the Commonwealth Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI). During the summer of
1986 there will be a 17-day workshop of problem- solving activities found in
general mathematics and elementary algebra textbooks. In the summer of 1987
there will be a 17-day workshop on general strategies for treating a variety of
problem-solving situations with participants constructing problem-solving
programs for their classrooms. The academic year following the summer workshop
will have classroom visitations by the staff from the Department of Education in
Saipan.
