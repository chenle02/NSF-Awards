This award to Andrew B. Bocarsly at Princeton University is jointly supported by
the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Research in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences. The proposal is concerned with the materials chemistry of cyanogels
which are novel transition metal cyanometallate coordination polymers that
undergo a sol-gel transition process when prepared in aqueous media. A typical
cyanogel prepared from tetrachloropalladate and hexacyanocobaltate contains 95%
water and is indefinitely stable. Other cyanogels based on platinum or tin and
cobalticyanide or ferricyanide will be synthesized and characterized. The goals
of the research are to characterize the cyanogel structure and stoichiometry, to
explore their thermal chemistry to produce solid-state materials as a function
of gel composition and to explore the application of derived solid-state
materials in the areas of materials science, catalysis and electrocatalysis.
Cyanogels are coordination polymers which will display novel solution and
mechanical properties. On heating, they will be converted to new alloys and
solid-state phases which may be ferromagnetic, conducting or serve as catalysts
for heterogenous hydrogenation and anodic oxidation of organic pollutants.
