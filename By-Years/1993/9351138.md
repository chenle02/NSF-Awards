9351138 Colvin A computer and demonstration classroom is being developed for use
in courses designed primarily for mathematics and mathematics education majors.
By developing an appreciation and excitement for using computers in abstract
algebra, linear algebra, combinatorics, and number theory courses these students
will be given the skills necessary to bring mathematics alive for them. The
classroom will be constructed to allow students, working in pairs, to use
computers and specialized software to enhance the instruction. Prospective
teachers completing this sequence of courses will be able to use computers in
classrooms and therefore be able to influence the movement towards the
introduction of technology into their classrooms. They will be able to observe
the benefits obtained from a computer based teaching environment. As teachers
they will be able to convey these benefits to their students and thereby
contribute to making mathematics come alive for the next generation. ***
