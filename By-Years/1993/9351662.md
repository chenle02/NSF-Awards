A Computational Chemistry Laboratory will be established for undergraduate
chemistry students at Hope College. Students will use this facility across the
chemistry curriculum and in undergraduate research. The facility will introduce
students to the rapidly evolving and enormously important area of computational
chemistry. Instruction in the organic, physical, and advanced chemistry courses
will be substantially enhanced through molecular mechanics calculations,
molecular orbital calculations, electron density maps, 3-D visualization of
steric and/or orbital overlap, reaction pathway calculations, infrared and
UV/VIS spectra calculations, and more. Wherever possible, calculations from the
Computational Chemistry Laboratory will be used to address questions arising
from measurements made in the experimental laboratories. Students participating
in Hope College's active undergraduate research program in chemistry will use
these powerful computational techniques to understand and interpret their
research results.
