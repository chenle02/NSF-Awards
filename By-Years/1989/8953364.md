Industry, university, and museum scientists and engineers will work with the
staff of the Sister Clara Muhammad School, a private, traditionally black K-8
school in Newark, New Jersey, to strengthen science teaching in all grades.
Staff development will be carried out throughout the academic year and in full-
time 2-week summer workshops. Partners with the school in the project include
the Center for Pre-College Programs at New Jersey Institute of Technology, AT&T
Networks Systems and Bell Laboratories, the New Jersey Marine Science
Consortium, and the Sci-Tech Center at Liberty State Park. The teachers and the
collaborating scientists and engineers will develop curricular models and
components to provide a unified, multi-year hands-on science program which will
be tied into the total school curriculum. Cost sharing by the partners will
total 90% of the National Science Foundation funding.
