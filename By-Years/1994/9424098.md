This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate researchers in
mathematics. The research at this site will come from some of the areas of
probability, operations research, number theory, partial differential equations,
and dynamics. The program will run for two months. There will be seminars twice
each week in which the students will present their work. Outside visitors will
also be asked to participate.
