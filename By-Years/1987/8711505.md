This project is an investigation of how iron oxyhydroxide reduction, organic-B
complexation, and biogenic opal dissolution will combine and interact in
sediment to produce observed boron concentrations patterns. The research will be
conducted in the laboratory where problems can be simplified by reducing the
number of variables that affect boron distribution. After conceptual models of
the control mechanisms have been developed the work will be extended to the
field. The initial experiments will consist of quantifying the effect on the
boron distribution as different solutes and solids are added to the sediment.
Three different types of sediment will be tested. The results will facilitate
the evaluation of boron as a paleo-environmental indicator, will advance
understanding of the behavior of boron and silicon in marine sediments, and will
improve calculations of carbonate equilibria.
