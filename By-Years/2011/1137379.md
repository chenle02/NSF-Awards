The project will examine the extent to which training science faculty members at
an HBCU community college (CC) in two teaching techniques (Reading
Apprenticeship and critical thinking skill development) and subsequently
supporting trained faculty through introductory science course redesign and
implementation will result in improved student learning outcomes, particularly
for minority students at the community college. The reading apprenticeship
pedagogy focusing on strengthening disciplinary science reading skills would
address the academic developmental needs of entering community college students
in west central Alabama, known as the Black Belt for the acute poverty,
inadequate public education, poor health, and high unemployment that exists in
the region. The critical thinking skill development pedagogy would change the
focus from simply covering science content at the community college to fill gaps
in student preparation to developing their critical thinking and reasoning to
improve students' problem solving ability. The project will contribute knowledge
on what are effective approaches in teaching science in an HBCU community
college specifically, and could generalize to other community colleges.
