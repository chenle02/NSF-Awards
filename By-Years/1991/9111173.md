Although Doppler weather radar systems have been used as research tools for many
years, they are just moving into operational use with the multi-agency federal
program called NEXRAD (Next Generation Weather Radar). Each of the 175 radars in
the NEXRAD network will be collecting data at the rate of several megabytes per
minute. Such large amounts of complex atmospheric data cannot be assimilated
without computerized analysis to reduce the data and make it more comprehensible
to the meteorologist. This project will utilize visualization techniques to
enhance the meteorologist's comprehension of the BVP kinematic analysis and its
relationship to the three-dimensional reflectivity structure. A system will be
built by combining scientific visualization techniques and single Doppler
kinematic analysis procedures for banded precipitation structures. The ultimate
goal of the project is to produce a model visualization environment to serve as
a powerful tool for atmospheric scientists studying the physics and dynamics of
precipitation systems.
