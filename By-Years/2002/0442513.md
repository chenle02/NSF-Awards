Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost all Formal Languages and
Automata (FLA) textbooks present theoretical material in a formal manner with
little visualization and no feedback. This project is developing an innovative
way of teaching FLA that uses the JFLAP instructional software tool to explore
abstract concepts while learning the formal theory. It is also evaluating
JFLAP's effectiveness through an extensive study. The goal is to show that when
using JFLAP in addition to the formal theory, students gain a better and deeper
understanding of FLA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The
material developed in this proposal is providing an interactive, discovery-based
approach to learning. Students can receive immediate feedback on problems, and
solve types of problems that are difficult to do with pencil and
paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This project is working
with 11 institutions, four of which are minority non-PhD granting institutions.
Its approach gives students a more hands-on approach to learning this
theoretical material. JFLAP lets faculty relate the more theoretical FLA course
to other computer science courses by addressing similar issues such as testing,
debugging, and run time analysis. Dissemination includes enhanced software, a
JFLAP user manual, a hands-on textbook, an online teacher's guide, papers, and
four faculty workshops at conferences.
