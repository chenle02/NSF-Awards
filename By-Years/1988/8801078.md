This research is concerned primarily with the combinatorics of convex
polytopes, including questions about barycentric subsivisions, facial
enumerations, and other combinatorial questions about the special classes of
k-simplicial and h- simplicial polytopes. Knowing how many faces there can be in
a polytope has turned out to be of interest to some computer scientists and
geometers. Such knowledge is important in finding convenient data structures for
storing geometric data and in analyzing the complexity of algorithms.
