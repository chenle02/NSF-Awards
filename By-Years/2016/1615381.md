Humanity faces significant grand challenges in the areas of energy, human
health, and environmental sustainability, and low temperature plasmas are at the
heart of many technologies promising to provide solutions for these grand
challenges. This award will provide support for students to participate in one
of the most important biennial conference series in the field of low temperature
plasmas, the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Plasma Processing Science to be
held July 24-29, 2016, at Proctor Academy, Andover, NH. The conference will
feature a comprehensive program that will highlight the most cutting edge
scientific advances in low temperature plasma science and will explore the
applications of low temperature plasma technology relative to many grand
societal challenges. Associated with the conference is a weekend-long Gordon
Research Seminar, which features attendance limited to graduate students and
post-doctoral associates, allowing for scientific interaction in a non-
threatening environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide
registration fee support for US students and postdocs to attend the conference
and the seminar. Seminar participation of 22 students and postdocs, and further
conference participation of 5 students and postdocs will be facilitated by this
award. The special format of the Gordon Conferences, with programmed discussion
sessions and ample time for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings,
will provide for a great learning environment for the students and postdocs, as
well as a fertile atmosphere of brainstorming and creative thinking for all of
the attendees.
