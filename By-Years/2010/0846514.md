0846514&lt;br/&gt;L. Ying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this
CAREER proposal is to apply compressed sensing, a new theoretical framework, to
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to revolutionize its imaging speed and enable
real-time imaging. The proposed research investigates various issues in
transforming the new mathematical theory into MRI practice and explores various
ideas to address these issues. Specifically, to meet the conditions required by
the compressed sensing theory, novel non-adaptive, non-Fourier encoding and
sampling techniques will be developed, novel sparse transformations will be
discovered to represent MR images most efficiently, and efficient and robust
nonlinear reconstruction algorithms will also be developed to recover the images
from sparsely sampled data. Integration with the existing fast MRI techniques
for maximal acceleration will also be studied. Furthermore, the proposed
research will evaluate performance by deriving theoretical bounds on speed
enhancements and carrying out simulation and experiments. Applications of the
developed techniques will be explored for various practical MR imaging problems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective of this proposal is to develop
an effective educational framework for systematic delivery of both basic
knowledge and new discoveries in biomedical imaging to a diverse body of
students, and create an infrastructure for resource sharing. The proposed
educational plan features a new biomedical imaging curriculum, activities to
integrate research and education with special efforts to increase women and
minority in engineering, and an open platform to disseminate results and share
resources in image reconstruction.
