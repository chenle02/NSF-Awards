The objectives are to characterize devices employing a single-electron charging
effect known as the Coulomb blockade effect and to investigate the potential for
applying this effect to the development of novel devices. The first phase of the
proposed study will develop devices on semiconductor heterostructures employing
two basic configurations and will characterize the conductance modulation and
current-voltage characteristics associated with Coulomb blockade effects in the
device. The experimental results will be compared with predicted trends in order
to validate the predictions and to evaluate the feasibility of proposals for
more advanced structures. The second phase of the study will investigate
advanced devices based on this effect. Devices based on several proposed
configurations will be developed and evaluated. Proposed transistors of this
type are expected to offer better gain and speed characteristics than
conventional devices and are expected to operate at more reasonable temperatures
and voltage levels than those required for mesoscopic structures.
