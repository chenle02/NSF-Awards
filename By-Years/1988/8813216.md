This proposal proposes to conduct a two-week Supercomputer Summer Institute in
August 1988. Attending would be 30 young researchers from across the U.S.,
including five researchers from SDSC industrial research partners. Review of
applications will be made by the SDSC Allocation Panel, a panel of computational
scientists which normally reviews applications for supercomputer resources at
the SDSC. Lectures and working sessions will give the students a strong
grounding in the practical techniques of supercomputer usage and expose them to
the wide range of research activities using supercomputing. Each student will
have a Macintosh workstation fo use during the Institute, as well as access to
more advanced graphics workstations from a variety of vendors, such as the Sun,
Apollo and Iris. The SDSC has conducted similar successful institutes in 1986
and 1987. Negotiations have reduced the budget from the $60,909 originally
proposed while retaining the proposal's quality. An award to the San Diego
Supercomputer Center for a 1988 Summer Institute is recommended in the amount of
$50,000.
