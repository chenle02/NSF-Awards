9509829 Cheer This project is on research to provide a foundation for the
detailed understanding of the three-dimensional fluid physics of pulsatile flows
with valves and moving walls in the region around the aortic valve and the
downstream ascending and descending aorta. Subsidiary objectives are: (1) to
produce a detailed map of shear stresses and analyze their effect on suspended
particles in the hart and large vessels, and (2) to do detailed modeling of the
flow pattern at the ostia (opening) of the coronary arteries which supply blood
to the heart muscle. ***
