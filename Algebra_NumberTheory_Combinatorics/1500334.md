Algebraic geometry provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces
(spaces of solutions of geometric problems) for interesting mathematical
objects. Once they are defined, there are natural compelling questions about
their geometry and topology. What do they look like? Are they irreducible,
connected, of what dimension? Are they smooth? if not, what singularities arise?
What structure is exhibited by their cohomology rings, and why should it be
geometrically expected? What are their equations? The investigator intends to
address many of these fundamental problems in a number of cases. The
investigator has a track record of sustained and serious effort both in outreach
to students at all levels (high school, undergraduate, and graduate), and in
building institutions in which algebraic geometry can grow. The investigator
will continue to attract graduate students into algebraic geometry and continue
to nurture the careers of graduate students, post-docs, and young researchers.
The investigator will also continue to work with large numbers of students at
the secondary and undergraduate levels, attracting students into the
mathematical sciences.

The investigator works in algebraic geometry, although his interests connect to
other areas of mathematics, including topology, combinatorics, physics (string
theory), number theory, and symplectic and differential geometry. This proposal,
continuing various strands of the investigator's work, deals with moduli spaces
and related notions in a variety of settings. In particular, the proposal deals
with a number of fundamental questions regarding the foundations of "tropical"
geometry, the stabilization of moduli spaces in the Grothendieck ring, the study
of K3 surfaces through elliptic fibrations, and the topology of various moduli
spaces of curves.
