9322225 Demas University of Virginia Dr. James N. Demas and other members of the
Chemistry Department of the University of Virginia are being supported for a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period
1994-6, twelve undergraduates will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of
chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique
feature will be the selecting of students from predominantly undergraduate
institutions and then inviting and subsidizing the visit of the student's
faculty mentor from their home institution to an REU symposium.
