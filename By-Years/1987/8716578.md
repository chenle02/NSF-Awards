The primary ofbjective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Evolutionary Influences of Dietary Cyanogens on Hemoglobin."
Support of the project will assist a well trained black, anthropologist to
improve her research capability and to complete the planning and development of
a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful, will
significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and
other research support.
