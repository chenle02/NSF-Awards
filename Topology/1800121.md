The 43rd Annual New York State Regional Graduate Mathematics Conference
(ANYSRGMC) will be held at Syracuse University on Saturday, March 24 2018. This
conference is an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and the
surrounding region to come together, share current research, and interact with
other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career.
Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future
mathematicians. At the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics
have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this will be the
first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable
opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the
broad range of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn
about other research going on in the region, as well be exposed to research in
areas of mathematics with which they are less familiar.

The ANYSRGMC is a one day conference, the majority of which consists of thirty
minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There will also be two
invited guest speakers, an opening address in the morning and a Keynote address
in the afternoon. The two speakers will be prominent mathematicians in two
distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the
graduate students attending the conference. The conference schedule, abstracts,
and other information related to the 43rd ANYSRGMC will be posted at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
