This SGER proposal investigates mechanisms of collective forgetting in the
aftermath of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee (FRC)
resolution to identify Ottoman killing of Armenians (1915-1917) a case of
"genocide". The theoretical context for the proposal is a larger program of
research that applies a cultural psychology perspective to the study of memory
and identity. Because people do not have direct memory of centuries-old events,
they necessarily construct a sense of collective identity via social
representations of history. However, prevailing representations of history are
not unbiased reflections of objectively recorded events, but instead constitute
celebratory constructions of the past that promote forgetting of collective
misdeeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of the study, the research
team will travel to Turkey to survey participants regarding experience of
Turkish identity, policy-relevant attitudes, and understanding of historical
events pertaining to the FRC resolution. Of particular interest will be the
relationship between national identification, use of interpretative denial
mechanisms (e.g., euphemistic naming) and endorsement of nationalistic policy.
The second phase will compare collective forgetting as a function of identity
relevance and representation of violence. The final phase involves a follow-up
study in Turkey to explore how collective forgetting operates over time. This
work contributes to the social, cognitive, and cultural understanding of memory
as a dynamic collective construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
