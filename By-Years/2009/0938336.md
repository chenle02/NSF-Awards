The College Board proposes to create a new Advanced Placement (AP) course - AP
Computer Science: Principles - that will focus on the principles and practices
of computing, preparing more students for a competitive 21st century workforce.
The new course will be consistent with the 2002 National Research Council
recommendation that AP courses "reflect what we know about how students learn;
build students' transferable, conceptual understanding and inquiry skills; and
convey the content and unifying concepts of a discipline." The course will be
engaging, accessible, inspiring, and rigorous. It is intended to foster a wider
appeal for the CS discipline and better prepare STEM majors. The College Board's
meticulous AP course development process, already proven and thoroughly vetted
in the NSF-funded redesign of several other AP science courses, will provide the
framework for developing the new course's curriculum. Specific deliverables of
the proposal will be: 1) the AP CS Principles course; 2) the design of course
pilots in both secondary and post-secondary settings; 3) implementation of the
pilots and curriculum evaluations; and 4) a suite of computer-based, prototype
assessment items.
