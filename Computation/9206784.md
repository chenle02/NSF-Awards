This grant supports the research of Professors C. Pomerance, Helmut Maier and
Andrew Granville to work on problems in analytic, computational, and additive
number theory. Professor Pomerance will continue to work on integer factoring
algorithms, in particular the number field sieve. Professor Maier will work on
the size of the coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials and irregularities in the
distribution of primes. Professor Granville will also work on the distributions
of the primes as well as sieve theory. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
