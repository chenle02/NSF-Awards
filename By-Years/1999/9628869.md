9628869 GRAHAM Land plants, like animals, begin life by forming embryos. Land
plant embryos, like many but not all animal embryos, develop while attached to a
parent from which they obtain food, especially sugars. The genetic mechanisms
associated with sugar transport are not well understood, especially in
morphologically simple plants such as bryophytes (mosses, liverworts,
hornworts), which have embryos, and charophycean green algae, which are closely
related to mosses but do not have embryos. In this study, Linda Graham and Lee
Wilcox will begin an evaluation of one set of genes, the hexose transporter gene
family, that are involved in sugar transport in plants. They will obtain
molecular sequence information from hexose transporter genes in charophycean
green algae. They will use these sequences to construct phylogenetic trees, and
compare these trees with others derived from sequences of different genes, and
from the morphological and anatomical features of the plants, seeking additional
support for the hypothesis that charophycean green algae and bryophytes are
closely related. They will seek support for the hypothesis that sugar transport
from parent plant to embryo is based in part upon hexose transporter gene
products (i.e., proteins) that are derived from plants without embryos
(charophycean green algae) but are specifically expressed at the junction
between parent plant and developing embryo in bryophytes. The results should
provide significant new information on the origin, early history, and
development of the land plant embryo, one of the most fundamentally important
events in the life history of land plants.
