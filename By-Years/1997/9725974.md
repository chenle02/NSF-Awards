9725974 McGillicuddy Coupled physical-biogeochemical models provide a useful
framework for testing our ideas about the underlying physical, biological and
chemical controls on elemental cycling in the ocean. Up to now, efforts to do so
on basin scales have produced mixed results. In this project, the investigators
will construct the first basin scale eddy-resolving biogeochemical simulations
of the North Atlantic to examine the impact of mesoscale processes on large
scale elemental budgets. A suite of experiments is planned what are based on 1'
(coarse), 1/3 (eddy-permitting) and 1/6' (eddy- resolving) CME simulations. The
coarse resolution runs will be used to benchmark the Sarmiento and Fasham
results, and serve as a control run for the higher resolution calculations.
Although the eddy-permitting case will most likely not be entirely sufficient
for a comprehensive study of mesoscale processes, it does represent a meaningful
intermediated step that will provide useful information without incurring the
substantial computational cost of the 1/6' runs. Understanding gained from these
experiments will be used to guide the development of parameterizations for
mesoscale biogeochemical processes to permit their inclusion in larger scale
(global) models.
