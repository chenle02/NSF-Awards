Title: Extremal and Probabilistic Graph Theory: Spectra, Subgraph Counts, and
Graph Sequences

In the past decade `global' questions, questions concerning classes and
sequences of graphs have come to the fore in graph theory. Hereditary properties
of graphs, sequences of dense and sparse graphs, classes of inhomogeneous random
graphs, graph algebras, families of supersaturated graphs, and spectra of
families of graphs have been studied by Alon, Chung, Borgs, Chayes, Lovasz,
Balogh, Morris, Bollobas, Razborov, Nikiforov, and Riordan, among many others.
The main goal of the present investigators is to develop spectral, analytical
and random techniques to attack some of the major open problems in these fields.
In particular, the investigators will focus on problems of convergent sequences
of sparse graphs, subgraph counts, and relations of spectra to the structure of
graphs and their classical invariants.

Graph theory is one of the youngest branches of mathematics and is still far
from maturity. Although it has been acquiring tools for decades, for much of its
progress it still has to rely on ingenious ad hoc methods. Any move that makes
the methods of well-established branches of mathematics relevant to major
problems of graph theory must be welcome. By showing how tools of classical
analysis and probability theory can be brought to bear on problems of graph
theory, the investigators will attempt to bring substantial areas of modern
graph theory into the fold of traditional mathematics. Most of these areas are
much studied by computer scientists as well, and have applications to networking
and the design and analysis of efficient algorithms.
