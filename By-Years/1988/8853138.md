The addition of two items for the central instrument facility: 1) a purge and
trap system, and 2) a high performance liquid chromatograph, provides full
support for the current instruction in the environmental sciences and
substantial support for an environmental engineering program. The additional
instruments augment those already available and provide all the major
instrumentation needed for up-to-date instruction in the environmental chemistry
component of the environmental programs. The augmented instrumentation supports
specified EPA methodology and the development of novel methods for environmental
analysis. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match
for the NSF award.
