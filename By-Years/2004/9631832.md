This GIG Award will provide additional NSF support for the advanced training of
postdoctoral visitors at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It will
provide funding for four new positions, bringing the program to a total of eight
postdoctoral visitors per year. New York University has committed itself to the
success of the program by making substantial cost sharing contributions. The
Courant Postdoctoral Program is now in its 39th year and continues to be the
starting point for many successful careers in the mathematical sciences. The
postdocs who choose to visist the Courant Institute benefit from the Institute's
large and high quality permanent faculty with specialties in overlapping area
throughout pure and applied mathematics, a tradition of interdisciplinary work
and collaborative research, and our unique location -- New York City. The
program involves intense collaborations between permanent faculty and postdocs,
in areas of research that span an unusually broad range of the mathematical
sciences, ranging from pure mathematics, to applied mathematics, to scientific
computation. Several recent enhancements of the program include an advanced
literature seminar, a yearly selection of special topics for a program of
interdisciplinary seminars and workshops, a systematic approach to mentoring,
and opportunities for interdisciplinary research and innovative teaching.
