The word magnetohydrodynamics derives from magneto-, meaning magnetic field,
hydro-, meaning water, and dynamics, meaning movement. It describes the
interaction of electrically-conducting fluids and electromagnetic fields. The
fundamental concept behind magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is that magnetic fields
can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the
fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself. Examples of such
fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, and salt water or electrolytes.
Applications of MHD play a role in many disciplines such as astrophysics,
engineering related to liquid metal, and controlled thermonuclear fusion. Due to
its significant role in applications, there have been many studies on the MHD
systems from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. Designing and analyzing
numerical methods to solve this system is in general a challenging task due to
the multi-physical nature of the problem. The aim of this project is to develop
novel numerical methods for solving MHD systems efficiently and accurately. The
project provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student
involvement in the research.

The governing equations of the MHD model display a nonlinear coupling between
the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and Maxwell's
equations of electromagnetism. With conventional numerical methods, the
approximation may converge to a "wrong'' solution when the exact solution has
singularities. In addition, for incompressible MHD models, both the velocity and
magnetic fields are divergence free, and numerical computations that do not
automatically preserve this property can suffer severe errors. This research
aims to design robust structure-preserving numerical methods for MHD equations
with high order convergent approximations for both smooth and nonsmooth domains.
To achieve this goal, the project employs hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin
methods (HDG) in view of their high order accuracy, easy implementation,
flexible meshing, and local structure preserving for physical moments, etc.
Because many applications require repeated simulations to obtain enough
statistical data, this research project will also develop state-of-the-art
ensemble HDG algorithms and will combine HDG schemes with other model reduction
techniques to further enhance efficiency for large scale computations.
