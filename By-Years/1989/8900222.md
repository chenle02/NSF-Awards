The Haystack Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, carries out
vigorous research programs in radio astronomy and atmospheric sciences, with its
unique facilities in Westford, MA. The Observatory is used by a large number of
researchers and students, nationally, primarily in graduate education. The
emphasis here is on a summer research opportunities program for undergraduates
as a continuation and expansion of the Principal Investigators' 1988 REU
programs. The PI requests funds for the support of nine students during 1989 and
1990. Research projects in radio astronomy and atmospheric sciences will be
supplemented by a series of weekly seminars, facility tours, meetings on
research discussions, and final report preparations and presentations. The
program is aimed at promoting in the students an appreciation for the full scope
of research functions in order to develop excitement in astronomical research
and to contribute to student interest in careers in science, engineering and
mathematics. It is hoped that the recruitment and selection processes will
encourage applications by women, minorities and handicapped students.
