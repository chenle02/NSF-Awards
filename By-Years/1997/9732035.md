*** 9732035 Dynes This grant will continue the support of an REU Site in the
Department of Physics at the University of California, San Diego. Applications
will be considered from students from colleges and universities nationwide.
Students will participate in an individual research project supervised by a
Physics Department faculty member. Students will be integrated into research
groups of their supervisors, giving them a first-hand view of research in an
academic setting. Student projects will include experimental, theoretical and
computational research in high energy physics, condensed matter physics,
biophysics, plasma physics, astrophysics, and nonlinear physics. The research
projects will be designed to lead students from a dependent research status to
one which will allow each student to become as independent as their research
skills and abilities permit. This activity is supported jointly by the NSF
Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research. ***
