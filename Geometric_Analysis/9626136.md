9626136 Corlette This proposal lies in the area of Kahler geometry. The geometry
of a quotient space of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle will be
studied; minimal Lagrangian surfaces in complex projective and quaternionic
spaces will be studied; the topology of geometrically finite quaternionic and
Cayley hyperbolic manifolds will be also be investigated. Kahler geometry is the
study of complex (sub-) manifolds equipped with a Kahler metric. A complex
manifold is a curved space which looks locally like a complex number space; a
Kahler metric then defines a distance function on the manifold compatible with
its complex structure. It should be mentioned that many difficult calculations
are possible only with the introduction of a complex strucure; a Kahler
structure makes it possible to interpret these calculations geometrically. This
is a very active area within the field of differential geometry with
applications to parts of modern physics.
