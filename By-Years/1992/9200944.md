Scientific findings are treated as more certain and less controversial as they
migrate downstream, that is, as they are interpreted and applied by actors
increasingly removed from the author's specialty area. Downstream actors can
include the press or the courts, who can present or apply originally tentative
findings as though they were engraved in stone. This process, however, can be
retraced. Broadly concerned with toxic health risks and more specifically
focusing on two case studies--the controversies linking spermicides and birth
defects and aspirin and Reye's Syndrome--this doctoral dissertation project,
will move "upstream," reconstructing authors' publication decisions. Open-ended
interviews with both case-study (7-10 principals for each case) and main sample
subjects (a snowball sample of 40 epidemiologists who have published studies
linking environmental exposures with toxicity in humans) will elicit information
about the actors' non-cognitive interests (that is, the social, economic, and
political stakes in the outcomes), considerations, and contingencies that attend
the decision to launch a new truth claim through publication. In addition, a
multi-tiered discourse and content analysis will explore responses of the
courts, the press, and the scientific community in the two case studies. This
project will contribute to the advancement of sociological knowledge about the
social construction of scientific facts, external influences on adherence to the
"norms of science," and the responsibilities of scientists for others' use of
their work. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
