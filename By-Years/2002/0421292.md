This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant support acquisition of a
millimeter wave vector network analyzer (MWVNA) tunable from 8 GHz to 1 THz and
associated microwave hardware to develop a method for non-contact laser
excitation and detection of ultrasonic waves in earth materials. The terahertz
network analyzer will complement existing laser and ultrasonics equipment in the
Physical Acoustics Laboratory in the Department of Geophysics at the Colorado
School of Mines. As part of this proposal, the PI's will try to extend recent
laboratory successes in imaging acoustic waves excited on the surfaces of
granite and aluminum slabs via laser to field applications using higher
frequency sources (100'a of GHz to 1 THz) and the acquired detection system. A
method of non-contact seismology is envisioned which could have broad
applications in the geosciences (e.g., imaging of highly polluted subsurface
environments), archaeology, and civil and military engineering (e.g., non-
contact detection of unexploded ordnance (UXO)).
