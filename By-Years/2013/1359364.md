This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the College of
William and Mary provides twelve undergraduate students each summer the
opportunity to participate in research on topics in atomic, molecular, and
optical physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear and particle physics,
theoretical physics, applied physics, and non-destructive evaluation. In
addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU
students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research
stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly
experience. By the end of the program, every student will have shared highlights
of the research through a weekly public blog, given two research presentations,
one of which is either a talk at the end of the program or a poster
presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader
impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to
help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from
groups underrepresented in physics. The project plans to be informed by an on-
going evaluation, which examines clear goals.
