The economically important genus Sebastes, containing the rockfishes, includes
nearly 100 species worldwide and is the largest genus of marine fishes in the
eastern North Pacific. The phylogenetic relationships among members of one
subgenus of Sebastes, Pteropodus, will be studied using allozyme analysis and
restrictiion fragment length polymorphisms of mitochondrial DNA. Additionally,
preliminary data indicate that two species of the subgenus, S. caurinus and S.
auriculatus, hybridize in areas of Puget Sound, Washington, a rare occurrence
among marine fishes. The geographic extent of the hybridization and the
parentage of the hybrids will also be investigated.
