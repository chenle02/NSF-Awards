An NSF proposal writing workshop will be held on June 4, 2017, at the University
of Southern California. The workshop will be collocated with the 45th SME North
American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) and the ASME Manufacturing
Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2017). The workshop aims to aid future
NSF proposal submitters in communicating clear research objectives and improving
proposal quality. Interactions during the workshop will help build meaningful
collaborations. This will positively affect the attendees, academic career and,
subsequently, will help develop the nation's human resources. Additionally, when
proposals are well written, the reviews tend to be more consistent and NSF panel
meetings are more efficient.

Major activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program
directors, breakout sessions to discuss example research objectives, a group
question/answer period, and a conclusions session. Professors and graduate
students from across the US will be invited to attend the workshop. Participants
will learn guidelines for writing a quality NSF proposal with an emphasis on the
research objective.
