Systematic studies of tourmaline are proposed to extend the utility of this
mineral as a petrogenetic indicator in a wide range of metamorphic rocks. Field-
related studies will be conducted on samples from NW Maine where the PIs have
already characterized conditions of metamorphism. Specific goals include: (1)
assessment of compositional relations between tourmaline rims and bulk rocks,
mineral assemblage, and T, (2) relations between metamorphic history and
tourmaline zoning patterns, (3) utilization of compositions of detrital
tourmalines to indicate sedimentary provenance, and (4) relations of
compositions of authigenic tourmalines and diagenetic fluids. These studies will
also lead to a better understanding of the crystal chemistry of tourmalines,
geochemical cycles of B, and metamorphic processes.
