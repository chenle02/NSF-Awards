9631237 Grizzle This proposal describes basic research in the modeling, analysis
and control of advanced technology, spark ignition engines. The goal of the
research is to develop, adapt and apply system theoretic notions to the problem
of reducing emissions in automobile engines while meeting performance and
drivability requirements. Federal regulations are driving the development of
advanced engine technology to meet the ever increasing demands for lower
emissions. These engines are fundamentally described by nonlinear, hybrid (mixed
continuous and discrete time) mathematical models, and require sophisticated
control systems for their proper functioning. The PI will partner with engineers
at Ford in order to have access to engine dynamometers for collecting the data
required to construct and validate the engine models, and for evaluating modern,
model-based feedback design concepts. This is a unique university-industry
cooperative research arrangement for developing and applying advanced system
theory and control methods to problems important to society. ***
