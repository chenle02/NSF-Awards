&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative
idea for reformulating the standard linear programming problem by taking into
account more realistic scenarios from market economics is being considered in
this proposal. The standard linear programming formulation of resource
allocation problem assumes that the cost of a commodity is independent of the
level of production. As one knows this is not the case in reality. By making the
cost a function of the production, the PI formulates the problem in more general
terms. However, under some natural but simplifying assumptions (which are
somewhat technical to describe) on the nature of the cost function, the solution
complexity of the problem turns out to be lower than the worst case complexity
of the solution to the standard linear programming problem. In fact, there are
indications that an O(n^2) solution can be obtained in this nonstandard
formulation by the PI. This is paradoxical in some sense (that a more general
problem has a simpler solution!), but apparently not so because for the LP
formulation the geometry of the feasible set is a polytope, whereas its is a
much simpler region under the new formulation of the problem. Also, the new
formulation has close ties with the theory of n- person
games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
