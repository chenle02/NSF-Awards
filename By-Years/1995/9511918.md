9511918 Ash As a result of Nazi racist policies, some of the most important
psychologists in Germany and Austria were among the thousands of German-speaking
academics and professionals forced to leave their positions and seek new lives,
mainly in Britain and the United States, during the 1930s. Dr. Ash is examining
what impact this forced migration had on the scientific and professional work of
these psychologists, and how they interacted with the scientific and
professional norms prevailing in the places to which they went. He aims to
combine collective studies of migr psychologists' career patterns with detailed
studies of scientific and professional change among individuals and groups to
arrive at an overview of migr s' roles in shaping -- and being shaped by -- a
changing discipline. The project includes broad-based social-historical analysis
of the migr s as a group with fine-grained studies of scientific changed in
leading schools of psychological thought and research. He is addressing such
issues as the support system available to the migr s and the priorities
governing such support; the transfer not only of theories, but also of modes of
scientific practice and the creation of new research and professional styles;
the role of migr s in the emergence of clinical psychology; and the ways in
which, for many migr s, scientific discourse became a medium for converting
personal experiences of loss into theoretical innovation.
