9312239 Maccini Inventory fluctuations are an important feature of business
cycles. Yet inventory research is in a very unsettled state. This research will
focus on two important unsettled issues. One is whether cost shocks in the form
of significant price increases of important inputs in the production process
together with the need to hold buffer stocks can explain inventory and
production movements. Existing work has concentrated on a small set of
manufacturing industries and solely on finished goods inventories. This research
focuses on examining production to order as well as production to stock and
investigates the interaction of order backlogs and inventories. Further, it will
examine the interaction of movements in inventories of materials and supplies
with those of finished goods. The second issue to be analyzed is how do credit
market conditions influence inventory movements. This is critical for
understanding how monetary policy affects the economy. The research focuses on
whether borrowing constraints brought about by imperfections in the credit
markets causes certain firms to have limited access to credit which in turn
influences their pattern of inventory holding behavior. A data base for
individual firms which combines data on financial condition with that on
inventories and sales will also be constructed and used. ***
