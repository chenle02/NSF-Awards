9520968 Luyanda The NASTO `995 Conference of the Northeast Association of State
Transportation Officials will be held in Puerto Rico on July 1995 with the
participation of ministers and secretaries of transportation of the Americas.
The conference will present a research-oriented conference-workshop within the
context of NASTO `95. The invited speakers will discuss current research
projects, discuss the state-of-practice in their respective countries and
institutions, and share knowledge about the impact that transportation issues
have had in their particular setting. The interaction amongst the researcher,
and between them and the policy makers and their technical staff, all from
different countries and backgrounds but facing similar problems, will allow
useful exchanges of information, help to set meaningful research priorities, and
stimulate collaborative projects. The papers presented, the formal and informal
discussions, and the resulting proceedings will provide an excellent technology
transfer mechanism. The event will provide a valuable opportunity to strengthen
ties and establish new connections between participants from North and South
America. The conference will also directly benefit students from the University
of Puerto Rico, who will have an opportunity to learn from the presentations and
interact with the participants. ***
