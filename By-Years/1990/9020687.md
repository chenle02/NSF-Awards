This project will continue the measurement and recording of radio waves at
Palmer Station, Antarctica. The principal experiment involves the monitoring of
transmissions from distant very low frequency (VLF) transmitters, and using
variations in the amplitude and phase of the received signal to deduce changes
in the properties of the atmosphere along the great circle route between the
receiver and transmitter. In particular, lightning strokes produce waves that
can penetrate into the magnetosphere where they interact with energetic
electrons in the van Allen radiation belts. Some of these particles can be
precipitated into the upper atmosphere where they cause a sudden change in the
conductivity, and therefore a perturbation in any radio wave that may be
propagating through that part of the atmosphere. Thus, the monitoring of the
transmitter signals can be used to map out lightning induced atmospheric
disturbances that are thousands of kilometers away. The investigators will also
operate equipment that will monitor natural sources of radio waves, such as the
sferics produced by lightning. Stanford University and the principal
investigator are leaders in research on very low frequency radio waves and their
interaction with the geospace environment.
