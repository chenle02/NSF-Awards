Dr. Larry W. Beck has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Beck received the doctoral degree from Texas A & M University
under the supervision of Professor James F. Haw. Dr. Beck will continue research
at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor
Mark E. Davis. The postdoctoral research will focus on the synthesis and
characterization of new catalytic/molecular-sieve materials. Work includes the
design of an alkali-free synthesis for zeolite ZSM-18 using a novel
triquaternary amine compound as the template, as well as the synthesis of a
combinatorial array of metal oxide compositions followed by characterization of
the acid/base properties. The work leads to new understanding of the materials
chemistry underlying heterogeneous catalysis. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
