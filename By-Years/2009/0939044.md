The purpose of the "Western Conference in Mathematical Finance, Santa Barbara,
CA 2009" is to bring together promising young specialists and eminent
researchers working in the area of mathematical finance, to encourage new
collaborations and allow for active exchange of ideas through informal
discussions. The WCMF is a self-organized effort to promote the financial
mathematics community on the West Coast. More importantly, the conference will
aid career development of young researchers, including graduate students, new
Ph.D.'s, and recent entrants to the field by providing them with a venue to
present their work, pose new research problems and interact with more senior
colleagues in an informal atmosphere. For this purpose, the majority of the
budget is allocated to provide travel support to a number of junior
participants. The workshop will expose participants to new directions of
research, including topical subjects in regulatory risk management,
environmental financial innovations and crisis modeling. Addressing these issues
is especially relevant and urgent in light of the ongoing financial
perturbations.
