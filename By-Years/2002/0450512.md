This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
novel instrumentation based on electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled with mass
spectrometry for identifying and quantifying chemical species in liquid-phase
samples in the field. The goal of this project is to employ an existing Minotaur
miniature mass spectrometer (MS) to develop a portable, easy-to-operate detector
that will provide real-time and highly sensitive detection of a broad range of
chemical compounds in liquid samples in the field. The objectives of the
research are to construct, integrate, and optimize an innovative miniature ESI
source into the instrument to receive liquid samples and introduce the target
analytes to the detector, while minimizing interference from background matrix
constituents, and to fully develop and qualify the analytical characteristics
and ease-of-use of the instrument during field operations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially this development of the first field portable,
miniaturized ESI-mass spectrometer will have commercial applications in several
governmental and commercial sectors, and has the potential to impact society
broadly by providing improved monitoring of water resources and protection of
the public from chemical exposure resulting from hazardous material accidents or
acts of terrorism. If successful, this research will lead directly to
developments allowing for determination of compounds of biological origin, e.g.
biomarkers, which will provide additional dimensions of information as to the
content of analytical samples.&lt;br/&gt;
