This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of organic chemistry. Dr. Cynthia K. McClure of the Chemistry Department of
the University of Delaware will explore two different methods for the synthesis
of the nitrogen heterocyclic substructures of alkaloids. One method is the
photochemical oxa-di-pi-methane rearrangement of amides and other nitrogen-
containing compounds to produce pyrrolizidine and indolizidine alkaloid
skeletons. The second method involves the addition of radicals to the nitrogen
of imidate esters to form a new carbon-nitrogen bond under non-ionic conditions.
If successful, these methods could be used in the total synthesis of
biologically active alkaloids and their analogs and a proposal for sustained
study in that area could be developed.
