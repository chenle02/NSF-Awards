HDR-9353136 Garza, Ray, Berriozabal, Manuel, Borman, Christopher and Valdez,
Jude University of Texas San Antonio, TX "San Antonio Comprehensive Regional
Center for Minorities" The San Antonio Comprehensive Regional Center for
Minorities proposes a comprehensive set of student enhancement programs, student
support initiatives, teacher development activities which will be articulated
across all grade levels from Kindergarten to 12th grade. In cooperation with
four school districts in San Antonio, Texas with more than 98,000 students of
whom 92% are Hispanic, the San Antonio CRCM seeks to facilitate systemic change
in the education system which currently enables less than 1% of the Hispanic
student population to earn a STEM B.S. degree and less than 0.05% of the
Hispanic student population to earn a STEM Ph.D. The San Antonio CRCM will offer
activities which will address the need to: 1. Create expectations for all
minority students that they will aspire to attend college and will succeed in
college. 2. Increase teachers' awareness of elements of the Hispanic culture
which cause Hispanic boys and girls to find competitiveness to be aversive, and
which places value of family closeness over educational opportunities. 3.
Provide student counseling and other student support services. 4. Improve
teacher knowledge and teaching skills in mathematics and the sciences. 5.
Improve course content, including course curricula and curriculum materials, to
enable minority students to learn the mathematical and scientific skills and
concepts necessary to compete and achieve in college STEM degree programs.
