This project builds on Phase I of the Interactive Mathematics Project. A new
three-year high school mathematics curriculum, which embodies the NCTM Standards
was developed, pilot tested, and two years field tested with diverse populations
during Phase I. This new secondary mathematics curriculum eliminates tracking
compleely and has proven to be effective with all students at all students at
all levels. Phase II builds on the work of Phase I by developing a fourth year
curriculum; reexamining and then revising all three years with the goal of
improving continuity; writing supplementary materials to allow greater teacher
flexibility in meeting the wide range of student needs; conducting a thorough
evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum; assessing the various models
of teacher inservice; and disseminating the program widely through large
regional centers.
