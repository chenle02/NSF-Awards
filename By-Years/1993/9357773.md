9357773 Yip The object of this NYI Grant is to develop a category of intelligent
computational tools for scientists and engineers. Given a high-level
specification of a physical problem in terms of nonlinear partial differential
equations, these tools will be able to automatically: (1) simplify that
equations by asymptotic techniques, (2) prepare numerical simulation experiments
for the simplified model, (3) monitor and control the experiments, (4) interpret
the results in high-level terms, and (5) derive qualitative predictions form the
model by approximate analytical methods. ***
