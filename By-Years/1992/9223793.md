The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will undertake an instru- mentation
development project to further advance the use of flow cytometry for ocean
science research purposes. Flow cytometers were originally developed for the
biomedical research community. Flow cytometers have developed into effective
tools for biological oceanographic research, by rapidly providing information on
samples containing particles as small as marine bacteria to large single- celled
phytoplankton. This work will bring several unique capabilities to flow
cytometric analysis of pelagic ecosystems: synoptic analysis (light scatter,
abundance, and autofluorescence of plankton ranging from 0.3 to 100 microns in
diameter); detailed analysis of light scatter signals through digital signal
processing; and advanced, real-time neural-network analysis of population
parameters. These enhanced capabilities will facilitate process studies by
population ecologists and they will contribute to the development of remote
sensing algorithms.
