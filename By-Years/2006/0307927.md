The Exploratorium will develop an exhibit focusing on three areas of mental
activity that process perceptions and enable human action: attention, emotion
and judgment. Developers will create 32 new interactive exhibits and rebuild six
to eight old ones to be part of the museum's permanent collection. The
Exploratorium will develop a new area in the museum dedicated to exploring the
processes of the human mind and brain, experiment with new ways of creating
meaningful mind experiences for visitors and help establish a sense of
collective experimentation among science centers in neuroscience and psychology
exhibits and programming.&lt;br/&gt;
