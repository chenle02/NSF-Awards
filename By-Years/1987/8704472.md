This research will focus on two problems in real algebraic geometry, namely the
Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture of 1956 and Delzell's conjecture. The first would
show that every continuous piecewise-polynomial function from real n-space into
the reals is a pointwise supremum of infima of finitely many polynomials. The
second would improve Delzell's continuous solution of Hilbert's 17th problem on
sums of squares. This research is in the general area of real algebraic
geometry. This is an area which is of basic importance to pure mathematics. In
addition, this field has an interface with robotics and consequently, will have
a positive impact on theoretical robotics, science and engineering.
