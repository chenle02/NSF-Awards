Their study will be directed on the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). The
study concentrates on (1) probing the ground states, (2) detecting quasi-
particle excitations, and (3) testing recent theoretical ideas on scaling of the
FQHE. They include experiments of (1) measuring shear modulus of the electron
fluid, (2) FQHE in higher Landau levels, (3) modifying the ground state, (4)
tunneling into the FQH states, (5) shot noise mesurement, and (6) measurement of
temperature and rf frequency dependences.
