This award supports the research of Professor J. Harris to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on the dimension of the parameter space of curves, the
theory of branched covers, Hilbert functions of points in uniform position and
an algebraic approach to the cohomology of moduli spaces. The research is in the
field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved
problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined
in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field
uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
