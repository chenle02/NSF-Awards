This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in materials
science between Kenneth R. Shull at Northwestern University and Constantino
Creton at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, Paris,
France. They will investigate the molecular and microscopic mechanisms
responsible for adhesion between a polymer melt and a solid surface. The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the thermodynamics o
polymer surfaces and synthesis of materials. This is complemented by French
experience in deformation mechanisms in polymers and in molecular structure
analysis.
