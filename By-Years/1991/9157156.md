The research addresses problems in mechanism theory, and focuses on (a)
kinematics, dynamics and design of closed chain mechanisms, (b) dynamic control
of multiple cooperating robotic systems and (c) autonomous manipulation and
locomotion in unstructured environments. The first topic is further divided into
three thrust areas including (1) control of a three degree of freedom pneumatic
wrist ankle joint capable of sustaining impacts and accommodating constraints,
(2) design of cable spring transmissions, and (3) synthesis of closed loop
parallel drive linkages for special purpose robots in manufacturing. The second
topic, coordination of multiple robots, addresses the simultaneous control of
trajectory and constraint forces. Specifically, the research problems are the
control of contact conditions, modeling and control of contact interactions when
compliant skins are used, and experimental validation of the models and
algorithms by using a test bed comprising two arms and objects that are larger
than the end effectors. The third research topic on coordination focuses on (1)
using compliant models for the locomotor terrain system to solve the force
distribution and traction optimization problem, (2) developing measures of
stability for locomotion on undulating terrain under dynamic loading, and (3)
establishing optimal foothold sequences and gait control schemes for dynamically
stable walking machines.
