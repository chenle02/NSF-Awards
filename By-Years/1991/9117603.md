Most organisms live in worlds that are spatially structured. The purpose of
this grant is to use dynamic, state variable models (which couple environmental
and physiological parameters in a consistent manner) to study spatial and multi-
trophic level aspects of insect-plant and host-parasitoid interactions. In the
course of this work, three main goals will be achieved. First, the methodology
of dynamic state variable modeling will be extended to include spatial
structure. Second, such extended models will be used to determine how the
descriptions of how populations change over space or time arise from individual
behavior. Third, the predictions of the theory will be tested using a three
trophic level system consisting of a plant, a fruit fly that attacks the seeds
of the plant, and a wasp that attacks the fruit fly. The experimental system
chosen uses a fly that is closely related to the apple maggot fly, so that
insights learned in this work may have important applied implications in pest
control. The combination of experiment and theory is ideal for the development
of new and important insights into behavioral evolutionary ecology.
