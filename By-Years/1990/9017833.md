The goal of ths research is to use nobel gases to constrain thenature and
origin of mantle heterogeneities. The controversy regarding the extent to which
helium isotopes are decoupled from the other isotopic tracers by magma chamber
proceses will be tested by measurements of He/(Th+U) ratios and by measurements
of He,Sr,Nd, and Pb isotopes in the same samples. The research will help
constrain the origin of the variability on different time and length scales, and
also resolve some of the controversy regarding the interpretation of low 3He/4He
ratios in oceanic rocks. New measurements will be made on samples from ocean
islands and ridges that are geologically well constrained.
