This Research Initiation Award will initiate development of an experimental
program to enable quantitative evaluation of the full, two-dimensional kinematic
fields within a complex viscoelastic flow. A video-based particle-tracking
technique referred to as Digital Particle Image Velocimetry is used which
employs high resolution monochrome CCD cameras and fast digital signal
processing algorithms to eliminate the time-consuming photographic and
optomechanical steps associated with conventional particle-imaging
methodologies. The apparatus will be used in detailed studies of the flow
instabilities that develop during the slow flow of highly viscoelastic materials
through model geometries that are characteristic of typical industrial
processes.
