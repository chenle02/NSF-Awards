&lt;br/&gt;EIA-0204464&lt;br/&gt;Rosenbloom, Joshua L., Ash, Ronald
A.&lt;br/&gt;University of Kansas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Characteristics
and Career Paths of Current IT Workers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award provides support for a study that will identify important decision points
in the educational and work experiences of Information Technology (IT) workers
that have led them to enter and remain in the IT workforce. The results of this
study will document the normal patterns of entry and retention in the IT
workforce to provide a baseline to examine the special problems of women and
minorities who are greatly underrepresented in this expanding and lucrative
sector of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a survey of both current IT
and non-IT workers in the greater Kansas City area, the project will gather data
on individual personality traits in conjunction with detailed family background,
and educational and work histories. These data will in turn be used to identify
aspects of attitudes, family background, and educational and work experiences
that have influenced individual decisions to enter IT jobs, as well as to remain
in (or exit from) them. Among IT workers the same data will be used to explore
differences by sex, and race and ethnicity. The results will illuminate both the
similarities between IT and science and engineering career choices, and the
differences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
