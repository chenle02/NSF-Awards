Principal Investigators (PIs) Kobulnicky and Povich will improve measurements of
wind driven mass loss from massive stars. Just like a boat moving through water,
a stellar wind collides with the interstellar medium and creates a bowshock. The
PIs will teach several hundred undergraduate students at Cal Poly Pomona and the
University of Wyoming, and members of the Wyoming Lander high school astronomy
club how to participate in the online Zooniverse-Milky Way Project. Students
will analyze infrared images and characterize the bow shocks. University
students will also participate in a summer observing program at the Wyoming
Infrared Observatory (WIRO) and the Apache Observatory (APO). The team will
determine the physical properties of over 400 stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-
main-sequence mass loss driven by stellar winds effects the stellar structure,
chemical yield, the light curve of the supernova, and the formation of a compact
object. The PIs apply the principle of momentum flux balance between a stellar
wind impinging upon an ambient interstellar medium moving relative to the star
to estimate the mass loss rate. The crowd-sourced measurements from archival
Spitzer Space Telescope, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Herschel
Space Observatory datasets will constrain the geometry of the infrared stellar
bow shock nebulae. Cross-matching with the GAIA database will yield stellar
distances and proper motions. Students will reduce and analyze the data taken
with the WIRO spectrograph and the APO Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object
Spectrograph (KOSMOS). The team will produce an empirically based prescription
for wind-driven stellar mass-loss rates as a function of stellar temperature,
gravity, rotation rate, and evolutionary stage, more than quadrupling previous
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
