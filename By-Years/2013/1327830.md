NASA will conduct a field campaign (spring of 2013) called Iowa Flood Studies
(IFloodS) in support of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite
mission scheduled for launch in 2014. This campaign, part of the GPM Ground
Validation activities, will focus on hydrologic applications of the mission
products, specifically for the prediction of floods. IIHR/Hydroscience &amp;
Engineering (IIHR) and the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) of the University of Iowa
will host the experiment and assist NASA personnel in selecting sites and
deploying instruments, as well as organizing and facilitating access to data
resources, and performing preliminary processing and analysis of IFloodS data.
IIHR and IFC will organize and set up a Command Center Facility for the
campaign, coordinate the logistical support of instrumentation maintenance
during the campaign, provide communication support for other state and federal
agencies using the data in real-time, and manage media and public
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collected by this campaign will
enhance our understanding of rainfall variability across scales, provide
uncertainty estimates for operational network of weather radars, and help to
refine models and improve predictions driven by space-based precipitation data
input for applications around the world. IFloodS presents a unique research and
education opportunity for many members of the hydrologic community because there
will be very high quality rainfall data collected over large river basins. This
specific project will support up to ten individuals to participate in this
opportunity.
