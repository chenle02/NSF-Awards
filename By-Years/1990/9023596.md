The research will investigate the corrosion resistance of coated and uncoated
reinforcement in concrete subjected to cracking and cyclic loading and methods
to repair such sections undergoing corrosion. Past research has been conducted
on reinforced concrete blocks, generally uncracked and unloaded, subjected to
temperature variations and wet/dry cycles of exposure to concentrated chloride
solutions. To more realistically simulate field conditions, it is intended in
the investigation to include cracked and cyclically loaded reinforced concrete
slabs. Past research has indicated that under such conditions it may be possible
to wear and crack bar coatings at crack interfaces.
