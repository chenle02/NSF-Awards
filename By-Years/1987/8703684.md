Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique used to obtain
structural information from molecules by irradiating them with infrared light.
The FTIR spectrometer acquired with the help of this award will be used for a
combination of teaching and undergraduate research focussing on the chemistry of
sulfur. The objectives of the project are to a) synthesize and to study the
reactivity of ketene (thioketene) ligated to metal ions; b) to stabilize sulfur
monoxide (and other lower oxides of sulfur) as a ligand in the complexes of
transition metals and to investigate the properties of ligated sulfur monoxide
and c) to prepare sulfur, pyrite and other mineral free coal samples by
reductive methods and to characterize them by their infrared spectra.
