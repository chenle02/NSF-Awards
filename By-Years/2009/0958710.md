This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Major Research Instrumentation Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) Program
grant supports acquisition of optical and acoustic borehole visualization tools
to facilitate characterization of subsurface sedimentary features, fractures,
and dissolution features in hydrological studies and resource assessments for
the State of Wisconsin. The requested imaging tools would be part of an
established subsurface investigations program undertaken by Wisconsin Geological
and Natural History Survey (WGNHS) scientists and staff. The WGNHS is a special-
mission unit of the University of Wisconsin-Extension, and undertakes research,
resource evaluation, teaching, and outreach related to the water, rocks, and
minerals of Wisconsin. Survey scientists conduct their own research but also
collaborate with universities, state and federal agencies, communities, and the
private sector throughout and beyond Wisconsin. The PIs of the proposal hold
affiliate appointments with and are active participants in the hydrogeology
program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. WGNHS scientists also
collaborate with regional faculty and their students from other UW campuses such
as UW-Milwaukee, UW-Oshkosh, UW-Green Bay and UW-Stevens Point, as well as other
regional institutions including Beloit College. The equipment would also support
collaborative projects between WGNHS scientists and U.S. Geological Survey,
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture,
Wisconsin counties, and other agencies. Borehole televiewers to be acquired will
support a range of scientific research themes including fractured rock
hydrogeology, contaminated water transport, aquitard hydrogeology and
groundwater resources of broad local, national, and international interest.
