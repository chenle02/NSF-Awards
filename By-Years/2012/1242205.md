The publications culture of a research community has an impact much broader than
simply how research is disseminated. This culture can have substantive impacts
on how and why research is conducted. The purpose of the workshop is to bring
together key players in this ongoing discussion within the CISE community for a
discussion and deliberation, with the aim of analyzing the issues and developing
guidelines for the way forward. The participants will represent all
stakeholders, from academic researchers to for-profit publishers. A specific
focus of the workshop would be to develop consensus around a set of guiding
principles. The workshop will make significant progress in exploring the current
and alternative publication models for computing research.
