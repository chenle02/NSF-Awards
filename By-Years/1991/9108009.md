Professor Wenzl will continue his previous research using braid groups to
construct interesting examples of subfactors of certain factors of von Neumann
algebras. The following points will be emphasized: (a) It is planned to find a
simpler and more conceptual approach to these examples using the theory of
quantum groups more explicitly. Moreover, the braid groups will be used to
construct other interesting subfactors. (b) Quantum groups also played an
important role in the proof of the existence of certain invariants of
3-manifolds. Professor Wenzl plans to extend the approach used in this
construction to treat not only the quantized Lie algebra of the special linear
group in two dimensions, but all the classical Lie algebras. Professor Wenzl's
research is in the area of self-adjoint operator algebras. These are families of
operators (infinite dimensional matrices) with a certain reality condition
imposed to make the algebras self-adjoint. Recent discoveries involving how one
of these algebras sits inside another have brought together a bewildering
variety of fields and have added immeasurably to our knowledge about these
fields. Professor Wenzl's project will contribute to these developments.
