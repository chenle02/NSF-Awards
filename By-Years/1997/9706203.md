9706203 Perry This is a proposal to study the complex but largely unconfined
carbonate karst aquifer system of the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Over
much of its extent this aquifer system is extremely permeable with the result
that a saline intrusion penetrates at least 100 km inland. The resulting
dispersion zone produces important rock-water interaction and affects water
quality in the overlying fresh water lens. A principal activity under this grant
will be measure water levels (with respect to mean sea level) and seasonal water
level changes throughout the northwest Yucatan Peninsula. These measurements are
difficult because of the high permeability and extremely low water table
gradients on the peninsula. At the time, they are necessary inputs to any
meaningful aquifer models. Approximately six water level gages will be installed
for long-term water level measurements. Water samples will be taken for radium,
barium, and stable isotope analysis. Radium and barium analyses will lead to a
better understanding of groundwater discharge into the Gulf of Mexico, and
stable isotope measurements will help determine evapotranspiration. The ultimate
objective of this work is to compile the information necessary for a complete
water budget for the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
