The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and
biostatistics programs in the South. It currently has member programs at 45
universities in 16 states in the region. This grant will provide support for
graduate and undergraduate students to travel and participate in the 56th Summer
Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics at Jekyll Island
Villas by the Sea in Jekyll Island, Georgia on October 3-6, 2021. The SRC is an
annual conference sponsored by the SRCOS. The purpose of the SRC is to encourage
the interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics
and biostatistics, and to provide motivation and direction to further research
progress. This project will focus on young researchers, giving them an
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to interact closely with leaders
in the field in a manner not possible at larger meetings. The SRC is
particularly valuable for graduate students, undergraduate students, isolated
statisticians, and faculty from smaller regional schools in the southern region
at drivable distances without the cost of travel to distant venues. Speakers
will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification,
amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups.  Under the
travel support provided by this award, graduate students will attend and present
their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers.

In addition to the graduate student participation, the 56th SRC will also
include the second annual Statistical Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE),
a conference within a conference aimed to encourage the participation of
undergraduate students from under-represented groups to pursue graduate
education and career opportunities in STEM fields. SURE will include events
specifically for undergraduate students and undergraduate mentors, such as a
panel about career opportunities in statistics, a ?Real Data Analytics
Workshop,? and a speed-mentoring session with current statistics and
biostatistics graduate students. The support provided by this award will support
SURE and encourage under-represented students to enter STEM fields, including
statistics or biostatistics, and provide training to support this endeavor. The
56th SRC will strengthen the research of the statistics and biostatistics
community as a whole and help bridge the gap for under-represented groups to
pursue statistics or biostatistics, particularly in the sixteen states of the
Southern Region. More information about the conference can be found at:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
