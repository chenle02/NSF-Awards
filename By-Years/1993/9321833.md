9321833 Dickison Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. William Dickison at
the University of North Carolina, graduate student Kenneth Cameron is conducting
field work in South America and in the Far East to collect materials of the
orchid groups related to the genus Vanilla. Morphological and molecular analyses
will then yield new characters for comparative studies aimed at improving
taxonomic recognition of species and genera and for inferring phylogenetic
relationships among these plants. New molecular data from chloroplast DNA and
from nuclear ribosomal DNA are likely to provide strong hypotheses of
evolutionary relationships. In turn, knowledge of the evolutionary patterns in
these orchid groups will help assess trends of evolutionary change in pollen and
seeds, which are distinctive in many of the vanilloid orchids. The vanilloid
orchids include the commercially important genus Vanilla as well as several
presumably derived genera that have lost photosynthetic capabilities and exist
as mycotrophic parasites, feeding on soil fungi on the roots of tropical forest
trees. This combined morphological and molecular study will help improve our
understanding of the evolution of these novel plant adaptations.
