This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award provides
funding for research on means of integrating two critical aspects of production
planning activity that have hitherto been performed separately using very
different models: the planning of the time-phased release of work into factories
using mathematical programming models, and the establishment of safety stock
levels that guarantee a desired level of customer service while remaining
feasible with respect to capacity constraints on the production resources. The
aspect linking these two operations is the lead time, the time required for work
released into the plant to emerge as finished product. It is well known that the
amount and timing of work release determines lead times, due to its effect on
resource utilization. The establishment of safety stock levels, on the other
hand, requires knowledge of the lead time of the production facility
replenishing that inventory. Historically the two problems have been pursued in
isolation, but recent NSF-supported work at Purdue has for the first time
allowed the development of release planning models that capture the effects of
releases on lead times correctly. This provides a mechanism for linking the
safety stock determination with the release planning in an integrated model. If
successful, this research will lead to the development of new supply chain
planning tools that will allow large supply chains involving complex
manufacturing facilities to operate with substantially lowered inventory levels,
substantially reducing costs without adversely affecting service levels. It will
also contribute to a better understanding of the linkages between two research
streams that have been treated as distinct areas with very different
mathematical tools in the past.
