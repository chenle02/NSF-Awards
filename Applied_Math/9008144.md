The inverse problem of determining the initial boundary conditions of a system
evolving in space and time from incomplete observations of the system at various
points interior to the spatial domain, is of considerable importance in many
engineering and scientific applications. This project deals with a selection of
theoretical and numerical aspects of these problems for certain classes of
parabolic partial differential equations. Determination of surface temperature
and heat flux from a finite set of interior temperature measurements stable
under noisy data will be investigated. Theoretical and numerical analysis of
methods involving eigenfunction expansions of initial data and Whittaker
Cardinal expansions of initial boundary data will be studied.
