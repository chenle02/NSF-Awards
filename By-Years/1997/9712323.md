INT 9712323 Wang This U.S.-Slovak engineering research project between Ming-
Liang Wang of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Milan Chandoga of the
Slovak Technical University and Andrej Jarosevic of Comenius University,
Bratislava, will examine novel approaches to measuring magnetic properties
associated with actual stress levels in existing structures. Specifically, this
work will feature detection of damage and measurement of cable forces in cable
stayed and suspended bridges, using an Slovak defined approach. Results are
expected to yield a well characterized magneto-elastic stress sensor with
potential for application in industrial non-destructive testing. This project in
structural systems engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence. ??
