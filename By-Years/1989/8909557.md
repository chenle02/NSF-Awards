The capture of energy from a stimulus and the initiation of a response signal
in the nervous system is termed sensory transduction. In the chemosensory
pathways, including taste and smell, chemical stimulant molecules often act by
binding to highly specific receptor sites on the membrane of the sensory cell.
This binding is in some way coupled to a characteristic change in the membrane
that initiates an electrical signal. It is likely that in many cases the
transduction process involves internal messenger molecules or ions, such as
cyclic nucleotides,calcium, or lipid metabolites. The microscopic aquatic
single-celled organism Paramecium shows simple chemosensory behavior, has many
interesting mutant strains, and its cell membrane has several properties similar
to excitable nerve cells. It has been a very successful model system for
clarifying some aspects of chemosensory reception. This project will explore the
structure, function, and distribution of chemoreceptor sites in Paramecium, and
how they interact with levels of internal calcium in the transduction process.
One of the important stimulus molecules is a cyclic nucleotide compound, cAMP,
closely related to the well-known ATP that has vital metabolic functions.
Molecular genetics will be used to clone and sequence the gene for the membrane
protein thatacts as the binding receptor site for cAMP. Once the gene sequence
is predicted, antibodies to shorter peptide sequences within that gene will be
made to probe receptor structure and distribution, and to predict the functional
domains of the receptor molecule. Calcium levels will be measured using dyes,
and normal and mutant strains will be used to characterize the nature of the
"molecular pump" driven by ATP that extrudes calcium. Findings from this novel
model system will have considerable impact on chemosensory work, because very
few chemosensory receptors have yet been characterized, and no common patterns
have emerged yet. The results, along with those on the calcium pump, are likely
to be important also to neuroscientists in general, since many of the mechanisms
may be similar to those found in the functioning synaptic contacts between
neurons.
