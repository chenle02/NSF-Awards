This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Faculty Development Award supports the effective integration of research,
teaching and outreach. The research goals are to understand ionic and electronic
currents in organic materials. Ion-paired monomers provide an avenue to better
control doping and electrochemical processes in organic electronic applications.
The establishment of the Advanced Materials Science and Engineering Center
(AMSEC) at Western Washington University provides an opportunity for a new
materials science minor, new curriculum development and industrial internship
opportunities for undergraduate researchers. The Discovery Corps Fellowship
Program supported postdoctoral and professional development models that combined
research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Postdoctoral
Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.
