This award will provide funds for an eight-week long summer REU program at the
new Aquatic Research Facility at the University of Kentucky. The program will
provide ten undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in aquatic
ecology. These ten students will be recruited from seven Kentucky colleges and
universities and will be matched with a faculty advisor who will supervise the
students work. To learn the relevant techniques, students will begin their
session by participating in the advisor's ongoing project. Within 2-3 weeks, the
students will shift most of their effort into independent research projects.
Informal weekly seminars during the summer, and evening seminars in the fall,
will stimulate discussion and provide information on research careers and on
major research issues and methods. After gathering and analyzing their own data
and developing skills in critical analysis of the literature and effective
scientific communication, the students will complete the program by presenting
their project results orally at an in-house "research conference".
