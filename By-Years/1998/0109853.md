This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
integrated optical amplifier/splitters through direct writing of sol-gel-
derived, erbium-doped coatings. Since optical signals decrease with transmission
and manipulation, amplifiers are required. Current designs involve serial
arrangements of passive (splitters) and active devices (amplifiers). This serial
design is bulky and expensive, due to the number of components and
interconnects. Integrated optical devices would greatly simplify optical
communication networks. Phase I will incorporate amplification into passive
devices, such as splitters, resulting in lossless optical devices. To provide
amplification, erbium will be incorporated into ceramic films via wet-chemical
processing. Subsequently, laser irradiation will selectively densify channels in
porous coatings, thereby locally increasing the refractive index and providing
light containment in the channels. Pumping the planar device will amplify
signals as they pass.

This technology in integrated amplifier/splitters will be key to making more
complex integrated optical circuits in telecommunication.
