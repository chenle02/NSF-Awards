In order to understand the properties of nucleic acids and the mechanisms by
which they are recognized by proteins, it is essential to understand the details
of fine structure and couple the sequence and structure data. Our goal is to
develop a database of nucleic acid structures and structural features so as to
allow computer queries about structural characteristics, correlations of
features among structures, and sequence-structure relationships. The achieve
this goal, all of the available primary and calculated information about crystal
structures of nucleic acids will be assembled into a relational database. The
system that will be created will be portable and accessible to chemists and
biologists in a large number of computer environments.
