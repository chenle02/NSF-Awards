9722936 Drueckhammer The objective of this project is to study the mechanisms of
catalysis by Coenzyme A (CoA) ester-utilizing enzymes using synthetic CoA
analogs as probes. Further studies will be directed at investigation of the
mechanism and the nature of the intermediate in the reaction of citrate
synthase. Additional acetyl-CoA enol and enolate analogs will be prepared and
studied as probes of citrate synthase, including analogs designed to permit
direct observation of a stable enzyme-enol or enzyme-enolate complex. Further
studies will be conducted on the mechanism of acetyl-CoA dependent
acetyltransferases using newly prepared electrophilic ketone analogs of acetyl-
CoA. These studies may provide new insights into the structure of the enzyme-
intermediate and enzyme-transition state complexes and the means by which the
acetyltransferases stabilize these species. Analogs of CoA will be prepared
having the amide bond nearest the thiol group altered. These analogs will be
used in initial investigations of the role of functional groups remote from the
thiol group of CoA in stabilization and destabilization of ground state and
transition state complexes in enzymatic reactions. Enzymes catalyze almost all
of the biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms and it is estimated
that about 4% of all enzymes require coenzyme A (CoA) or a derivative of CoA in
their reactions. These include enzymes of industrial, biotechnological, and
biomedical importance. This project is directed at understanding the underlying
chemistry involved in the function of these enzymes. This work will provide new
insights into how enzymes work, the basis for their malfunction, and the means
by which their function may be modulated or altered.
