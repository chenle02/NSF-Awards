9629353 Middleton Computer models of past, present and future atmospheric
chemistry conditions and air quality scenarios rely on inventories that are
constructed on appropriate spatial and temporal scales and incorporate relevant
chemical species. The development and distribution of global inventories is the
key function of the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC). The ultimate goal of
GEIA is to establish emission inventories for all trace tropospheric chemical
species, incorporating fluxes from both anthropogenic and natural sources.
Research conducted under this award will support the development of global
inventories. Management and distribution of GEIA inventories are primary tasks
to be conducted. Inventory development will be supported by providing travel
funds for participation in GEIA working groups by emissions inventory experts.
The data bases will be maintained by the GEIA Data Management and Information
Exchange Center and the resulting products, periodically updated as appropriate,
are expected to become standard inventories for the international atmospheric
chemistry community. All GEIA inventories are available electronically to
interested users upon request.
