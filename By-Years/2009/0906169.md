Urban environments provide novel opportunities for increasing our understanding
of ecological processes and identifying feedbacks between ecological and
societal dynamics. To address scientific and management uncertainties associated
with the linkages between carbon, water, and energy exchanges within a city,
this project will begin developing a multiple-scale urban environmental
observatory. The urban observatory approach will provide novel opportunities to
describe current urban environmental conditions and develop short- and long-term
forecasts of likely futures based on societal decisions and future climate
predictions. By focusing on the water-carbon-energy nexus, the urban observatory
will provide descriptions of how urban water use leads to changes in urban
ecosystem functioning. It will also allow for testing of hypotheses regarding
the response of urban ecosystem processes to weather, irrigation, and land-cover
changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed urban observatory will have an
immediate impact by identifying the sensitivity and resilience of ecosystem
functioning and ecosystem services associated with human health and prosperity
in response to changes in land-use, management, and water availability for the
city of Riverside, CA. This project will provide a longer-term impact by
developing a framework for improving management of ecological processes to
provide ongoing availability of ecosystem services to support human well-being
within this region. The results will be disseminated in venues appropriate for
scientists and local stakeholders in a format that can assist real-time
management activities. In conjunction with the improved knowledge, this project
will contribute to the training of underrepresented groups in science at
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.
