"Project SUM" is a new, community-based initiative intended to provide unique
opportunities for 250 local middle and high school girls and boys to explore
science, mathematics, engineering and technology through after-school, weekend
and summer programs. The project is based on the A-MAN program located at their
7,500 square-foot international discovery and learning center. The program
encourages young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to consider entering the
fields of science, mathematics, engineering or technology. The program combines
a multi-faceted informal science education experience with a strong link to the
formal education programs in local schools. The program will operate Monday
through Saturday with two 84-student cohorts (named, Mercury and Gemini) and one
82-student cohort (Apollo) each participating in Project SUM activities two days
per week for 3.75 hours each day.
