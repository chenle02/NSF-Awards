This project is introducing infrared spectroscopy and microscopy as key elements
of the freshman laboratory experience, in addition to the current means of
investigation. These are powerful but uncomplicated tools applicable to study of
many kinds of samples. Infrared is also pedagogically valuable for illustrating
molecular dynamism and many aspects of bonding. Microscopy contributes a
favorable esthetic element to the student experience of chemistry. This project
is addressing student perceptions that chemistry, at least as taught in
introductory courses, has little or nothing to do with their lives, by focusing
the freshman chemistry laboratory program on working with "real world" materials
such as analgesics, household cleaning agents, plastics, textile fibers,
vitamins, and the like. This project harnesses the resulting interest by
providing opportunities for students, working in groups, to plan and carry out
small-scale investigations of such materials in a "directed-inquiry" mode.
