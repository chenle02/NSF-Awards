This project is enabling Vanderbilt University to acquire instrumentation to
teach about the nonlinear interactions of light with matter, as part of the
University's advanced laboratory in optics and lasers. The project is motivated
by increasing demand for significant instruction in the techniques and concepts
of modern optical physics, both in the advanced laboratory and in independent
study and in honors projects. Recent proof-of-concept experiments have included
studies of nonlinear laser-matter interactions in Chinese green tea, cresyl
violet dye, and ion-implanted fused silica. This project-oriented approach to
nonlinear optics with cw lasers is giving undergraduate students a unique
opportunity to have fun with serious optical physics, and motivating them toward
early involvement in research.The project is enhancing teaching effectiveness,
because nonlinear laser interactions are at the heart of many of the most
fertile areas of laser and optical science. Moreover, nonlinear optical physics
in solids and liquids is a powerfully and quintessentially integrative field of
inquiry, bringing together experiment and theory, optical and condensed-matter
physics, quantum and classical physics. The new instructional activities using
cw infrared and visible laser light include: studies of self-focusing and self-
trapping of laser beams, optical switching experiments, and modeling of
nonlinear processes in solids and liquids.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
