proposal# 9413626 PI - Ledford The chemical analysis of mixtures is commonly
required in chemistry, materials science, biotechnoloy, and environmental
science. If the application demands detection, identification, and
quantification of more than a very few substances in a mixture, then chemical
separation is usually required. Most current methods of separation are either
very slow or are limited to only a small portion of the mixture. The objective
of this proposed STTR research is to develop much faster instrumentation for the
chemical analysis of moderately complex mixtures. This research project will
develop a rugged instrument for commercial application. The instrument will
detect, identify, and quantitate volatile organic substances in mixtures
containing about one hundred components within five minutes or less. Commercial
applications include engine emissions analysis and rapid environmental
screening.
