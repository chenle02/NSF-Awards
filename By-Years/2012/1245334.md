Despite data confirming that computer science students who start programming
projects early and spread their effort over time perform better, too many
students put off their work to a point that restricts their chances to get
assistance thus making it difficult to recover from unexpected hurdles. The
overarching goal of this project is to produce a classroom strategy that
measurably reduces procrastination and increases student project performance,
while being applicable in larger classrooms without adding substantially to
faculty overhead. This project designs and evaluates the effectiveness of three
classroom interventions for multi-week programming assignments. Automated
situational awareness alerts are based on a model of student progress and show
students a comparison between their current efforts and a summary of past
student performance data. Students also engage in active reflection and after
each assignment write and discuss with classmates how their time management
choices affected their work. Students also use scheduling sheets that require
them to break down tasks and plan how much time to allocate for each piece to
help them form, express, manage, and track smaller-scale deadlines. All three
interventions are grounded in temporal motivation theory. The impact of the
interventions is measured in terms of when students start a project, when and if
they finish the project, their score on a project, their retention of the
material covered by the project, and changes in their attitudes on
procrastination. The interventions are automated through the open-source tool
Web-CAT which supports analysis of student-written programs. A workshop is being
held to assist faculty on using the interventions in their own classes. The
interventions are not necessarily computer science specific and, if shown
successful, can be adapted to other STEM disciplines.
