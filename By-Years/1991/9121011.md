Two workshops will be held to evaluate the current state of finite deformation
elastic-plastic constitutive models, the appropriate experimental bases for
these models, the range and regimes of validity, and the utility of such models.
Similar efforts are underway in Japan and Germany, and the workshop coordinators
will interface the US effort with these ongoing international efforts.
