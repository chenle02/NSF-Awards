The project studies the use of advanced Human-Machine Interface kits such as
helmet displays and Virtual Reality goggles with low-cost autonomous Umanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and assesses their impact on the ground operator's
cognitive load, and explores the addition of the capability to enable the UAV
with a certain amount of cognitive ability so that it can suggest places in the
scene to make observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project impacts search and
rescue, disaster mitigation, mapping and assessment, and broadens the
perspectives of faculty and students through an international collaborative
effort.
