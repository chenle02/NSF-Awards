The research will evaluate the overloads and ultimate load on a 1/3 scale model
of a shell-type bridge structure which was previously analyzed and evaluated on
a smaller scale model. The analytical study will be verified and further
analysis on several other cross-sections will be investigated for comparison of
load carrying capacity and economic consideration.
