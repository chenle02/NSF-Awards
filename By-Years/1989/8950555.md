The field sciences curriculum in the departments of Biology and Earth Sciences
will be improved by developing a hands-on, instrument-based course in
experimental design and data analysis. In addition, laboratories in existing
courses will be improved, as will the undergraduate student research program,
and the development of inter-departmental courses. Environmental monitoring
systems include sensors for ground and surface water monitoring, air quality
including particulates, and soil probes. These will be integrated into a
computer workstation and terminals. The systems will be integrated into
laboratory exercises and activities which expose students to practical use of
the instrumentation in real experimental situations, which will allow them to
develop abilities in critical thinking and experimental design. The school will
provide 50% matching funds.
