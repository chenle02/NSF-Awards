Neural dynamic programming (NDP) is a scheme that provides approximate solutions
to dynamic programming in which neural networks are used as a tool for function
approximation. Such a scheme is applicable to problems that minimize/maximize a
cost but for which a traditional dynamic programming approach is not feasible
since the cost function is usually not known. In the present project,
applications of NDP to automotive engine control will be studied and
implemented. A challenging problem facing the automotive industry is to design
vehicles that generate emissions satisfying the federal government's future
emission regulations. The challenge here is to minimize the emission and at the
same time to achieve better fuel economy and vehicle driveability. In the past
few years, the automotive industry has engaged in efforts to develop engine
control algorithms that will generate emissions satisfying the government's
emission standards. Emissions generated by automobiles are one of the major
sources for air pollution in the United States. Theoretically, emissions can be
controlled to a minimum possible level by controlling the engine combustion
process so that the air and fuel are mixed at certain desired ratio. This
control problem, as it is known, turns out to be very difficult to solve. This
is partly due to the complexity of modern automotive engines and due to the
complexity of the fuel combustion process. In addition to achieving lower
emissions, the automotive industry has also engaged in efforts to design cars
that have better driveability and consume less fuel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NDP
implementation can be accomplished by adding a $1-10 chip developed under a
previous NSF SBIR grant that, with additional training, could also be to reduce
the cost of fuel flexibility an urgent strategic need.&lt;br/&gt;
