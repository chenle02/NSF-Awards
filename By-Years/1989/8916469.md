Studies of volcanic products along the Andes show a variation in chemistry
along strike and across strike with time. These variations can be explained by
two contrasting models; (1) that the chemical variations simply reflect
variations in the mantle source (primary magmas are not modified by interaction
with the lithosphere); or (2) that these variations are due to modification of
primary magmas due to interaction with the lithosphere through which they pass.
In the Central Andes, the similarity of the compositions of the erupted
andesites to typical continental crust, has led to the suggestion that these
reflect the direct mantle to curst flux, and support a model for crustal growth
through magmatic addition at the subduction zone Crustal thicknesses in the
Central Andes reach~70km, and it is difficult to envisage that primary magmas
would not be modified en route to the surface. The alternative interpretation is
that Andean andesites are chemically similar to continental crust because they
have been extensively contaminated by the crust. This project will address this
key issue by studying mafic monogenetic centres in Bolivia. Available data
suggests that these are the least differentiated lavas in the Central Andes and
have 87SR/86SR similar to the source of island arc magmas. They therefore
represent the closest examples to primary magmas in the Central Andes, and
appear to be a vital window into the composition of the sub-Andean mantle.
