Like the finite element method, the finite volume method is a discretization
technique for solving partial differential equations. Due to the local
conservation property and other attractive properties such as robustness with
unstructured meshes, the finite volume method is widely used in computational
fluid dynamics. Unlike finite element methods, numerical analysis for the finite
volume methods is very limited. Only handful of papers analyzing the finite
volume approximation for the Navier-Stokes equations can be found. The goal of
the proposed research is to establish a complete numerical analysis for a class
of the finite volume methods to the Navier-Stokes equations, including
establishing stability of the methods; deriving optimal priori error estimates,
posteriori error estimates and superconvergence of the solutions; and proving
convergence of adaptive procedures.

Computational fluid dynamics covers wide range of problems from air flow around
airplane to blood flow of human body. The mathematical foundations of any
computational fluid dynamics problem are the Navier-Stokes equations. The finite
volume method is the classical numerical method for the problem used most often
in commercial software and research codes. The objective of the project is to
provide mathematical theory for the finite volume method.
