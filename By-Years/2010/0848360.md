In most primate species, the members of one sex migrate around the time of
puberty, leaving their birth group and attempting to join another group in which
they then reproduce. Decisions about when, where, and with whom to migrate are
possibly the most important decisions that these individuals make, because they
have tremendous impact on risk of death, as well as access to breeding
opportunities. In white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), males migrate
multiple times, whereas females remain in their birth groups. Males migrate
either singly or with allies. Because new immigrants who take over the alpha
male position often kill infants, it may be expected that the presence of recent
immigrants is a source of stress for females as well as males. &lt;br/&gt; This
project, a continuation of an 18-year study documenting the life histories of
107 white-faced capuchin monkeys in 11 social groups, will collect demographic
and behavioral data, as well as genetic and hormonal data (collected non-
invasively from feces) to access the factors that contribute to migration
strategies for males, and counter-strategies for females trying to protect their
offspring from new immigrants who might kill the infants. Extensive behavioral
records will enable testing of hypotheses regarding the effects of relationship
quality, play experience and personality on the effectiveness of particular
migration tactics.&lt;br/&gt; The Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project will provide
year-long internships to 18 students, preparing them for graduate school and
conservation jobs. The project also provides research opportunities for
postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The PI and the long-term research
assistants serve as consultants to the Costa Rican Park Service and local
landowners by providing recommendations for reforestation and ways to mitigate
the negative effects of development and tourism on wildlife. Project staff
members also create educational materials and give presentations on conservation
at primary schools near the study site.
