Barros-Neto&lt;br/&gt;0124940&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Brazil Program
award will provide support for cooperative research between Dr. Jose Barros-Neto
of Rutgers University and Dr. Fernando Cardoso at the Universidade Federal do
Recife in Brazil. The researchers intend to study fundamental solutions to a
class of partial differential equations that have been the subject of extensive
studies and generalizations for their usefulness as a mathematical model in gas
dynamics and flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project
involves the study of fundamental solutions of the Tricomi equation, which is
the classical prototype of a partial differential operator of mixed type, and
its generalizations at certain spatial points. Building on the important role
that certain hypergeometric functions play in the finding of fundamental
solutions to the Tricomi operator, the researchers aim to develop new analytic
facts about differential operators of mixed type and push forward standard
Euclidean analysis to higher dimensional manifolds with more complicated
symmetry structure. &lt;br/&gt;
