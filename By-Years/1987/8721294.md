This project involves the development of a quantitative model to describe the
processes involved during metamorphic differentiation in rock systems. The model
will draw upon nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory and existing data on chemical
kinetics, transport laws, and chemical speciation in metamorphic fluids, and
will allow quantitative prediction of the space-time evolution of metamorphic
textures from initially homogeneous, fine-grained materials. The specific
objective of the project is to develop a two-dimensional simulator program based
on reaction transport equations coupled with viscous flow laws, incorporating
pressure-solution and interfacial energy effects as the driving forces for
differentiation. The results of this research will provide a better
understanding of the geochemical self-organization processes involved during
metamorphism.
