The Activate Computational Thinking (ACT) exploratory research project of
California State University-San Marcos is a two-year professional development
model to support a cohort of 16 middle school science teachers of
underrepresented students as the teachers gain computational thinking (CT)
competencies and design and teach CT-integrated classroom science lessons that
will provide students with CT learning experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
design of the ACT professional development (PD) supports an iterative process
where teacher training is followed by the cycle of design, field-test, and
refinement of CT lessons. The overall PD is then refined before the next
training begins. Close monitoring of teacher and student responses to project
activities will show how (1) teachers gain understanding and knowledge of CT
concepts and capabilities; (2) teachers design science lesson plans that
integrate CT learning experiences; (3) teachers implement science CT-integrated
science lessons; and (4) students exhibit the use of CT skills in the course of
completing their class assignments. Training will occur over two years in two
summers and after school. The project combines participant learning and team
teaching of a cohort of middle school students by trained participants during
the first summer term. This will be followed by yearly training and mentoring.
Teachers will produce science lesson plans that incorporate computational
thinking.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the understanding
of what it takes to empower middle school science teachers as designers of CT
learning opportunities for students from underrepresented groups. With an
estimate of 90 students per middle school teacher per year, the project is
expected to impact more than 2,800 students as the 16 project teachers implement
CT-integrated science lessons into classroom activities over two years.
