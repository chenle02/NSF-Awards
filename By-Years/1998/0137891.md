This project addresses the input of nutrients (specifically, iron) to the oceans
from atmospheric transport of dust, and the production of sulfur containing
gaseous species (such as DMS, dimethyl sulfide) by the ocean organisms as a
result. Increased production of DMS leads to increased atmospheric particle
formation which in turn can affect climate. The principal investigator will
participate in a research cruise where she will sample atmospheric particulates
and analyze them for their trace metal content (including Fe(II)), and measure
the gas-phase concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the atmospheric
particulate concentrations of sulfate, and methane sulfonic acid (MSA), all
oxidation product of DMS. She will also carry out photochemical leaching
experiments which will simulate the interaction between atmospheric aerosols and
ocean water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported under the ADVANCE
program, will launch the independent career of a female scientist. It will
expose undergraduate students to research at the interface of atmospheric
chemistry and oceanography, and will improve our understanding of the role of
atmospheric aerosols in enhancing ocean productivity.
