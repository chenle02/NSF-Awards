9314711 Froelich Funds are recommended for this project to test the concepts of
mineralogical and fluid chemical evolution of a deep sea site on a subduction
zone at the Chile Triple Junction. Pore Fluids will be analyses for Rb, Cs, Ba,
Ni, Cr, rare earth elements, and U, O, Sr and He isotopes. These data will show
whether a collisional phase of hydrothermal or metamorphosed fluids produced the
observed mineralogical sequence and fluid chemistry 100 k.y. ago.
