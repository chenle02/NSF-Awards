Faculty beginning their independent careers often find the process of writing
their first grant proposals to be challenging. Community faculty leaders Corinna
Schindler of the University of Michigan and Osvaldo Gutierrez of Texas A&M
University are organizing a workshop that seeks to provide new chemistry faculty
insight into the proposal writing and reviewing process so that they can
identify and develop strong research, education, and outreach activities.
Participants will have the opportunity to network with each other as well as
successful grant recipients and federal program officers from a variety of
agencies. The participants will engage in mock panels, research presentations,
and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how
to put together a research plan that is ambitious, yet realistic and compelling.
Broader impact criteria are also discussed in terms of educational activities,
outreach, and technical applications to societal problems.

The 2023 Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop, supported by the Division
of Chemistry is planned for Spring 2023 in Alexandria, Virginia. This workshop
will bring together up to 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions
and demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas,
planning educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating
project aims.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
