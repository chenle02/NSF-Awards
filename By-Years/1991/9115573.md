With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry and
Molecular Structure Programs, Professor Record will use Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance to measure ion concentrations in intact, living cells subject to
osmotic stress. Statistical mechanical theories will be used to interpret these
data and obtain a molecular level model for the role of thermodynamic
nonideality in functional cell processes. %%% Professor Record will use modern,
non-invasive spectroscopic techniques to monitor concentrations of important
ions in intact, living cells. He will use thermodynamic theories with these data
to develop a general understanding of the role of concentrated solutions in
determining how cells function. This is a beautiful example of how to apply
theoretical and experimental physical chemistry to important, complicated
systems.
