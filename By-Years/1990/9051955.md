Through this project, the chemistry department provided its students with an
FT-NMR to augment and revamp the laboratories in biochemistry, inorganic,
organic, and Integrated Laboratory. A cobalt-complex-synthesis laboratory for
freshmen includes use of the FT-NMR. Applications include the use of
multinuclear spectra (C-13, P-31, and N-15 and H-1), variable temperature
(kinetics and thermodynamics measurements), proton decoupling (heterocyclic
compounds) and two-dimensional NMR (organic and inorganic as well as student
research project in biochemistry). The four full-time and two part-time faculty
had all had experience with one or more of the capabilities mentioned and
provided hands-on usage for their students in laboratory and directed research.
The net effect of the acquisition of the instrumentation has been an enhanced
laboratory experience and an opportunity for faculty to be renewed through new
laboratory experiments and techniques, as a whole group, thus forging new links
among the faculty and strengthening mutual support and curricular planning. The
institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
