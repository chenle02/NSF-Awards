This project funds the purchase of equipment to support improvements in two
upper-level aquatic biology courses: Limnology and Planktonology. These two
courses serve the Environmental Studies and Marine Biology degree programs,
respectively. The new items of equipment include (1) a videomicroscope system,
(2) a light/temperature controlled incubator to culture isolated phytoplankton
and for controlled growth of phytoplankton in nutrient enrichment experiments,
(3) a shaker for use in the incubator, (4) two automated water samplers to
permit water sampling during tidal, diel, and storm event periods, a
multiparameter water quality monitor for measuring and logging dissolved oxygen,
pH, depth, conductivity, and turbidity, (5) an underwater quantum sensor for
measuring and logging light flux and other custom inputs, (6) a
spectrophotometer for nutrient analyses, and (7) two laptop computers to
interface with primary data gathering instruments and perform data analysis and
graphics. This new equipment introduces students to state-of-the-art research
equipment and techniques, fosters investigative approaches to scientific
problems by students working in small groups, focuses on water quality problems
associated with urban stormwater detention ponds (a national concern) and local
tidal creeks, and provides experience vital for students entering graduate
programs or employment in aquatic biology.
