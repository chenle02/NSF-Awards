The variability of the mean flow of the equatorial middle atmosphere (15 to 90
km altitude) is dominated by the quasi- biennial and semi-annual oscillations
(the QBO and SAO, respectively). The oscillations are manifested as a westerly
phase of the equatorial zonal winds and represent a condition of superrotation
in terms of angular momentum. The purpose of this research is to explore, from a
theoretical viewpoint, the dynamics of these oscillations. The QBO is a
stratospheric phenomenon, occurring irregularly every 22 to 34 months, whereas
the SAO is semiannual and has components in both the mesosphere and
stratosphere. Atmospheric motion in the middle atmosphere is influenced by
radiative and photochemical processes. Dr. Dunkerton, in collaboration with
scientists from the United kingdom, will further investigate the QBO and SAO
using a fully coupled two- dimensional radiative-dynamical-photochemical model.
