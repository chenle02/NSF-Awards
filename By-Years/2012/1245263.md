The proposed research will provide an important set of observations on the
nature&lt;br/&gt;of the earthquake cycle for a major continental strike-slip
fault with direct implications for earthquake&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, estimating
earthquake repeat times, crust and upper mantle rheology as a function of the
state&lt;br/&gt;of stress, and interaction between earthquake processes and
regional tectonics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications: This case study provides
information on the mechanics of continental strike-slip&lt;br/&gt;faults in
general, including the San Andreas Fault, earthquake and tsunami hazards in the
greater&lt;br/&gt;Istanbul area, and opportunities for international scientific
collaboration.
