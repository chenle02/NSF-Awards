0309596&lt;br/&gt;Hess&lt;br/&gt;The Interdisciplinary Conference on Epikarst to
be held in early October,&lt;br/&gt;2003 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, will
sponsored by the Karst Waters&lt;br/&gt;Institute. Epikarst is the boundary
between soil and rock in karst,&lt;br/&gt;honeycombed with small fractures and
solution pockets that may or may not be&lt;br/&gt;filled with water. The
secondary porosity of this zone and its complex role&lt;br/&gt;in contaminant
transport, especially of NAPL's have increased interest in&lt;br/&gt;epikarst.
While karst scientists from different disciplines recognize
its&lt;br/&gt;importance, our ignorance of the epikarst is nearly complete! We
will bring&lt;br/&gt;together karst scientists and scientists from other
disciplines whose&lt;br/&gt;participation may shed light on this enigmatic zone.
There will be a&lt;br/&gt;relatively small number of formal presentations,
followed by a lengthy&lt;br/&gt;discussion. The discussion will be transcribed
and become part of the&lt;br/&gt;conference proceedings. Topics include defining
epikarst, hydrology and&lt;br/&gt;contaminant transport, economic impacts,
soils, fauna, and ecology of&lt;br/&gt;epikarst.&lt;br/&gt;
