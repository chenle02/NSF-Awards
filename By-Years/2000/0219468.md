The problem of developing efficient automated systems of
logical&lt;br/&gt;inference is a key step toward the dream of creating
verifiable,&lt;br/&gt;reliable, and secure hardware and software systems. This
research is&lt;br/&gt;aimed at developing a well-founded, unified theory of
practical&lt;br/&gt;logical inference, that combines complementary ideas and
powerful&lt;br/&gt;approaches for propositional inference developed in AI,
formal&lt;br/&gt;verification, and theoretical computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unified theory will focus on (ii) combining
the different&lt;br/&gt;representations used in the various approaches to
propositional&lt;br/&gt;inference, such as Boolean decision diagrams and
conjunctive normal&lt;br/&gt;form, in order to take advantage of the diverse
algorithmic techniques&lt;br/&gt;associated with each; (ii) developing new and
improved inference&lt;br/&gt;algorithms using the combined representation; (iii)
precisely&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the power of various heuristic inference
techniques,&lt;br/&gt;such as clause learning and randomized search; and (iv)
developing a&lt;br/&gt;rigorous understanding of how problem structure indicates
the&lt;br/&gt;potential effectiveness of particular inference
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve theoretical work
using methods of proof&lt;br/&gt;complexity as well as experimental work on
logical encodings of both&lt;br/&gt;real-world verification problems and AI
planning problems. The&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal research is to significantly
expand the size and&lt;br/&gt;complexity of software and hardware systems that
are amenable to&lt;br/&gt;formal analysis.
