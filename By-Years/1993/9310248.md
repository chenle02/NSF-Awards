9310248 Philander This award provides funds for graduate research assistantships
under the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University. This
Program represents the academic component of a very successful collaboration
between NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Princeton
University's Geological and Geophysics Sciences Department. Some of the GFDL
scientists teach some of the courses in the AOS Program and serve as the
advisors to the students under this award. The students have access to GFDL's
computational facilities. Students' disseration topics cover a variety of
challenging problems related to weather and climate, such as interdecadal
variation of climate (using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model), representation of
cloud dynamics in numerical models, and the dynamics of monsoonal circulations.
The student program is highly competitive and has produced many excellent
scientists who are among the leaders in the field today. ***
