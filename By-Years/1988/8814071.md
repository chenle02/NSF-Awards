They will study donor impurity levels in semiconductors by photoemission
spectroscopy. Concentrations as low as one part in 10-6 will be studied with meV
energy resolution, at a photon energy near 5 eV. Many systems will be studied.
The Silicon:Phosphorus system is emphasized. One set of experiments will use the
surface sensitivity of the photoemission technique to study impurity levels near
surfaces. The large effective hydrogenic radius of 20 A for Phosphorus and
Silicon should result in a significantly defferent binding energy of the
Phosphorus levels near the surface than in the bulk. This study will produce the
first experimental observation of this surface binding enrgy shift. A second set
of experiments will exploit the unique power of photoemission spectroscopy to
directly observe the one electron density of occupied levels and study impurity
band formation as a function of concentration. The concentration range near the
metal/insulator critical concentration (3x10-18/cm3 for Silicon:Phosphorus) will
be emphasized. This study will show the electronic density of states directly,
and determine the bandwidth and Fermi level position as functions of
concentration.
