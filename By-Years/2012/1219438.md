ABSTRACT

03 July 2012 Proposal Number: 1219438 Institution: Scripps Institute of
Oceanography PI: B. Appelgate Co-PI: Z. Kelety

This proposal requests Shipboard Scientific Support items for the vessels
operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) namely; the R/V ROGER
REVELLE, MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and ROBERT G. SRPOUL. Requests include: (1) a
new fire detection system for NEW HORIZON, (2) a new oily water separator and
reverse osmosis water maker for SPROUL, and (3) new hanging blocks and a closed
circuit television system for the REVELLE. This award also includes computerized
stability program up-grades for all vessels in the Academic Fleet. All items
requested will enhance safety, bring the vessels into current regulatory
compliance, or provide greatly improved science support capabilities.

Broader Impacts: SIO vessels support federally-funded scientific research
throughout the world?s oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography. SIO participates in a large number of
outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of
government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign
ports. All told, Scripps vessels are scheduled to complete nearly 470 NSF
sponsored days in 2012.
