The material flow within manufacturing can be characterized by three different
types of activities: make activities; move activities; and store activities. The
configuration of the move and store processes is a fundamental system design
decision. The objective of this research is the characterization of system
performance in terms of this configuration decision. Specifically, the objective
of this project is a mathematical methodology and associated computational
techniques for rapidly and accurately predicting performance for a special class
of manufacturing systems. The approach to be used is based on a network of
queues model developed in a prior work, however, the solution approach in this
project involves the decomposition of the real problem into separate problems
for the major system elements. The subproblems will be analyzed using models
such as continuous time Markov chain models and queueing models. This project
will produce the characterization and the analysis tools for a broader class of
applications than existing analytic methods.
