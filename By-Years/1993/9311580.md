9311580 Machta This proposal concerns the statistical physics of complex and
disordered systems. In particular it concentrates on three areas. 1) A theory of
phase transitions in porous media with wide distributions of pore sizes is being
developed using Migdal- Kadanoff approximations. The PI is particularly
interested in studying the 4helium superfluid transition in porous aerogel
glasses. 2) The PI proposes to study a clean example of self- organized
criticality - that of the lambda transition in 4helium in the presence of heat
flow. 3) The PI plans to study the application of computational complexity
theory (something which arose out of theoretical computer science) to problems
in statistical physics by determining the time requirements (and therefore the
algorithmic choice) to solve various models on parallel machines. %%% The
proposed work involves theoretical and computational approaches to the
understanding of phase transitions in disordered systems. Of particular interest
is the understanding of how helium undergoes its superfuid transition in a
porous medium - the long wavelength fluctuations which are usually present in
such transitions are truncated by the presence of the pore cages. Another aspect
of this work concerns the study of a metastable system; that of the so- called
lambda-transition in helium in the presence of heat flow. This produces a clean
example for the study of self-organized criticality - a concept which has been
applied to phenomena as varied as stock-market pricing and earth-quake
prediction. Lastly, the proposal attempts to classify various models for phase
transitions according ideas that came out of theoretical computer science -
ideas that concern how difficult, computationally, it is to solve these models.
