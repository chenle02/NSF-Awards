One fundamental problem in whole-cell biocatalysis is the impermeability of cell
membranes to diverse substrates of industrial interests, which greatly limits
the reaction rate, and in worst scenarios makes the intracellular enzyme network
completely inaccessible. This research proposes two novel strategies to the
permeability issue. In the first strategy, an E.coli Lipid A mutant with
modified biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides will be used to alter the outer
membrane permeability. In the second strategy, membrane-active peptides that
modify membrane permeability will be used. These peptides will be generated by
directed evolution methods with carefully designed selection and screening
procedures. The modulation of cell permeability could be effected by varying
cation concentrations, permeabilizing peptide expression level or by using a
peptide sequence with a different membrane permeabilizing activity. By removing
permeability barriers, the whole-cell biocatalysts can be made accessible to
synthetic substrate of various types, hydrophobic and large hydrophilic
substrates that cells do not normally have mechanisms for uptake.
