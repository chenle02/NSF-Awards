This project will create and research a computer-based curriculum for
probability and statistics targeted primarily for the high school. The
development and evaluation of the materials will be based on past and ongoing
research of student conceptions of probability and statistics. The curriculum
will focus on the development of concepts, many of which have proven difficult
to teach in standard courses. The program will consist of a software package
together with a set of laboratory activities organized into three modules,
"Chance", "Chance Plus Rules", and "Chance Plus Structure". In the majority of
these labs, students will use the computer to build sampling models, draw large
random samples, and analyze the resultant data. These computer simulations will
provide the empirical data against which students will evaluate their intuitive
predictions and theories. Students will eventually build models to study complex
phenomena consisting of both probabilistic and deterministic components. Small
components of the curriculum will be evaluated and revised based on clinical
interviews with individual students. Larger components will be tested in a
number of sites involving a diversity of student populations.
