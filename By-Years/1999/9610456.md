The primary goal of this research project is to investigate the local and global
dynamics in the motion of a spinning disc system and to numerically and
experimentally verify the theoretical results. The results of this research will
be useful in applications such as computer disc memory devices, industrial
circular saw blades, and turbine rotor dynamics. The objectives of the research
are four-fold. First, the general nonlinear equations of motion governing the
disc dynamics will be derived systematically to include the effects due to
inherent bending rigidity, membrane stresses arising from centrifugal forces,
non-axismmetry of the inplane and transverse displacements, geometric
nonlinearities, aerodynamic damping arising from air stationary and moving with
respect to the disc, parametric excitation due to time varying spring rate,
etc.. Second, is equations, along with symmetry-breaking bifurcations, will also
be examined. Third the mechanisms which five rise to global bifurcations in
nonlinear spinning disc to identify the important modes, locate the stability
boundaries, and examine the nature of the nonlinear response to verity the
theoretical predictions. Validation studies will be carried out using actual
data from manufacturers of spinning discs. Experimental verification and
validation in turn, guide the development and refinement of the theories to
incorporate any new phenomena observed.
