Small magnetic structures are being developed for&lt;br/&gt;magnetic sensors
(for example, exploiting the&lt;br/&gt;giant magnetoresistance effect, or
tunneling magnetoresistance)&lt;br/&gt;for nonvolatile memories exploiting
either the Hall effect or magnetotransport&lt;br/&gt;effects and for storage on
a nano scale.&lt;br/&gt;They present challenges in design for
controlling&lt;br/&gt;the value and reproducibility of the switching
field.&lt;br/&gt;Temperature effects as well as fluctuation&lt;br/&gt;of the
grain structure on a mesoscopic scale become important.&lt;br/&gt;At the moment,
magnetic nonvolatile memories are being developed by&lt;br/&gt;IBM-Siemans
(Infinion) and the Motorola Companies.&lt;br/&gt;The uniformity of the switching
field is a major stumbling block in the&lt;br/&gt;commercilaiztaion of high
density nonvolatile magnetic memories.&lt;br/&gt;At the moment the yield of
addressable sites is very small.&lt;br/&gt;Nearly all current micromagnetics
calculations are carried out&lt;br/&gt;at zero temperature and do not include
the temperature effects.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, very few systematic
investigation were carried out.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study and develop a way
to predict the device&lt;br/&gt;characteristics and enable their optimum
design&lt;br/&gt;with techniques that we have developed over the last several
years.&lt;br/&gt;These include (a) calculations from an analytic point of view
in&lt;br/&gt;combination with a finite temperature Monte Carlo code that we have
written and&lt;br/&gt;optimized; (b) experimental studies of the switching
field&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of our in-house e-beam patterned
submicron&lt;br/&gt;structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
