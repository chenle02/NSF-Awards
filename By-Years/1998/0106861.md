0106861 Brown The style, magnitude and timing of Tertiary deformation in the
central Tibet Plateau remain poorly known, but such information is central to
discriminating among the various models for the origin of plateaus. Subsurface
data is required to document accurately the amount of shortening and other
parameters. A series of seismic lines have been obtained by the China National
Star Petroleum Corporation and these data have been made available for this
project. Reprocessing and interpreting these data are expected to greatly
improve understanding of Tertiary deformation on the Tibet Plateau.
