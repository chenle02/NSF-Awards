This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site award will support eight
undergraduate researchers working under the supervision of the site director and
two faculty associates, one from Spelman College. Students will be engaged in
mathematical research focusing on questions regarding the solution of linear
algebraic equations and linear programming type optimization problems. Students
will examine various iterative schemes for solving matrix systems with real,
symmetric positive definite matrices. A primary target in the research is the
estimation of extreme eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices. Computer
experiments will be run to assist in the formulation and testing of hypotheses.
Students will be encouraged to continue their projects during the academic year.
This project continues a similar one funded during the past year.
