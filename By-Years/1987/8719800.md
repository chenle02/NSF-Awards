This project will test the hypothesis that the dentition of the black saki
monkey reduces resistant dietary items (hard fruits, seeds, nuts) that are
critical to the animal's diet; and that these hard food items are opened with
canine teeth specialized for applying high pressure during puncturing and chewed
with flat, thick enameled molars capable of applying high pressure during
crushing, and that these foods are not accessable to similar primates with
different tooth formations. These hypotheses will be tested by observation of
feeding and ranging behavior of black saki and similar spider monkeys in the
forests of Northern South America, and by analysis of availability, use, and the
physical and chemical properties of the food items eaten. The project will use a
new method of measuring the resistance to puncturing and crushing of the foods.
