9322062 Tezduyar This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
involve students in high-performance computing in fluid dynamics. Examples of
particular tasks are: a) understanding the significance and practical value of
the application problem, b) proper mathematical modeling of the problem,
including the specification of the differential equations to be solved and the
associated boundary conditions, c) being aware of the challenges involved in
numerical solution of these equations, d) selecting the computational method
best suitable for the problem, e) generating the mesh, grid, or other
discretization environment for the selected computational method, f) selecting
the computational hardware best suitable for the computations planned, g)
setting the stage for vectorized computations on the most advanced Crays or
implementing the formulations for massively parallel computations on the
Connection Machines CM-200 and CM-5, h) performing the actual computations, and
i) visualizing and analyzing the computed data with the advanced graphics
techniques, including the video animation of the computed results. ***
