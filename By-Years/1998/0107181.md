The investigators will determine which physical processes are responsible for
temporal variations in galactic cosmic radiation with time scales greater than
22 years, with particular emphasis on periods of order 100 years and greater. A
subsidiary goal will be to establish limits for the "space weather" that has
occurred throughout the period 1200-2000 AD. The main effort is to use the
cosmogenic records of the time variation of the galactic cosmic radiation over
the period 1200-2000 AD, together with the neutron monitor and satellite
measurements over the past 50 years, to investigate the physical properties of
the long term (100 year time scale) modulation. This study comprises several
components. The investigators will set limits on the changes in beryllium-10 and
carbon-14 due to changes in the geomagnetic cutoff, as a consequence of changes
in the geomagnetic moment, and its vector direction, 1200-2000 AD, and
developing a means to correct the data for these effects. They will use the
known occurrence of very large solar cosmic ray events in the interval 1561-1994
to investigate the contributions they have made to the beryllium and carbon
data, and to develop a method to remove such contributions. Using these results,
they will remove geomagnetic cutoff and solar cosmic ray effects from the
cosmogenic data, leaving a more accurate representation of the long-term
modulation of the galactic cosmic rays. This will allow them to deduce what
temporal changes in the energy spectrum of the galactic cosmic radiation are
consistent with the observed long-term changes in cosmic ray intensity from 1200
AD to the present. Synthesizing the work with satellite data from near earth and
from the far heliosphere, the investigators will set bounds on the nature of the
mechanisms that produce the long-term modulation of the galactic cosmic
radiation. They will explore the astrophysical implications of the results and
establish benchmarks for space weather 1200- 2000.&lt;br/&gt;
