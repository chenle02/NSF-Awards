Founded in 1887 as a graduate institution with a distinguished history in
scientific research, Clark University has rapidly evolved into a university-
college, a combination of a small liberal arts college and research-oriented
university. This concept promotes the linkage between teaching and research,
where undergraduates are closely involved in the scholarly activities of faculty
and graduate students. This synergetic relationship has been important to the
success of the Ph.D. program in Psychology. The program has an excellent
reputation, and is recognized as one of the institution's lead graduate
programs. The Department resides in Jonas Clark Hall, one of the university's
keynote buildings. Constructed in 1889, the facility in its existing condition
cannot support training and faculty research activities. As a part of Clark's
efforts to strengthen its science graduate programs, the university has made a
commitment to renovate and modernize Clark Hall. Funds from the Academic
Research Infrastructure Program will be used to partially support the renovation
of research and research training space. The project includes full asbestos
abatement, replacement of the HVAC system, reconfiguration of research
laboratories, and the upgrade of electrical and communications services. Upon
completion, the renovations will allow full utilization of existing space,
accommodate an increased number of researchers associated with graduate
training, and provide modern access to new communication technologies.
Improvements to the HVAC system will raise the building to modern research
standards, providing ambient conditions throughout the year. Modernizing the
facility will strengthen a long-standing and renown research program that has
had success in integrating undergraduate, graduate and faculty research
activities. This NSF project will enable the institution and department to purse
its vigorous and expanding roles in research and research training for both
undergraduate and graduate students.
