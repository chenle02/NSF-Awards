Bob Devaney will continue his exciting work on planar dynamical systems. This is
part of a program to extend the understanding of rational maps to more general
maps in the complex plane. He will continue to study the Julia sets of selected
one-parameter families of mappings. These form theboundaries between points with
unbounded iterates and those which remain in some fixed region. His innovative
use of movies in these studies has been very instructive in our understanding of
the dynamics of entire functions, and now seems likely to bear fruit in his
investigations of non-analytic dynamics. Devaney will also turn his attention to
the bifurcation diagrams of these families. In the realm of analytic dynamics
Devaney will work to understand the local dynamics of entire maps near an
essential singularity. This is important since one of the distinguishing
features of entire functions is the presence of an essential singularity at
infinity. In order to extend earlier work to the non-analytic setting he will
study non-rational meromorphic functions. There appear to be new dynamical
phenomena displayed by the Julia sets of these functions. A final topic for
investigation will be the bifurcation structure of the area preserving Henon
maps.
