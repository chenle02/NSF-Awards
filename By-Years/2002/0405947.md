DMS-0405947 &lt;br/&gt;James N. Damon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue
investigating two problems that superficially are unrelated. One concerns the
geometry, topology and deformation properties of stratified sets and nonisolated
singularities. The other involves the development of geometric methods for
problems in computer imaging. These different problems benefit from the approach
of singularity theory via groups of equivalences and also from the analysis of
geometric and topological properties, which are consequences of transversality
to Whitney stratified sets. He has applied these methods to determine local and
global geometric properties of an object and its boundary from its Blum medial
axis (which is a skeleton of the object used to characterize shape properties).
He has also applied these methods to determine, for various notions of scale,
the generic "scale-based geometry" of grayscale images. Third, he has also used
these infinitesimal methods to determine the topology and geometry of a large
class of highly singular complete intersections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will have a broader impact via its focus on the use of singularity
theory as a tool for questions in computer imaging. This takes several forms
including: continued joint interaction of the investigator with computer
scientists at several locations, but especially at the Univ. of North Carolina;
the development of tools from singularity theory, which directly apply to
problems of interest in imaging; and the specific consideration, in joint work
with several computer scientists, of several concrete imaging problems of
current interest involving feature statistics and tensor
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;First, the PI proposes to build on his results for medial
structures to: develop concrete models in terms of topology for searchable
structures for 3D objects which will be of use in 3D-imaging, to enlarge the
class of allowable structures to include degeneracies, and to apply these ideas
for uses in statistical properties of geometrical features for shape. Second, he
will further develop methods of scale-based geometry to: determine the singular
geometry in the presence of parameters; develop methods to verify generic
geometric properties for feature detection; and apply the methods to tensor
images. Third, he proposes to further advance the understanding of underlying
geometric and topological structure of such highly singular spaces and their
representations as sections of universal singularities, and their properties as
Whitney stratified sets. &lt;br/&gt;
