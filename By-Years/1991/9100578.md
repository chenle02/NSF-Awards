Professor Wolf will continue his research on Lie groups, harmonic analysis, and
representation theory, with some applications to complex analysis, Riemannian
geometry, and control theory. He will develop applications of his recent results
on the equivalence of various methods of construction of representations. He
will study the possibility of determining the character of a representation from
a formula he has derived with R. Herb. He will complete his work on the Schwartz
space of a general semisimple Lie group and study discrete series
representations of groups of hermitian type. Finally, Professor Wolf will study
the observability and controllability problems for evolution equations
associated to invariant differential operators on Riemannian homogeneous spaces.
Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when
the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin
of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract
objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or "representations"
of the symmetry group.
