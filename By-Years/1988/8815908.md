They propose projects in condensed matter physics in two general areas:
nonequilibrium growth and the theory of quasiperiodic structures. The first area
is the main subject of the proposal: they will investigate a model for thin film
growth (ballistic aggregation), aspects of diffusion-limited growth, notably a
joint experimental and theoretical project in electrodeposition, a model for
fracture which maps it onto a DLA type process, flow in porous media, and an
investigation of aspects of crystallization. In the second area they will
explore the propagation of wavepackets in artificial quasiperiodic
supperlattices.
