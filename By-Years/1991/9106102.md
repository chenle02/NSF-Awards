Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a peptide hormone, originally
identified in the brain. Data has shown that it may be produced by the human
placenta and may regulate human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which regulates
the production of progesterone, which is required for the early maintenance of
pregnancy. Studies will examine placental GnRH production and its effect on the
production of the hCG. An understanding of this relationship is central to an
understanding of the ability of the placenta to regulate its own growth and
development, as well as that of the child. Approximately ten percent of all
infertility is unexplained, some portion of which may be due to spontaneous
abortions due to an inadequate hormonal environment. It is therefore apparent
that a better understanding of the hormonal requirements for the maintenance of
pregnancy are required.//
