The anthropology museum at the University of Kansas is undertaking overall
improvements in their archaeology collections. Their holdings have strengths in
the Northern and Central Plains for both prehistoric and historic periods. These
collections are among the best documented in the central Plains, and are
remarkably coherent, stemming as they do from tightly focused research projects
carried out between 1945 and 1965. In all, more than 1800 sites from the Plains
and Plains/Prairie border are represented in the collections. This project will
represent the completion of the upgrading of the collection begun in a small
grant funded last year. Significant improvements have already been made and with
this grant the collections will be available for researchers in the
anthropological community. One of the major priorities facing museums in North
America is the proper curation and management of archaeological collections.
Through NSF support considerable progess can be made in correcting problems that
have plagued museums and hindered research.
