Specimen data about mammals exist in a large number of institutions. Until now,
there has been no integrated approach so that a researcher might move through
various collections for research. Here, seventeen natural history institutions
have come together to build and support a part of biodiversity informatics in an
open, collaborative manner. The system will facilitate open access to the data
from a web browser, which will enhance the value of the collections and also
conserve curatorial resources. The design paradigm can be extended and modified
by other groups interested in other species sets. The networked information
system will permit the participating institutions to support the global use of
collection data in research, education, and informed decision making. This
factual information about the earth's biodiversity will be readily available to
help maintain and wisely manage the earth's natural resources. The distributed
database for mammal collections will represent the first time that many of these
data are available online, together. The simplicity of the design will provide a
low-cost opportunity for any institution to participate.
