0216459&lt;br/&gt;Dugdale&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
San Francisco State University's Romberg Tiburon Center provides funds for
acquisition of research instrumentation for isotope tracer research in coastal
marine science and estuarine ecology. Instruments supported here include a
stable isotope mass spectrometer with gas chromatograph interface, a high
resolution scintillation counter, and an elemental analyzer and reduction
furnace. The instruments will be used in a variety of projects, including
ongoing studies of carbon and nitrogen fluxes in phytoplankton near Bodega Bay,
CA, oceanic fixation of nitrogen by Trichodesmium, nitrogen dynamics of natural
planktonic communities in response to iron enrichment, coupling of carbon and
nitrogen cycles in coastal upwelling, and invasive species in the San Francisco
Estuary. The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF. San Francisco State University will provide cost-share support
from non-federal funds for a portion of total project
costs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
