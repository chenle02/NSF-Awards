The central aim of this project is to explore in vivo the cellular mechanisms
that are responsible for the retraction of certain axonal projections by
identified neurons in the leech central nervous system. Based on recent
experiments, Dr. Macagno believes that the loss of these projections is the
result of interactions between segmentally homologous neurons. He suggests that
these interactions are mediated by a signal that the neurons exchange at or near
their growth cones, probably through direct cell-to-cell contact. The
experiments are designed to test this hypothesis and to provide the bases for
the future examination of the mechanisms involved in the signalling and response
of the cells. The principal approaches will be (1) to examine ultrastructurally
the interaction between processes by dye- marking and computer-aided serial
section electron microscopy and (2) to photoablate, wholly or partially, the
interganglionic process of one cell and examine the response of its homologues.
These observations will provide further insight into overproduction and
selective retraction of axonal projections, a common and important feature of
the development of neuronal circuitry.
