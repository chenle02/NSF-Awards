This proposal seeks to continue funding for the deep-sea core and sample
repository at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). The repository has
distributed over 15,000 samples over the past three years. Additional funds are
sought for the replacement of corroding sample trays and for some inexpensive
analyses to aid sample selection. LDEO provides significant support to the
facility, especially personnel and IT. The facility also offers opportunities
for student training and research.
