This research addresses computation of reachable states for VLSI designs
described in high-level languages and the application of these results to
automatic test pattern generation (ATPG). Methods to compute symbolically the
set of states reachable from an initial state are being explored. An extended
finite state machine (ESFM) model, which can represent communication protocols
and hardware behavior, is being used. A key idea is that the model allows use of
arbitrary state variables, such as boolean and arithmetic, which will provide
efficiency in computation. Methods and prototype tools to convert automatically
a design in VHDL to an ESFM are being developed. These methods and techniques
are being applied to ATPG for sequential circuit test.
