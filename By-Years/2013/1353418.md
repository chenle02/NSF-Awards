Often referred to as microblogging, the practice of average citizens reporting
on activities "on-the-ground" during a disaster is increasingly common. The
contents of these message are potentially valuable to responder organizations
and victims, but their volume makes it difficult to separate valuable messages
from the stream. This project will examine microblogged messages sent during
disasters to determine what aspects of the messages (individually and
collectively) indicate that they are relevant, verifiable and actionable.
Factors to be considered include the content of the messages, the identity of
the sender and the overall pattern and spread of messages. The identified
factors will then be used to instruct crowdsourced workers who will label
messages to create a large corpus of labelled messages.

The project is important because microblogging data are seen as increasingly
important: they are ubiquitous, rapid and accessible, and they are believed to
empower average citizens to become more situationally aware during disasters and
to coordinate to help themselves. The result of the project, if it is
successful, will be evidence that it is possible to identify relevant,
verifiable and actionable messages from a stream of microblogged messages and
identification of the evidentiary factors. A further outcome will be a disaster-
related, labeled dataset of messages, which will be useful to researchers, e.g.,
those seeking to automatically classify information within a microblogged data
stream.
