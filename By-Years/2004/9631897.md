9631897 Castro This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for five U.S. mathematicians to participate in the 1996 Summer School in Partial
Differential Equations to take place in Bogota, Colombia, July 22-August 2,
1996. Organizers are Dr. Alfonso Castro, University of North Texas and The
Summer School will emphasize Elliptic Partial Differential Equations, Quantic
Groups, Mathematical Biology and special Functions. Each course ranges from
introductory background to state of the art research problems. The aim of the
activity is to establish relationships between U.S., Colombian and foreign
mathematicians, discovering and encouraging young talent interested in graduate
work and fostering research collaboration among different groups. Participants
in the school include, besides U.S. and Colombia, other countries in the
Americas: Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil, as well as participants from Spain, New
Zealand, Holland and Germany. Thus, this presents an excellent opportunity for
multi-national cooperation in research and education. ***
