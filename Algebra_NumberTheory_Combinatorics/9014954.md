Professor Schoen will work on the relation between Chow groups and Hodge
theory. He will study the torsion subgroup as well as the Bloch-Beilinson
conjectures. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
