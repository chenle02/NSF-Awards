The Toolik Field Station (TFS) has been a major site for research in the North
American Arctic&lt;br/&gt;since 1975. Much of what is known about structure and
function of arctic terrestrial and aquatic&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems, effects of
climate change, and feedbacks to global climate has emerged from
long&lt;br/&gt;term, process-based ecological research at TFS. TFS-based work
has resulted in significant&lt;br/&gt;discoveries on adaptations of organisms to
the Arctic and population-level changes in animal&lt;br/&gt;and plant
distributions and phenologies. Because climate is changing rapidly in the
Arctic,&lt;br/&gt;continuing research into mechanisms of ecosystem response and
feedbacks is a high priority.&lt;br/&gt;This need and ongoing interest by
scientists from many disciplines in use of TFS promise a&lt;br/&gt;steady demand
for TFS science support in the future. TFS supports the Arctic Long-Term
Ecological&lt;br/&gt;Research program (LTER), projects in the Arctic Observatory
Network program (AON), NASA?s&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment
(ABoVE), the Earthscope Transportable Array, and is&lt;br/&gt;a core site for
the National Ecological Observatory Network program (NEON). TFS is a
founding&lt;br/&gt;partner in the EU-sponsored International Network for
Terrestrial Research and Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;in the Arctic (INTERACT), which
links field stations around the circumpolar Arctic, and a&lt;br/&gt;member of
the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). At least 993 peer-
reviewed&lt;br/&gt;journal articles, 161 books or book chapters and 144
dissertations and theses have been published&lt;br/&gt;on research based at TFS.
