This proposal provides partial support for the Small Grants Program of the
American Sociological Association. The Program is administered by the
Association and has been jointly funded by the American Sociological Association
and the National Science Foundation for the last two years. This Programs
provides small amounts of funds for conferences, workshops and limited scale
research projects. These pilot projects constitute the initial phases of larger
projects for which other major funding will be sought. The Small Grants Program
is particularly valuable and necessary source of funding for workshops and
conferences. These provide social scientists vital opportunities for enriching
the research endeavors and advancing the theoretical and methodological
development of the discipline.
