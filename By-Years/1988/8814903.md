A new multiphoton laser excitation technique will be used to study atoms in
which at least two electrons have been excited. These atoms are expected to have
a different atomic structure, often dominated by correlation effects, with
little overlap with the ground state. The studies will explore both lower lying
doubly excited states and the planetary highly doubly excited states. Activities
include studies of branching ratios, shakeoff, planetary atoms, inside-out
excitation, high power core laser effects and high resolution fluorescence.
These are expected to yield important information about the quantum three body
problem and may be useful in the development of energy storage media.
