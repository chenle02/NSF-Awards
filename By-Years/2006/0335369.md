The study would develop new measures of non-cognitive outcome of schooling on
motivation, self-efficiency, self-regulation strategies, and beliefs about
learning. The study addresses the concern of the effect of beliefs and
strategies on cognitive growth. These measures could be used in the MSP Projects
to assess effects of the various interventions on students. The study would
gather large pools of survey data by working with the Math and Science
Partnership projects as well as other sites and would analyze these data with
sophisticated statistical models. The study will be significantly large enough
to include a specific examination of underrepresented groups. The goal of the
investigators is to make new tools for assessing student motivation generally
available to MSP projects to be used for increasing teachers knowledge about the
role of these beliefs, and assist them in helping students. Also, the tools are
intended to assist MSPs evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation.
