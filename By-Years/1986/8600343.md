This grant will provide International Travel support to permit the principal
investigator to attend and present at an International Conference, "Reliability
of Methods for Engineering Analysis", to be held at University College, Swansea,
U.K. on July 9-llth, l986. The objective of the conference is to bring together
leading researchers and practitioners of the fields of finite element analysis
and CAD to discuss the present state of computational methods and their
integration in computer aided design. Specific emphasis will be given to the
accuracy and reliability requirements of the computational procedures and
software used. The following topics will be included: accuracy and reliability
requirements in practical finite element analysis and industrial applications;
accuracy measures in finite element analysis, automatic construction, and
adaption of meshes; solid modeling and finite element analysis and graphics;
artificial intelligence and expert systems; and verification and quality
assurance of software and computer usage (software/hardware design). During the
3-day conference, 30 leading experts will provide overviews of different aspects
of the above topics.
