Chapman Conference on Micro and Meso Scale Phenomena in Space Physics Funds are
requested to support the attendance of graduate students and recent doctorate
candidates at the AGU Chapman Conference on Micro and Meso Scale Phenomena in
Space Plasmas. Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the
American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not
normally available through the format of larger meetings. The unifying theme for
this conference is the interface between micro and meso scale processes and
associated theory and modeling. This unifying theme is very important to
magnetospheric physics generally as illustrated in the prime example of MHD
fluid models for plasma reconnection (then treating meso-scale processes in
boundary layers) vs. kinetic, wave-particle interaction physics needed to
quantitatively treat the anomalous dissipation required by most reconnection
models (the micro process). The proceedings will encompass stochastic and
quasilinear processes and nonlinear wave-particle interactions occurring in
fluctuating, nonequilibrium, collisionless, collisional and turbulent space
plasmas. The conference will help to assur that the upcoming generation of space
physicists will be well versed in this complex, yet vital area of space physics.
