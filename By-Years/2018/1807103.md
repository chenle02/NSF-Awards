This proposal supports eight students for their travel to attend the Association
for Computing Machinery International Workshop on Security in Software Defined
Networks &amp; Network Function Virtualization (SDN-NFV Security), to be held in
Tempe, Arizona, USA, on March 21, 2018. SDN and NFV are two emerging networking
paradigms, which introduce significant granularity, visibility, flexibility and
elasticity to networking, but at the same time bring forth new security
challenges. SDN-NFV Security is a leading international forum for university
researchers, scientists, and industry professionals for new theories and
technologies related to security challenges in SDN and NFV. Participation in
workshops like SDN-NFV is an extremely important part of graduate students'
research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present
their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers
and senior researchers, and gain exposure to leading edge
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
