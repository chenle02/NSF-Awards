Students are using a computer algebra laboratory equipped with Macintosh
computers running the computer algebra system MAPLE. The computer algebra system
allows students and teachers to approach mathematics from a more conceptual
point of view than is the case in more traditional settings. This facility is
serving students in the regular calculus sequence as well as in the business
calculus course and in the linear algebra and differential equations courses. A
calculus lab will be developed for students taking calculus and physics
concurrently. Summer workshops are being set up so that high school teachers can
learn to use such systems in their classes. The University will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
