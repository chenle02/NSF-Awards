Beloit College will purchase sample preparation equipment for use in
undergraduate geology laboratory courses. This equipment will be used by geology
students in courses in crystallography, mineralogy, petrography, petrology, and
sedimentology to prepare samples for a variety of analyses requiring a high
degree of sample purity. Advanced undergraduates also will use the equipment for
similar purposes in senior thesis work and independent projects. Beloit College
will match the NSF equipment grant with an equal amount of funds.
