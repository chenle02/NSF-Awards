Research will be conducted on a potential process for removing organic
contaminants from water. Energized electons produced by an accelerator will be
used to alter the molecular structure of the contaminants and to capture the
contaminant-fragments on polymers through which the water flows while being
subjected to radiation or to cause crosslinkage of polymers in
solution/suspension for subsequent removal by a separation techinque.
