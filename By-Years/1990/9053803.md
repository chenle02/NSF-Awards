San Diego State University will create a learning environment in the physics and
biology courses for elementary teachers that facilitates conceptual
understanding of scientific phenomena. The classroom environment will utilize
computer and videodisc learning tools to help students construct and monitor
their own scientific knowledge. The products to be produced by the project are:
A) a metacognitive skills workbook; B) skeletal semantic networks in physics and
biology for use in teaching students to think about the links between
observation, evidence, and interpretation; C) videodisc-based tutorials in
several areas of physics; D) a videodisc of physics and biology images relevant
to classroom activities; and E) strategies for teaching prospective elementary
teachers for conceptual understanding. The University's cost sharing will be 14%
of NSF's contribution.
