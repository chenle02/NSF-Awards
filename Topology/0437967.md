The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the leaders of the fields of
knot theory and 3-manifold topology to discuss the state of the art of the
subjects (currently in a state of rapid change). A second purpose is to
introduce young mathematicians, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to
the subjects. The workshop will begin with minicourses followed by individual
lectures on the later days. The mathematical theory of knots is currently a very
active area of mathematics. Knot theory has found application in molecular
biology, for example in testing models of the action of certain recombination
enzymes on DNA. The study of knotted orbits gives a powerful tool in the theory
of 3-dimensional dynamics. Knot theory is connected intimately with questions
such as "what is the shape of our universe?" Our space, which appears
3-dimensional and flat (or 4-dimensional with time) may be curved in on itself
and form what is known as a closed 3-manifold. The deep connection between the
theory of 3-manifolds (and 4-manifolds) with knot theory is the special focus of
this workshop. It is timely, as many long-standing problems in the subjects have
recently been solved, giving rise (of course) to new and deeper problems.
