&lt;br/&gt;The National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) was established in 1998
as a coordinated national plant genome research program by the Interagency
Working Group on Plant Genomes (IWG-PG). In the 10 years since the program
started, the field of plant genomics has made tremendous progress, changing the
way that plant research is conducted, attracting a new generation of scientists
to the field and contributing a wealth of new information and knowledge with
potential application to agriculture. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss
the status of plant genome research in the U.S. after 10 years of the NPGI and
to consider the challenges and opportunities for the next decade. The workshop
will bring together stakeholders with broad range of expertise in high-
throughput genomics, plant biology, bioinformatics and databases drawn from the
academic, private and international sectors. Workshop outcomes will be captured
in the form of a paper to be developed by the workshop participants and
circulated to the broader community. The paper will be accessible through
http://pbio.salk.edu/pbioe/ and TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org).
