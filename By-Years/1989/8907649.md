Instrumentation will be provided for a wave launching facility in support of a
recently completed Large Plasma Device, intended to study a variety of waves and
nonlinear effects in plasmas. The launcher will consist of a high power
broadband amplifier, antenna, signal generators and spectrum analyzers. Low
frequency ion waves and their interaction with particles will be studied;
experiments will also be carried out on plasma dynamos, taking advantage of the
MHD nature of the plasma.
