Our understanding of fundamental problems in the biological sciences requires
new&lt;br/&gt;approaches, new collaborations, and perhaps new ways of doing
science that involve highly&lt;br/&gt;quantitative and mathematical approaches.
The mathematical and biological sciences are&lt;br/&gt;ripe for efforts to blur
the boundaries between mathematical/statistical and
biological&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. New partnerships, new training programs, and
new ideas are needed to promote&lt;br/&gt;research that integrates cutting-edge
math and biological tools. A 1.5 day workshop is&lt;br/&gt;proposed to bring
together senior and junior investigators from the biological
sciences&lt;br/&gt;and the mathematical/statistical sciences. A keynote address
and six talks will be given&lt;br/&gt;on day 1 to highlight the opportunities
and challenges at the math-bio interface. On day&lt;br/&gt;two, a group of
approximately 30 will work together for a half day to brainstorm
ideas,&lt;br/&gt;initiatives, and activities that will enhance math-bio
linkages. The intention is that&lt;br/&gt;this workshop will stimulate many
other activities on campuses, at society meetings, and&lt;br/&gt;within agencies
that together should have synergistic effects in promoting the type
of&lt;br/&gt;research that will help solve complex problems faced by our
society.&lt;br/&gt;
