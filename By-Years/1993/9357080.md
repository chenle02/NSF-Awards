This research project will focus on two main topics: mechanisms of vegetation
change and resource economics. The research will be conducted in areas of the
Florida coast and will investigate the effects of changes in flooding and
salinity regimes on coastal plant communities. Costs and benefits of plant root
system developmental plasticity will also be addressed. %%% Research of this
type should have outputs of considerable importance to the better understanding
and management of fragile coastal environments like marshes.
