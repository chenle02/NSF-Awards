To make sound public policy decisions it is critical that policy makers
understand the values consumers assign to those things policies will impact.
Surveys using hypothetical referendum questions are sometimes used to collect
the information used to estimate these values. Research indicates that if
consumers respond to the survey as if they were participating in a real
referendum vote, the survey will result in unbiased estimates of consumer
values. However, surveys that contains multiple referendum questions and surveys
in which voters believe they have an opportunity to influence government policy
at no cost, generate biased estimate of consumer values. It is important to
understand both the nature and source of this bias as well as how to mitigate it
in order to generate accurate benefits estimates for public policy making. This
study will investigate these questions for three different survey mechanisms:
the double referendum mechanism, the choice experiment mechanism, and an
incentive compatible mechanism. The study will also include an investigation of
the role that ill-defined consumer preferences plays in generating biases in
survey responses.

This research will use the tools of experimental economics to test for the
nature and source of biases in the survey mechanisms described above. The
results of this study will shed light on how the incentive structures of these
alternative survey designs affect the reliability of the resulting benefits
estimates. Such information will allow researchers and policy analysts to design
instruments when can generate improved benefits estimates for policy-making
purposes.
