This Special Project award provides funding for a workshop to bring together
professionals involved in programs and organizations involved in increasing the
cultural diversity in the field of computing and information technologies. The
workshop focus is on priorities with respect to ethnic diversity and access for
persons with disabilities and on organization of a national center to coordinate
activities and raise public awareness of cultural issues related to computing
and information technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
this project lies with the expertise of the participating computing
professionals to contribute to the knowledge and research on cultural diversity
in computing. The broader impacts revolve around the potential for the collected
group to raise public awareness about cultural diversity and to collectively
initiate projects that may broaden the field of computing. &lt;br/&gt;
