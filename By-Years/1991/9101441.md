A new patented method to reduce the oscillatory behavior of electro-mechanical
systems, called Command Input Pulse Shaping, was successfully demonstrated in
Phase I of this SBIR effort. When implemented on essentially single-mode
systems, dramatic improvements in dynamic behavior were observed, with settling
times being reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 5. The current work is to now
implement this technique to more complex multi-mode systems and to refine and
fine tune the procedure to achieve better and quicker results. The economic and
technological impact of this work is potentially tremendous. Almost all electro-
mechanical machinery, in manufacturing and other industries, are constrained in
their ability to perform by their dynamic characteristics that leads to
vibratory motion. A practical technique that can counter this, would have far
reaching consequences in terms of improving performance and allowing the
equipment to perform at increased rates. The economic impact of this possibility
could be significant.
