This is a request for a network of workstations to aid the Biomedical
Engineering Program to upgrade its computational capability. The network will be
used by both students and faculty to develop finite element and other highly
computation-intensive models in biomedical engineering. There are a large number
of projects on a variety topics (such as cardiac mechanics, lung mechanics,
temperature distribution, cellular metabolism) that would benefit from the
upgraded facility.
