Disproportionate attention is paid to low-probability, long-term potential
implications of data science and&lt;br/&gt;artificial intelligence. Meanwhile,
substantial negative impacts are being felt now. One explanation
for&lt;br/&gt;this disconnect is the stark racial, gender, and geographic
detachment of large technology companies from the people--disproportionately
racial and ethnic minorities and women--who feel these negative effects. This
award will support a conference at Rutgers University-Newark centered around the
transformative potential of engaged research around Data Science and Artificial
Intelligence. (Engaged scholarship refers to integrating research, teaching, and
public service. Engaged research in AI and Data Science emphasizes the
importance of not just algorithms, but the data they are trained on, the
problems they are deployed on, and the communities they affect, as well as the
people who do the work.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
