With the advent of modern computers it is possible to tackle the numerical
simulation of condensed matter physics problems using realistic models.
Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational technique which allows the study of
the statistical mechanics of and transport in many.body systems by solving
simultaneously the classical equations of motion of N particles, where N is a
large number. From the experimental point of view, much effort has been invested
to prepare thin films and novel materials using vapor phase deposition
techniques. In spite of the considerable importance that the growth of thin
films has in basic and applied condensed matter physics, only limited effort has
been dedicated to its theoretical understanding. Most of the work to date relies
on phenomenological models relying on a variety of parameters which are hard to
determine experimentally. Some limited amount of numerical simulation has also
been performed mostly using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. For the growth of thin
films however dynamics is of key importance and MC methods are not well suited
to study the dynamical behavior. It is therefore of importance to perform MD
studies in order to understand the role dynamics has in thin film growth. In
many cases, numerical simulation can also provide a guide to experimental
studies. The reason for this is that in numerical studies it is possible to
change parameters independently so that the relative importance of one parameter
with respect to others can be ascertained. Here they propose to use MD to
stimulate and study a variety of problems regarding the vapor phase growth of
thin films as well as a variety of surface related problems.
