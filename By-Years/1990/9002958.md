Professor Salinas will pursue his research on multivariable operator theory,
including Toeplitz C* algebras on bounded domains in n variables, weighted
Wiener-Hopf operators, and joint quasitriangularity of operators and
quasidiagonality of C* algebras. Professor Upmeier will continue and expand his
work on multivariable Toeplitz operators, C* algebras, and index theory. He will
also study quantization procedures on manifolds. Dr. Zhang will continue his
work on the structure of certain simple C* algebras and multiplier and corona
algebras of certain types of C* algebras. The notion of a C* algebra is an
abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These
transformations can also be thought of as having values in the states of the
space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is
that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states
are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches
of mathematics and physics make them important to study.
