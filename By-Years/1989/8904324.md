This project is a study of the intense public debate about the political
persecution of the Argentine people under the 1976-82 military juntas. The
society is now in the process of coming to grips with these activities, and
explaining them to itself. The PI, a cultural anthropologist, will interview
members of four groups in Argentina: the armed forces, the Church, human rights
organizations, and the intelligentsia. The researcher will also observe public
activities, conduct in-depth interviews, and analyze speeches and other public
media. This research is important as several societies in the world are in the
process of reconstruction after periods of intense internal violence.
Understanding how this process takes place will help us understand the behavior
of other nations we interact with.
