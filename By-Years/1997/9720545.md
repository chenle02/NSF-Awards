9720545 Ellis, Carla Schlatter Duke University POWRE: Visiting Professorship:
Systems Research in Adaptation This project supports the research and
educational activities of the PI as a Visiting Professor at the University of
Washington for the 1997-98 academic year. The research investigates the role of
adaptation in computer systems, particularly as it applies to resource
management in clusters of workstations and environments for mobile computing.
Adaptation is an emerging theme in systems research. At all levels of system
design, there are potential performance benefits to be realized by responding to
dynamic variations in runtime behavior and resource availability by applying
distinctly different policies or techniques. The defined research plan
experimentally addresses questions concerning what the best adaptation
strategies are and what infrastructure mechanisms are useful for their
implementation. The methods to be employed include design, implementation, and
measurement of software prototypes to evaluate various adaptation approaches.
This award is expected to have impact on the discovery of new adaptation
techniques to improve mobile and cluster computing performance, encouragement of
women students to enter and to complete advanced degree programs in Computer
Science, and advancement the PI as a senior woman in research and education.
