9730617 Mao This award provides funding for the operation, maintenance, and
further development of an X-ray diffraction facility dedicated for ultra-high-
pressure diamond anvil cell experimentation at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The facility makes use of
the unique characteristics of the brilliant X-radiation produced by the wiggler
magnet at the NSLS beamline X17C to characterize the physical and chemical
properties of materials subjected to pressure (up to four million atmospheres)
held between the jaws of a diamond anvil cell. ***
