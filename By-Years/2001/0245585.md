This symposium will bring together about thirty leading thinkers and policy
makers in several related areas of cyberinfrastructure for science, including
scientific collaboratories, grid computing, and e-science environments. The goal
is to bring together international representatives of these movements and
communities to better create mutual awareness and understanding and to
accelerate research, development, and deployment of these new environments to
support science. A related objective is to articulate both the technical and
social/organizational prerequisites for success in these endeavors. This nascent
movement has profound implications for science education, for education and
research in the humanities and for the future of the entire higher education
enterprise.
