Dr. McKitrick at the University of Michigan will study evolutionary
relationships within a large group of birds that includes the sandpipers,
stilts, plovers, gulls, terns and auks (Order Charadriiformes). This group is of
great interest from an evolutionary perspective because its members, while
presumably closely related, show a wide variety of adaptations for life in and
around water and are consequently a very diverse assemblage. Many of these
adaptations have involved internal as well as external anatomical changes. This
has led to spirited debate among biologists about the significance of certain
anatomical similarities and differences among these birds: do the similarities
reflect close genealogical relationship or are they merely independent
occurrences that have evolved in response to similar environmental conditions?
This proposal will address such questions using data from the hindlimb
musculature and from the anatomy of the vocal apparatus. The study will yield
hypotheses about genealogical relationships within the group, as well as about
how the internal anatomy has evolved. The study will also result in a large body
of descriptive data that will be of great use in other comparative studies about
evolutionary trends in vertebrate anatomy.
