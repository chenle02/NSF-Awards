9457148 Blumenthal All optical photonic switch networks shall be studied, by
developing and experimentally implementing new bufferlens all-optical routing
techniques. These techniques will be applied to novel multiwavelength photonic
switch architectures. Physical limitations to the size and scale of multihop
multiwavelength networks will be experimentally investigated. ***
