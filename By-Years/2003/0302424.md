ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geosciences Institute for Education and
Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth Science Program at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn will develop an annual research program for selected grade
5-12 teachers and students from the Detroit Public School System. The program is
designed to extend research and learning opportunities in the geosciences to
underrepresented groups within the City of Detroit. This project addresses two
problems. People of color comprise 80% of the population within the City of
Detroit, but they comprise less than 10% of all science majors at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn, and fewer than 3% of geoscience majors. In addition, Earth
Science is now required to be taught in the 5th, 8th and 11th grades in Michigan
public schools, but fewer than 2% of the teachers who regularly teach these
classes have ever had a college-course in geology. NSF funding will be used to
develop the fundamental program, which, if successful, will continue with
support from the Detroit Public Schools and the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
The program will consist of a three-week session whereby 10 selected teachers
and a maximum of 20 of their students will participate in geoscience research
projects located within southeast Michigan. During the three-week session the
students will spend two days each week in the classroom and laboratory for an
introduction to the research problem. The remaining time will be spent in the
field assisting faculty, graduate and undergraduate students with ongoing
research projects. Following the three-week session, the teachers and their
students will maintain contact with the faculty through a specially developed
web site. Teachers and students will assist UM-Dearborn faculty and students in
presenting the preliminary research results to the Geosciences Session at the
Michigan Academy of Arts, Sciences and Letters Annual Meeting.
