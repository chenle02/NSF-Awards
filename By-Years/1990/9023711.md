This is a three-year program in Theoretical Modeling of Microelectromechanical
Systems combining the efforts of investigators from the Electrical Engineering
and Civil Engineering Department at Case Western Reserve University. The program
objectives are to carry out theoretical studies to gain a fundamental
understanding of electromechanical and (mechanical) interface characteristics of
microfabricated electromechanical devices and to produce models which can
predict the electromechanical performance of these devices. A thorough
understanding of these electromechanical and interface properties as well as
predictive theoretical models is necessary for successful design and fabrication
of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The research program is organized into
two parts: (i) development of advanced computational techniques for
electromagnetic, (mechanical) stress, and coupled electromagnetic/stress fields
analysis in microelectromechanical devices and (ii) development of theoretical
interface models for friction, lubrication, and wear in microelectromechanical
devices. These two parts have a synergetic relation toward the objectives stated
above.
