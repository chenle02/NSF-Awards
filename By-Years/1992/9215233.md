This research continues the study of generic stochastic manufacturing systems.
It includes the development of further results on simple almost optimal
heuristics for parallel machine scheduling. It also examines a wide range of
flow line problems, including probabilistic analysis of deterministic scheduling
rules, new models for tandem lines with dependent service times, and some new
performance measures aimed at reduced Work-In-Process and Just- In-Time
manufacturing. New approaches to control of queueing networks and jobshops, such
as Bandit problems and Brownian networks that may yield robust, simple, priority
scheduling rules will be explored. Some recently started work in scheduling of a
metal rolling mill, will provide a practical testbed for the combined
application of stochastic and deterministic models. Here the stochastic models
provide long term optimal throughput, while short term deterministic algorithms
minimize setup and changeover costs. This is a realistic approach for the
increasing uncertainty as the time horizon lengthens. Technology transfer will
be achieved through the implementation of case studies and development of
constructional manuals and tutorials for curriculum in manufacturing systems.
