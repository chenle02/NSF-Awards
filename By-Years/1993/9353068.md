9353068 Baggett This project investigates the use of calculators in teaching
mathematics in grades kindergarten through five. From the beginning children are
exposed to real numbers (not just positive integers), and they learn to perform
arithmetic operations mentally on simple numbers and with a calculator
otherwise. Drill is replaced by project-like lessons in which children are
active participants. Children use real objects, make measurements, and engage in
interdisciplinary activities as essential parts of the lessons. The Jackson
Intermediate School District, Michigan, the University of Michigan, and the
University of Colorado, are collaborating in the project. Teachers have been
using many lesson units for several years in a number of participating schools.
The planned outcome is to have a complete classroom-tested set of K-5
educational materials, three videotapes of classroom calculator activities ***
