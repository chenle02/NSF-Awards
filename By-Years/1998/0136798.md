Traditionally, Comparative Advantage had been the foundational logic that best
frames the understanding of trade. A second alternative, that focuses on the
Advantages of Specialization, offers an argument for the opening of markets that
commands relatively more public support. Neoclassical economics was derived on
the basis of comparative advantage because it allowed for constant returns
postulate, without which a competitive economy seemed impossible. Only in the
1980's and 1990's, attention was directed to Adam Smith's emphasis on
specialization and the size of the market. Modern analyses, not only
demonstrates compatibility with competitive organization, but also identify
sources of endogenous growth. These modern developments have been systematically
presented in Xiaokai Yang's treatise, Economics: New Classical versus
Neoclassical Framework (Blackwell, 2001). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of
the workshop is to stimulate examination of this emerging research program,
which young scientists will not have encountered in their textbooks or in
orthodox training. The workshop will expose them to Professor Yang, and to a
critical evaluation of his treatise, in the expectation that they will,
themselves, shift some of their interests to "generalized increasing returns"
and its implications.&lt;br/&gt;
