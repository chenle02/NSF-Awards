9714939 Winter Funding provided by this grant will provide a workstation which
is needed to support the educational and research goals of the University of
Puerto Rico which includes a Department of Atmospheric Sciences. The McIDAS
program has initiated much interest in weather phenomena, especially of the
Caribbean region, amongst the students and faculty. In the fall of 1997 the
present UNIDATA facilities will be moved to a new larger location. While UNIDATA
software currently runs on a loaned computer, students and facilty need their
own UNIX workstations. The University of Puerto Rico has committed matching
funds to supply the necessary number of PCs which will be networked to the
workstation and provide students with a unique experience to study
meteorological phenomena. A large number of students are expected to take this
landmark course in meteorology which should build the necessary human resources
to lead Puerto Rico in atmospheric research and teaching.
