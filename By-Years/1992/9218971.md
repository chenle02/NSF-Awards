In this renewal, PIs will, in collaboration with Mexican colleagues, finish
work on an interdisciplinary study of an early Jurassic assemblage of small
fossil vertebrates from Huizachal Canyon, NE Mexico. These fossils represent a
rare example of the apparently cosmopolitan, low-diversity fauna distributed
throughout most of Pangaea after the end-Triassic extinction. Three lines of
research to be completed are 1) study some newly discovered fossils, including
skulls of a new sphenodontian, 2) collect and analyze pollen from appropriate
localities, and 3) extend the stratigraphy into neighboring canyons to establish
lithostratigraphic relationships of the fossil-bearing beds. Some additional
geochemical analyses and radiometric dating will be conducted to help establish
the age of these fossil-bearing strata.
