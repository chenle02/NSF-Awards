The 17th Workshop on Combinatorial and Additive Number Theory (CANT 2019) will
take place at the CUNY Graduate Center on May 21-24, 2019. This year's edition
will be a "Jean Bourgain memorial meeting" celebrating the seminal work of Jean
Bourgain in the field of combinatorial and additive number theory. The
conference features fourteen plenary talks by renown leaders in the field and is
expected to attract a diverse group of participants, including junior
researchers, women and members of underrepresented groups.

The plenary talks will address both the combinatorial, number theoretic and
analytic aspects of Bourgain's work. A particular topic that will be addressed
in several of the talks are consequences and applications of the Bourgain-
Demeter decoupling theory. More details can be found on
