Design engineers are challenged with determining how to modify design variables
in order to realize desired performance goals. For highly complex situations,
the number of performance criteria that must be simultaneously considered far
exceeds the number that a human engineer can comfortably contemplate. These
performance criteria are typically highly non-linear functions of a large number
of design variables, and few tools are available to assist engineers in managing
such design spaces. The objective of this research is to provide a new method
for representing complex high-dimension, highly non-linear design spaces. A
hyperdimensional B-spline object (HyPerMap) is fit to data from design
iterations (either simulations or experiments), resulting in a system that
relates performance indices to variations in design variables. The system map is
used to explore the design space, make optimal design decisions, and understand
the impact of uncertainty on decisions. Furthermore, the B-spline based HyPerMap
structure offers computational advantages over competing techniques during
generation, evolution, evaluation, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact
of this work will be an enhanced ability to design complex systems. Discussions
with representatives from industry and research laboratories have convinced us
that this research addresses a real need in the area of complex systems design.
Our computational approach represents an opportunity to introduce a scientific
foundation to a previously experiential process and to provide a basis for
design optimization with knowledge of the associated system performance error
and uncertainty. Thus, we expect the approach will also provide educational
benefits for students of engineering design, particularly through the use of the
resulting tools for complex systems design. &lt;br/&gt;
