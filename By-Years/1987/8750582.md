The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Hunter College will introduce a new
laboratory for physics majors. Students taking this new laboratory will have had
an already existing lecture course and laboratory in the fundamentals of
electronics. The equipment purchases will allow physics majors access to
microcomputers (personal computers) used to (1) control experiments and (2)
collect data from probes placed in the experiment. The five experiments which
will be used are in the areas of heat (thermodynamics), properties of magnetic
materials, properties of repetitive or oscillatory motion (nonlinear harmonic
motion). The students will also see how a computer collects data from an
experiment through various kinds of probes which sense the temperature and other
quantities in time. The digital computer cannot make continuous measurements of
(for example) temperature as it changes with time but instead must measure the
temperature at discrete but closely spaced time intervals. This process of
digitizing is quite interesting in itself and the student will learn what
conditions must be met so that the digitizing is done properly and the result is
faithful to the phenomena measured. The major equipment proposed for purchase
are six Macintosh microcomputers, chosen for their ease of use by the student.
Also, proposed for purchase are (1) the equipment to perform the experiments,
(2) the probes that sense or collect the data from the experiment, and (3) the
equipment which connects the signal from the experimental probe to the computer
(the computer interface).
