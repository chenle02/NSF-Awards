The future of information technology industry depends on designing computer
systems that are tolerant of errors caused by variations in device
characteristics. Traditionally system reliability is achieved by replicating
critical system components. Since variability induced errors occur slowly over
time, replication for the sole purpose of providing reliability is prohibitively
expensive for low cost computing platforms. This research explores using 3D
stacking to implement redundant components and variability monitoring circuitry
on a 3D stacked die. Using 3D stacking the redundant computation blocks can be
built using a variation resilient process technology that may be slower than the
process technology used for building the primary processor. This research takes
a holistic approach to designing the 3D stacked monitoring spanning from
innovative microarchitecture solutions to exploiting application's inherent
error tolerance. On the microarchitecture front, this research explores the
potential for seamlessly reconfiguring the monitoring layer to act in three
modes: performance assists, when variability induced errors are rare, or as
guard processors, when variability induced errors begin to appear, or as backup
processors, when device aging may result in irreparable errors on the primary
processing substrate. On the architecture front, this research explores a new
exception class called Reliability Aware Exceptions that allow microarchitecture
blocks to raise an exception in response to a variability induced error. These
software visible exceptions can then be exploited by application classes that
are inherently error tolerant and can customized exception handling mechanisms.
