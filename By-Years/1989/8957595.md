This award provides support to Dr. Jeffrey S. Banks under the National Science
Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program. The objective of
this program is to provide research support to the Nation's most outstanding and
promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and teaching. This award will allow the investigator to
pursue his research concerning the fundamental structure of collective choice
and public institutions. His theoretical, statistical and experimental work on
this broad topic spans the disciplines of political science and economics and
methodologically ranges across game theory. The main thrust of his current
research involves a signaling games approach. Signaling games are two-person
sequential-move games in which the first mover possesses information concerning
payoffs relevant to the second mover's decision calculus. They can serve as an
appropriate framework for the study of a variety of economic interactions in
which asymmetric information is available to the participants, among them job
market signaling, limit pricing, predatory behavior, and tax auditing. Dr.
Banks' early research led to the derivation of well-defined refinements of the
sequential equilibrium concept which permits narrowing the focus of attention to
a tractable set of strategies. Next, he applied the signaling games framework
and the selection criteria to a variety of political economy models including
models of agenda control, electoral competition, legislative oversight, and
regulatory auditing. He is currently extending his analytic approach to wider
classes of incomplete information games which facilitates generalization of
previous signaling models to a more dynamic setting. His work is moving toward
the development of models which will better mirror the reality of complex
substantive issues in political economy. Dr. Banks' excellent technical skills
along with his broad vision of the applicability of economic and political
concepts offer an important contribution to the development of knowledge about
information transmission across electoral, legislative and bureaucratic
settings.
