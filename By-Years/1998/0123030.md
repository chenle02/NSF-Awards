PROJECT SUMMARY This project is providing the equivalent of 32 full-time
scholarships per year to students from educationally under-served backgrounds
ranging from rural to inner-city environments. In addition to access to a
quality education, the students receive both faculty and peer mentoring, time
and resource management counseling, and, if needed, tutoring at no cost. During
the junior and senior years, students have the opportunity to undertake
research, participate in technological leadership seminars and engage in
cooperative education which allows them to simultaneously earn money for
educationally related expenses and obtain experience in their chosen career
field.
