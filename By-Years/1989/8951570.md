This project will support the purchase of laboratory and computing equipment
which will be used to restructure the teaching of applied mathematics courses at
the University of New Hampshire. It is being funded under the Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the
quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. The purpose of the laboratory will be to
establish a setting where students will confront three important components of a
mathematical application: (1) the reality of the system under study, (2) the
mathematical model of that reality, and (3) the computational algorithms which
are used to relate the two. Students will be enabled (1) to develop and explore
mathematical models of a variety of systems which display fundamental physical
and engineering concepts and processes, (2) to conduct laboratory experiments
based on these systems and collect data describing the systems' behavior, (3) to
analyze the data using modern computational methods, and (4) to use the results
of the experiments to explore the validity of their models and the algorithms
used in their analyses.
