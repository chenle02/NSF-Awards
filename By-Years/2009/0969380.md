Almost all of the visible mass that we see in the universe is contained in the
atomic nucleus. It is of vital importance to gain experimental data about how
nuclei are constructed to explain the early history of the universe, the
abundances of the chemical elements in our solar system and even the
distribution of these elements in our galaxy. An excellent nucleus to study for
this purpose is the common isotope of helium, He-4. This nucleus will be a
subject of study at Jefferson Lab by measuring the probability of knocking out
protons with different energies using the high-energy electron beam. Another
method of gaining insight into how nuclei are constructed is by placing short
lived particles called hyperons in nuclei and observing the energy levels of
these hypernuclei. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will provide vital
training for graduate students and undergraduate students in nuclear and
particle physics. The activities of these students will include helping set up
the experiments, making the experimental measurements, analyzing the data and
learning sophisticated simulation techniques. There is a desperate need for well
trained physicists in the near future. The training the students receive has
been shown to be transferable to other fields besides physics that benefit from
the keen analytical skills they learn.
