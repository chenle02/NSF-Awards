This project is aimed at generating an experimental protein system designed to
simultaneously develop a fundamental materials processing capability, and to
develop a fundamental understanding of interfacial protein-inorganic crystal
molecular recognition. The key contribution of this work arises from the
experimental capability to precisely control the three-dimensional spatial
distribution of carboxylate residues on a protein surface. Two proteins,
streptavidin and protein G, have been carefully selected for this study. They
both have a predominance of beta-sheet and delta-helix secondary structure, and,
thus, provide a defined scaffolding on which to manipulate the placement of
glutamic and aspartic acid side chains. The resolution and three-dimensional
spatial control provided by genetic engineering capabilities cannot be currently
matched by other techniques. This work thus represents a unique and powerful
addition to the experimental characterization of molecular recognition in
biomineralization.
