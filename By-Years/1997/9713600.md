Earth's ionosphere, the final link in the solar-terrestrial connection, is
fundamental to understanding conditions where solar perturbations result in
damage to technological systems, such as power distribution systems, navigation
aids, and communication networks. The investigators, recognizing this need, are
creating a novel event-driven protocol adapting the Sondrestrom radar
operational mode, data analysis, and data dissemination to the specific needs of
space weather modeling and specification teams. Specifically, the Sondrestrom
Radar Response System (SRRS) will enable operation during periods subsequent to
detection of a coronal mass ejection, from beginning to end. Coronal mass
ejections can be detected early with upstream monitors such as SOHO and WIND
satellites, and their probability for terrestrial impact can then be better
calculated. The design and implementation of the SRRS will greatly accelerate
the development of near-real time electrodynamic specification tools for
eventual integration into space weather forecasting models.
