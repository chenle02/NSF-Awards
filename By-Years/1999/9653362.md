Summer Institute in Demography The College of Arts and Sciences at Fayetteville
State University requests support for a week-long Summer Institute in Population
Studies with a focus on African American demographics. The Institute is intended
to enhance the teaching of selected sociology faculty from undergraduate
colleges and universities particularly those from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs). The Summer Institute offers intensive seminars and
programs to improve faculty participants knowledge on social demography with
special emphasis on African Americans. Faculty members in sociology and related
fields in the social sciences who teach in undergraduate programs will be
selected to participate in the summer Institute. The major objective of the
Institute is to encourage the participants to incorporate demographic methods
and data into the undergraduate curricula. This will enhance the teaching
effectiveness of demographic and population studies courses, and introduce a
multi-cultural framework to the curricula by using a comparative perspective
with focus on African Americans. An earlier workshop conducted in the summer of
1992, with a 2-day follow-up in the summer of 1993 was very effective in
achieving this objective.
