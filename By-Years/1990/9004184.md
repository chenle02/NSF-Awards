The proposed program of research is designed to improve our understanding of the
chemical evolution of seawater during the last 600 m.y. of Earth history. To
accomplish this, we plan to extend our analytical data base for the chemical
composition of brines in fluid inclusions trapped in halite (NaCl) in marine
evaporites. Many of these brines are samples of the solutions from which the
salt precipitated. In marine evaporites these brines are largely or entirely
derived from seawater; their composition therefore reflects the composition of
seawater at the time of salt precipitation. In many instances the evolution of
these brines from seawater has been so complicated, that little information
regarding the composition of the parent seawater can be gained from the
composition of the inclusion fluids. Fortunately, the evolution of the brines in
some marine evaporites has been sufficiently simple, so that much of the
chemistry of the starting seawater can be reconstructed. The data accumulated to
date indicate that the composition of seawater has been surprisingly
conservative during the past 600 m.y. At present these data are still
fragmentary. We propose to extend them considerably, and to construct a
reasonably complete record of the composition of seawater during the Phanerozoic
Eon.
