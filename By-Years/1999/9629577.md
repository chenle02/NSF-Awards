9629577 Paulson Alkenes are important chemical species for the formation of
oxidizing compounds within the troposphere. On a global scale, alkenes comprise
the majority of non-methane hydrocarbon emissions, and roughly half of the
carbon that reacts through an ozone-alkene chemical reaction, does so by forming
short-lived Criegee reaction intermediates. The research supported by this award
is expected to make significant contributions to the understanding of the
mechanism of ozone-alkene reactions in the troposphere, especially those
involving photochemical reactions of biogenic alkenes with tropospheric ozone.
The project examines the kinetics and mechanism of ozone-alkene reactions using
Teflon batch reactors in conjunction with GC/FID/MS, gas phase FTIR spectroscopy
and FTIR/matrix isolation analytical techniques. The experimental approach
focuses on the decomposition and reaction pathways of Criegee reaction
intermediates. Study of the chemical reaction mechnisms involving Criegee
intermediates has important possibilities for understanding the processes that
control the formation of oxidants in the troposphere. Overall, the goals
described in the research project would lead to a significant improvement of our
understanding of atmospheric reactions involving alkenes, and hence of air
pollution and tropospheric chemistry. ATM-9629353
