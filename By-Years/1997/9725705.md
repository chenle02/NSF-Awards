9725705 Norton High rates of atmospheric deposition of beryllium are toxic
biologically and are exacerbated by synergistic interaction with aluminum. The
Czech Republic is experiencing growing problems, and similar consequences may
well soon be experienced in Maine. An expert international research team would
pursue parallel pilot studies into the biogeochemical controls on Be fate and
transport by examining beryllium biogeochemistry in forested ecosystems. This
project funds the work in Maine and travel for international collaboration; the
Czechs are supporting the work in their country. The plan for the pilot study is
to develop chemical time series for beryllium fluxes into, through, and out of
watersheds in a paired study in the Bear Brook Watershed where one watersheds is
being artificially acidified with ammonium sulfate. The study evaluates the
fluxes of total BE and 7Be at the forest floor, leaving the watersheds, and in
litter fall. Be in stream vegetation and sediment is being evaluated before and
after acidic discharge events to assess temporary exchangeable pools.
