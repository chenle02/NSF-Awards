9410399 Alford This investigation will study the low temperature oxidation of Si
in contact with Cu-Silicide. The kinetics of the phenomena, characterization of
the oxide layer, and use of the orientation dependence on growth rate to form
vertical isolation oxides in integrated circuits shall be investigated. At room
temperature Cu-silicide forms an oxide layer between the Si and silicide
interface when exposed to air. The oxide layer grows to a thickness of several
microns in a period of weeks. The growth kinetics, will be characterized to
obtain activation energy, substrate orientation, identity of moving species (use
of implanted makers), and influence of dopants and impurities. The integrity of
the growth oxide will be quantified by electrical measurements (MOS capacitor
structures, I-V, C-V), ion-beam analysis (composition, density, and impurities),
and transmission electron microscopy (microstructure). ***
