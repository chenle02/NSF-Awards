The High End Computing (HEC) field is at a major crossroads due to the advent of
many-core technology --- integration of tens and hundred processors (cores) on a
single chip, heading to 1000 cores per chip in Exascale systems in the 2015-2020
timeframe. Unlike previous generations of hardware evolution, this shift in the
hardware road-map will have a profound impact on future HEC software. First, the
programmer will be faced with the scalability challenge of expressing and
managing parallelism at the scale of millions to one billion threads in a single
system. Second, the programmer will be faced with the locality challenge of
optimizing data movement in a highly non-uniform system structure with order-of-
magnitude gaps in bandwidth and latency between adjacent levels of the memory
hierarchy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific focus of this project is on
developing programming models, compilers, and runtimes to address the above
challenges of future HEC systems, guided by a specific many-core architecture to
ensure practicality. The research will deliver results in the following areas:
1) new parallel programming constructs for many-core architectures such as
asynchronous activities, places, and phasers that build on past experiences with
the X10 language, but will be manifested in C/C++ instead of Java in this
research; 2) new parallel intermediate representations (PIR?s) and compiler
optimizations for parallelism and locality; 3) a new thread virtual machine with
two levels of parallelism, Synchronous Coarse-Grain Threads (SCTs) and
Asynchronous Fine-Grain Threads (AFTs); and 4) evaluation of the programming
model, compiler, and runtime on a Cyclops C64 many-core system that directly
exemplifies the parallelism and locality challenges facing future HEC systems.
