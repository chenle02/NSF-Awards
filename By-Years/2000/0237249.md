This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports research and educational activities in chemical synthesis by
Professor Paul Chirik and his research group in the Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Biology at Cornell University. The goal of the research is to develop
transition metal reagents to induce reactivity in otherwise inert molecules.
Professor Chirik and coworkers are particularly interested in learning how the
environment around the metal center can be manipulated to induce reactivity with
elemental nitrogen, phosphorus and aliphatic carbon-carbon bonds. Ultimately,
these studies may allow construction of new pharmaceuticals and other commodity
and specialty chemicals from underutilized natural resources. Educational
activities connected with this research are designed to demonstrate the vital
role chemical synthesis plays in modern society. These concepts will be
presented as part of an introductory chemistry course for engineers, a graduate
course for first year students, as well as in community programs designed to
reach children and adults in the local area.

This research strives to fix elemental nitrogen, which can be derived from air,
and elemental phosphorous, directly into organic molecules through new methods
that could lead to more energy efficient industrial processes. Educational
activities will be developed to demonstrate to students both in higher education
and in the surrounding community the vital role that chemical synthesis plays in
modern society.
