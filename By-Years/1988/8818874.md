The evolution of parental care, especially by males, is poorly understood in
insects because it is so rare, and few studies exist on mating systems in
monogamous species. Male and female burying beetles (Nicrophorus spp.) cooperate
to bury small carcasses, establish and maintain a brood chamber, feed and guard
offspring for extended periods of time. The PI's investigations to date suggest
that the amount of paternal investment of N. orbicollis is dependent on a
balance between the number of offspring reared by a deserting versus a care-
giving male, the probability that the carcass will be taken over by another
burying beetle and the brood killed, and the probability that a deserting male
can find a new carcass and rear another brood instead of rearing the present
brood. This study will investigate the probabilities for each of these factors
on a natural population in Jaffrey, New Hampshire. Silphid beetles are a good
choice of animal to use in the study of the evolution of parental care and
monogamy because the principal factors affecting the number of young that can be
raised can be quantified and manipulated in a simple manner that generates
straight-forward results. Moreover, the proposed research is highly feasible
because the beetles are abundant, easily reared and maintained in the laboratory
and easy to observe in the field and under simulated-field conditions. All
behavioral and ecological aspects if parental care and the results of this care
can be quantified and related to each other as components of total reproductive
strategy. The results will provide a detailed, holistic picture of the costs and
benefits of providing extended parental investment and will contribute to our
understanding of the evolutionary ecology of parental care.
