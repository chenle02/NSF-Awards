In the first few years of life, children learn a great deal about the causal
structure of the world around them; they learn how some events make other events
happen. This knowledge is reflected in children's everyday "theories" of the
world. How does this learning take place? This research program will investigate
the underlying mechanisms for causal learning in children. In particular, the
research will explore how children use information about contingencies between
events, such as the fact that one event always follows another event, to draw
conclusions about causal relationships. It will investigate how children learn
about inhibitory causes, interactive causes and hidden, unobserved causes. This
work is informed by recent work in computer science and statistics that shows
how computers can make accurate causal inferences. This work should have
significant broader impact for educational practice. Causal relationships play a
crucial role in scientific knowledge. If we understand children's basic natural
causal learning mechanisms, we can use this understanding to help teach science
more effectively. Similarly, this research has impact for studies of
developmental disabilities such as autism and mental retardation. There is
reason to think that children with these syndromes may have particular
difficulty with causal learning, and understanding natural causal learning may
help us understand and remedy these difficulties.
