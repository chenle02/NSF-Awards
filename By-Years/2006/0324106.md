The project initiates a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
Scholarship program for undergraduate students in computer science and
mathematics. The project provides scholarships for academically talented,
financially needy students, enabling them to enter the high technology workforce
following completion of a baccalaureate degree. The project accomplishes the
following objectives: increases the number of graduates and the retention of
students in the two disciplines, provides enhanced educational opportunities,
improves student support services, and strengthens partnerships between the
CSEMS departments and high technology industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, the program maintains a group 30 students each year to receive a
$3125 scholarship. The program will be advertised throughout eastern Kentucky.
The management team select Scholars based on indicators, such as high school
G.P.A., letters of recommendation from teachers, and Math ACT sub-scores.
Support services for the Scholars include special course sections reserved for
the Scholars, academic tutoring opportunities, faculty mentors, a seminar series
in mathematics and computer science, and a shadowing program with local
businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars participate in an intense mentoring
program with faculty mentors, who sponsor monthly advising and support services.
Scholars participate in career-planning seminars conducted by the Director of
Career Services and receive instruction in interviewing skills and resume
writing. For a period of six months after graduation, faculty mentors contact
graduates bimonthly in order to track job placement or job
satisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;
