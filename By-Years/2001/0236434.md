Krishnan Balasubramanian of UC-Davis is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply relativistic quantum
chemical methods to study the clusters of main group, semiconductor, and super-
heavy elements. Spectra, properties, and reactivities will be predicted in order
to interpret recent experimental findings. Also, relativistic quantum dynamics
with computed potential energy surfaces that include spin-orbit coupling will be
investigated.

Precursors in metal-organic chemical vapor deposition used in semiconductor
production include novel heterocyclic molecules. Experimental studies of these
species will be aided by the insight, interpretation, and prediction of their
properties provided by this research. In addition, the chemistry of super-heavy
elements, which have a very short lifetime, can only be understood by coupling
the guidance of theoretical calculations to available empirical data.
