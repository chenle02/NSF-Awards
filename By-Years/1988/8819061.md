This award provides funding from the Minority Research Initiation Program to
support a workshop on proposal writing for scientists from historically black
colleges and universities. The workshop will be held at Hampton University on
March 17 and 18, 1989. The representation of minorities in leadership positions
in scientific research is a matter of concern to NSF. This workshop is an effort
to facilitate and encourage the submission of research proposals by minority
physicists.
