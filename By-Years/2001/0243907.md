Proposal ID: AST-0243907&lt;br/&gt;Institution: California State University Los
Angeles&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gillam, Stephen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stephen Gillam is
awarded funds through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program to
continue CURE (the Consortium for Undergraduate Research Experience). Based at
California State University, Los Angeles (CSLA), the consortium includes Los
Angeles City College, Los Angeles Southwest College, East Los Angeles College,
Los Angeles Valley College, Pasadena City College, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL). The objective of CURE is to encourage underrepresented
minorities to select science or engineering as a career. Every year, ten
students will be recruited from the CURE institutions for a ten-week research
program in the summer. Some of the students will continue their projects part-
time throughout the academic year. Scientific mentors will be drawn primarily
from CSLA and JPL. The available research facilities include the JPL Oak Grove
facility, the Table Mountain Observatory, and equipment at CSLA. &lt;br/&gt;
