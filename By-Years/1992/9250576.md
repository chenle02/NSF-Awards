This project provides support for acquisition of image processing equipment to
be used in concurrent signal processing/controls laboratories. The control
systems laboratory is well-equipped and well-established while the undergraduate
signal processing laboratory is a relatively new addition to the department and
is currently being redeveloped to include a number of basic image processing
experiments. This award will allow the acquisition of equipment to enable joint
projects for students of both laboratories to work together in parallel efforts.
The purpose of the project, then, is to teach young engineers how to collaborate
with engineers with different specialties, to understand concurrent engineering,
and to work well as a team under these circumstances.
