9614256 Otto Accumulating evidence suggest that the parahippocampal cortical
region plays an important role in memory processes, the precise contribution of
the parahippocampal cortical region to normal memory, and the way in which
damage to this area impairs memory, is poorly understood. The proposed studies
entail a systematic investigation of the role of the parahippocampal cortical
region in memory processes. An initial series of studies involve the development
of an associative memory task that based on neuroanatomical considerations, will
actively engage and critically depend on neural circuitry within the
parahippocampal cortical region. The remaining studies entail an
electrophysiological examination of the response properties of individual
neurons within the parahippocampal cortical region during learning of this task.
It is expected that these cells will change their response patterns during
learning such that they will become more responsive to stimuli used during
training, reflecting a learning-induced "plasticity" of responsiveness. These
data will provide valuable insight into the ways in which the parahippocampal
cortical region participates in memory processes in general.
