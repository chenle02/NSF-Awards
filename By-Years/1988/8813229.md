NYSERNET, Inc., proposes to develop software which will provide Internet access
to bibliographic database materials which are available to scholars today only
indirectly or via low-speed low- function terminal networks. They propose to
undertake this work in close cooperation with OCLC and other information
suppliers. The key element of the project is a bridge from the suppliers' OSI
protocols to the Internet TCP/IP protocols, forming a useful step in the NSFNET
transition to OSI protocols. This work when completed will advance that
transition by allowing information suppliers to develop products now for the
coming OSI environment while serving the large academic TCP/IP marketplace in
the short term.***
