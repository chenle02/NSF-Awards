This research is on an interconnect-centric layout design methodology
incorporating on-chip inductance into the methodology. Specifically, the
following problems are explored: (1) accurate modeling and analysis techniques
for multiple coupled RLC interconnects; (2) efficient algorithms for
interconnect synthesis to optimize performance and signal integrity for coupled
RLC nets; (3) efficient algorithms for pre-layout interconnect estimation
considering a comprehensive set of interconnect optimization techniques, and
application of estimation results to interconnect architecture planning; and (4)
efficient algorithms for pre-layout estimation of maximum switching current for
functional blocks followed by optimization of the power supply structure using
the RLC model. In addition, this project investigates an innovative computer
engineering curriculum incorporating interconnect and System-On-Chip (SOC)
considerations, and development of Web-based interconnect planning tools for use
in innovative teaching and for outreach beyond the campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
