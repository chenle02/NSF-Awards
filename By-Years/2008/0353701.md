This interdisciplinary program emphasizes the science of behavior. Each summer
12 undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in this eight-week
REU Site. REU student participants will be encouraged to investigate the causes
and effects of human, animal, and human-animal interactions. This includes
various aspects of the behavioral and social sciences including psychology,
behavioral biology, ethology, anthropology, ethnohistory, and criminology. The
academic objectives for this summer program are: provide students the
opportunity to design and carry out a research project; enhance students'
understanding of the scientific process; provide an educational environment in
which to explore possible career choices in the various behavioral sciences; and
help students understand the value that research can play in their occupational
and personal lives. The Site will include an ethics-training component, as well
as workshops on such topics as SPSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
