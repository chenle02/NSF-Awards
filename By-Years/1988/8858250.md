Relativistic quantum field theories which describe the nucleus as a system of
nucleons interacting through various meson fields are being studied by Robert
Perry in an effort to identify critical elements of the theory which can be used
to test their relevance. This requires isolating nuclear phenomena that can be
accurately predicted in a strongly-interacting field theory, and that are most
naturally understood as quantum corrections which are unique to field theories.
Professor Perry has focussed his attention on the polarization of the nuclear
vacuum, which is neglected in traditional calculations, and has developed new
analytic tools to study experimental signatures of such vacuum polarization
effects. He is also working on simple models in which the behavior of
macroscopic degrees of freedom can be consistently derived from the dynamics of
their quark constituents. This research on nuclear quantum field theories is at
an interface between particle and nuclear physics and seeks to achieve a deeper
understanding of a many-body system which is unique in physics, the atomic
nucleus.
