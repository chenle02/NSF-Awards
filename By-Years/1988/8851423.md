The project is removing four perceived deficiencies in the Chemistry curriculum.
The deficiencies are: 1) lack of student exposure to modern, computerized
instrumentation; 2) lack of laboratory courses at an advanced level; 3) lack of
any laboratory work in the important area of polymer chemistry; and 4) lack of
modern instrumentation to maintain a vigorous undergraduate research program.
The grant is allowing the purchase of modern computerized spectroscopic
instruments, computers to control them, equipment to introduce polymer chemistry
into the curriculum, and a rapid kinetics spectrometer. The instruments are
being used to revamp entirely the first term of the junior level physical
chemistry laboratory that is taken by all chemistry majors. In addition, the
second term of the physical chemistry sequence that features kinetics and
spectroscopy is also being substantially changed in order to incoporate the new
capabilities into the laboratory. A new course in the chemical applications of
magnetic resonance is being added to the curriculum to give students laboratory
experience at the advanced level. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
