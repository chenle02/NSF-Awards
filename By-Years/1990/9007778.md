This is a Research Equipment Grant in the area of power electronics. The work
which will be impacted by the grant is in the modelling, design, and control of
brushless motor drive systems. The specific project relates to the real time
digital control of a brushless machine. It is expected that the equipment will
permit an improved actuation method for torque control based on integral
manifold techniques. The digital equipment permits capability for digital
measurement of torque, and inductance as well as electrical states.
