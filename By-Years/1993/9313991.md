9313991 Aller Planetary nebulae represent material which was ejected from
highly evolved stars. Its composition contains clues about the evolution of
stars and the ejecta are an important source of heavy elements in the
interstellar medium. The abundances of elements in planetary nebulae will be
determined using high quality spectra now available from the Lick Observatory
Echelle Spectrograph and new modeling techniques. ***
