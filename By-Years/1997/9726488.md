This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research in the laboratory of Professor Carl J. Carrano at Southwest
Texas State University under the initiative on Research at Undergraduate
Institutions. This research will explore the chemistry of `scorpionate`
complexes. Scorpionates are trispyrazoly-borate and -methane ligands, which are
facially coordinating and stabilize metals in a variety of oxidation states. A
general synthetic route into heteroscorpionate ligands, which would incorporate
a biologically relevant donor (thiol, phenol, carboxylate, etc.) as the
`stinger` tail along with two pyrazolyl `claws,` will be developed. The facially
coordinating nature of these ligands together with the introduction of
heteroatoms will provide the basis for studying these compounds as models for
metal ion active sites in proteins, such as as nitrile hydratase. This research
at a primarily undergraduate institution will undertake the preparation of new
complexes with ligands that will allow the compounds to serve as models for
metal-centered active sites in proteins.
