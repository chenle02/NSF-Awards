Plasma-Aided Manufacturing, the use of electrically charged particles in the
manufacturing processes, is an emerging field that have direct applications to
many high technology products and traditional industries. The University of
Wisconsin at Madison will establish an Engineering Research Center on Plasma-
Aided Manufacturing to expand fundamental knowledge on industrial plasmas, and
develop new processes to meet present and future requirements of industry. The
research thrusts will include, (1) plasma etching and microwave processing, (2)
plasma deposition and polymerization, (3) plasma synthesis, sintering, and
spraying of ceramics and refractory metals, and (4) plasma modification of
materials. There will be a subcontract to the University of Minnesota at
Minneapolis. The Center will bring together faculty and students from 11
separate departments. A team of 30 companies who span the range from large
multi-national corporations to specialized and smaller manufacturers will
participate in the Center's research, education and technology transfer
activities.
