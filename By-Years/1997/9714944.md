ABSTRACT 97-14944 Thorp SGER: Effects of a major flood on secondary production
of zooplankton in the Ohio River: Implications for ecosystem theory and river
management. In March, 1997, the Ohio River valley experienced its worst flooding
since 1964 (a 100+ year flood). This research will consider the effects of this
large-river flood in the context of current theoretical models that have never
been empirically tested in the temperate zone. The investigators will study the
influence of flood events on zooplankton productivity and the source of
nutrients to the river food web. The relative contribution of nutrients from
upstream reaches as opposed to the floodplain will be measured. Current
management strategies for large rivers and their floodplains assume that a model
developed in the tropics (the Flood Pulse Concept) is applicable to temperate
rivers. This model predicts that most riverine animal biomass derives from
production within the floodplain and not from downstream transport of organic
matter produced elsewhere in the basin. If this model is not applicable to large
temperate rivers, this research will have very broad-reaching implications.
