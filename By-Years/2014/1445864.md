The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program provides a unique
professional development opportunity for K-12 educators to inform national STEM
policy and improve communication between the STEM education community and
national leaders. Albert Einstein Fellows spend eleven months working at the
National Science Foundation, bringing extensive knowledge and STEM classroom
experience to the agency. In addition, fellows are provided with an extensive
program of professional development training during their fellowship year. The
Albert Einstein Fellows program is run by the non-profit Triangle Coalition for
Science and Technology Education. The lead federal agency for the program is the
Department of Energy Office of Science. Other federal participants in the
program include NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Congress. In 2014-15, NSF will host ten
Albert Einstein Fellows.

The Albert Einstein Fellows program is designed to provide substantial STEM work
experience beyond the confines of the classroom, as well as extensive training
in the fields of science, technology, and engineering, STEM education policy,
and STEM program outcomes. For teachers, the program increases STEM knowledge
and pedagogical skills, provides an opportunity for building leadership
capabilities as STEM experts, and assists with understanding the policy process.
Overall, the program brings STEM educator expertise to inform and improve
communication with policymakers. The program also encourages broader diversity
in STEM by recruiting in demographic sectors (race, ethnicity, location, etc.)
that are historically underrepresented.
