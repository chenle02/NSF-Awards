Abstract Beneteau

The proposal is for partial funding of the 25th Southeastern Analysis Meeting
(SEAM). The meeting will be held March 20-22, 2009 at the University of South
Florida, Tampa, Florida. The purpose of SEAM is to disseminate and exchange the
latest ideas and developments in classical analysis, complex and harmonic
analysis, and operator theory. Emphasis is placed on involving junior faculty
and graduate students in the meeting. The host school will provide facilities
and cover local organizing expenses. NSF funding will be used to pay for the
expenses of the main speakers and for participant support. Priority will be
given to graduate students, post-docs, younger faculty, and members of
underrepresented groups.

Historically, the topics of the main lectures have reflected the major current
developments in analysis. For example, at the 24th SEAM, C. Fefferman discussed
his solution of the Whitney extension problem. The intimate format of the
meeting fosters collaborations between younger and more senior mathematicians,
and this exchange of ideas has often in the past and is likely to lead in the
future to significant scientific advances.

In its quarter of a century history, SEAM has proven to serve as the first
significant research experience for many beginning researchers and advanced
graduate students. On many occasions, new PhDs have an opportunity to present
their work and make important contacts with researchers from other universities,
thus launching their careers. In addition, SEAM has always been very successful
in promoting participation from underrepresented groups, women, and minorities.
Because the conference is so well-known and well-advertised, we have confidence
that this trend will continue for the 25th SEAM.
