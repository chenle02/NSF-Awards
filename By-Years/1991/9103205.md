Microzooplankton (protozoans and micrometazoans) are abundant in the sea and
play significant roles in pelagic food webs. Estimating microzooplankton
biomass, however, is a tedious and relatively specialized process. Techniques
are needed to augment traditional approaches. It is known that algal pigment
content is roughly proportional to biomass. The hypothesis of the present study
is that carotenoid pigment content in microzooplankton is also correlated with
biomass. The objectives of this research are to test this hypothesis and to
identify environmental forcing functions responsible for variability in the
relationship. Findings, to date, support the hypothesis, but elaboration is
necessary. Experiments will be undertaken to identify the influence of food
availability, light intensity and spectral characteristics, and population
growth on the pigment:biomass relationship. In addition, the analytical method,
which involves HPLC, will be modified to increase carotenoid resolution. The
improved method will provide data at higher rates than presently possible, and
may allow discrimination between micrometazoan and protozoan biomass.
