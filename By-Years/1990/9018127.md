This award is for support of research to study the portion of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet which feeds in to the Ross Ice Shelf. Satellite image analysis, ground
surveying, and radar soundings by both airborne and ground-based systems
comprise the necessary elements of this research. These activities are an
essential part of the Siple Coast Project and the new SeaRISE initiative which
have as goals: 1) Determination of the configuration and mass balance of the
Siple Coast region of the West Antarctic ice sheet, 2) Determination of the
physical controls of ice flow in this region, and 3) Prediction of the future
behavior of this region using numerical models. These models will be enhanced
by: 1) Completion of the surveys in the catchment areas of all the ice streams,
2) Determination of surface velocities in ice streams D and E, 3) Measurements
of the discharge flux of ice streams D and E, 4) Examination of ice stream flow
in the area of a surface undulation using satellite imagery, 5) Quantify the
relative motion between the surface and bed in the grounded region just upstream
of the grounding line.
