This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Benjamin
F. Plummer at Trinity University, who is studying polycyclic aromatic compounds
that have distorted molecular shapes. Investigation of these non-optimal
structures will provide fundamental information about factors that govern
molecular structure. The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Plummer will
include both theoretical and computational efforts. A series of new and unusual
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will be synthesized and will also be studied
computationally using both molecular mechanics and molecular orbital
calculations. The resulting theoretical predictions for thermodynamic strain and
spectroscopic transitions will be compared with experimental data obtained from
spectroscopy and from studies of chemical reactivity.
