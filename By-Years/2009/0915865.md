The proposal is to support multi-stage queries by integrating knowledge from
across different queries, creating a "knowledge mosaic." This approach, if
successful could radically improve and extend web search from one of primarily
fact-finding to one of fact-finding and problem solving using a set of related
queries which find pieces of information which are then "stitched together" such
that relationships and links between the information can be better revealed. The
approach to problem-solving becomes one of using a set of related queries which
find out portions of information on graph models, building the knowledge mosaic
using RDF and other graph-based Semantic Web technologies and extending a
proposed new query language SPARQ2L The resultant view keeps track of what
knowledge has been found, and attempts tto combine it in useful ways to provide
a more complex knowledge view for the information the user seeks to discover.
The research could have pronounced impact on how search and discovery is
performed on the web.
