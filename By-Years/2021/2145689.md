This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Principal Investigator (PI) Battersby and her team are
comparing large observational datasets with custom numerical simulations to
study molecular gas and dust in clouds at the center of the Milky Way. The team
are investigating turbulence, which can compress cloud fragments and seed the
gravitational collapse that leads to the formation of stars and planets. On
larger scales, turbulence can stir up the clouds and slow down the onset of
fragmentation and gravitational collapse. To advance our understanding of this
process the team will compare their observations to custom numerical simulations
and determine the physical properties of turbulence as well as quantify the
number of cloud cores that will form stars. To improve the retention of
undergraduate students from under-represented groups in STEM, PI Battersby will
lead the University of Connecticut Science, Technology, and Astronomy Recruits
(UConn-STARs) program. The students will participate in professional development
activities and outreach at local high schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;PI
Battersby and her team will make statistical comparisons between their numerical
simulations and data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array
(ALMA) to disentangle the physical origin of Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)
turbulence and measure its properties (the Mach number, virial parameter, and
solenoidal fraction). They will also compare the turbulence in the extreme
environment of the CMZ, the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way, to that in more
quiescent parts of the disk. The team will compare the Core Mass Function, the
precursor of the stellar initial mass function, in these different parts of the
Galaxy to further our understanding of how turbulence regulates star formation
and how it may vary with environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
