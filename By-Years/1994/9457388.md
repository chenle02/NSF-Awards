The research exploits the advantages of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to
detect, analyze, and quantify environmental changes. The first research thrust
focuses on improving SAR image formation with a phased array airborne or
spaceborne radar. Efficient SAR image formation techniques are being developed
by appropriately designing the transmitted waveforms of the phased array radar.
The trade-offs between nonparametric and parametric techniques are being studied
and understood. The second research thrust focuses on the SAR image
understanding and ground truth evaluation. Statistical clustering algorithms and
various feature extraction schemes that adequately incorporate electromagnetic
phenomenology are being developed and evaluated. The third research thrust
focuses on the detection, analysis, and quantification of environmental changes
through repeated SAR imaging of critical regions including the environmentally
fragile Florida wetlands. Change detection techniques are being developed to
quantify and document subtle environmental changes from these images.
