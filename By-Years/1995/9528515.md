ABSTRACT The Second International Forum of Particulate Technology is organized
by the Particle Technology Forum (PTF) of American Institute of Chemical
Engineers. This biennial meeting will take place in conjunction with the 5th
World Congress of Chemical Engineering in San Diego, CA, July 14-18, 1996. This
workshop will focus on the needs of particulate technology in various fields
including environment, energy, food, agriculture, pharmaceutics, and
biotechnology. Technical sessions will cover topics such as storage and
conveying, particle formation, dispersion of powders in liquids and gases,
classification and separation, mixing, size reduction, agglomeration, rheology
and multiphase flow, and fluidization. Both oral and poster presentations will
allow interactions between U.S. scientists and leading international experts
from more than 25 countries. The participants will have the opportunity to share
recent results and discuss potential collaboration between industry, academia,
professional societies and government agencies. The research opportunities in
various areas of particulate technology will be documented in the conference
proceedings. Syed Qutubuddin
