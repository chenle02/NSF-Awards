Pure mathematics is fundamental research -- it cannot be judged by its immediate
use: history teaches us that important applications arise unexpectedly, years
later. In the spirit of the great David Hilbert, our project is problem-driven.
As he said over one hundred years ago, ''As long as a branch of science offers
an abundance of problems, so long is it alive. [...] It is by the solution of
problems that the investigator tests the temper of his steel; he finds new
methods and new outlooks, and gains a wider and freer horizon. [...] A
mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not
completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our efforts.'' In the case of this
project, most of the problems to be considered were posed over sixty years ago
by Paul Erdos, the greatest problem poser in history, and are related to the
distribution of primes and modular arithmetic. In fact, the energy and momentum
of this project will be established by a kickoff conference which will bring
together outstanding mathematicians who have done dynamic and useful work on
some of his most challenging problems. For many decades, the main problems
seemed to be out of reach, but a few years ago Hough and Nielsen proved some
breakthrough results. Within the scope of this project, in applying methods of
combinatorics and probability theory to solve several major problems that have
remained, some new mathematical techniques for their solutions could be derived
that might then be applicable to many other problems, including those in number
theory. This project has the promise to be impactful in a number of ways within
and beyond the discipline. For example, the factorization of integers is of
great practical importance in cryptography, and reconstruction problems are
likely to be of use in biology (e.g., DNA sequencing). The second shortest path
problem is related to a proposed diagnostic test for schizophrenia.
