This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and
Graph Theory. The series consists of three mini-conferences on Combinatorics and
Graph Theory in Atlanta where Emory University, the Georgia Institute of
Technology, and Georgia State University are located. Three mini-conferences
will be scheduled in November, February, and April, respectively. Each
conference will feature one distinguished researcher with two one-hour lectures,
four one-hour lectures by distinguished researchers mainly from the southeast
region, and four thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a continuation of the ongoing Atlanta
Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory started in 2010. The featured
lectures and other invited talks have covered a variety of topics in graph
theory and combinatorics. The speaker pool not only has a good gender balance
but also consists of a nice blend of senior, well-known researchers and young
rising stars. The series has become a major event for combinatorics community in
the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen
collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of
the United States.
