Lehigh University is partnering with middle and high schools in the Allentown
and Bethlehem Area School Districts in the Lehigh Valley, industry experts from
Air Products and Chemicals, Agere Systems, Insaco, Inc. and the Discovery Center
for Science and Technology Pennsylvania on "A Lehigh Valley Partnership to
Enhance STEM Education Through G4-12 Teaching Fellows." The involvement of
industry and the Discovery Center is novel and evidence of the project's
intellectual merit. This project builds upon established outreach programs at
Lehigh and will continue to enhance the educational experience of students in
Lehigh Valley schools by placing graduate and advanced undergraduate Teaching
Fellows in STEM classrooms and establishing STEM outreach teams. Teaching
Fellows are helping grade 4-12 teachers introduce inquiry-based learning and use
multimedia, wireless and other innovative technologies in local classrooms.
Outreach teams consisting of Fellows, Lehigh faculty and industry experts are
training and exchanging ideas with STEM teachers and administrators from the two
schools districts. The great diversity within the school districts served
promise broad impacts from these activities. This project is partially supported
by funds from the Directorate for Engineering and from the Directorate for
Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
