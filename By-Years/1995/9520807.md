Abstract ATM-9520807 Andrews, John T. University of Colorado Title: Decadal-
Scale Proxy Records of the Last 3,000 Years from the Eastern Canadian Arctic and
Iceland Based on Lake Sediment and Palynology This PALE/ARCSS award supports a
study of decadal-scale variability in the paleoclimate of Iceland over the last
3,000 years. It is specifically intended to unite projects of Baffin Island and
Iceland by creating lake sediment and pollen records for Iceland that can be
compared to similar high-resolution records from sites on Baffin Island, N.W.T.,
Canada. This effort will help to integrate paleoclimate records from Greenland,
Iceland and the Eastern Canadian Arctic and will provide information useful in
piecing together the synoptic climatology of the northern Atlantic region.
