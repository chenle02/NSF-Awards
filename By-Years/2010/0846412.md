This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG)
has been awarded a grant to database and curate it's DNA Bank. This project will
address unprocessed specimens that have accumulated due to unanticipated growth.
Accessions have surged from escalated efforts to document dwindling biodiversity
and as a result of large scale multi-institutional projects (e.g., TreeBOL).
Storage efficiency will be improved, tissue samples and DNA aliquots will be
databased, and these data united with voucher herbarium specimen data. NYBG's
herbarium is one of the most consulted in the world, and thus, its specimens
have up-to-date identifications. An on-line catalog will promote efficient
access to these research materials by the scientific community
(http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/DNABank.asp). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training
and career development will be provided to a technician and a graduate student
working on this project. NYBG develops minority and under-represented groups
through its intern and Graduate Studies programs, and by training international
collaborators. Organizing the DNA Bank physically and electronically will
facilitate their use in these educational endeavors, allow scientists without
these resources to participate in Barcode of Life research, and position NYBG to
be an international repository for future samples (e.g., NSF-funded MonAToL).
Practices instituted at NYBG can be adopted by other institutions. The web page
will stimulate the public's awareness of the significant research the DNA Bank
supports.
