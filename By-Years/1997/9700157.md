The essence of this research is a systematic classification of the variants of
the multicast problems that present themselves in various networking and
distributed systems applications, as well as algorithmic solutions to these
problems in the spirit of "competitive analysis". Even though the research
pursued in this project is theoretical in nature, the algorithms developed may
be of practical value. The issues addressed are also being very actively studied
by the networking community. This algorithmic effort may in fact bridge between
the Theory and Networking communities, since the researchers in the Networking
community are seeking solutions to dire problems created by the growing scale of
the Internet and its applications. From the algorithmic point of view, which is
the point of view taken in this proposal, the Multicast Problem can be defined
as follows. Various network users issue online requests for a connection to
certain multicast sources. The network either connects this request or rejects
it (admission control decision). If a request is connected, a path with
sufficient residual bandwidth is established starting at the requesting user and
ending either at the source or at one of the users previously connected to the
same source (route selection decision). The goal of these admission control and
route selection decisions is to maximize the total number of users connected
subject to the network capacity constraints. Namely, the number of connections
to different sources passing through any edge should not exceed the capacity of
that edge. The innovation in this research is in developing a unifying framework
that simultaneously captures admission control and route selection decisions in
their full generality. This framework can be generalized to include issues such
as pricing policies, network design & synthesis, etc.
