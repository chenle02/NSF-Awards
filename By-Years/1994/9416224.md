9405534 Louie This research will test Cenozoic extension models for the southern
Great Basin of Nevada with large- and small-scale, multidisciplinary geophysical
investigations. Geophysical methods will outline the development of small
alluvial and lacustrine basins, which can constrain the timing and nature of
regional tectonic activity. The stratigraphy of basins east of Death Valley,
California, may be diagnostic of the mode and timing of extension. Constrained
by velocity structure, this research will test the geophysical and sedimentary
features proposed by differing Cenozoic tectonic models. In addition, this
research will provide geophysical field experience to undergraduate and graduate
geological sciences classes, enhancing several degree programs at the University
of Nevada, Reno, and Pennsylvania State University. ***
