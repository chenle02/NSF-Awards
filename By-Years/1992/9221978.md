There are fish species known as "weakly electric" fish, because they emit a
small discharge from an electric organ. They use electroreceptor organs in the
skin to detect changes in the electric field that surrounds them, somewhat like
echolocation behavior. One whole part of their brain is called the
electrosensory lobe (ELL), where the nerve signals from electroreceptors are
integrated with nerve signals from other parts of the brain, including
information about body position, about the commands for timing of the electric
organ discharge, and about other stages of electrosensory processing. Modulation
of sensory input has been demonstrated here in the changes in effectiveness of
the contacts between nerve cells, known as synaptic plasticity. This work uses
electrophysiology and anatomical tracing of the processes of single nerve cells
to determine how cells within ELL respond to electrosensory and central inputs,
and to determine the basic anatomical circuitry of ELL. This model system is
useful not as a "simple" one, but as one which may help to understand the real
complexities of sensorimotor integration linking sensation to behavior in the
vertebrate central nervous system. Using this unusual non-human sense will
provide insights about how central brain structures modify the flow of sensory
information, how sensory information is modulated by commanded motor activity,
and how synaptic plasticity affects functions of sensory processing and network
functions.
