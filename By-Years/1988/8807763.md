The principal investigator will continue his research in the extreme value
theory, in collaboration with de Haan. The particular interest for this project
is asymptotic theory of the extremes of multivariate negative exponential
distributions. Theory of extremes has a number of applications including
meteorological data, flood and wind measurements. The behavior of the
multivariate extremes depends not only on the stability of the marginal
distributions but the dependence structure of the multivariate distributions.
Study will be made for various dependence functions. Estimation of the
dependence functions will be studied.
