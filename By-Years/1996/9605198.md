The program of research will focus on strong CP problem. It is one of the
unresolved theoretical puzzles of the Standard Model of particle physics. In the
first stage of the project, analytic and numerical studies of the analog of the
CP problem in two-dimensional models will be performed with the aim of gaining
insight into a possible dynamical solution. The second stage of the project will
focus on the situation for pure Yang-Mills theories in four dimensions. The work
may lead to further insight into the quantum structure of Quantum
Chromodynamics. It might also affect the direction of future axion searches by
experimentalists.
