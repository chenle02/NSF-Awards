This is a MRI planning grant proposal to develop a fundable proposal for a study
which will assess the impact of Jackson's candidacy on Black party support and
political participation during the 1984 and 1988 elections. The central
questions for this study are: 1) what factors lie behind the near unanimous
support of the Democratic party by Blacks; 2) what was the impact of Jackson's
candidacy on Black party support across the 1984 and 1988 elections; 3) how did
Jackson's candidacy affect Black voter turnout in 1984 and 1988; 4) what factors
contributed to the discrepant turnout levels in the 1984 and 1988 presidential
elections; 5) and what are the implications of Jackson's candidacy for 1992 and
beyond? The proposed research will utilize data from the 1984 and 1988 National
Black Election Study (NBES). The NBES data sets, combined, constitute a four-
wave longitudinal study of African-Americans' political attitudes and behavior.
The principal investigator will use the planning period to write a larger, more
detailed proposal that will focus on the validation of the NBES data. She will
also do some exploratory data analysis to determine the cost of validating the
NBES data.
