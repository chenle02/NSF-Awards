9522738 Shawki This analytical/computational/experimental study will improve
the understanding of material damage and catastrophic failure through shear flow
localization over a wide range of loading rates, materials and observation
length scales. An energy based framework as well as second strain gradients in
the constitutive relations will be employed in deciding when dynamic shear
localization occurs in thermally-sensitive and strain rate-sensitive materials
that also work harden. The experimental phase, to be conducted at the Ohio State
University, will study the evolution of the spatial deformation field. ***
