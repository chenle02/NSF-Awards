9561674 Jackiw This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
establishes the groundwork for the development of interactive and exploratory
geometry-learning software realized on inexpensive, pen-based, and handheld
computers. The research draws on Key Curriculum Press's existing dynamic
geometry software--The Geometer's Sketchpad--and on the accessibility afforded
by handheld technology (currently in the form of "graphing calculators"). The
proposed research will develop classroom scenarios of pen-based devices used in
classrooms, taking into account possibilities for interaction with desktop-based
computers. These scenarios will be used to develop algorithms for pen-based
geometry input, prototypes of a pen-based Sketchpad product, and specifications
for a minimal hardware platform for launching this new technology in a
mathematics education context. The Geometer's Sketchpad enjoys a position as a
well regarded and commercially successful educational software system. The
proposed project, led by Sketchpad's original author and ongoing project
director, will pave the way for migrating this software to a new and promising
hardware platform on the horizon of educational technology. The project has
outstanding potential for commercial success in school markets because it
represents an environment which is educationally sound (in that it draws on the
existing Sketchpad), widely accessible (in that it is both portable and
inexpensive), and ideally suited for exploring mathematics (because it is pen-
based).
