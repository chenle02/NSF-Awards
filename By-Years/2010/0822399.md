Organisms are designed to be reliable and to deal robustly with unexpected
changes in the environment. Like machines designed by engineers, the reliability
and robustness of organisms is far from perfect. In engineering terms, machines
that last a very long time and handle a wide variety of unexpected situations
are very expensive and often poorly suited to their tasks - thus, engineers
design with both costs and benefits in mind. This project examines the same
sorts of design tradeoffs in biological terms. For example, how have organisms
been designed with regard to reliability and robustness? How have the tradeoffs
between costs and benefits been resolved in biological design? This work will
study biological examples of breakdown and repair from these design
perspectives. The methods include mathematical and computer models to study the
problems of biological design coupled with synthesis of real-life examples of
breakdown, such as cancer, aging, and, molecularly, the smaller-scale components
that make organisms work. These studies will result in improved understanding of
biological reliability and robustness. That understanding will have broader
impacts by providing insight into when and why breakdown occurs - the
fundamental basis of disease and aging.
