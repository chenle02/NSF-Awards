This project is a teacher development program that builds on three projects, the
"Virtual Solar System Project", the "Virtual Exploratorium," and the "Virtual
Gorilla Modeling Project." While featuring modeling enriched inquiry-based
learning environments, the project develops and evaluates a model for changing
teaching practice as teachers incorporate the extensive use of these
technologies. The PIs use a four-phase process to help 90 middle school teachers
make the transition. In the first two years of the project, teachers begin their
apprenticeship with a one-week intensive workshop on science, pedagogy and
technology. This is followed by one or two weeks working in one of three summer
camps (at the Georgia Outreach Program or the Zoo). The third phase involves
digital video and reflections with a follow up one-day seminar. In the final
phase, teachers build their own communities, hold local workshops (1-2 hours)
and do outreach presentations. Subcontracts are to the Atlanta Zoo and to EDC
(Honey et al) for evaluation, which is quite thorough and consistent with PDET.
Included are three doctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;
