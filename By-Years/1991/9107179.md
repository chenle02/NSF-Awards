The aim of this proposal is to demonstrate that the best opportunity for
directing the crystallization process toward desired phases and morphology may
be during the crystal growth process by controlling nucleation and directing the
formation of preferred mesoscopic prenucleation aggregates. It will be shown
that the growth and morphology of molecular crystals on substrates can be
directed by (1) using surfaces with monolayers that provide uniform wetting
properties and controlled nucleation, and (2) by promoting self-assembly
interactions at surfaces derivatized with carefully designed functionalized
monolayers. This award is part of the "Materials Chemistry and Chemical
Processing Initiative," and it is jointly funded by the Division of Materials
