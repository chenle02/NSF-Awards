This award will support collaborative research between Dr. John L. Omdahl of the
University of New Mexico and Dr. Brian May at the University of Adelaide (South
Australia). The research is clearly significant in the development of our
understanding of the ubiquitous biological activities of the many varieties of
P450 genes. For example, some P450 genes are expressed in the liver to
metabolize foreign chemicals such as drugs and others are expressed in tissues
for hormone production. Specifically, these researchers propose to define the
control region of the P450 gene responsible for metabolism of phenobarbital in
chickens, and to isolate the P450 gene of the pig to lay the ground for future
work in defining the control regions of these genes responsive to hormones. The
project brings together complementary expertise in that Dr. May is well-versed
in the molecular biology of these systems, and Dr. Omdahl is an expert in their
biology. In addition to the scientific advances anticipated and their potential
applications to toxicology, the University of Adelaide's Center of Excellence
for Gene Technology will serve as a resource for understanding how such centers
are organized and administered for potential application at the University of
New Mexico.
