9706012 Reeder The proposed research will examine specific aspects of the
incorporation mechanisms of trace elements into carbonate minerals crystallizing
from low temperature aqueous solutions. A significant aspect of the research
involves the application of synchrotron-based X-ray adsorption fine structure
spectroscopy to determine directly the detailed local coordination of
incorporated trace metal species. The PI proposes to examine the coordination
environment of uranium species coprecipitated in calcite and aragonite, the
incorporation of barium into calcite, and structural perturbations caused by Mn
in the CaCO3-MnCO3 system. The proposed research will lead to a better
understanding of the roles that trace and minor elements play as tracers in
minerals recording the petrogenetic and diagenetic processes and also of the
processes that control their mobility and fate in the near-surface environment.
