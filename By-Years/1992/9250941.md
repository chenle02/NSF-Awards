Northeastern University is creating a computer facility, the Math Excel Mentor
Laboratory, to support the learning of mathematics. The program Math Excel was
inspired by a visit from Uri Triesmann and is loosely modeled on some of the
other programs he has helped develop. This program will employ some of its
students as mentors in the Math Excel Mentor Laboratory. The Math Excel Mentor
Laboratory will serve two related purposes. The first of these is to be a
support laboratory for sections of calculus, differential equations, and linear
algebra. Through the laboratory, students will explore ideas new to the
curriculum. The second purpose will be to provide an environment in which
students help students explore mathematics creatively and make their own
discoveries. One aspect of this second purpose will be the creation of a
supportive student culture of mathematical discovery.
