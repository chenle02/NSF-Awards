In this award, the investigators would carry out a Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic
study of samples collected by ALVIN and dredged by other ships from the
spreading axes in the Mariana Trough and the Lau Basin, both very important back
arc basins in the western Pacific. These two sample sets are extremely valuable
since they were collected at a very fine scale and at a great cost and
considerable geophysical measurements were made at the sample sites. Besides,
visual observational data exist with the ALVIN samples. Major element and trace
element analyses are being done on these samples, as part of other NSF supported
projects. The combined elemental and isotopic data set will help in
understanding various magmatic processes in marginal basins, such as, nature and
scale of source variability of magma, partial melting of rocks and mixing of
magma, segmentation of the spreading ridge, etc. Also the study will indicate
the extent of inhomogeneity in the mantle under these back arc basins. Back arc
basins have been somewhat neglected by the community but they hold important
clues for the overall understanding of the plate tectonic processes. //
