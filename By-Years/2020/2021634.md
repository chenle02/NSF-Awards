Title: Assessing Transformative Justice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;While transformative justice takes many forms, there is scant
scholarly knowledge, whether theoretical or empirical, on the efficacy of these
measures that may be employed during transitions from conflict to peace. This
project will collect community-generated indicators of justice, recognition, and
reconciliation in order to establish reparative impact. The goal is to examine
the outcomes of transformative justice and derive a measurement for the efficacy
of steps taken by states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employing a mixed-method
approach, including focus groups, survey research, and an experimental design,
this research will be based in various theories from law, political science, and
international relations, in order to develop new theory on the role of
reparative mechanisms and on the limits of transformative justice. The project
will provide innovative consultation, assessment, and learning tools for
measuring amends in terms of recognition, justice and reconciliation. The case
studies of Colombia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be utilized
due to their extensive reparations programs. Focus groups will be used to
collect community-generated indicators followed by survey research methods to
measure changes in perception and impact over time. Findings will advance
scientific discovery and understanding of the ideas behind transformative
justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
