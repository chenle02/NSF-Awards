This award provides for one-third of the funding needed for the acquisition of
equipment to monitor seismic, deformational, and explosive activity at Merapi
volcano in Indonesia. The additional funding for this acquisition has been
committed by the Pennsylvania State University. Monitoring with this equipment
will make it possible to systematically evaluate the deformation at Merapi
volcano over the next few years, a period within which a significant explosive
eruption is considered likely. The equipment requested includes electronic
tiltmeters and accompanying telemetry systems to monitor dome activity and a
"total station" surveying system to enable dedicated, full-time monitoring of
the Merapi edifice deformation. Deformational data will be interpreted in
conjunction with conventional telemetered seismic data obtained by the
Volcanological Survey of Indonesia as well as a real-time seismic amplitude
monitoring system to be installed by the Principal Investigator. The research to
be carried out with this instrumentation will enable Merapi volcano to be used
as a natural laboratory to understand crucial volcano deformational processes,
and to test and refine deformation models before and during volcanic eruption.
