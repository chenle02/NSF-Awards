In the study of biology and medicine and the human sciences, scientists and
physicians have generally been divided into two camps: vitalists and
materialists. Vitalists argue that the phenomena of life entail something sui
generis, something which provides sensibility, force, function, organization,
"vitality," harmony and integration to matter. Materialists argue that the
phenomena of life can ultimately be entirely explained by means of the standard
laws of physics and chemistry. Like all generalizations, this attempt to divide
scientists and physicians into two distinct camps over-simplifies very complex
issues; but these generalizations also serve as a useful heuristic in examining
the scientific goals of scientists. In the history of biology, the debate
between vitalists and materialists, there have been several classic
confrontations. The most famous involved Louis Pasteur in the 19th century.
Another in the 18th century was between a British Jesuit, Tuberville Needham,
and an Italian priest, Abbe Lazzaro Spallanzani. The debate continues to the
present. Every time the issue seems to be resolved in favor of the materialists,
however, the vitalists surge back with new arguments and experiments to convey
the force of their ideas. Dr. Williams, under this research grant, is examining
the origins of modern vitalist theory as it developed in Montpellier in southern
France and the impact Montpellier vitalism had on biosocial thought to 1850.
Montpellier was the home of an ancient and prestigious medical school and of the
sole learned society in provincial France to compare in scope and reputation to
the Academie des Sciences in Paris. Dr. Williams is exploring the social,
cultural, and intellectual environment of Montpellier; the doctrines and
teachings of the leading Montpellier figures; and the influence exerted by
Montpellier on diverse theorists who extrapolated models for social "life" from
the study of vital systems. She is investigating both concrete institutional and
sociopolitical linkages among the actors and intellectual filliations
established by linguistic, epistemological, and conceptual affinities. This
study's significance lies in its showing how and why Montpellier fosters a
decisive reorientation of the life sciences, especially in France, and
encouraged the emergence of biosocial thought.
