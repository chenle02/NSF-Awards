9352607 Veening This project will incorporate the use of Capillary
Electrophoresis (CE) into the undergraduate curriculum as an important
instrumental tool in chemical and biological research. It will be applied to the
identification of pollutants in environmental water samples, the separation of
complex proteins and amino acids, and analysis of metabolites. This project will
introduce this state-of-the-art technique to students through laboratory
exercises and through undergraduate research projects.
