9314400 Hickey Vargas This is study will examine the geochemistry of rocks from
the West Philippine Basin to address questions concerning the timing and mantle
sources of island arc type versus oceanic island type volcanism. Results will
improve the understanding of tectonic evolution of the basin and the
relationships between regional and large scale mantle reservoirs. ***
