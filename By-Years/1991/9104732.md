Computational geometry as a field deals with the algorithmic aspects of
geometric problems. Most of the existing research has been restricted, however,
to problems involving straight lines in two dimensions. The goal of this project
is to develop improved computational methods for both curved objects and three-
dimensional objects and then to develop efficient algorithms for a collection of
optimization problems, including inner and outer approximation of curved and
three-dimensional objects, three-dimensional mesh generation, and pre-
fabrication partitioning of both rectilinear and fixed-orientation of VLSI
designs.
