This project is concerned with the development of algorithms for calculating the
eigensystems of general matrices by reducing them to a form which is more
compact than the usual Hessenberg form and by applying the LR algorithm ot the
condensed form. Preliminary tests suggest that the proposed algorithm will
produce accurate results in a much shorter time than the standard QR algorithm
for a dense eigensystem. For the most condensed form of a tridiagonal matrix, a
divide-and-conquer algorithm will be developed for use in parallel computers.
For a specialized Hamilton eigenvalue problem which requires the solution of an
algebraic Riccati equation, our algorithm will be based on symplectic similarity
transformations which preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the matrix.
