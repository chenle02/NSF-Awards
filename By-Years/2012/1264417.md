Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and businesses increasingly
aim to form networks to address issues such as hunger, poverty, disease, and
environmental degradation. Interorganizational networks enable constituencies to
transcend some limitations and work toward common
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research combines social network analysis
methods with intensive assessment to (a) produce a reliable and valid measure of
NGO capacity, and (b) test the common presumption that an NGO's capacity to
address problems of disease and development is dependent on its local network of
relationships with other NGOs, businesses, and government
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will include an
important new outcome measure for NGO research. In addition, this project will
identify the types of collaboration associated with increasing an NGO's scope of
services, leadership strength, human resource capacity, financial stability, and
research and advocacy capacity. This should have practical implications for
better management of NGOs in context.
