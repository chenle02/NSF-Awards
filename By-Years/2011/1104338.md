This project will examine the magnetic conjugacy and non-conjugacy of the
auroral electrojet system. Instances of non-conjugate behavior may arise from
one or more of four different reasons. The possible reasons for non-conjugate
behavior are: (1) inter-hemispherical differences in Earth's internal magnetic
field, (2) differences in ionospheric conductivity due to differences in solar
illumination, (3) external electric currents driven by the interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) and (4) field-aligned currents flowing from one hemisphere
to the other. Statistical analyses of a large number of events will be used to
determine under what conditions each of the possible reasons for non-conjugate
behavior are operative. The project will characterize differences and
similarities in the auroral electrojet systems in the two hemispheres and will
determine the dependence on season, location and IMF conditions.

Most of our knowledge of the behavior of auroral phenomena comes from
observations in the northern hemisphere and the common assumption is that the
southern hemisphere is simply a mirror of what happens in the northern
hemisphere. Two locations, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the
southern hemisphere are referred to a conjugate if they are connected by a
magnetic field line. Optical observations done simultaneously in both
hemispheres has shown many instances of non-conjugate behavior. This project
will use magnetic field measurements taken in both hemispheres from a large
number of magnetometers to examine the conditions that produce non-conjugate
behavior.
