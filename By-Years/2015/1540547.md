This project aims to derive fundamental results in the field of network design.
In network design, one wishes to derive a network which simultaneously has low
cost and desirable properties such as high connectivity for fault tolerance. The
goal of this project is to find improved approximation algorithms - which find a
network with cost and quality provably near the best possible for a given
problem instance - or to prove new inapproximability results. Problems in this
area have a large practical significance in many areas including transportation
planning, road planning, and power grids. The project will provide undergraduate
research opportunities. The PI plans to test some of the algorithms developed in
practical settings with the assistance of students from the recently launched
Computer Science Undergraduate Research Academy at Rutgers-Camden. The project
will focus in particular on approximability of NP-hard network design problems
including some of the most significant connectivity problems: Directed Steiner
Tree, Directed Steiner Forest, Group Steiner Tree, Multicommodity Buy-at-Bulk,
Minimum Poise Tree, Tree Augmentation, Directed Rooted 2-Survivable Network, and
the Minimum-cost Vertex k-Connected Sub-graph problem.
