This research project will focus on detailed field measurements and response
prediction analyses of another large arch dam in China, to study dynamic
interaction mechanisms of the impounded-water, sediment, and foundation rock
with the dam. New areas of investigation include the dam-water-sediment
interaction effects with respect to the sediment properties and sediment
thickness, effects of canyon topography on the free-field ground motions, and
improved dynamic excitation techniques. The basic concept in the field
measurements is to excite the dynamic response of the dam and its retained water
by detonating explosive charges. Two types of explosion tests will be employed:
those applied to the foundation rock and those detonated in the lake water. In
addition, two approaches based on the seismic reflection and refraction
techniques will be employed to measure the reflection coefficient of the lake-
bottom materials. The proposed test program will provide improved understanding
of the actual dynamic response behavior of arch dams influenced by the
interaction with the impounded-water and the foundation rock; by the energy
absorption of the lake-bottom materials; by the lake topography; and by the
spatial variations of ground motion around the canyon. Results of the proposed
research should lead to better understanding of the dam-water-sediment and dam-
foundation interaction effects, and will provide measured data by which the
accuracy of computer programs for analyzing the earthquake response of arch dams
can be examined and possibly improved.
