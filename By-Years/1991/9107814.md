It is proposed to study the low-temperature magnetic properties of several
highly symmetric structures containing rare-earth and/or transition-metal ions.
They aim to: a) provide stringent tests of theoretical predictions for the
ordered state of purely dipolar magnets with high symmetry, particularly cubic
lattices, b) explore magnetic order in some new cubic materials containing two
competing sublattices of ions, one with primarily dipolar interactions, the
other with "exchange"; and c) test recent predictions of "order induced by
disorder" in frustrated exchange-coupled systems, focusing on f.c.c. Heisenberg
antiferromagnets.
