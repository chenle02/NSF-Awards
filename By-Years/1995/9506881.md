9506881 Haselkorn The objective of this U.S.-Czech joint research project
between Dr. Robert Haselkorn of the University of Chicago and Dr. Vaclav Paces
of the Czech Institute of Molecular Genetics is to clone and sequence particular
fragments of the chromosome from three strains of the bacterium Rhodobacter
capsulatus. This bacterium is purple and non-photosynthetic and useful in
studies of carotenoid biosynthesis, photochemical reactions centers, and
nitrogen fixation. The fragments to be characterized and cloned by the
researchers contain the junctions created by large-scale chromosomal
rearrangements and changes. The collaborative effort should yield new knowledge
about the bacterium's nucleotide sequences and may help determine the mechanisms
of these rearrangements. Results would further our basic understanding of genome
plasticity and evolution. This project in microbial genetics fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
