The speech of a number of victims of sudden hearing loss who have previously had
normal speech and hearing will be analyzed. The local medical community will
identify such persons at an early stage of their deafness, and any changes which
may occur in their speech over the three-year course of the project will be
tracked. On the basis of preliminary work, it has been established that there
are wide variations in the developmental patterns of such subjects' speech after
deafness. Recordings of their speech made at regular intervals will be analyzed
according to a number of relevant parameters, and the results will be used to
test a number of specific hypotheses about the role of hearing in speech,
hypotheses which can account satisfactorily for the full range of observable
data. To the extent that time and resources allow, the speech of normally
hearing subjects whose hearing has temporarily been blocked by one of a variety
of techniques will be examined.
