The research project examines ways to utilize climate information gained by the
scientific community in conjunction with the traditional knowledge held by
people native to the Arctic as a determinate for making decisions in response to
changing climate conditions in the far north. A range of scenarios for changing
climate conditions such as decreased sea ice, changing frequency of extreme
weather events, storm surges, and other environmental factors will be used to
predict the probability of variable environmental conditions that could lead to
decisions in the local communities about management of resources, marine
transportation options, and coastal construction. Local stakeholder groups will
be used to identify how socioeconomic decision-making might be done in response
to various probabilities for changing climate on a variety of time scales. An
interdisciplinary education project will integrate natural and social sciences
with specific application to arctic climate and socioeconomic issues. The
project will contribute to the Human dimensions of the Arctic system (HARC)
initiative of the Arctic System Science Program.
