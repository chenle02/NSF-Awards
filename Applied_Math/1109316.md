The investigator will be working on several projects at the intersection of game
theory, statistical mechanics, and probability. One series of projects is
centered around the deep and largely unexplored connections between game theory
and statistical mechanics. On one hand, game theoretical concepts enrich greatly
the modelling tools of statistical mechanics and, on the other hand, recent
advances in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics shed a new light on game
theory. In particular the investigator will work on the connections between
certain zero-sum games and the concepts of irreversibility and entropy
production. Another series of projects involve the development of multiscale
modelling via stochastic processes, deterministic equations, and hybrid
stochastic-deterministic models in evolutionary games. These tools are needed to
model complex systems with multiple spatio-temporal scales such as flexible
real-time frequency trading in telecommunication networks or monopolistic
competitions between companies vying for spatially distributed customers. The
investigator will work in collaboration with mathematicians, economists and
computer scientists with the goals to develop adequate mathematical tools and to
construct realistic models.

Game theory starting with Von Neumann, Nash, and many others has always been,
and still is, a crucial tool in mathematical economics. Starting in the early
1980's, in particular due to the biologist Maynard-Smith, evolutionary game
theory was born and it combines the traditional static concepts of strategic
equilibria with the implementation of learning mechanisms and strategy
transmissions via dynamical mechanisms. Evolutionary games are now used notably,
in population biology, social sciences, computer sciences, as well as physics.
The investigator's work is motivated on one hand by the deep theoretical
connections between game theory and physics (in particular non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics). On the other hand the investigator also aims to develop
the mathematical tools to model complex multiscale problems with a combination
of game theory and probability. A notable challenge is to construct an agent-
based model for spectrum trading in mobile telecommunication networks. Problems
of this type are expected to be crucially important in the near future due to
the explosive development of mobile telecommunication devices.
