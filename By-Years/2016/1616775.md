This project addresses the fundamental question of how cells regulate the
selective uptake of molecules and material from the surrounding environment.
Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize surface components. During
endocytosis, a portion of the plasma membrane is pulled into the inside of the
cell forming a small, spherical structure known as an endocytic vesicle. This
research will investigate the cellular machinery that carries out endocytosis
and how it is regulated. This project will support diversity in science and
education through training of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom
belong to groups underrepresented in the sciences. Both undergraduate and
graduate students in this project will be involved in taking hands-on yeast
research, concepts in cellular compartments, and fluorescence microscopy into
middle school classrooms. In addition, knowledge gained through this research
will be integrated in undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the principal
investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore fundamental and
outstanding questions in endocytosis. Aim 1 will tackle one of the ongoing
problems in the field: is there an endocytic checkpoint and if so how is it
regulated? It will test the hypothesis that binding of integral membrane protein
cargo by components of the machinery is a central event in the assembly of the
endocytic machinery and address a controversy regarding the function of a
scaffolding protein called clathrin in membrane bending at endocytic sites. Aims
2 and 3 will explore the activity of two new regulators of the endocytic
machinery recently discovered by this laboratory. Aim 2 will investigate the
concept that one of the new endocytic proteins regulates the actin cytoskeleton,
which provides force to pull the vesicle into the cell. Aim 3 will test the idea
that the second new protein regulates dynamics of the endocytic machinery
through ubiquitination-deubiquitination, an important but poorly understood
posttranslational modification of endocytic proteins. Additional candidate new
proteins of the endocytic machinery will be systematically tested to verify if
they indeed work in endocytosis and to understand how they work. The powerful
Saccharomyces cerevisiae system will allow for the study of endocytosis
regulators both in vivo and in vitro. The research will be multidisciplinary
including yeast genetics, live cell fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy
and electron tomography, biochemistry, X-ray protein crystallography,
equilibrium binding assays and kinetic assays, as well as modeling approaches.
