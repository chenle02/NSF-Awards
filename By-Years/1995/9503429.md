9503429 Akbar The proposed research aimed to develop a systematic understanding
of the electrical behavior of ceramic sensors in terms of their microscopic
constituents. Two model systems will be chosen for this study: (i) TiO2
(anatase)- based gas sensor and (ii) Y2O3-based thermistor. The electrical
measurement will involve both the dc and ac techniques, deep-level-transient
spectroscopy (DLTS) and thermally stimulated current (TSC). Microstructural and
surface characterizations will involve scanning and tunneling electron
microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and vibrational
spectroscopy. This comprehensive approach is expected to lead to a level of
understanding that would make a major impact on research in other areas of
electronic ceramics as well. %%% The proposed research aimed to develop the high
sensitivity and reliable sensors capable of continuous operation in high
temperature environments for extended periods and cycles.
