The "metal poor" stars in the halo region of our Milky Way Galaxy reflect more
closely than any known others the chemical abundance history of matter created
at early epochs in the history of the Universe. Using a new echelle-CCD (Charged
Coupled Device detector) at McDonald Observatory, the Principal Investigator
(PI) plans a two-year program that will complete a survey of "heavy neutron
capture" abundances (elements Ba through Yb in the periodic table) among halo
stars which was supported by an earlier NSF award to him. He will then undertake
a survey of the abundances of all accessible "ultrametal poor" stars. This
program exploits the recent detector developments which have permitted the PI to
survey fainter and fainter stars in the halo and thereby push our knowledge of
the Galaxy's chemical history back to the first generation of stars, formed
perhaps within a billion years of the Big Bang.
