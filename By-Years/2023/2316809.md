Mathematical modeling has played a crucial role in assessing and forecasting the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and informing public health policies. However,
existing models often fail to consider underreported clinical cases, resulting
in inaccurate estimates of epidemiological parameters and flawed forecasts.
Meanwhile, wastewater surveillance has emerged as a promising tool for capturing
data from a diverse population, including asymptomatic individuals and those not
captured by clinical testing. Despite its potential, integrating wastewater data
with mathematical models of infectious diseases remains largely unexplored. This
project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging wastewater surveillance data to
enhance the calibration of dynamic population-level epidemiological models. By
incorporating wastewater data, the project seeks to improve the estimation of
true disease prevalence, enhance forecasting of future cases, and monitor the
emergence and evolution of viral variants. The developed mathematical frameworks
will be vital for the ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 and similar diseases,
enabling public health officials to assess the effectiveness of interventions
and plan accordingly. This research actively engages undergraduate students,
particularly from underrepresented backgrounds, fostering diversity and
inclusivity in STEM fields. The project contributes to the curriculum and
program development at Lawrence Technological University, establishing a
sustainable and interdisciplinary research program in mathematical biology.

This project aims to address the limitations of existing mathematical frameworks
used to model infectious disease spread, which often suffers from inadequate
calibration due to underreported cases resulting from asymptomatic individuals
and low self-reporting. As a consequence, critical epidemiological parameters,
such as the basic reproduction number, are poorly estimated, leading to
inaccurate forecasts and a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms
driving infection transmission. To overcome these challenges, the project will
develop mechanistic mathematical frameworks that enhance traditional SIR-type
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) models, commonly associated with a system of
ordinary differential equations. These enhanced models will incorporate two
additional sources of data: viral RNA copies found in wastewater and viral RNA
copies found in stool samples. The incorporation of wastewater viral RNA copies
will introduce a new variable into the SIR-type model, governing the dynamics of
viral concentration in wastewater over time. The viral shedding curve,
representing the amount of virus shed by an average infected person over time,
will be modeled phenomenologically using parameters derived from clinical stool
samples. To further improve the accuracy of the shedding curve and gain insights
into its underlying mechanisms, a within-host virus model will be developed,
incorporating uninfected cells, infected cells, and immune responses within the
gastrointestinal tract. The overall modeling framework will be extended to
account for virus variants by dividing the infectious class into distinct
compartments, each with variant-specific parameters such as transmissibility,
vaccine resistance and reinfection rate. The resulting mathematical models will
be analyzed, numerically simulated, and parameterized using appropriate
datasets. User-friendly computational packages will be developed to facilitate
the implementation of these models and their interface with public health
databases.
