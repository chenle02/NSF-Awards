The ultimate goal of the Bio-Bench project is to develop skilled bench
technicians for the life sciences industry, including workers for companies
growing out of business incubators, and training of unemployed or underemployed
individuals for entry positions into the life sciences industry. To accomplish
this goal, the St. Louis Community College (SLCC) Center for Plant and Life
Sciences, with a biotechnology technician training program in a post-incubator
facility, allows SLCC to assist growing companies as they navigate the early
years of existence. The SLCC provides local companies with a Contract Research
Organization (CRO) with which they can contract work to the SLCC training
programs, allowing them to get work completed locally, and utilizing equipment
that the company doesn't have access to, while giving the technicians training
in real-world experiences. The CRO provides a much needed service for growing
companies, while providing on-site internships for students enrolled in the
technician program. Students in the program will gain cutting edge technical
skills and scientific knowledge to advance their future careers in the life
sciences. The project also provides awareness programs for middle and high
school students within the St. Louis region to educate them on the opportunities
available within the plant and life science industry. Local teachers receive
training on plant and life science-related concepts and procedures that can be
incorporated into their existing science curriculums that raise the awareness
and understanding of students as to the critical need for the industry and the
many employment opportunities available. The project is guided by an industry
advisory committee from partner organizations to establish training needs,
establish partnerships with growing companies, and assist with the
identification of candidates for the program. In addition, the project provides
emerging companies with needed incentives to stay in the region and grow to fuel
the growth of the entire life sciences industry within the city and state.
