An understanding if solar flare generation must be based on an understanding of
observational data. The interpretation of the large amounts of data presently
available presents many problems. These include identifying independent
observational data types and developing an appropriate model with which to
utilize the data. By utilizing a number of different techniques, including
artificial intelligence techniques, it is expected to gain knowledge regarding
the presence of precursors to M-class flares. This will benefit solar physicists
involved with the modelling of solar phenomena, since they may gain insight into
the relationships between observational data and the underlying physical
processes. It will also benefit forecasters making solar flare predictions and
aid in experimental planning within the near Earth environment. ***
