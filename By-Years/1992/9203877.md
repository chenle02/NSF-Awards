In the last decade the nonlinear optical properties of semiconductors,
especially GaAs and A1GaAs have been studied extensively near their bandgap, and
have been applied with limited success to all-optical switching. However little
is known about the physics and applications of semiconductors near half their
gap. Our preliminary results on a nonlinear directional coupler have shown the
potential for classical all-optical waveguide switching below half the band gap.
Based on this preliminary result, it is proposed to investigate the third order
nonlinear properties of bulk and MQW samples of GaAs and A1GaAs near half their
band gap, that is to: 1) measure the spectral dependence of both the
nonlinearity n2 and two photon absorption coefficient B2, looking for
enhancements due to gap states, excitons ets; 2) use the below half band gap
nonlinearities to demonstrate all-optical switching devices; 3) investigate
spatial soliton propagation, and its potential application to logic devices in
A1GaAs; 4) study whether the cascading of second order nonlinearities can lead
to large third order nonlinearities.
