The objective of the research is to develop Computer Numerical Control (CNC)
Spreading Machines to enhance their versatility and performance and ultimately
the productivity and competitiveness of the garment industry. This objective
will be achieved by the development of a computer numerical controller for
spreading machines as well as advanced control algorithms for fabric spreading.
The computer numerical controller with a position feedback transducer will
enable the implementation of the following functionalities: auto
threading/rewinding, auto turntable rotation, auto tension feed compensator,
auto roll unwinding system, auto edge alignment, auto lay height sensing
elevator, and the flexibility of producing large number of different drop sizes
with programmable lay length, ply height and step-laying. The intelligent
learning control schemes taking advantage of the repetitiveness of the spreading
process and accommodating the changing mass of the fabric roll will enable an
increased spreading speed with precise ply length--higher productivity and less
waste of fabric.
