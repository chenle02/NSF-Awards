9409921 Bettencourt ABSTRACT Several hypotheses regarding the extremity of
judging members of ingroups and outgroups are derived from a comprehensive
analysis of the existing and contradictory research literature on polarization
effects. The proposed research focuses on generating stimulus materials and
pilot data that will permit the PI to test three hypotheses in a subsequent
grant application: 1) the 'complexity-extremity' hypothesis that outgroup
members will be evaluated more extremely because perceivers have lower cognitive
complexity regarding out-groups than in-groups; 2) the 'black sheep' hypothesis
that extreme members of ingroups (both good and bad) are evaluated more
extremely than equivalently good or bad outgroup members; 3) the 'expectancy
violation' hypothesis that ingroup and outgroup members will be evaluated more
extremely to the extent that their behavior violates perceivers' expectancies.
The research is important because it promises to provide new insights into the
question of why people evaluate the same behavior differently when it is
performed by a member of their ingroup than when it is performed by a member of
another group. This phenomenon has implications for discriminatory treatment in
academic settings, work settings, the courtroom. By increasing our understanding
of the nature of these prejudicial effects and the psychological processes
underlying them, the present research will place us in a better position to
reduce them. ***
