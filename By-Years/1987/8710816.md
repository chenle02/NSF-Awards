Project Objectives: The primary objective of the project is to develop a
competitive research proposal on "The Mississippi Rural Poverty Project." The
project will seek to apply the Chicago Urban Poverty and Family Structure
Project (UPFSP) to Mississippi. Broader Significance of the Project: Support of
the project will assist a well trained black, sociologist to improve his
research capability and to complete the planning and development of a regular
MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful, will significantly enhance
the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and other research support.
