Information on the convection of magnetospheric plasma is for understanding
many atmospheric processes. Although extensive measurements have been made with
many instruments, there remains considerable disagreement about the nature of
the global convection. The purpose of this empirical model. We will generate a
database that has as its core all the convection measurements made by the radars
located at Millstone Hill, Goose Bay, and Sondre Stromfjord. We will also
assemble a database consisting of the values od the indices that may
parameterize the state of the global convection. Several approaches to the
mathematical reduction of the data to models will be explored. An important
product will be estimates of the variance associated with the modeling. By
binning the observational data and studying the variances, the characteristic
states of the global convection will be determined and the indices of greatest
parameterizing value identified.
