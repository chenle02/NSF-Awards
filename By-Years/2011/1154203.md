The Shippensburg University Scholarships for Educational Achievement in STEM
(Ship-SEA-STEM) program recruits academically talented students from
economically disadvantaged and under-represented populations, including first
generation college students, students from rural populations, and minority
populations and retains these students in STEM disciplines using evidence-based
strategies to support and motivate the students. The Ship-SEA-STEM program is
providing three cohorts of select scholars with a comprehensive suite of
financial assistance, support services, internship placements, and research
opportunities. Using a variety of directed team-building experiences, which
include a scientific writing course, workshops, retreats, research, and
internships, the Ship-SEA-STEM program strives to increase motivation, enhance
self-esteem, encourage learning, teach students how to problem solve,
collaborate, and develop professional relationships. The Ship-SEA-STEM project
seeks to build a culture of success among the target populations at Shippensburg
University.
