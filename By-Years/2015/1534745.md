The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the
possibility of&lt;br/&gt;obtaining real-time precise 3D depth information using
a miniature robust sensor system&lt;br/&gt;opening up a myriad of opportunities
for commercial application. Imaging sensors are&lt;br/&gt;now widespread and
inexpensive, as is computing power, already an integral part of&lt;br/&gt;most
cameras. The 3D imaging sensor to be developed enables disruptive
applications&lt;br/&gt;for manufacturing, robotics, human-machine interfaces,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and&lt;br/&gt;emerging 3D
scanners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase 2 project is focused on the&lt;br/&gt;design, development, and testing of
a miniature, robust, low-cost optical imaging sensor&lt;br/&gt;system capable of
acquiring three-dimensional (3D) information from a scene with
high&lt;br/&gt;precision and accuracy, overcoming current state-of-the-art
technologies. The sensor&lt;br/&gt;provides, from a single shot, an image and a
depth map; associating each object&lt;br/&gt;feature with its precise 3D
location. With the advances in sensing technology, 3D&lt;br/&gt;information is
increasingly incorporated into real-world
applications?from&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing to entertainment and security. The
proposed sensor provides&lt;br/&gt;improvements in depth resolution while being
fast, compact, lightweight, and amenable&lt;br/&gt;for mass production at low
cost.
