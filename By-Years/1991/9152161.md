To prepare telecommunications technicians in the 1990's that have exposure to a
wide variety of telecommunication and telecomputing techniques involving
different types of transmission equipment, analog and digital instrumentation
has been obtained to develop a telecommunications laboratory for the
Telecommunications Technology program at Texas State Technical Institute -
Sweetwater. The three workstations in the laboratory provide training in noise
measurement, multiplexing, signal analysis, signal encoding and decoding,
frequency modulation technologies, and other technical applications.
