Equipment funds will be used for the purchase of lasers and a UV fluorescence
imaging system for characterizing the temperature and concentration fields of
oxidizing species in high temperature reacting flows. The immediate application
will be the characterization of the time evolving temperature, OH and O
concentration fields inside a resonant dump combustor, an apparatus under
evaluation as a hazardous waste incinerator. Such measurements can be
accomplished nonintrusively using laser- induced fluorescence (LIF), in which an
excimer laser pumps a dye laser that is tuned to a particular transition of a
species that either occurs naturally in the combusting mixture, or else is
seeded into the flow. In general, the intensity of the observed fluorescence is
related to the temperature and density of the fluorescing species. Thus, under
certain conditions, temperature and/or concentration fields can be extracted
from planar images of laser-induced fluorescence.
