The research objective of this work is to develop methods of preparing
multifunctional surface-grafted polymer assemblies that can operate as engines
capable of directing motion of nanosized objects. The approach is to: 1)
generate surface-grafted macromolecular assemblies with gradual variation of
physico-chemical properties (grafting density, molecular weight) and surface-
grafted "smart" polymers that undergo sharp and reversible transitions in
response to temperature changes; 2) develop characterization tools for
monitoring the transport on gradients; and 3) demonstrate motion of
nanoparticles using the surface-tethered gradient assemblies and
thermoresponsive polymers.

Understanding how "smart" polymer surfaces direct transportation of nanosized
objects is expected to have a profound impact on basic science, technology, and
life sciences. For example, uncovering the conditions under which such "smart"
polymer surfaces act as molecular engines capable of controlling the motion of
nanoparticles can be utilized in designing novel methods of material assembly or
providing insight into partitioning of functional adsorbates on surfaces. In
addition, the basic principles of nanoparticle motion can be used to understand
protein adsorption and protein separation from multicomponent protein mixtures
on artificial surfaces. The societal benefits resulting from this work include
(but are not limited to) better design of medical drugs or capability of
detecting bio-warfare agents.
