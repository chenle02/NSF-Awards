The overall research objective of this project, a collaboration between CMU and
Lehigh, is to develop, study, and test new MEMS sensor system regarding its
capabilities for structural monitoring. The proposed research embraces new MEMS
transducers development, combined experimental and mathematical investigation of
the devices' multi-mode sensing performance, structural testing for
determination of condition characterization, and methods to power and
communicate with devices. Included is also an integral component of mathematical
investigation of non-linear effects of sensors performance and their
electromechanical functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will significantly
promote teaching and training of students of all levels and diverse backgrounds
by sharing experience on non-traditional mode on the basis of multidisciplinary
education. The technical outcome is expected to enhance the management, safety
and security of the public infrastructures through smart sensing and
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;
