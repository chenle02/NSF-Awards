This award supports the research in automorphic forms and representations of
Professor Goro Shimura of Princeton University. Dr. Shimura's work will be
concerned principally with the topics of: the periods of automorphic forms of
arithmetic type; differential operators on symmetric spaces; and the special
values of various zeta functions and Eisenstein series. Non-Euclidean plane
geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but
by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed
study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of
modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one
of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the
whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to
its historical roots.
