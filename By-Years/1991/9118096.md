This award provides funding for engineering design and construction of
synchrotron X-ray beamlines and associated instrumentation that will be part of
the Advanced Photon Source (APS) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. This
project will be specifically aimed at the design and construction of beamlines
for use by the earth sciences community. Projected use of the brilliant and
tunable microbeam hard X-radiation at APS include research on materials
subjected to ultra-high pressures and temperatures simulating conditions in the
interior of the Earth, aerosols, submicroscopic phases in rocks and soils, and
kinetic studies of phase transformations important in geological processes.
