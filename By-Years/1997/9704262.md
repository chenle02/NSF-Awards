In telecommunications, video-technology, and multimedia applications, a real
challenge is posed by some genuinely nonlinear problems for the solution of
which, unlike in the linear case, a final unified theory is not yet available.
Such nonlinear problems include cancellation of large nonlinear distortion in
very-large-scale electronic circuits and systems (VLSI), nonlinear sharpening of
contrast in noisy images, modeling and identification of nonlinear signal and
image sources, and content-based nonlinear compression and decompression of
signals and images. The goal of the current project is to develop a rigorous and
yet practical framework for the design/synthesis of nonlinear analog, digital,
and mixed mode filters for the solution of the above types of nonlinear
problems. The approach followed in this project is based on an Generalized Fock
(GF) space framework developed by the PI (R.J.P. deFigueiredo), T.A. Dwyer, and
L.V. Zyla. A GF space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of discrete- or
continuous- parameter Volterra functional series with a problem-dependent
weighted inner product. In the context of a given application-specific problem,
the optimal nonlinear filter structure is obtained by an orthogonal projection
of the desired filter into the subspace spanned by the representers of
interpolating, smoothing, and other design constraint functionals in an
appropriate GF space. A number of analysis, synthesis, and implementation issues
constitute the focus of the investigation.
