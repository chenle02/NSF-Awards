9450006 Sikes This project, Bridging the Gap, is designed to empower local Girl
Scout volunteer facilitators and leaders to plan, organize, and direct SEM
activities at the grass roots level. This will be done by providing materials,
resources, and training in SEM interest areas and recognition programs. The
specific goals of the project are (1) to increase the number of registered girls
participating in SEM activities presented in the Contemporary Issues booklet
Into the World of Today and Tomorrow, and in other recognition programs included
in the SEM interest area in Girl Scouting. (2) to provide training, materials,
and support to Girl Scout Troop leaders so that they can encourage girls in
their troops to participate in SEM activities; and (3) to establish a community
support system at the service unit level using the volunteer SEM facilitator to
implement SEM activities for girls at the local level. Through a national
dissemination plan approximately 2,647,000 Girl Scouts in 332 Girl Scout
councils can be impacted. ***
