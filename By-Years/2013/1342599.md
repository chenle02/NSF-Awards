Although the element iron (Fe) is the most abundant transition metal in
atmospheric aerosols, it can be a limiting nutrient in large areas of the
surface ocean. The availability of Fe as a biological nutrient depends on its
particle size, solubility and chemical speciation, all of which are source
dependent.

The set of questions presented in the proposal are focused on the physiochemical
production and measurement of atmospheric soluble Fe (Fesol), forms. In
particular, these studies will be directed towards the valuation of soluble Fe
emitted by automobile vehicle exhaust. As well as comparing the total Fe (Fesol)
associated with combustion from different motor vehicle types (e.g. gasoline,
diesel and compressed natural gas fuels) under well characterized (chassis
dynamometer) driving conditions, an effort will be made to characterize the
quantity of fuel borne Fe. A second part of the project will look at the
speciation of solubilized Fe that result from the dissolution by polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, both a fraction of common hydrocarbon fuels and a
combustion fuel by product.
