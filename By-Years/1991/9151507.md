A new Laboratory Process for the general chemistry program based on modern
computer-interfaced FTIR, UV-VIS, and GC instrumentation will be implemented.
The laboratory will be closely coordinated with the lecture and will enable
science and engineering students to learn by the methods of practitioners. The
laboratory will involve problem definition, hypothesis development, experimental
design, hypothesis testing, and assessment and generalization of results. The
grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
