This grant will allow the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens (MSBG) to transfer its
unique collection of 65,000 dried epiphytic plants (plants that grow on other
plants) to new, improved facilities (cabinets and compactor system) in
conjunction with a move to a new, climate-controlled building. The MSBG
collection is known nationally and internationally, especially for its
collection of orchids and bromeliads, and is well used in education and in
applied and basic research on epiphytes. The new facilities will also allow
growth in MSBG activity for at least the next 10 years.
