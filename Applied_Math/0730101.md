This award provides support for a conference, held in Birmingham, Alabama in
November 2007, on current research in mathematical and computational analysis of
reaction-diffusion equations and their applications. The three-day meeting is
part of the successful series of biennial Mississippi State - UAB Conferences on
Differential Equations and Computational Simulations. The conference encourages
and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and
members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.

Eleven plenary lectures and approximately 125 contributed talks are devoted to
research themes in partial differential equations with a broad array of
applications. This multidisciplinary conference brings together workers in
mathematical modeling and analysis, numerical analysis, scientific computation,
and engineering. The conference provides opportunities for graduate students and
recent Ph.D. recipients to present their work, to learn about current research
in the area, and to develop collaborations with one another and with senior
researchers.
