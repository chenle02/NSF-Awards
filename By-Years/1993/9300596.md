Dr. Martin R. Minelli and other members of the Chemistry Department of Grinnell
College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is that half of the participants will be selected from non-doctoral
public and private colleges within 250 miles of Grinnell.
