The utilization of energy by animals in natural environments, particularly
different individual patterns of energy allocation to such factors as growth and
activity, is poorly known. This study will examine differences in energy
allocation to respiration and growth in a natural population of vertebrates.
Correlations among individuals in different aspects of respiratory metabolism
(maintenance, maximal, and field) will also be determined as well as the genetic
linkage between maintenance and maximal metabolic rates. The differential
allocation of energy to lean growth and fate storage will be measured. The
investigators will specifically examine how metabolic rates, body size, and body
composition change during the active foraging season and the correlations among
these factors.
