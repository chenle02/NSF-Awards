Dr. Wilson will continue his program of computational physics. Research will
concentrate on topics in astrophysics and nuclear theory. This will include work
on neutron star collisions, supernovae models, and relativistic heavy ion
collisions. This research will study systems thought to be important for new
experimental facilities currently under construction. These systems are highly
complex; and computer simulations are the best tool to study their details to
plan future experiments.
