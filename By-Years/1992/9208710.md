Improving our ability to design and construct high quality facilities will
require technological innovations. Research plays an important role in
originating innovations. However, there are many barriers to implementing
innovations. A major new paradigm is necessary in order to stimulate
technological innovations within the Construction Industry. One proposed
strategy is based on the creation of an "Institute" dedicated to the promotion
of " Quality Constructed Facilities". The Institute would serve as the catalyst
for research directions, and the development and implementation of
interdisciplinary approaches to design and construction. The goals of the
workshop are as follows: 1) To establish whether there is a strong consensus for
an "Institute for Constructed Systems". 2) To explore the role of the proposed
institute within the National Science Foundation and the Civil Engineering
Profession. 3) To explore how the Institute could be implemented and funded.
