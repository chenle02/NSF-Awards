This grant provides funding for the development of a new computational
optimization method for engineering design called `physical programming`. This
method is intended to make it possible to optimize physical systems in a
computational environment that does not require the use of numerical weights on
system attributes. The correct numerical values of these weights, which are
typically difficult to identify, reflect the degree of conflict between the
different design objectives. Rather than using weights, physical programming
allows the designer to express his/her preferences by specifying several ranges
of differing degrees of desirability for each design objective. This new
approach is intended to bring simplicity, and reduced computational burden to
the optimization process. The theoretical foundation of physical programming and
related computational algorithms will be developed, together with optimization
visualization methods that exploit the physical programming formalism. This
grant also calls for the development of a practice-oriented course in design
optimization for seniors and first-year graduate students. The objective of this
course is to equip students to effectively use optimization in industrial
settings, using physical programming. If successful, the outcome of this
research will result in the development of physical programming to the point of
commercial and industrial applicability. In recent years, industry has
significantly increased its use of optimization to improve product designs.
Presently, the effective and reliable use of optimization is not within the
reach of most industry engineers on a day-to-day basis. Two main reasons are:
(1) the required level of expertize in optimization, and (2) the difficulty of
expressing the designer's preferences using weight-based methods. The proposed
research will address the above-stated difficulties; and will also provide a new
and more flexible framework to address linear and nonlinear programming
problems.
