This project advances the current state of knowledge regarding the governance of
scholarly digital infrastructures, comparing interoperability, interconnection,
capacity management, and systems management. Digital infrastructures are large-
scale sociotechnical systems that rely on the Internet technologies, digital
data, and social practices that work together to create functionality across
time and space. This research is motivated by the growth of large-scale digital
projects designed to support the digitization, preservation, access, and reuse
of information artifacts. The need for long-term sustainable computational
resources for information is ubiquitous across all aspects of society including
government, education, healthcare, and scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project is developed as a comparative case study in order to
contrast and compare the institutional practices of digital infrastructures, and
it pursues two research questions: What are the common and unique aspects of
digital infrastructure governance? How do digital infrastructures coordinate the
interoperability, interconnection, capacity management and systems management of
these digital technologies and practices? The first research question focuses
attention on detailing the ways in which digital infrastructures operate, make
choices, distribute resources, negotiate issues, and offer services. These
decisions both frame and are shaped by the combination of scientific practices,
the participant's interests, current technologies and their development
trajectories, and the structure and form of data. The second research question
focuses specifically on the relationships among the pertinent digital
infrastructure characteristics, digital technologies, and governance.
Identifying and articulating these patterns and structures is at the heart of
this project.
