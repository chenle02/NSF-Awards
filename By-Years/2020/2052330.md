The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve education in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The proposed project develops a
personalized tutoring tool using artificial intelligence, teaching the skill to
translate word problems into mathematical expressions. This system will identify
areas of weaknesses in interpretation of word problems, then create associated
drills. This can be used at various educational stages to help recruit and
retain students in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops an artificial intelligence
tool to assess student understanding of word problems and develop associated
tools for student drills. The initial application will be supplementary
materials for undergraduate thermodynamics courses, but the process is
applicable to STEM education at all levels. The system has a testing capability
to gather data on student performance and develop a customized response. This
system will advance techniques for self-paced supplementary education to
increase STEM student retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
