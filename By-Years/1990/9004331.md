Stomata are biological valves in the aerial organs of plants that regulate
simultaneously photosynthesis and transpiration. The opening and closing of
stomata are affected by the shrinking or swelling of "guard cells" which form
their edges. The chloroplasts of the guard cells that surround the stomatal pore
do not senesce (yellow) at the same time as those in mesophyll tissue of the
same leaf. The long range goal of the project is to culture stomatal guard cells
in ways that preserve their unique physiological properties, including the
functionality of their chloroplasts. Such cultures could be used to study the
induction and regulation of chloroplast senescence. This laboratory has
established protoplasts of stomatal guard cells of Nicotiana glauca in culture.
However, optimal conditions for cell survival have not yet been identified. A
variety of culture conditions will be evaluated to identify those that are
optimal for cell survival. To determine whether any of the unique properties of
guard cells are maintained in culture, some of the physiological and biochemical
properties of freshly isolated guard cell protoplasts will be compared to those
of protoplasts of cultured cells. The same experiments will be performed with
guard cell protoplasts from senescing (chlorotic) leaves: 1) to evaluate their
viability relative to those of guard cells of non-senescing leaves, and 2) to
determine whether there are any differences in the properties of guard cells of
the two types of leaves that might explain why the stomata of senescing leaves
fail to open in response to light. This research is directed at developing
techniques for culturing stomatal guard cells from leaves under conditions that
not only permit their survival but also maintain their differentiated
properties. The availability of such cultured cells would greatly facilitate
further research on the physiological function of these cells which regulate the
passage of water and gases across the surfaces of leaves. Since the chlorophyll-
containing organelles, chloroplasts, of guard cells behave differently from the
chloroplasts of other cells under some physiological conditions, these cells
would provide an excellent model system in which to study the regulation of the
functional state of chloroplasts. Since this research will be conducted at an
undergraduate institution it will also provide an excellent opportunity for
undergraduate students to gain first hand experience in research in plant cell
biology.
