This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of atomic spectroscopy. Professor Scheeline's project aims to optimize
a sample introduction method for atomic spectroscopy that would quantify the
analysis of alloys. An electronic array detector will be used to measure
spatially, temporally and spectrally the light emission and light scattering
from spark discharges of metal alloys. By determining these parameters the use
of this sample system will be optimized with respect to precision and accuracy
in metal alloy analysis.
