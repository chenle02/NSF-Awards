Yau will continue his investigations of geometric questions which relate to
problems in physics. His investigations of Kahler metrics on low dimensional
manifolds are of importance in superstring theory. The latter is currently being
studied in the context of the search for a complete unified field theory. The
existence of complete Kahler-Einstein metrics on Kahler manifolds has recently
been related to the positivity of the first Chern class. This result, together
with its implications for algebraic geometry, will be further investigated. In
particular, for non-compact manifolds, the construction of such metrics with
either negative or zero scalar curvature will be studied. Yau will also attempt
to find a clear understanding of complete Kahler-Einstein metrics with zero
Ricci curvature. These are extensively studied by particle physicists who are
interested in superstring theory.
