This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program award
supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to be housed in the
Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at University of Rochester. The
SEM is capable of revealing minerals features and chemical composition at the
micron-scale with magnification up to 100,000x and will be equipped with an
energy dispersive spectrometer which permits spatially resolved compositional
analysis. The SEM will be used to investigate the chemistry of synthetic
minerals grown in the laboratory that seek to mimic mineral growth phenomena
occurring in nature. The SEM will be small format and portable enabling student
training in Earth and manmade materials characterization within classroom
settings. Local outreach targeted at K-12 teacher training will also benefit
from the acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEM will support research in
experimental igneous petrology including trace element mineral-melt partitioning
studies, equilibrium isotope fractionation studies of synthetic and natural
minerals, development of crystallization thermobarometers and oxygen fugacity
determination methods The instrument will also support other University of
Rochester laboratories including: (i) the laboratory for isotope geochemistry
which performs measurements of radiogenic and stable isotope compositions of
rocks and minerals to better understand history of Earthâ€™s silicate reservoirs;
(ii) the structural geology group who study the evolution of mountain belts at
many different scales including microstructural analysis of cataclasites and
mylonites to understand deformation mechanisms and kinematic evolution; and
(iii) the paleomagnetic research group that focuses on the measurement of
magnetic remanence (bulk magnetic properties, natural remanent magnetization) of
a variety of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
