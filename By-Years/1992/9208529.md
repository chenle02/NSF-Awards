The objectives of this research is to synthesize reduced transition metal
oxosilicate and oxophosphate compounds that have low- dimensional structural
frameworks. Compound characterization will be directed toward understanding the
bond strength, spin-spin and spin-lattice interactions, band structures, and the
onset of metallic properties associated with quasi-low-dimensional structures.
The proposed research is significant because it will provide information on a
class of structural models for studying the behavior of delocalized electrons in
a confined space. These studies can ultimately be used in the development of new
materials that are of magnetic and electronic importance.
