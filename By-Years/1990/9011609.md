This 18 kW rotating-anode x-ray generator and diffractometer will provide
state-of-the-art capabilities complementing a unique variety of existing
neutron, electron, and gamma-ray diffraction programs on the campus. The x-ray
source is configured for two user beams, one for small-angle scattering
experiments and the other primarily for single-crystal experiments. The single-
crystal diffractometer is a standard four-circle model built by Huber and is to
be equipped with a monochromator. Proposed research includes studies of the
structure and phase transitions of metal surfaces and films physisorbed on
single-crystal substrates. Surface and low-dimensional physics are primary areas
of interest. Research in structural studies of metals and magnetic systems,
phase transitions in metals, liquid scattering studies, and structural chemistry
and biology can also be accommodated. The facility provides in-house capability
for experiments, graduate student training, and preliminary work for subsequent
studies at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National
Laboratory.
