9405449 Abstract This project focuses on the nature of RNA polymerase II
transcription termination in higher eukaryotes. In contrast to prokaryotes, the
3' ends of mature eukaryotic mRNAs are generated by processing rather than by
transcription termination. The processing of the nascent RNA transcripts,
combined with the inherent instability of the primary RNA products generated by
termination, has thus restricted the in vivo analysis of transcription
termination. It is clear, however, that RAN polymerase II transcription
termination is seldom, if ever, localized to single discreet site, but rather,
occurs over a region that may extend for several kilobases. both the sequence
and location of the termination region with respect to the end of the mature
mRNA are specific to each transcription unit. Although the sequences
encompassing the termination region appear to play a significant role, the key
termination signal appears to be generated by the 3' processing of the nascent
RNA transcript. 3' processing is an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of a
functional mRNA. Therefore the coupling of pre-mRNA 3' processing and RNA
polymerase II transcription termination offers an elegant mechanism for assuring
that mRNA synthesis is complete prior to transcription termination. *** The
central goal of this project is to elucidate the biochemical basis for the
coupling of RNA polymerase II transcription termination and mRNA 3' processing.
The recent development of a well characterized and highly purified mRNA 3'
processing system will form the basis of this work. The specific objectives of
this proposal are to: 1) Develop an in vitro system for the investigation of the
coupling of RNA polymerase II transcription termination to the 3' processing of
the nascent RNA, 2) Delineate the role of a 5' to 3' processing machinery and
the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. A basic knowledge of the mechansims
that serve to direct the termination of RNA polymerase II t ranscription may
lead to an understanding of the manner in which this process contributes to the
regulation of gene expression. %%%
