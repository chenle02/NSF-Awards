9408552 Clemens The purpose of this research is to investigate and optimize the
strengthening mechanisms in epitaxial metal multilayers. A previous grant
developed the capability for growing and structurally characterizing epitaxial
(001) oriented FCC/BCC superlattices by sputter deposition. Hardnesses of these
materials were investigated and enhancements nearly 300% found over the rule of
mixtures. This remarkable phenomenon is the subject of this continued program.
Using singly-oriented, epitaxial films, both the mismatch and relative thickness
of layers are varied to deduce plastic flow mechanisms. Structural
characterization involves high resolution cross-section transmission electron
microscopy of as-deposited and deformed materials so that the atomic scale
defects responsible for deformation can be identified. This information is
incorporated into the modeling component of the program, which utilizes both
continuum and atomistic approaches. %%% One result of this program will be metal
films of unusually high hardness. These films could find applications in
semiconductor, information storage, and coatings technologies. In addition, this
program should develop fundamental understanding about plastic deformation in
layered materials and ultra-thin films. ***
