The goal of this project is to explore the application of nonlinear adaptive
control and stabilization to viscous flow phenomena. The objectives include drag
and noise reduction, and control of separation, transition, and turbulence.
Adaptive and robust control methods will be applied to practical flow situations
and will be validated via simulations. The control will be accomplished via
compliant wall techniques. The resulting software will be useful to aerospace
industry for the development of advanced aerospace vehicles.
