The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide
organizations with easy access to efficient logistical planning. The project
will potentially assist emerging businesses and other organizations by providing
optimization services in road maps such as finding delivery routes, selecting
locations for new facilities, and selecting routes for cables or pipes. This
allows organizations facing such problems to focus on their core mission and
outsource the optimization. This project will enable such organizations to
provide better service at lower cost.

This I-Corps project draws on substantial research aimed at developing of
efficient algorithms for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions to
optimization problems in planar networks, networks that can be drawn on a flat
surface. Since road maps are mostly planar, these algorithms can be adapted to
work on road maps. The project builds on an implementation of the underlying
algorithmic methods. The implementation can very quickly find high-quality
solutions even for very large networks. The project will explore the
commercialization of algorithmic techniques in real-world contexts, and suggest
new optimization problems requiring further research.
