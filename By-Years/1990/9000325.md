The goal of this project is to assess the role played in tropical cyclone
formation by eddy momentum fluxes associated with upper tropospheric waves and
by wind surges in the lower troposphere. Earlier studies by the PI indicate that
the fluxes induce the radial circulation which draws warm, moist air inward and
concentrates the area of convection in developing atmospheric disturbances,
leading to hurricane formation. The principal research method involves numerical
modeling of developing and non-developing disturbances and diagnosis of the
model runs. Under his previous award, the PI used composite data (a combination
of data from a number of cases) for the Atlantic region. Under this award, the
PI will investigate individual cases, using data for the northwest Pacific
region. A new research emphasis for this project is the investigation of the
role of low level wind surges.
