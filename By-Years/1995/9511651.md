Derivation of the explicit analytic equation of motion for deformable celestial
bodies, falling at relativistic speeds in strong gravitational fields, is the
goal of this work. Dr. Nordtvedt's work builds on his fully covariant, strong
field action principle for the motion of bodies with spherical extensiol, said
action principle having been conjectured and made plausible by exact
calculations of 1/c2 order motion of such extended bodies. This action principle
for extended bodies also reveals the route for including consideration of body
deformation on the relativistic motion. Any progress which can be made to more
accurately describe the motion of realistic bodies falling in strong
gravitational fields will aid in the a-priori calculation of gravitational
radiation wave form pulses from the type of astrophysical events which have a
likelihood of being observed by gravity wave detectors being constructed through
National Science Foundation support. The sensitivity at which detection of the
weakest gravity wave signals will be made depends on the precision to which the
signal shape theoretical templates can be made.
