The proposal addresses a research program on the optimal method for producing,
closing, and adjusting control survey nets. The project has two main goals. One
is to investigate the feasibility of developing a distance measuring devive that
corrects for systematic errors caused by humidity and air turbulence. The second
goal is to investigate and implement a univeral closure algorithm that
efficiently uses redundant data by properly applying weighing factors in
proportion to ecpected errors.
