9352219 Wahl The purpose of this grant is to develop a curriculum in software
engineering that focuses on testing, maintenance, and reliability. A software
testing laboratory will be developed to provide an environment conducive to
teaching, learning, and experimenting in these critical but often neglected
areas. The testing laboratory will support increased emphasis on undergraduate
instruction in testing and maintenance. A sequence of two software engineering
courses is proposed. The second course in the sequence will be devoted to
teaching testing and maintenance principles relating to verification,
validation, reliability, debugging, reverse engineering, restructuring, and
enhancement of software. The testing laboratory will consist of a network of 5
UNIX-based RISC stations. The workstations will be used by students in the
software engineering courses and students in a capstone projects course through
ongoing experimentation in reliability, testing and maintenance techniques. By
developing a model curriculum focusing on the later phases of the software
development life-cycle, the project will provide a model for software
engineering education in the areas of testing and maintenance. ***
