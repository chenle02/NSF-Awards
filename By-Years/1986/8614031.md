This proposal requests partial funding for the purchase of a 500 MHz High-
Resolution NMR spectrometer to be used as a shared facility by a large community
of NMR users at the University of Minnesota. The instrumentation will be used
for research on the structure and stability of biological molecules in
nonaqueous solvents, ion effects on the structure and interactions of DNA,
hydrogen exchange in BPTI, E. coli thioredoxin and thioredoxin analogs obtained
by genetic engineering, structure determination of thioredoxins, structure and
mechanism of non-heme iron- containing proteins, new strategies for peptide
synthesis and design of organosulfur compound, characterizing the
physicochemical properties of lignin derivatives, and cellular processes in
intact cells and tissues. In addition to facilitating the above research, the
instrumentation will allow new long-range possibilities and developments in the
chemical and biochemical research programs at the University of Minnesota.
