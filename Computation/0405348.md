The principal investigator and his colleagues study the structure and function
of real-world networked systems, particularly information, computer, and social
networks. The work includes an empirical component concerned with the discovery
and analysis of network structure, including collaboration networks, citation
networks of papers and of registered patents, transportation and other
geographic networks, social networks, and computer networks of various kinds
including administrator and server-client networks and networks of "weblogs."
Properties studied include correlation functions, spatial structure, centrality
and similarity measures, and measures of assortative mixing and community
structure. There is also a theoretical component to the work, involving the
development of models to aid in the understanding of the effects of network
structure. Of particular interest are generalized random graph models of
networks, percolation models of network resilience, growth models, exponential
random graphs, and Markov graphs. The project also includes the development of
new computer algorithms for extracting and visualizing network structure,
particularly for the detection of community structure in networks.

The investigator and colleagues try to understand the form and behavior of
networks, particularly information networks, computer networks, and social
networks. The work has bearing on a number of issues of current importance. A
knowledge of the structure of networks of acquaintance is crucial to an
understanding of how information, such as news, rumors, consumer trends, etc.,
spreads through society. Similarly, networks of physical contact between people
govern the way in which diseases spread and computer networks govern the spread
of computer viruses. A proper understanding of the nature and progress of
infections is impossible without good network models. The work described here is
aimed both at determining what the structure of the networks in question is, and
also at modeling the effect of that structure on possible outcomes. As well as
enhancing basic understanding of these problems, the results point to ways in
which network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to either improve
network transmission (in the case of information) or slow it down (in the case
of epidemics). For disease transmission, for instance, it may be possible to
suggest effective targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow
disease spread. New data resources and analysis techniques also are developed
that will aid future work by other researchers on related topics.
