TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial funding for the 2013 Polymers Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). The 2013 GRC will be an integrated educational
forum for discussion of the most recent advances in polymer research across the
broad horizon of the field. The conference will consist of nine technical
sessions on polymer innovation in biomacromolecules, nanotechnology, catalysis,
sustainable polymer chemistry, renewable technologies, and electronic, optical,
stimuli-responsive, and biomedical materials. The invited speakers are widely
recognized as leaders in their fields and will deliver focused lectures with
broad scientific appeal. Special attention is devoted to the development of a
diverse program including under-represented groups, international participation,
and broad interdisciplinarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS) will again precede the GRC as in the last two conferences. The 2013 two-
day seminar will include only graduate students and post-doctoral associates,
who will give oral presentations and posters. All GRS attendees will be invited
to remain for the subsequent GRC, where the GRS award speakers will present
their talks to the entire audience. Strong international participation will
offer opportunities for global collaborations and discussions of emerging areas.
