RNA polymerase is the principal enzyme of gene expression and the target for
genetic regulation. Its basic structure-functional features are highly conserved
among all living organisms. The broad goal of this project is the understanding
of the molecular mechanism of RNA polymerase basic function. To this end a
combined genetic and biochemical approach will be taken using as model the RNA
polymerase from Escherichia coli. The collaboration takes advantages of the
biochemical strength of the U.S. side and specifically, it is proposed to
generate an exhaustive collection of in-frame linker insertions and deletions in
the cloned gene rpoB which encodes the B subunit of core RNA polymerase. The
mutant RNA polymerase holoenzyme (a2BBo) will then be prepared for biochemical
characterization by in vitro reconstitution from the individual subunits. The
subunits will be obtained by overexpressing them from plasmids carrying the
three rpo genes under the control of inducible promoter. The malfunctioning of
RNA polymerase caused by the mutations will be characterized using an arsenal of
in vitro assays which would allow to monitor and quantitate individual steps of
the enzyme's functional cycle. This approach is anticipated to define and map
the structural elements of the enzyme which carry out the multitude of RNA
polymerase biochemical functions.
