This project implements an innovative course delivery system to improve
instruction to the varied student audience in introductory computing. Course
delivery is based on the interactive videodisc learning station where the
student can, on the same device, watch a video lecture and practice using the
software being taught. The components of this learning station include a
microcomputer, a touch-screen monitor, a laserdisc player, and videodisc
courseware. This introductory course is required of all Computer Information
Systems (CIS) majors and serves over 1,000 students per year campus-wide. Two
quarters of pilot courses to determine the feasibility of this project produced
very favorable reactions. This undertaking makes it possible to provide a
consistent, high quality course to a broad cross-section of students and
contributes significantly to the computer literacy of the student population.
The award is being matched with a greater amount (101%) by the principal
investigator's institution.
