Small particles and film surfaces are studied using high resolution electron
microscopy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, coupled with analyses using
theoretical modeling and simulation. The small particle research emphasizes
experimental analysis of quasi-molten behavior of nanoparticles employing a
systematic examination of real-time structural evolution. The surface research
examines surface reconstructions in thin films. Plan view imaging of surfaces in
transmission electra microscopy focusses on the interaction of bulk defects with
surface reconstructions in gold and iridium. Critical to the research is the
application of ultrahigh vacuum environments to maintain surfaces free of
contamination. %%% The properties of nanoparticles and thin film surfaces depend
in part on their surface structures. This research explores the use of high
resolution electron microscopy to quantitatively describe the atomic
arrangements on the surfaces of small particles and thin films.
