This project explores the complex web of relationships within the world of legal
and medical sexual assault interventions and the consequences and benefits of
the formal system by which the State interacts with sexual assault victims. The
PI will use field research techniques to follow particular sexual assault
victims and their cases over a one-year period to understand and document the
short- and long-term effects of legal and medical sexual assault protocols. This
project is guided by three questions: 1) How do individual actors and the
evidence that they produce and document preserve a sexual assault victim's
physical violations such that they are within the appropriate institutional
structure? 2) What is the role of time in the encounter between victims and
institutional agents in the emergency room and adjoining sites? 3) What are the
multiple, at times conflicting, narratives of sexual violation and healing in
circulation at different stages in the intervention? This project deviates from
the approach taken by most studies by starting at the moment at which sexual
assault victims enter a facility that provides care rather than a courtroom.
