The purpose of this project is to develop the planning and decision making
tools for optimum resource allocation in earthquake risk mitigation.
Contributions will be made from the fields of earthquake engineering, operations
research and management sciences. The project will develop the analytical
fundamentals, the numerical solutions, and the practical applications of the
resource allocation problem for earthquake risk management. It is intended to
develop the tools that would identify the sequence of strengthening procedures
that minimize the resources and maximize the earthquake risk reduction
considering monetary, time and space constraints.
