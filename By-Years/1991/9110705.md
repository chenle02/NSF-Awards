The main goal of this project is to investigate the noise characteristics of a
two-dimensional (2-D) electron gas in the presence of a strong electric field ,
i.e., when electrons are out of equilibrium with the lattice. This topic is
important because noise defines the sensitivity and reliability of semiconductor
devices. The miniaturization of these devices will lead to an emphasis on 2-D as
opposed to 3-D electron gas. In the present work we will use the Boltzmann
transport equation and the Monte Carlo method to simulate current fluctuation
(noise) in a 2-D electron gas. By calculating the time dependence of the
current- current correlation function it is possible to determine the current
fluctuation and its frequency dependence. Noise is defined by scattering
processes. We will study the contribution of localized and interface phonons to
the noise. Special attention will be paid to scattering by the electric
potential of background and remote ionized impurities. Capture by these impurity
states and subsequent release will be examined; we expect that these processes
will make major (and often overwhelming) contributions to noise in the high
electric field region. Emphasis will be placed on the optimization of low-noise
configurations for 2-D structures.
