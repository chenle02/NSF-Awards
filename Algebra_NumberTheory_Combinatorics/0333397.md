Title: Equidistribution problems and semisimple Lie groups

The investigator, in several joint works with W. T. Gan and A. Eskin, has
exploited methods from harmonic analysis and ergodic theory to understand the
equidistribution phenomenon of integer representations of invariant polynomials.
The investigator proposes to continue her study on equidistribution questions on
homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups, especially those connected with
problems in number theory and geometry. For example, the problem of
understanding compact maximal flats in Riemannian symmetric space or orbits of
lattices in various homogeneous spaces of Lie groups are of interest.

The application of ergodic theory and the representation theory of semisimple
Lie groups in number theory is one of newly discovered tools in modern
mathematics. The methods, when applicable, turn out to be very powerful and
solve some of the important problems which pure number theoretic methods cannot
deal with. The investigator is interested in the problems at this intersection
and hopes to develop further tools to deal with them.
