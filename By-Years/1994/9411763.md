9411763 Deb This is an award to support travel by the applicant to attend the
regional meeting of the European International Water Supply Association that
will be held in Zurich, Switzerland from May 15- 20, 1994. The investigator will
address a plenary session of the conference on "Water Distribution System
Performance Indicators" following the Keynote Address. This conference will
address technologies and methodologies for rehabilitation of water distribution
systems, a matter of great concern with respect to the aging of U.S. municipal
water distribution system components of the urban infrastructure. Results are
expected to identify research needs associated with addressing the ability of
these systems to provide adequate quantities of water, dependably and
efficiently.
