This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin and his
Ph.D. research was on the biochemistry of plant ubiquitin. He plans to carry out
his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Pamela Green at
Michigan State University. The proposed research entitled "Identification and
characterization of cis- and trans-acting factors involved in mRNA stability"
will broaden the training of the Fellow into plant molecular biology and nucleic
acid biochemistry.
