This study concentrates on high resolution electron microscopy(TEM) of compound
semiconductor films for increased understanding of the relationships between
atomic level structural characteristics, electrical and optical properties, and
details of advanced materials synthesis and processing methods. Additionally, it
is anticipated that these research efforts will provide a basis for relating
observed microscopic features to subsequent optical and electronic device
performance.
