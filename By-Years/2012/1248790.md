This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce
microbes capable of cost-effective production of amino acids used as animal feed
supplements. Technical research herein will test the feasibility of applying
cutting edge synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques to develop
engineered strains capable of sustainable and cost-effective production of
purified animal feed supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable,
sustainable and safe source of animal feed supplements using biotechnology. Many
plant-based animals feeds, such as those based on maize, are deficient in key
nutrients needed for growth. To improve feed efficiency and animal growth rates,
these deficiencies have been historically overcome with supplementation with
animal waste or protein-rich plant products including soy. Recent BSE (Mad Cow
Disease) outbreaks combined with dioxine toxicity (from supplementation with
fish products) however, have discouraged the use of animal products. Further,
supplementation with soy supplies excess, unnecessary amino acids that the
animals excrete as nitrogen-rich waste, a significant environmental pollutant.
Feed supplementation using purified amino acids produced via biotechnology
offers a superior approach from a safety and environmental sustainability
perspective.
