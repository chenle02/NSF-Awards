The Mobile Aero System Test (MAST) laboratory provides hands-on design and test
experience for teams of undergraduate aeronautical engineering students. The lab
consists of a nonflying, instrumented, aircraft test bed with both ground and
air propulsive systems. The use of MAST lab provides the real- world educational
impact of actual aircraft use with the safety of ground-based experiments.
Current laboratories teach individually the parts of an aircraft with little
regard to the complete system. MAST lab is an excellent venue to provide
exposure to the interactions within the complete aircraft system. New
undergraduate experiments emphasize the principles of concurrent engineering in
the areas of composite structures, propulsion, guidance and control, and most
importantly, systems integration. The laboratory is also being transported to
local schools, conferences, and special community events to promote technology-
related careers.
