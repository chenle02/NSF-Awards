This effort is to continue the development of numerical ocean general
circulation models based on approximate dynamical equations that are derived
using Hamiltonian methods. The equations are physically consistent but
mathematically simpler than model equations now in common use. Application of
the equations will be made to ocean processes that depend on density advection
and non-linearity.
