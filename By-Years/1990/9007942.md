It is proposed to construct a Structures Testing Strong Floor in the Department
of Civil Engineering at the University of Connecticut. The Strong Floor would be
40 ft. wide by 68 ft. long, have a 4 ft. x 4 grid of anchors, each with a safe
working load of 100,000 lbs, be instrumented for overload protection, have 20
ft. headroom and be serviced by a 25 ton capacity overhead crane. Regional
cooperative research would be developed with other universities, research
institutions and industry and so the Strong Floor would be a regional focus for
structures testing. The Strong Floor would allow customized testing of unusual
assemblies and serve the region to improve construction safety.
