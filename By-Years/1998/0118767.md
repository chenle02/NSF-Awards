This project extends peer-to-peer communication networks to better support
formation of virtual communities in wide area computer networks. Virtual
communities bring together individuals with similar interests, but the
difficulty of forming them and sustaining critical mass discourages communities
that serve small populations or compete with existing communities. Large-scale
peer-to-peer networks offer the possibility of self-organizing communities, in
which nodes recognize and create relatively stable connections to other nodes
with similar interests. The solution includes nodes that learn about their
network neighborhoods, nodes that offer partial (and competing) directory
services, new methods of routing messages efficiently in peer-to-peer networks,
more accurate methods of making resource selection decisions in environments
containing many resources, and a utility-theoretic model for decision-making by
individual nodes that incorporate multiple task requirements (e.g., cost,
accuracy, and reliability). The scientific results will be more robust and
efficient peer-to-peer networks, new techniques for forming virtual communities,
and a better understanding of how complex peer-to-peer networks work. A software
simulator will enable CS, MIS, and Business students to study virtual
communities, for example testing hypotheses about why marketplaces fail or
policies that encourage community formation. The basic science can be used to
build search tools that explicitly consider tens of thousands of databases,
software that supports dynamic creation of virtual communities within
organizational intranets in response to unforeseen developments (e.g., the DoD),
and wireless networks in which devices work whenever they are in range of
another device.
