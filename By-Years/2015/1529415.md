The objective of this project is to enable archives and libraries to securely
deliver born-digital materials to networked patrons. Examples of such materials
include commercial and academic publications such as interactive CDROMs as well
as the archived materials of citizens. Archives are increasingly accepting disk
drives or even entire computers, yet access to such materials requires the use
of obsolete software designed for archaic platforms. Further, access to these
materials may be restricted to authorized researchers. This project will project
will make it possible to deliver such materials over the Internet while
retaining institutional control. This will provide further access to materials,
many of which may be products of Federally funded
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and evaluate viable
emulator architectures supporting remote access to born-digital materials while
addressing three major issues: (1) portability and maintenance of emulator
platforms, (2) principled control of required system software, and (3)
principled control of digital artifacts. The definition of "principled control"
may vary with the materials being accessed -- from copyright control, to secure
access to sensitive materials. This project will weave together existing
technologies (e.g. trusted platform modules) in potentially novel ways to solve
a pressing societal problem.
