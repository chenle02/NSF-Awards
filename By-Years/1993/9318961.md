9318961 LaFleur Aquinas College requests support from NSF for a connection of
its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET. Michnet is the midlevel network
located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and network
information services. It will give Aquinas College a 56 thousand bits per second
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
