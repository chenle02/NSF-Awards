This research is a theoretical and experimental study of bubble size
oscillations in time varying pressure fields. Previous analysis will be extended
to include the influence of gas solubility which becomes important for highly
soluble gases or for low solubility gases but at large amplitude pressure
fluctuations. The results for bubble dynamics from this microscopic view point
will be used to derive suitable macroscopic (averaged) equations for pressure
waves in bubbly liquids and fogs. The research should lead to improved
capability for predicting two phase flows with possible phase change such as
occurs in reactor thermal hydraulic systems and in accidental releases. It
should also be of use for cavitation, medical applications of ultrasound, and
ultrasonic cleaning.
