Many concepts in science and mathematics are learned in the context of reading
scientific textbooks and popular writings on science. This study will
investigate how the meanings of words are extracted from the context of text. It
is aimed at understanding the process in which concept meanings are extracted
from text. The research team seeks to (a) extend and develop algorithms for
computational contextual vocabulary acquisition (CVA) (i.e., learning from
context); (b) to unify a disparate literature on the topic of CVA from
psychology and other fields, and (c) to use the knowledge gained from the
computational CVA system to explore its implications for educational curriculum
and learning. The knowledge gained from case studies of students using the CVA
techniques will feed back into further development of computational theory. This
project falls within Quadrant 2 (fundamental research on behavioral, cognitive,
affective and social aspects of human learning) and Quadrant 3 (research on SMET
learning in formal and informal educational settings).
