9354031 Bayliss Three science/mathematics faculty from San Jose State College
are designing and presenting a team taught capstone course emphasizing the
integration of the natural and physical sciences with mathematics for senior
preservice science and mathematics majors. The course will present several of
the themes in the Science Framework for California Public Schools in an
integrated mathematics/science format. Related faculty development workshops are
presented at San Francisco State University. The initial workshop, for all
science and mathematics faculty, explores new methods of teaching and learning.
A second workshop, for Biology Department faculty, raises the level of awareness
on how faculty learn and how, as science and mathematics teachers, faculty can
serve as role models for preservice teachers for excellence in teaching. The
focus is, in part, on learning from the constructivist perspective. ***
