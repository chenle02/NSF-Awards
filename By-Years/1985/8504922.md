Large numbers of software packages dealing with various aspects of production
planning and control are appearing on the market. They are sold under the rubric
of computer-integrated manufacturing. In practice, this is an inappropriate
term. Various languages are used; the packages will not run on all machines,
and, worse yet, they are not integrated. One part of this problem will be
addressed. The flow of information will be traced through a manufacturing
company, from business planning through completion of product manufacture.
Manufacturing Resource Planning modules (MRPII) are available for processing
much of this information. A software house will provide an MRPII system for the
project. This system will be interfaced with a computer drafting module obtained
from NASA. CAD data will feed the Bill of Material module, with provision for a
formal Engineering Change procedure. The data can then be used for preparation
and release of purchasing or shop orders. A number of bridges between the CAD
and the MRPII system will be developed.
