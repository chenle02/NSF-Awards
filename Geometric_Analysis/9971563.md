Abstract



Award: DMS-9971563

Principal Investigator: Michael Wolf



Michael Wolf proposes to continue his studies of the applications

of Teichmuller theory to the theory of complete minimal surfaces

in space and of the applications of new techniques in harmonic

maps to singular spaces to problems in Teichmuller theory,

discrete groups and (smooth) harmonic maps theory. In

particular, he proposes to extend his present methods for finding

complete minimal surfaces to periodic minimal surfaces, then

proving their embeddedness via a combination of

Teichmuller-theoretic and minimal surface methods, and then

finally studying limits of families of these surfaces as their

genus increases. He also proposes to classify the minimal maps of

surfaces into a particular building associated to convex

projective structures on Riemann surfaces (in order to identify a

geometrically natural compactification of the space of discrete

faithful representations of a surface group into the Lie group of

convex projective transformations). Finally, he proposes to use

harmonic maps to singular spaces (both with mild singularities

and more serious singularities, like real trees) to study bending

measure coordinates on the Bers slice of Quasifuchsian space, and

harmonic maps between hyperbolic spaces.



The fundamental questions underlying all of this are, "What are

the possible shapes of surfaces we might encounter?", and "What

shapes arise if we require the surfaces to be efficient users of

material, in some sense?" There are, of course, many ways of

interpreting the words "shape" and "efficient", and different

applications of the proposed research would most likely involve

different interpretations of those words. This research project

is an attempt to advance our understanding of the possibilities

for the shapes of soap films (which efficiently use material --

some applications of this theory by others to material science is

in its embryonic stage) and for three other types of shapes. We

also study the possible ways of transforming one surface into

another in an energetically efficient way. It turns out that all

these different problems are deeply interrelated, so advances in

one area often lead to advances in others.
