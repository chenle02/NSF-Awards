Prof. Oyama will continue studying the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of
organic compounds with ozone over transition metal oxide catalysts. Oxygenate
and aromatic compounds, such as ethanol and toluene, will be oxidized
competitively over Mn or Mo oxides supported on zirconia, titania, alumina and
silica. The various supports will provide different reductibility - thus
electron-accepting capability-to the oxides. The kinetics and mechanism of
reactions, and the key steps determining selectivity will be studied by isotopic
distribution. The adsorbed intermediates will be investigated by in situ laser
Raman spectroscopy. The chemistry of oxidation with ozone will also be studied
in separate flow reactor at high flow-rates on other oxides of interest. Oxides
of Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni, wash-coated on open-cell foam substrate, will be
tested in terms of activity for low-temperature catalytic oxidation of VOC model
compounds with ozone.
