This award supports a workshop to plan for the implementation of modern
geoscience transects across the interior of the Antarctic continent. The
workshop would bring together scientists with experience in over-ice geophysical
traversing and with expertise in modern geophysical (especially seismic)
techniques. The workshop will be convened July 19-22, 1989, immediately
following the 28th International Geological Congress in Washington, D.C.. It
will consist of two days of open discussion followed by two days of detailed
planning by a smaller group. The end product of the Workshop would be a detailed
science plan for a U.S. contribution to the international effort on Antarctic
geoscience transects. The convenor of the workshop is Dr. Ian Dalziel,
University of Texas, Austin.
