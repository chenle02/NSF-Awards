This grant develops the Platteville Atmospheric Observatory, located in
Platteville, Colorado. The observatory currently has VHF, UHF, and boundary
layer wind profilers for lower atmospheric measurements of winds, waves and
stability. The PI plans to establish a medium frequency radar and all-sky meteor
radar, providing measurements of upper atmosphere winds. She will also upgrade
the VHF wind profiler and UHF boundary layer profiler to provide greater
sensitivity for atmospheric coupling and precipitation studies. In sum, these
acquisitions, developments and upgrades will implement research of large scale
wave motions and their influence on circulation, wave-wave interactions,
coupling of energy and momentum between regions of the atmosphere via gravity
waves, boundary layer evolution, and land-atmosphere hydrological processes.
