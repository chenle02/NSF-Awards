Abstract

Title: Integrating the Local and Global Structure of Natural Scenes PI: Michael
Lewicki, CMU Co-PI: Aude Oliva, MIT

One of the fundamental problems in modeling human vision is understanding the
visual cues and computations that underlie the perception of natural visual
scenes. Recent studies have suggested that there exist important aspects of
scene perception which do not depend on the recognition of objects in the scene
and are more global or holistic in nature. The objective of this proposal is to
use integrated theoretical and experimental approaches to gain insight into the
information processing that underlies the representation of natural scenes and
the computation of their global and spatial layout properties. The research will
be driven by the theoretical hypothesis that visual system representations at
both a local and global level are adapted to the statistical structure of the
natural images and scenes. This project will investigate local structure of
natural images by developing hierarchical statistical models of local textures
and testing to what extent human observers are sensitive to the same statistical
features. The spatial structure of natural images will be investigated by
developing statistical models that identify scene regions over which there are
smooth changes in the local texture distribution and comparing the resulting
segmentation to that of human observers. The global structure of natural scenes
will be investigated by developing a statistical model that learns holistic,
statistical representations, with the aim to evaluate scene depth and spatial
layout information as human observers do. The broader impact of this work is
that it will develop theoretical models that can be directly tested at a
perceptual level and are also sufficiently detailed that they could lead to
testable models of the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, it will be
essential to understand the computational principles underlying human perception
in order to emulate their behavior in machines and also to better understand our
own visual experience.
