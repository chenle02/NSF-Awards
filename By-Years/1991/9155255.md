This program offers a three year sequence of four-week summer institutes in
Biology, together with dissemination and outreach activities, as part of the
Woodrow Wilson National Science and Mathematics Leadership Program. The four-
week institutes, which begin in the summer of 1992, are held on the campus of
Princeton University. The 1992 institute is devoted to the topic area of
bioethics, the 1993 institute to a comprehensive view of traditional and
contemporary biotechnology, and the 1994 institute to middle school biology. The
four-week institutes include lectures, laboratory activities, modeling of
teaching methods designed to involve students in their learning, extensive use
of computer technology, and both small group and individual projects. In the
follow-up and outreach activities, materials written by the participants are
field-tested in their own classrooms and reproduced for distribution to peers.
Further dissemination occurs through one- week workshops conducted in subsequent
years by teams of lead teachers selected from institute participants. Continuing
contacts among the participants and the growing number of other classroom
teachers included through the outreach projects are encouraged through a
telecommunication network.
