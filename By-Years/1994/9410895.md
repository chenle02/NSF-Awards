9410895 Siddiqi This research program is to investigate the hypothesis that
seismic deformations can cause, or contribute to, drain clogging of earth dams,
specifically, the Tampas Canyon Dam. This dam has been shaken by several
significant earthquakes, including the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake
and its after shocks. In recent years it has been observed that the water table
(phreatic surface) has been rising significantly at this dam due to improper
functioning of the inclined drains, resulting in seepage on the downstream
slope. The Tampas Canyon Dam is an earth and rockfill dam, and is located in San
Juan Capistrano, Orange County, California. A complete geotechnical
investigation during the past three years has indicated that the factor of
safety under pseudo-static conditions with the existing elevated phreatic
surface is well below the acceptable level. Several borings have revealed
significant clogging of the drains with upstream core material. Based on the
results of this investigation, it is hypothesized that the presence of the core
material has been caused by disruption of the existing bond between the drain
and the core due to seismically induced deformations. Relative displacement of
the core and drain, along with loosening of the core material, are thought to
result in the intrusion of the fine-grained core material into the coarser and
more porous drain material. No definitive proof of this mechanism has so far
been found. The objective of this investigation is to determine if changes in
the phreatic surface at this dam are caused by seismically- induced settlements.
This is being accomplished by monitoring horizontal and vertical movements
within the embankment due to significant aftershocks. Piezometer readings and
pool elevations are monitored to determine if a rise in the phreatic surface
occurs. ***
