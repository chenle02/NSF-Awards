This project examines environmental conflicts surrounding proposed and completed
cases of dam removal in the northeastern United States, focusing in particular
on the social dimensions of these conflicts. Over the past several decades more
than 900 mostly small dams in the United States have been removed due to
increasing public concern over the safety of aging dams, an unwillingness to
invest scarce resources in infrastructure repair, and a growing interest in
restoring degraded ecosystems. Despite a decade's worth of research on the
legal, social, economic and cultural dimensions of dam removal, there remains a
vital need for comprehensive research on the multiple facets of the dam removal
process, particularly in cases that generate conflicts among state agencies,
environmental advocacy groups and local communities. The research asks the
following questions. What are the biophysical and social characteristics of
locations targeted for dam removal? What are the key technical, economic and
environmental rationales driving dam removal processes? How do scientific
knowledge and cultural values shape the dam removal process and generate
conflicts? Considering debates on the origins of environmental conflicts and the
way in which landscapes reflect cultural attitudes, the research sheds light on
the shifting character of environmental politics in the United States as
revealed through contestation over dam removal. This study uses both
quantitative and qualitative techniques, including geographic information system
(GIS) technologies and semi-structured interviews, to analyze more than 100 dam
removals in New England, creating a regional assessment that analyzes both the
environmental and social dimensions of the removal process.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators anticipate that stakeholders, including
government agencies, environmental groups, and community organizations, will use
the results of this research to advance ongoing studies on watershed restoration
and encourage more informed national dialogues on dam removal and ecological
restoration. This project will offer significant training and research
opportunities for Dartmouth undergraduate students (particularly those
participating in the Women in Science Program) in combined qualitative-
quantitative methodologies. The collaborative team of physical, geospatial, and
social scientists will serve as an important template for future inter- and
intra-disciplinary studies in geography and spatial sciences.
