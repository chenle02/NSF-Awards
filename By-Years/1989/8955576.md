Brandeis University will initiate a 4-week, multidisciplinary, residential
Young Scholars project which will be a component of the Brandeis Summer Odyssey
Program for high school students. This project will provide full, need-based
scholarships to 30 students in grades 10- 11. The Brandeis Summer Odyssey
Program is designed to encourage young people to pursue their interests in
science by introducing them to unique academic and career options. This is
accomplished through class and laboratory work, a lecture series, field research
and trips, and interaction with leading research scientists.
