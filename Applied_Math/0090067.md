Asymptotic and Statistical Analysis of Volatility and its Implications for
Derivative Pricing and Risk Management

Proposal Number: 0090067 PI: K. Ronnie Sircar Department of Operations Research
& Financial Engineering Princeton University.

In modern financial markets, investors are increasingly faced with exposure to
changing and uncertain volatility. This project concerns mathematical models in
which volatility is a stochastic process, and their use in derivative pricing
and risk management. The main aim is to develop an efficient and robust
framework in which models are calibrated from observable market data and then
used to design risk-minimizing strategies that hedge a portfolio against the
potentially serious consequences of changing volatility. This problem is
important for investors from large trading institutions to individuals with
pension funds.

The spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the last
twenty-five years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of dollars in the
US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk (mis)management
disasters, such as the Barings, Orange County and Long Term Capital Management
fiascos, have created an urgent need for smart mathematical and computational
models to quantify the respective risks and rewards of such investments. This
project aims to build on the methodology introduced by Black, Scholes and
Merton, to take into account the fluctuating nature of market volatility.
Mathematical tools are combined with statistical analysis of past prices to
produce formulas and software that accurately capture the potential losses and
gains in today's vast derivative market.
