The Main Conjectures of Iwasawa theory which have been studied up to now relate
the first Chern classes of Iwasawa modules and Selmer complexes to p-adic
L-series. The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher
Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define
higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This
will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of
Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with
connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series. To do this, one needs
enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension
features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i)
Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for
imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.
Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have
trivial support in codimension one; the PIs will study their codimension two
support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and
Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols
in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series. Concerning (iii), the PIs
will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the
function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras. One
further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern
classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main
Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of
tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation
theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.

This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of
algebraic equations. In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of
such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa
showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led
to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry
groups arising from such families. The proof of such "Main Conjectures" has been
one of the central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years. This
proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with
more precise measures of rates of growth. Concerning broad impacts, work on
algebraic questions of this kind has led to the development of technology
essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission
of data.
