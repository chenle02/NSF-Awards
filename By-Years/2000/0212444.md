Several million U.S. workers were exposed to asbestos, which causes a variety of
diseases that range from non-disabling to fatal. At least 500,000 individuals
have filed tort claims related to asbestos exposure and, because a typical
claimant files claims against 20 defendants, as many as 10 million claims may
have been filed. Liability costs have caused about 75 large firms to file for
bankruptcy. The eventual cost of asbestos liability is estimated to be as high
as $200 billion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the large volume of asbestos
lawsuits has clogged the dockets of many courts, judges have tried new legal
procedures to encourage quick resolution of claims-including consolidation of
multiple lawsuits for trial, bifurcation of trials into multiple phases, and
"bouquet" trials. Part of the project involves collecting a dataset of asbestos
trials and using regression analysis to examine how these new legal procedures
affect trial outcomes and incentives for additional plaintiffs to file lawsuits.
Also, a large fraction of asbestos trials result in punitive damages compared to
other types of trials. The project will estimate the frequency of punitive
damage awards in asbestos trials, the degree of concentration of punitive damage
awards on a few firms and whether punitive damage awards have been a significant
factor in asbestos firms' bankruptcies. Other parts of the project will examine
how asbestos settlements are influenced by trial outcomes, how firms with large
asbestos liabilities decide whether to file for bankruptcy, and how insurers
affect asbestos firms' litigation strategies. A final part of the research
involves comparing compensation of asbestos victims to compensation of victims
of a different mass tort. The comparison will show whether the asbestos mass
tort is qualitatively different from other mass torts or merely larger.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will advance scientific knowledge of mass
torts and how the court system and the bankruptcy system deal with them. In
particular it will determine the extent to which asbestos liabilities and
bankruptcies have increased as a result of procedural innovations that were
developed to deal with congested court dockets. The research will provide
information and analysis to inform the policy debate concerning how asbestos and
other mass torts should be handled and whether a new approach, such as an
administrative compensation scheme, is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
