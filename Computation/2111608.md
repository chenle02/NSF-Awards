Partial differential equations form an integral part of modern sciences.
However, they have limitations as models for our increasingly connected world as
well as for extreme and anomalous events such as financial crisis, material
failures, and disease outbreaks. Other nonlocal equations in contrast are useful
for models of traffic flow, epidemics, materials with defects, population and
flocking dynamics, and finance, as well as for image and data analysis. This
project develops systematic mathematical frameworks with efficient and reliable
numerical methods for nonlocal models with applications to several important
multiscale and nonlinear systems of importance in modern sciences and society.
Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary research. The project
comprises three sub-projects. The first is concerned with the important issue of
designing efficient numerical algorithms for systems formulated on unbounded
domains. The project will use an approach of a reflectionless perfectly matched
layer for nonlocal wave equations; rigorous numerical studies will be conducted
and a systematic understanding of the discrete and continuous perfectly matched
layers for nonlocal waves will be provided. The second sub-project aims at
developing asymptotically compatible finite element schemes for non-self-adjoint
and nonlinear systems; the project will develop new theories for singular
perturbed nonlocal convection-dominated diffusion problems and semi-linear
nonlocal problems that are crucial for the robust simulation of parametrized
nonlocal models. The third sub-project aims at providing easily implementable
positivity-preserving meshfree finite difference discretization for a class of
nonlocal operators; the project will tackle stability issues while maintaining
the positivity-preserving properties and other advantages of meshfree methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
