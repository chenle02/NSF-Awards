The objective of this project is to support the continued development of the
integrated polymer technology laboratory course through the purchase of a high-
shear mixer/extruder. This instrument provides students with hands-on experience
in polymer processing (e.g., extrusion, mixing, and compounding), polymer
rheology, and polymer processability. In addition to the hands-on experience,
the students are introduced to a unique integrated laboratory experience, as
well as increased polymer education in ancillary courses. The high-shear
mixer/extruder is key to completing the laboratory integrated laboratory
concept. The high-shear mixer provides students the ability to prepare samples
from their own neat resin and fillers, in the course of which detailed studies
of the effects of processing on polymer properties can be analyzed. In the
integrated polymer laboratory, students directly determine the correlation
between processing parameters and mechanical properties and investigate
important polymer engineering and science principles. The laboratory experience
includes an element of design that requires students to apply knowledge from
their classroom experience in order to formulate and test specific formulations
to enhance a particular mechanical property. This project is projected to affect
240 undergraduate students, 9 college faculty, 10 pre-college students, and 4
pre-college teachers over its 2-year life. A similar effect is expected in the
ensuing years. *
