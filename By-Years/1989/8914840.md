About a dozen experts from the biochemical engineering community are planning to
hold a 2-day workshop/conference on Research and Training Needs and
Opportunities in Bioengineering and Biochemical Engineering. The workshop is a
response to the growing need for the United States to establish a future
direction in the field both in research frontiers and training of the future
generation of bioengineers. The major objectives will be to discuss and
formulate a consensus on policy and strategy issues, scientific and research
issues, and training issues relevant to future national needs in the discipline
of bioengineering and the natural interfaces with other areas of bioengineering.
