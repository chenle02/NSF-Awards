This project provides funding for travel awards to graduate students in order to
attend the 2014 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis for Systems
and Software (ISPASS-2014). ISPASS is a premier forum for presenting,
discussing, and debating advanced academic and industrial research work focused
on performance analysis in the design of computer systems and
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused primarily on broader
impacts through the education students will receive from attending the technical
sessions of ISPASS, mentoring that they will receive through the interaction
with senior researchers, and networking opportunities they will receive through
numerous different conference activities.
