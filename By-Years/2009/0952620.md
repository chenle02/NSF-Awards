This grant provides travel grants to U.S. based graduate students to attend IEEE
GLOBECOM 2009 to be held in Honolulu on 30 Nov - 4 Dec 2009. It encourages
participation by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Other
criteria include evidence of research in the conference topics, and/or a serious
interest in these topics as demonstrated by coursework and/or project
experience. Women and minorities are given preference when other qualifications
are similar. NSF support is used exclusively to fund a group travel grant to
subsidize junior researchers. No NSF funds are used to conduct the
conference.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;IEEE GLOBECOM 2009 is a premier international
conference for the dissemination of state-of-the-art communications and
networking technologies and identifying future directions in the research and
development areas. This conference offers not only technical paper presentations
but also a wide range of other educational formats, including panels, tutorials,
industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches by academic and industry
leaders. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Attendance at this type of technical conference
provides students with a broader understanding of the research field and also
allows for ample opportunities to interact with peer graduate students from
other institutions, to meet with leading researchers and to grasp the state-of-
the-art of the industry.&lt;br/&gt;
