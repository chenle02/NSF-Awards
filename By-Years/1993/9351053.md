9351053 Shaw This project emphasizes an integrated approach to the teaching of
courses in digital geographic techniques to undergraduate students. Using
designed and coordinated laboratory exercises, students learn the principles and
techniques of computer- assisted cartography, remote sensing, digital image
analysis, and geographic information systems. More importantly, These laboratory
exercises are designed to teach the interrelatedness of different techniques,
and to give students a good understanding of how these techniques can help solve
real-world problems in geography. Also, a laboratory manual consisting of
related exercises and instructions will be produced as a result of the project.
