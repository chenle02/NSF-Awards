This award funded through the NSF Chemical Synthesis program supports work in
the research group of John F. Berry at the University of Wisconsin--Madison
aimed at using multiple inorganic functional groups to promote multi-electron
processes. Here an "inorganic functional group" is defined as a unit capable of
at least one redox reaction. Thus, combining multiple functional groups should
lead to the observation of multiple redox reactions available to the same
molecule. For example, a compound having a Mo(II)-Mo(II) quadruple bond
'functional group' can undergo two-electron oxidation to yield a triply-bonded
Mo(III)-Mo(III) species, and a metal-oxo 'functional group' can undergo two-
electron oxygen atom transfer processes. These two functional groups can be
combined in such a way as to permit reversible four-electron redox and O-atom
transfer reactions to take place. In this work, the exploration of compounds
that combine inorganic functional groups will provide a pathway towards the
discovery of new multi-electron reactions. The inorganic functional groups to be
studied range from metal-metal multiple bonds, including metal oxo, carbene, and
nitrido compounds, to heterometallic species in which each metal serves as a
separate functional group.

Multi-electron reactions are very important in chemistry as well as in
biological processes. For example, multi-electron reductions of molecules such
as molecular oxygen are not only biologically important, occurring in aerobic
respiration, but also play key roles in important energy-related technologies,
such as fuel cells and water splitting. A fundamental challenge in the chemical
community is to improve the efficiency of such multi-electron reactions. New
ways to facilitate multielectron chemistry are of great significance, and this
award supports a conceptual advance aimed toward the discovery of new multi-
electron reactions. This advance involves combining traits of different
transition metal compounds, each individually capable of electron transfer, into
new compounds able to perform multi-electron transfer.
