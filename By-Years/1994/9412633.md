9412633 Foss This work consists of a collaboration between the PI and
researchers at the Ford Motor Company. The PI will spend one semester of a
sabbatical leave at Ford working with various colleagues in the fluid mechanics
area. It is expected that there will be substantial collaboration during this
period. It is also viewed as likely that continuing funding from Ford will be
available as the result of the PI identifying significant problems to which he
can contribute. It is also expected that the knowledge gained by the PI will
directly impact upon on-going courses he offers and that new and relevant
examples will be brought into the classroom and laboratory. ***
