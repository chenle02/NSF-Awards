Magnetic fields are a conspicuous feature of the ionospheres and magnetospheres
of planets, including Earth, though their origin (the dynamo problem) is not
well understood. This project is a theoretical investigation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, or turbulent flow in the presence of
magnetic fields. High resolution numerical simulations will be employed, and
will be used to evaluate a method of simplifying turbulence processes called the
Lagrangian-averaged (or "alpha") model. When validated, the method will be
applied to MHD regimes relevant to the geodynamo (so-called low magnetic Prandtl
number regimes) that have not been modeled previously. The work will not only
advance the understanding of the geodynamo but will be a test of the alpha
model, which has been proposed for other investigations of turbulent flow. The
project provides for training graduate students and a postdoctoral research
associate, and will sponsor an international workshop at NCAR on the modeling of
complex geophysical flows in the summer of 2006. The grant is funded jointly by
the Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the Division of Mathematical Sciences
through the NSF program, Collaborations in Mathematical Geosciences (CMG).
