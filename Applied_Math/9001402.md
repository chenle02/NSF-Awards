With this award the principal investigator will continue his application of
asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type to the study of bifurcation
problems and moving boundary problems that arise from reaction-diffusion
systems. In particular, he will investigate so-called singular bifurcation
problems, wherein small changes in the bifurcation parameter can cause large
responses in the system, laser instabilities, and the changing time history of
the moving interface in certain pharmaceutical problems involving the time-
release of medication. This proposal is concerned with bifurcation phenomena. As
an illustration, stand a plastic ruler on its end and push on the top end. If
you do not push very hard nothing happens. But if you push sufficiently hard the
first thing that happens is that the ruler bows, either to the left or to the
right. We call this a bifurcation: the configuration of the straight ruler has
split (bifurcated) into one of two possible shapes. Applying still more force to
the ruler results in an even number of bowed shapes having more and more curves.
The principal investigator will study the number of solutions that bifurcate
from a given solution of systems of equations that govern lasers and release of
chemicals in the body.
