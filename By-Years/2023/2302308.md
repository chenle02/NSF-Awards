This award supports a meeting on mathematical logic, titled a Very Informal
Gathering of Logicians, from Friday February 10, to Sunday February 12, 2023, at
the University of California Los Angeles. This is the twenty-first in a series
of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been
one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The
meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important
advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific
projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate
students and early career researchers, to allow them to come to the meeting.
Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and university
teachers. What they learn at the meeting will have a positive impact on their
research and teaching.

The meeting is scheduled to have twelve talks, on a wide range of topics within
mathematical logic, including set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and
philosophical logic, with speakers at all career stages who have obtained
outstanding results in these fields. One of the talks is a named lecture in
honor of Greg Hjorth. The 2023 Hjorth speaker is Maryanthe Malliaris. The
meeting's webpage is at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ineeman/Conf/VIG2023/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
