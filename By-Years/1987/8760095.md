This research is exploring new results from the statistics literature which are
expected to have significant advantages for the performance and accuracy of
signal models. Previously only minimum - phase (or symmetric) models could be
identified from observed data due to an implicit Gaussian assumption through the
conventional restriction to second-order statistics. By use of higher-order
cumulant statistics, the researcher is able to identify a good approximation to
the true phase of the signal model. This will be important in applications to
adaptive channel equalization adaptive echo cancellation, and adaptive array
processing. This proposal was rated first out the sixteen SBIR proposals
submitted to the MIPS Division. Funding in the budgeted amount of $49,499 for 6
months is highly recommended for this Phase I proposal.
