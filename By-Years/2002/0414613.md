&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. El-Shall of the Virginia Commonwealth
University will conduct research on the mechanisms, structures, and kinetics of
the early stages of cationic, radical, and metal catalyzed radical
polymerization in the gas phase, in clusters, and on nanoparticle surfaces. The
proposed work has three objectives: 1) to determine the structures of growing
oligomers in the gas phase and in clusters, and of bulk polymers on the surfaces
of nanoparticle catalysts; 2) to characterize the mechanisms, reactivity,
kinetics, and temperature dependencies of polymerization and copolymerization
reactions in the gas phase and in clusters; and 3) to investigate the mechanisms
of metal-catalyzed polymerization, to characterize the metal-ion-organic
intermediates, and to explore the design of efficient nanoparticle catalysts for
better control of the polymerization products including metal/polymer
nanocomposites. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this
research. Teaching and research will be integrated in the university's chemistry
curriculum, and a rich outreach program will include teachers and students in
the K-12 levels.&lt;br/&gt;
