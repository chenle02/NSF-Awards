Novel high-performance helium free precession (HFP) magnetometer is proposed
for use in geomagnetic field measurements and magnetic geophysical exploration.
We propose in Phase I to define a concept for a portable laser-pumped helium 3
magnetometer which has small size, high sensitivity and low power consumption.
The key technical component is a miniature tunable near-infrared laser pump
source developed by Polatomic for NASA use in a helium 4 space magnetometer. The
laser pumping light and sensor read-out will be carried by optical fiber link
between the sensor and the laser/electronics package. During Phase I we will
assess the feasibility of the laser-pumped helium 3 magnetometer and optimize
the laser pump source for pumping helium 3. The concept will be validated in
Phase II with the design, fabrication and testing of a laser-pumped helium 3
magnetometer. In Phase II two sensors will be built in order to evaluate a
laser-pumped helium 3 gradiometer. If technically feasible, the laser pumped
helium free precession magnetometer would replace the proton free precession
(PFP) magnetometer as the world standard. The HFP would provide continuous read-
out and have sensitivity improved by more than an order of magnitude over the
PFP.
