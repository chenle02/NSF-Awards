This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the
feasibility of developing an integrated model to predict the impact of
hurricanes as dynamic turbulent system on large bodies of shallow water.
Technology International Incorporated has previously shown that the integration
of separate models for hurricanes and shallow bodies of water into a single
model has the potential of simplifying the complex task of simulating the
interaction between the two systems. Several constraints were initially imposed
on the model to estimate the feasibility of the integrated model. Such
constraints will be relaxed and some of the effects discounted in model
formulation will be taken into account. The model will be solved numerically for
various situations and the stability of the interface region in the hurricane-
water system will be investigated. To demonstrate the prediction capability of
the model, conditions at onset of chaos will be evaluated.
