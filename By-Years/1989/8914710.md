This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Jean Galtier and Dr.
Brigitte Meyer-Berthaud, Universite des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc,
Montpellier, France, and Dr. Charles Beck, University of Michigan, Ann Arber and
Dr. William Stein, State University of New York-Binghamton, centering the origin
and early evolution of seed plants. These two research groups have access to
especially large and important collections of some of the earliest known seed
plants, members of the extinct Lower Carboniferous seed fern family,
Calamopityaceae, from the New Albany Shale of the United States, and the
Lydiennes Formation of the Montagne Noire of France. In the recent years, it has
become increasingly clear that input from fossil early seed plants is essential
for correctly inferring seed plant phylogeny. However, to be successful more
comprehensive geological and geographic perspectives on calamopityacean and
other early seed plant remains must be developed. This award will provide travel
support to allow the investigators to integrate their research efforts in
several areas including: i) detailed systematic analysis of very similar
material described independently by the two groups, ii) a concerted effort to
improve the methods by which information on these forms is collected, including
development of morphometric analytical techniques for assessing homology in the
primary vascular system, iii) development of plans for a comprehensive database
on early seed plant remains suitable for a wide range of research problems, and
iv) a phylogenetic analysis of seed plant origins concentrating on the fossil
evidence of this group's early members.
