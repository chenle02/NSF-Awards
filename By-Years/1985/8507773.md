The objectives of this project are to design a set of lake evaluation techniques
that can be used to understand the functioning of an individual aquatic
ecosystem and to use this approach to predict the impact of land or water use on
water quality. The investigation combines laboratory and field experiments,
empirical relationships, and mathematical modeling techniques.
