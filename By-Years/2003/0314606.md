With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office
of Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting an integrated program that
focuses on undergraduate research, curriculum development, mentoring and
outreach. Dr. Jeffrey Willemsen of the Department of Chemistry at Willamette
University and Dr. Ronald G. Brisbois of the Department of Chemistry at
Macalaster College will focus their collaborative efforts with undergraduates on
developing methodology for the synthesis of cyclolpentadienyl-Co-
cyclobutadienyl-CpCoCb)-bridged cyclophanes. Further, the project will
concurrently seek to develop a modern chemistry curriculum and the collaborative
research will be used as a focal point for the enhancement of the Willamette
University Native American Summer Science Camp.
