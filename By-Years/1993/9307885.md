9307885 Hawkins This project will develop codified design recommendation for
PRESSS consistent with the format of the NEHRP Recommended Provisions for the
Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings. For that activity input
and feedback on the proposed recommendations will be solicited from PRESSS
researchers, and from appropriate Building Seismic Safety Council Committees,
American Concrete Institute Committees, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute
Committees and Structural Engineers Association Committee. In addition to
developing codified design recommendations, documentation will be provided
concerning the development of those recommendations from specific archival
sources of information. Also, pictorial representations will be developed of
connections and connection region details that meet the requirements of the
recommendations and trial designs will be made for representative buildings to
assess the economic and practical significance of the application of those
recommendations. A guide will be issued that contains details of those designs
and the finding from them. ***
