9560893 Yadav This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on
producing novel refractory microspheres for insulation applications. Insulation
is an essential technology with a broad impact on almost all industries. Fuel
effficiency, raw material usage, equipment size, equipment weight, and system
reliability all depend on the properties of the insulation used in the system.
Existing insulation materials have one or more of the following limitations: (1)
excessive volume or weight; (2) material degradation at temperatures greater
than 1000 degrees C; (3) low thermal shock resistance; and (4) high cost. This
project will focus on producing refractory microspheres that feature low weight,
low volume, high thermal shock resistance, low cost and the ability to work
effectively at temperatures as high as 2,500 degrees C. During Phase I, the
concept will be demonstrated. If approved, Phase II will optimize and field test
the novel insulation system. Thermal insulation is a major industry serving a
wide range of residential and industrial application needs. Low and high
temperature insulation is needed to maximize fuel efficiency in process
industries, reduce heating and utility bills in residential markets, protect
microelectronics and fragile devices from the adverse effects of heat, and
ensure safety of personnel and property on fire-prone structures such as bridges
and offshore oil rigs.
