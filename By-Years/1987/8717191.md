Recombination is a genetic consequence of sexual reproduction; it results in
chromosomes containing genes from both parents. The goal of this project is to
understand how natural selection can act on recombination. The form of genetic
variation for recombination determines how the response to selection can occur.
This variation will be studied in a population of the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster. Genes on the X and third chromosomes will be studied to see how
they influence recombination in the X chromosome. This will show the form of the
variation for recombination due to both linked and unlinked modifier genes, and
how they interact. Theoretical analysis will aid the interpretation of the
experimental results. Mathematical analysis and simulations will be done for
models of multiple recombination modifiers. The goal is to see how the net
selection on recombination is related to the selective effects from the
individual modifiers.
