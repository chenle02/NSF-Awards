9321558 Sowers This award is for support for a study to construct a 200,000 year
record of the concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere from the
occluded air parcels in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core.
This record will provide information on nitrogen biogeochemical cycles over
glacial/interglacial time periods. The concentration of nitrous oxide in air is
determined by the sources and sinks of this gas on a global scale. Estimates of
the sources (terrestrial and marine biospheres) and sinks (photodissociation in
the stratosphere) are not presently well constrained but the terrestrial
biosphere is thought to contribute about 80 % of the global nitrous oxide
emissions with the other 20 % being made up from an oceanic contribution.
Comparing an atmospheric nitrous oxide record with other bioactive gases such as
carbon dioxide and methane will help in understanding the nature of changes in
global carbon cycling throughout the past 200,000 years and will be a useful
stratigraphic tool for correlating Greenland and Antarcitc ice cores. ***
