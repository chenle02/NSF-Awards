9725059 Cross This award provides support for the acquisition of a nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) console and accessories to complement an existing 19.6
Tesla (830 Megahertz) magnet located at the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University. The resulting instrument will
form part of the National High Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility at the
NHMFL and will be available to users for a wide variety of experiments. The
830-Megahertz (MHz) console is a triple resonance, NMR instrument that can be
adapted for high-resolution capability. The spectrometer will enable
investigators to conduct a wide range of NMR experiments including solution
state NMR in magic angle spinning probes at the nanometer scale, high resolution
magic angle spinning solid state NMR of semi-solid samples, and solid state NMR
of static powder and oriented samples. The spectrometer will serve as a staging
instrument for a 900 MHz system currently being developed, and the 830 MHz
system will also be used to develop technology for the very high fields
available in the resistive and hybrid magnets at the NHMFL. ***
