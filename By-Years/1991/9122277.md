The purpose of this project is to isolate and analyze the economic consequences
of the Marshall Plan. Remarkably enough, there does not exist a single,
systematic study analyzing the economic impact of the Marshall Plan, despite the
fact it was one of the great successes of American foreign policy in restoring
the economic strength of Europe after World War II. This research is
particularly timely given the break up of the Soviet Empire and the current
debate about how best to construct an economic assistance program by the Western
Democracies. The findings of this project could provide useful insights as to
how an aid program might be structured. Specifically, the project will take
three approaches to analyzing the impact on economic growth of U.S. aid to
Europe after World War II. The first, an aggregate approach, will develop an
analytic framework that takes as its point of departure the two- gap literature
in development economics. An empirical model of the channels through which the
Marshall Plan affected aggregate output growth will be developed and estimated
for the period 1945 to 1955. The second is a sectorial approach which will use
input-output tables and data on aid-financed commodity imports to assess the
role of the Marshall Plan in removing sectorial bottlenecks. The third is
political economy approach which will develop and use models of collective
decision-making to analyze the allocation of U.S. aid.
