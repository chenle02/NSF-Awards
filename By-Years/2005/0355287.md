This project focuses on experimental investigations of the interaction of an
isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field by utilizing the wavelength
scaling of the strong field interaction at frequencies much lower than the
binding energy of an electron in the atom. Addressing these scaling laws with
novel ionization experiments using few-cycle mid-infrared (2 micron and 4
micron) pulses is crucial since it tests the very foundations of all our
understanding of the intense laser-atom interaction. A number of key studies
will be enabled by this proposal and include; significantly increase the number
of atomic systems capable of experiencing intense laser fields, allow systematic
studies of one- and two-electron systems, examine strong field interactions for
prepared states, initiate a global investigation of scaling laws and permit the
first high-sensitivity experiments on atoms in large ponderomotive potentials.
For the first time, the proposed novel investigations exploiting strong-field
scaling laws can address unanswered questions, test fundamental concepts,
explore new limits and potentially result in new discovery, all of which should
add to our understanding of the intense laser-atom interaction.
