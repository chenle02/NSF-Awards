This project involves the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of
observations of the near infrared solar corona, in an attempt to understand the
relative contributions of electron scattering, dust scattering, and dust thermal
emission near the Sun. The observations will be carried out from Mauna Kea,
Hawaii utilizing a new eclipse coronograph system. The system is designed to
observe the coronal signal in the infrared H and K bands, and at wavelengths in
between, in polarized and unpolarized light, outside and during solar eclipse.
Successful interpretation of the new observations should result in better
understanding of the role of circumsolar and circumstellar dust grains, and in
particular, should help resolve long-standing questions concerning the role of
thermal emission by dust near the Sun. This award is made under the auspices of
the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at the National Science
Foundation.
