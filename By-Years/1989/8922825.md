Marine snow is a generic term for all aggregated particles in the water column
which are 500um or larger in diameter. Aggregates in this size range are
abundant throughout the world's oceans. They are composed of algae, bacteria
protozoa, detritus organic and inorganic debris often embedded in a mucus
matrix. Much of the surface derived matter in the ocean fluxes to the ocean
interior and sea floor as large particles of marine snow. Dr. Alldredge will
continue her work on marine snow formation. The topic is of significant interest
in terms of nutrient regeneration in the ocean and the role of these particles
as a potential as a food source. There are two areas of work which she will
pursue. The first is to characterize the nutrient regeneration in the
microenvironments and the second is to investigate the role of diatoms
(phytoplankton) in flocculation. This research is a continuation of a very
successful research project which has been funded for the last three years.
