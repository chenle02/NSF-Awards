This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of photoelectrochemistry. This research activity continues and
broadens investigations of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions
and the characterization of semiconductor electrodes that were initiated during
the tenure of NSF grant CHE-8304666. This research is providing fundamental
insights into the nature of the semiconductor/liquid junction and the chemical
and photochemical reactions that can be carried out at such junctions. These
interfacial systems are of direct significance to applications such as solar
energy conversion to electricity and useful chemical products, photoetching of
semiconductors, analytical sensors, and nonlinear optical devices. This research
stresses new approaches to the characterization of the semiconductor interface
by scanning tunneling microscopy and ellipsometry, and the study of size and
doping effects in particulate semiconductors. Investigations of the design and
application of "integrated chemical systems" having tailored arrangements of
semiconductor, catalyst, sensitizer, and redox couples within a support, with
structural organization at the micrometer level, to promote desired
photoreactions will be pursued. This broad research activity provides new,
fundamental knowledge of photoinduced charge transfer processes at semiconductor
interfaces and the effects of structure and ordered chemical composition on the
efficiency of these processes. Additionally, these studies should give rise to
new photoelectrochemical devices and enhanced technologies for the processing of
semiconductor materials.
