The efficient production of polymers having precisely defined properties
requires the development of advanced process control strategies which are based
on a thorough understanding of the processes occurring in their polymerization
reactor. This in turn requires the use of on-line sensors to measure polymer
properties during synthesis. The major objective of the PI's research program is
to develop quality control strategies for free radical polymerization of vinyl
monomers, melt polycondensation of thermoplastic aromatic polymers, and
innovative polymerization catalyst systems. such strategies are based on
understanding the fundamental characteristics of the polymerization occurring
especially the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution. This
equipment grant will supply funds for the purchase of a gel permeation
chromatograph which will permit the PI to make rapid on-line measurements of
molecular weight properties. He will use this information in the design of his
control systems.
