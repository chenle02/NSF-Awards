9622669 Baumgartner This REG project develops a multi-functional robotic
platform dedicated to a support of research activities in the areas of vision-
based robotics for remote planetary surface operations, precise navigation of
flexible manipulators, optimal path planning for flexible-link robots, fault
detection and isolation for kinematically redundant robots, and high-performance
industrial crane control. The platform achieves a maximum of eight degrees-of-
freedom for manipulators enabling several robotic configurations via locking
various joints and exchanging and/or removing links of different stiffness
properties, lengths etc. The project supports the acquisition of vision sensing
equipment, computing equipment for control and fabrication of the robotic
platform.***
