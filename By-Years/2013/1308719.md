Integrating metabolic theory and population models to predict the consequences
of warming on marine invertebrates

Managing the effects of climate change is a pressing concern, but ecological
predictions are still lacking. The idiosyncratic nature of species-specific
responses to multiple stressors contributes to the difficulties associated with
predicting population responses to global change. The metabolic theory of
ecology is a starting point for understanding population responses to
temperature, against which other components of climate change may later be
evaluated. However, the application of metabolic theory to population-level
responses is in its infancy. In particular, the effects of warming on critical
life stages have not been considered in the context of entire life cycles. This
project will apply metabolic theory to size-structured population models to
forecast the effects of warming on the demographics of marine invertebrates.

The integration of theory and modeling will aid in identifying potential
outcomes of climate change beyond the lifespans of individual scientists and
provide a set of testable predictions for physiological experiments in the
context of entire life cycles. Case studies will focus on ecologically and
commercially important species (e.g., urchins, abalone) in temperate marine
communities worldwide. Collaborations with resource managers and First Nations
partners in British Columbia will raise awareness about climate change and local
impacts to kelp forests and other temperate nearshore habitats.
