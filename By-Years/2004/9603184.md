IBN-9603184 PI: King An important part of the brain that contains sensory
pathways to higher centers is called the brainstem. In this region there are
many distinct clusters of cells, called nuclei, that process and relay
information brought to them by nerve fibers from the sense organs. One nucleus
important for handling taste information is called the nucleus of the solitary
tract (or NTS). The projections of nerve cells of this nucleus from left and
right sides have been believed to continue without crossing the midline, but new
data suggest that there may be a significant bilateral projection to a higher
relay nucleus. This project uses anatomical tracing and immunocytochemical
techniques to clarify those projections. Results will have an impact on our
understanding of this important nucleus for taste processing. This research at
an undergraduate institution (RUI) also will have a substantial impact on giving
undergraduate students and excellent experience participating in a significant
research project.
