ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0103727&lt;br/&gt;S.
Hedayat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator together with his co-
researchers study and employ a combination of mathematical, statistical, and
computational tools which are useful in discovering new orthogonal arrays useful
for multifatorial experiments. Proper and relevant small Chebyshev-systems and
maximum principles will be developed for identifying and constructing optimal
designs for non-linear models. When needed genetic algorithms will be developed
for the purpose of explicitly constructing optimal and near optimal designs
useful for linear and non-linear models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
develops new methods and theory for the purpose of collecting informative and
cost effective data. Two broad cases are considered. Those cases where data are
controlled by many factors, and those cases where medicinal chemists are seeking
for natural products with chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive properties among
thousands of agents. In both cases the goal is to collect the minimum amount of
data with maximum info/cost value. The proposed research has important
applications in collecting and analyzing raw optical density data used by
medicinal chemists. This research provides a mechanism for integrating,
coordinating and expanding interdisciplinary interaction between statisticians
and researchers in the areas of pharmaceutical and medical sciences. The
emerging uses of natural products in preventing and treating disease add urgency
to a portion of the proposed research. The outcomes of this proposal will also
assist scientists working on research projects sponsored by NIH Office of
Dietary Supplements (DOS) and National Centers for Complementary and Alternative
Medicines (NCCAM).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
