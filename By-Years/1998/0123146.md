Arizona State University College of Engineering and Applied Sciences
(CEAS)&lt;br/&gt;NSF CEAS Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community
(CIRC)&lt;br/&gt;Scholars Program&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This
project provides 40 scholarships to talented low-income students majoring in
computer science and engineering. The program called the Collaborative
Interdisciplinary Research Community (CIRC) Scholars Program, includes a CIRC
Academic Enrichment Program and the Research Orientation Workshops (ROW)
Program. This project enables ASU to recruit and to retain high quality students
with financial need who, without this support, might not be able to continue
their education on a full time basis. The focus of the recruitment is on
students of junior or higher standing and transfer students, but also includes
some sophomores and some graduate students with special financial needs.
Underrepresented minority students in computer science and engineering (African
American, Hispanic, Native American, and women) are especially recruited for
these scholarships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Engineering and Applied
Sciences (CEAS) at ASU has a well, established infrastructure to support the
project. Key to the support of the scholars, is the requirement to participate
in an Academic Enrichment Program that includes workshops on study skills and
close mentoring and monitoring by ASU staff and faculty, as well as the Research
Orientation Workshops (ROW) Program, which concentrates on research and graduate
school. Scholars are also offered the opportunity to participate in one of ASU's
high profile research groups in the CEAS.&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL
