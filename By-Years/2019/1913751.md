A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will increase the data available to industry and
the general public on the feasibility of the use of air-source heat pumps
(ASHPs) in cold climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Fairbanks,
Bristol Bay Campus will conduct laboratory tests of at least three models of
ASHPs to characterize efficiency at different outdoor temperatures and heat
loads. The resulting data will be used to create an ASHP performance model that
will be used to identify boundary conditions for which savings in fuel are no
longer achieved, considering the additional fuel that needs to be burned in a
power plant to produce the electricity for the ASHP. A control strategy for
turning the ASHP on and off will be created to save fuel. A long-term model will
be developed that estimates the annual savings in fuel achieved by using an ASHP
as a supplemental heating system controlled with the developed control strategy.
The long-term model may be applied to twelve rural Alaska communities to
determine the potential benefit in a variety of real-world
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
