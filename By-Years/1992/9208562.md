The focus of this research involves the development of a process which allows
the electrochemical reduction of a redox mediator at an electrode in an aqueous
medium containing an enzyme, an alpha-keto acid and an ammonia source. The
reduced mediator will reduce the enzyme to its active state which will, in turn,
react with the alpha-keto acid to afford the desired amino acid in optically
active form. Optimization of the process could provide an economically
competitive, environmentally benign method for the commercial production of
amino acids. %%% With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry
Division and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are co-supporting the
research of Dr. Albert J. Fry and Dr. Susan B. Sobolov of Wesleyan University
and Dr. James M. Fenton of the University of Connecticut. The focus of the
research, sponsored under the NSF/EPRI initiative on Research in Electrochemical
Synthesis, is the development of an electrochemical-enzymatic process for the
synthesis of alpha-amino acids.
