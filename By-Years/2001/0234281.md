A growing concern among corporate information technology (IT) managers is the
elevating gap between the increasing system maintenance and administration cost
of the IT infrastructure and the decreasing hardware/software acquisition cost.
&lt;br/&gt;This gap is escalating because system administration and
management&lt;br/&gt;is still relatively labor-intensive and thus non-scalable,
despite extensive research/commercial efforts to automate the process. In view
of this trend,commercial enterprises resort to IT out-sourcing in order to share
expensive and precious system management expertise. Despite its compelling cost
saving advantage, IT out-sourcing so far has not been the mainstream, chiefly
because the lack of technology to enforce and certify the so-called Service
Level Agreement (SLA) between the out-sourcing and out-sourced parties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop a multi-dimensional storage
virtualization system called Stonehenge, which is able to guarantee a wide
variety of storage-related Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and thus provides
the enabling technology toenforce SLAs associated with storage service in
particular and Internet services in general. The set of techniques developed in
the Stonehenge system will carry the storage virtualization field one large step
further because they allow virtualization of storage resource almost in all
possible performance attributes that can be associated with physical disks.
&lt;br/&gt;As a result, Stonehenge allows creation of virtual disks that are as
tangible as physical disks, and yet much more flexible and easier to manage and
maintain. As an integral component of this project, we will also develop a
unified and reusable implementation framework that could quickly convert, with
zero or minor modification, a given cluster-based Internet service into QoS-
aware, such that they are capable of supporting contractual SLAs that are
described in terms of service-specific performance
metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides its intellectual contributions, this
project will make a major impact on the undergraduate and graduate education of
the CS department at Stony Brook by introducing a series of system management
courses, which will use the Stonehenge prototype as a case study on the
functionality and implementation details of production-grade enterprise storage
management systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
