Research mechanism. This project investigates the relationship between economic
reforms and political party success in post-communist Albania. The transition of
formerly authoritarian, communist nations into democratic free-market nations
has been quite tumultuous. This study collects regional economic, demographic,
and political data in Albania surrounding the Albanian elections scheduled for
May 26, 1996. Contrasted with other former communist countries, the Albanian
election appears to go against the recent electoral trend of the electorate
shifting support to former communist parties. The study will considerably
enhance our understanding of the factors contributing to continuous support for
democratic institutions in formerly communist nations. ***
