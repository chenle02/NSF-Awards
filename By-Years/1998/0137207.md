ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0137207&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this study, researchers at the University of California at Irvine will make
high-precision measurements of radiocarbon (14C) in annual bands in corals from
the Galapagos Islands in order to understand the variability of carbon dioxide
fluxes from the tropical Pacific Ocean to the atmosphere between AD 1600 and
1950. The radiocarbon measurements will be made by accelerator mass
spectrometry. Measurements of the strontium/calcium ratio and the oxygen
isotopic composition (18O) will be made to identify changes in coralline 14C
arising from upwelling-induced changes in sea surface temperature. The
investigators expect that this study will yield a record of how the CO2 cycle in
the tropical Pacific has changed on human time scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
