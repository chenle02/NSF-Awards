This planning proposal, submitted by Montana State University (MSU), requests
support for team development and planning activities that will analyze statewide
capacity and infrastructure, develop a framework for the research topic,
identify workforce&lt;br/&gt;development opportunities and develop project
sustainability. Planning activities will involve participation of statewide
teams representing the Montana University System and will include coordination
with the jurisdictional EPSCoR Steering Committee and the Office for the
Commissioner of Higher Education. These planning activities will develop the
foundation for an RII Track-1 proposal and project that will advance research
capacity and workforce development in areas that are important to the state of
Montana and promote education, inclusion, and
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
