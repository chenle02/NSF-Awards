This research is aimed at greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms
associated with the formation and stability of icosahedral phases. Several
factors associated with the development of icosahedral structure are under
examination, including effects of solute atom size, electron count and
electronegativity. The crystallization of stable icosahedral phases in the
titanium-manganese-silicon system is being examined to determine how the
behavior changes with silicon concentration. Diffuse scattering behavior and
crystallization studies are being planned for selected icosahedral phase
systems.
