This award provides one-half of the funding required for the support of a
laboratory technician to assist in the operations of the stable isotope mass
spectrometry laboratory in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Southern California. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funding required. The stable isotope laboratory at USC is primarily
engaged in research projects investigating the role of aqueous fluids in
geological processes of the Earth's crust. Specific goals of current projects
include: (1) To determine the depth to which surface (meteoric) water penetrates
the crust. (2) The nature of fluid-rock interactions across the lithostatic-
hydrostatic transition zone. (3) The role of fluids in faulting and shear zones.
(4) Understanding the influence of fluids escaping from cooling magmatic plutons
within the crust. These general goals are investigated through detailed study of
isotope variations (primarily oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur) in rocks of
the Mojave desert of California and Arizona.
