9413333 Stone-Martin Support for an NSF Backbone Transition Planning Workshop
FARNET (The Federation of American Research Networks) has requested partial
support for a planning workshop aimed at developing goals for the transition and
a model of the critical planning steps needed. It will also serve as a forum for
team building. The workshop will bring together networking stakeholders from all
sectors to discuss issues related to the transition and the next phase of the
NSF backbone evolution. This planning process is very timely with regard to the
overall interest in both the Administration and Congress for the overall vision
of the Networking Information Infrastructure and the part that the current
Internet will play in it. Funds will be used to partially defray travel costs of
the academic attendees and to pay for post forum editing and costs for
disseminating the resulting report.
