The use of intensive aquaculture techniques in the United States has placed an
increasing emphasis on maintaining water quality. Development of a low-cost and
reliable automated water quality and feed condition monitoring and control
system would provide both research and commercial aquaculturists with a means of
maintaining water quality for hatchery, nursery, grow-out and feed production
systems. Information gathered manufacturers has indicated that four elements are
required to design an appropriate monitoring/ control system: an understanding
of the biological, physical and chemical parameters critical to aquaculture;
experience in capability: and experience with control devices and electronic
theory. To date there have been no coordinated efforts to integrate these four
elements to produce a complete system of monitoring and control for aquaculture.
Utilization of off-the-shelf environmental sensors, microcomputers and control
devices integrated by software modules would go far in alleviating the problems
attendant to maintaining water quality in intensive aquaculture systems.
