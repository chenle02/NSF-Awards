Species vary enormously in the complexity of their vocal repertoire.
Unfortunately, we know very little about how this variation is matched by
auditory capabilities. Moreover, individuals can vary enormously in how much
their vocal repertoire changes over the course of the year, yet we know almost
nothing about correlated changes in auditory capability. This comparative study
of the plasticity of the auditory system will give us insight into both of these
issues. This research program will focus on properties of hearing in songbirds
using auditory evoked potentials, how those properties change across seasons,
and how they differ between individuals. The research will include an
unprecedented array of tests of hearing performance in eight species of
songbirds.. First, the experiment will test whether hearing is ?tuned? to
species-specific aspects of song, and the characteristics of the species
habitats, and if hearing is conserved among closely related species. Experiments
will also test whether individuals vary more when processing song than when they
process contact calls. Second, the experiments will evaluate whether seasonality
in hearing matches the use of vocal signals, habitat changes that affect how
sound carries through an environment, follows taxonomic similarities between
species, and whether seasonality reflects seasonal variation in social
interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Given the broad
similarities between avian and mammalian auditory systems, understanding the
plasticity of the avian auditory system is likely to help us understand
plasticity in the human auditory system, and thereby provide avenues of research
in the treatment of hearing disorders. Our work on hearing has been the focus of
a series of workshops on communication geared to high school students. One goal
of this program is explicitly to include students from disadvantaged areas. We
will also train graduate students and undergraduates in cross-disciplinary
research.
