9317825 Wangemann This proposal requests partial support for travel funds for
young faculty and graduate students to attend the topical meeting on Optical
-Microwave Interactions, to be held in Santa Barbara, CA July 19-21, 1993, under
a sponsorship of the IEEE Lasers and Electro Optics Society. The meeting will
provide a forum for presentation and discussion of fundamental scientific and
engineering advances in the interaction between optical techniques and
microwave/millimeter wave applications. The discussions will focus on several
broad areas: (1) the use of ultrashort-pulse lasers and high-speed
optoelectronics for the control and characterization of devices, circuits and
interconnects; (2) microwave signal generation and distribution with cw lasers
and optical modulators; and (3) generation of ultrashort electromagnetic
transients and their applications. *** scotco" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
