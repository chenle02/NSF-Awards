This project integrates research and education in the design of memory
hierarchies. The research augments conventional cache management techniques with
more sophisticated reference history information. These techniques include
programmer-supplied annotations, hardware buffers to identify and exploit
locality, use of latency tolerance to decide on invalidation of cache lines, and
prefetching of thread working sets. These research efforts will be integrated
into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum by adding courses, organizing a
working group on computer architecture, and maintaining a web site on memory
hierarchy management.
