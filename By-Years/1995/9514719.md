This award allows the principal investigator to engage in several research
projects in ethics and values in science while expanding his knowledge of
ethics. He will work on two projects, with five ethicists, three at his home
institution and two in the Chicago area. These ethics scholars represent
different perspectives and areas of competence (e.g., professional ethics,
ethics in science, ethics of compromise, etc.), The first project will develop a
book that will integrate ethical considerations with actor-network perspectives,
in examining domestic and international approaches to scientific and technical
development and modernization. The second involves adding ethical considerations
to strategies used by agricultural cooperatives in grappling with the new
biotechnologies. The project will raise issues surrounding the impact of these
technologies and the organizational changes they portend, on ethical and other
values held by cooperative members. The ethical issues will be added to the
agenda at a meeting of cooperative leaders to be sponsored by USDA. For both
projects, the mentors will suggest relevant readings and discuss the issues with
the investigator, who will pose specific questions to them. In addition, the
investigator will audit a graduate seminar in ethics at his home institution and
participate in seminars at the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions
at IIT. Outcomes will include a book on ethics and development, journal articles
on ethical issues for cooperatives, presentations at scientific meetings, and
integration of ethics into the investigator's teaching.
