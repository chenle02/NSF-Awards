The Department of Mathematics at Florida State University will purchase
computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including: Computing in Geometry (M. Seppeli et al.) Numerical Uniformization of
Grothendieck Dessins and Bel@l maps (P. Bowers) Symbolic Computation for Hopf
Algebras (W. Nichols) The Symbolic Computations Group at Florida State
University has been formed to focus on new, nontraditional computational
mathematical projects such as these. The extremely high-speed computers to be
purchased, with their extensive storage capacity and advanced graphical
capabilities, will enable the application of a synergistic mix of geometric,
algebraic, and numeric techniques to effect rapid advances in these new
mathematical directions. Possible areas of application include brain mapping and
the design of efficient hard-disk read-heads.
