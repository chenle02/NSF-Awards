This is a project supported under the "Expedited Awards for Novel Research"
(NSF 87-90). The method of hydrodynamic isolation to protect concrete dams
against earthquakes is studied. A dam is isolated, not from the ground motions,
but from the dynamic water pressure by means of either anchoring gas-filled
balloons in the reservoir, attaching a closed-cell foam material to the upstream
face, or continuously injecting bubbles into the reservoir. Thus, the
significant increase in response of the dam which may occur when the reservoir
is full or nearly full is eliminated. All three schemes will be evaluated for
potential benefit as well as cost. It has been shown that a strong earthquake
represents a severe loading of a large concrete dam with full or nearly full
reservoir, causing extensive cracking with unknown consequences. Isolating a
concrete dam from hydrodynamic effects avoids the increase in dynamic response.
This increase becomes significant as the water level is raised from about the
three-quarter height of the dam to the crest. The study has potential to impact
retrofit of existing dams with seismic deficiencies and the design of new dams.
