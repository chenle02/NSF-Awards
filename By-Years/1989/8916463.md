This project is to study the dynamics of small-scale wind structures in the
marine planetary boundary layer off the west coast of the U.S. The marine
boundary layer will be modelled by a homogeneous rotating reduced-gravity model
to understand the supercritical flow conditions which lead to enhanced upwelling
favorable winds. Additionally, the model will be used to study the effects of
topography in producing coastally trapped wind reversals. The understanding of
these processes should enable better prediction of events in the coastal ocean
as a result of better models of atmospheric forcing.
