The goal of this research is to improve the quality of bulk crystals by study
and modification of the temperature field at the crystal growth front. A
modified Czochralski process which will incorporate a heater immersed in the
melt just below the crystal growth will be studied experimentally to obtain a
flat growth-front profile which is expected to provide bulk crystals with
reduced defects. Primary studies at the PI's facility will be carried out with
NaNO3, and the information learned transferred to the growth of other materials
such as GaAs and InP, in collaboration with AT&T Laboratories.
