This research examines the molecular events that occur when DNA polymerases, the
enzymes responsible for duplicating DNA, encounter damage on DNA. In particular,
the main question of this project is: what do DNA polymerases do when they
encounter DNA strand breaks? The two strands of DNA in all living cells can be
broken as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation or spontaneously through
normal metabolic processes. DNA double-strand breaks are very harmful to a cell.
Some estimates suggest one DNA double-strand break in a human cell is sufficient
to lead to cell death. A DNA polymerase molecule is dependent on an unbroken DNA
template for synthesis of new DNA; it uses the sequence of the template strand
to create a new complementary copy of DNA. Therefore, one would expect the
enzyme to simply stop or fall off when it reaches a DNA double-strand break. But
this project focuses on a surprising observation: occasionally a DNA polymerase
can synthesize DNA past a break in a template strand; it is able to switch
between two broken template strands. The biological implications for DNA double-
strand break repair and rejoining are important. DNA polymerases may play an
important role in rejoining broken DNA templates during their replication of the
genome. This project focuses on quantifying this template-switching activity by
DNA polymerases and on determining the underlying mechanisms involved. Using a
variety of experimental approaches from protein biochemistry to molecular
biology, this research seeks to understand how DNA polymerases recognize broken
template strands, what proteins influence template switching by DNA polymerases,
and how DNA structure affects the efficiency of template switching.
