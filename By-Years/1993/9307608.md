The research entails applying differential geometric techniques to the Feynman
path integral approach to the modern quantum theory of gravity. This also
involves techniques from the topological theory of knots, in particular the
recently developed concept of the Jones polynomial. The scope of this research
would provide a significant contribution to mathematical physics. Participation
by undergraduates in the projects will be encouraged.
