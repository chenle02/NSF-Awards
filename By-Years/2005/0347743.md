The objective of this work is to develop programs that can learn executable
models of behavior as they observe physical social agents, where "executable"
means that the models should run in simulation or on mobile robots; and
"physical social agent" means an animal, robot or person that senses its
environment, acts upon its environment, and normally operates as part of an
interacting multi-agent group. The algorithms developed in this work will
support a applications such as: the ability to observe social insect colonies,
build models of their behavior, then execute and verify the models in
simulation; the ability to observe motorized vehicle activity (e.g., cars on a
highway), build models of their behavior, then use the models to evaluate
highway designs in simulation; and the ability to train mobile robot teams by
providing video examples of team behavior to be emulated. To these ends, the PI
will leverage research in behavioral ecology, computer vision (especially
activity recognition), and behavior-based robot control, having observed that
the representations utilized in each of these areas are strikingly similar. The
PI will investigate how natural, large-scale systems organize themselves and, in
tandem, he will study how artificial robot teams can be programmed to cooperate
effectively; the motivation for pursuing both lines of research at once is that
the PI expects each to inform the other. The results of this project will
advance our understanding of how intelligent, distributed multi-agent systems
can be organized for effective performance.

Broader Impacts: The techniques developed in this work will profoundly influence
research in several disciplines outside computer science, including ethology,
ecology, and animal behavior. The software developed for learning and executing
models of social behavior will be made available over the Internet to members of
the research community. The PI will also develop new computer science courses
whose topics are intertwined with this research, including one on Intelligent
Robotics and Perception, another on Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems, and a third
on Principles of Physical MultiAgent Systems.
