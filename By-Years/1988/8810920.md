A micromechanic approach will be used to study the fiber-matrix interfacial
effects, such as friction, debonding and microcracking on the stress
distribution and thermo-mechanical properties of composite materials. This study
will contribute to the understanding of the fiber-matrix load tranfer mechanism
which in turn affects the stiffness, strength and mode of failure of a
composite. The results can be used for designing an optimal composite to suit
its end use.
