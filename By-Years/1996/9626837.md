The focus of this research is to achieve direct alkynylation and olefination of
secondary and tertiary C-H bonds via the use of alkynyl and vinyl triflones. The
research will attempt to define the mechanism of the reaction, to develop
enthalpy-matched reagents for regiospecific alkynylation of complex substrates,
to define appropriate protecting groups to enable selective alkynylation of
unactivated tertiary C-H bonds in the presence of typically more reactive
functional groups, to examine the reactions of functionalized alkynyl triflones,
to use optically active acetals for the enantiospecific synthesis of acetylenic
1,3- and 1,2-diols, to seek seek alternate reagents for low temperature
initiation of the alkynylation reaction, to use the reaction to induce radical
cyclizations and fragmentations and to broaden the scope of the reaction to
include radical-mediated olefination, dienylation, allenylation and allylation.
With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Philip L. Fuchs of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. Professor
Fuchs will focus his work on developing methodology by which to transform C-H
bonds into C-C bonds. Such methodology, relying on reagents known as triflones,
would provide synthetic chemists with a powerful tool with which to modify
organic molecules.
