This 3-year project from the Educational Service Center, Region 16, Belleville,
IL, plans to enhance elementary science teaching for the region by combining
efforts of teachers, administrators, and parents in 15 elementary schools with
the resources of a local institution of higher learning and the technical
assistance of the Educational Service Center. Project activities will span 3
years with 5 weeks of course work for leaders each summer and extensive
implementation and follow up activities during the school year. The LITES (lead
teachers) will be trained in the use of several validated activity-based science
curricula, will select course options to improve their science knowledge, and
will learn leadership skills to assist other teachers in implementing activity-
based science. School teams will be comprised of an administrator, primary, and
intermediate teacher. Schools with significant populations of minority students
will be given priority. This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher
enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science knowledge and
teaching, and develop leadership skills of teams of teachers from participating
schools, and because it targets teachers of a needy population. Non-NSF cost-
sharing is approximately 39% of the amount requested from NSF.
