Individuals and organizations routinely trust third party providers to hold
sensitive data, putting it at risk of exposure. While the data could be
encrypted under a key that is kept secret from the provider, it rarely is, due
to the inconvenience and increased cost of managing the cryptography. This
project will develop technologies for working with encrypted data efficiently
and conveniently. In particular, it will enable searching on encrypted data,
which is prevented by currently deployed encryption, and running arbitrary
programs efficiently on encrypted data. The broader impact of this work will
include new, practical techniques for searchable encryption and other
outsourcing technologies, and foundational results for both primitives to deepen
understanding of their potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop
new techniques for searchable encryption to support more flexible and usable
searching, to improve efficiency, and to enhance security by leaking less
information to a malicious service provider. In particular, it will unify the
line of cryptography research on encrypted searching with well-developed
information retrieval techniques. The proposed work will investigate
constructions and foundations of oblivious RAM. It will develop fundamental new
lower bounds to map the landscape of possibilities for oblivious RAM, and design
and analyze new constructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see
