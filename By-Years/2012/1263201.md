This award supports the renewal of the physics Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California - Davis. Each year,
the REU program will provide eight to eleven students from around the United
States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU
students work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project in
the areas of condensed matter physics, biophysics, complex systems, nuclear
physics, high energy physics, and astrophysics. In addition to their specific
research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty,
graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-
related work in diverse settings. At the end of the program, each participant
gives a formal research presentation and presents a written project report that
can lead to a peer reviewed publication. Research work is augmented by an array
of educational and social activities. These activities allow students to put
their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of
professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific
environment.
