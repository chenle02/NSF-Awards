Stable inheritance of genetic information across generations depends on egg and
sperm cells acquiring intact chromosomes from parent cells through meiosis.
Sorting parent chromosomes into gametes involves programmed formation of double
strand DNA breaks (DSB), which is done in the context of structures such as
RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) that can disrupt processing of the DNA if left
unresolved. This project will characterize R-loops and how their presence
affects the outcomes of DSB repair during meiosis. The project also aims to
improve science literacy by exposing elementary school students of diverse
backgrounds to genetics concepts using play and creative exploration. For this
purpose, scientists at various career stages will partner with public elementary
schools to offer children summer science experiences, including hands-on
research. In addition, the project will provide research training opportunities
for undergraduates and graduate students in the field of genetics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research is focused on processes that perturb genetic stability
during gametogenesis. Atypical RNA:DNA hybrid structures are normally formed
during meiosis, and chromosomal instability ensues when these structures fail to
disassemble. The first aim is to identify mechanisms by which accumulation of
these R-loops affects repair of programmed DSBs. The second aim is to examine
how R-loops affect crossover formation during recombination. The studies will be
performed in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and will employ a
combination of cell biology, genetic, and genomic approaches. The outcomes of
the research will provide crucial insights into cellular processes that regulate
genomic stability and, therefore, the integrity of egg and sperm
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
