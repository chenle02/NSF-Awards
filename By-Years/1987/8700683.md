Language acquisition and retention among the Mississippi Band of Choctaw
Indians will be examined, and Mississippi State University and Choctaw students
will be introduced to this area of linguistics through a) on-campus classes,
seminars, and guest lectures, and b) an off-campus, on-reservation field school.
The research will provide a comparative base for the study of language shift
employing data from Dr. Patricia Kwachka's recent work in Alaskan Native
communities. Research in this area is practically nonexistent and offers major
theoretical insights to processes of human stability and change. Dr. Kwachka's
residence at Mississippi State University will make available instruction and
consultation in a scholarly area outside the capacity of their ordinary
resources. Through a lower division course, "The Cultural Contexts of Language
Learning," and through numerous guest lectures in introductory courses, she will
reach women and other minorities before they disassociate themselves from higher
education. Most importantly, the active participation of both the Choctaw tribe
and Mississippi State University in this project offers a unique opportunity for
theoretically significant, locally relevant, cooperative research and
instruction. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to
provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in
the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
