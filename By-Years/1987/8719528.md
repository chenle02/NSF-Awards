The petrogenesis of two classes of igneous meteorites, shergottites and
ureilites, will be studied by making in-situ measurements of microdistributions
of rare earth and possibly other trace elements in various mineral phases. The
concentration and spatial distribution of REE will also be determined in
crystals of olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase grown from melts doped with
concentrations of REE ranging from ppm to percent levels. The objective of this
work is to determine the concentration limits of Henry's Law behavior and the
applicability of distribution coefficients measured at high concentration levels
to the low levels characteristic of natural samples. A modified Cameca IMS-3f
ion microprobe will be the primary experimental tool, complemented at high
concentration levels by electron probe measurements. The carriers of various
isotopic anomalies will be located in different acid residue samples from
primitive meteorites. The carriers will be identified by a combination of
microanalytic techniques that include analytical electron microscopy, laser
Raman, and others. Work will continue on the improvement of ion probe techniques
including quantitative ion imaging, improved ion extraction optics, and
development of a wider base of calibrated mineral standards. Although the work
focuses on meteorites, it is anticipated that the results will also have
important implications for studies of terrestrial samples.
