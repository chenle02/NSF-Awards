Barrington's nucleus is a collection of cells in the brainstem that projects to
spinal cord neurons innervating the bladder. Based on lesion and stimulation
studies, this nucleus has long been thought to be involved in the micturition
reflex. Recently, Dr. Valentino noted that this nucleus contains one of the most
dense clusters of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-immunoreactive neurons in
the brain. Since CRF is the primary brain hormone that initiates the stress
response and that stress increases the synthesis of CRF in these neurons, she
has proposed that Barrington's nucleus is involved in the regulation of
autonomic function under stressful conditions. Dr. Valentino will systematically
study this major CRF-containing brain nucleus and its possible role in stress.
She will employ state-of-the-art anatomical methods to map the afferent and
efferent connections of CRF-containing neurons of Barrington's nucleus in the
brain. These studies will identify the neural circuitry by which stressors are
able to communicate activity to this nucleus. In addition, Dr. Valentino along
with her collaborator, Dr. Aston-Jones, will use electrophysiologic criteria to
determine how different kinds of stressors alter activity of these CRF-
containing neurons in this region. The results will not only provide new
information about the function of Barrington's nucleus but may lead to a better
understanding about how the brain integrates the multicomponent response to a
stressor.
