This award provides partial support for the Seventh International Conference on
Aerogels, a triennial multidisciplinary meeting focusing on the fundamental and
technological aspects of these unique nanosystems. The aerogel field spans the
chemical, physical, biological, engineering, and materials sciences and the
scope of this symposium ranges from traditional interests in broadening the
synthetic and processing strategies for fabrication of aerogels to increased
emphasis on applications of aerogel nanoarchitectures, including creating
improved performance in energy storage and conversion devices, sensors, and
remediation materials. This four-day meeting will bring together the leading
American and international scientists in this area in a setting populated by a
diverse group of younger and more established investigators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this symposium and of NSF support of it
include the significant presence of women among the plenary speakers, reduced
registration costs for students, significant interaction of young US scientists
with international leaders in the field, and an aerogel sculpture display that
enhances public appreciation of nanoscale science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
