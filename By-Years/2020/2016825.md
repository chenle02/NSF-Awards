Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) requests funds for oceanographic
instrumentation that is needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research.
Working within the collaborative framework of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the proposed instrumentation will be
maintained by the SIO ship operations department for use by NSF-supported
scientists from institutions nationwide who require these seagoing facilities.
Instrumentation is requested for RV Sally Ride, a 238-foot, Navy-owned vessel
built in 2014. The vessel completed 282 funded days in 2019, only 13 of which
were for NSF. In 2020, the ship is scheduled for 254 days with 102 of them in
support of NSF-funded science. With this proposal, SIO provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Virtual Desktop Infrastructure R/V
Sally Ride $178,129&lt;br/&gt;2) CTD Rosette and CTD Cart System R/V Sally Ride
$90,487&lt;br/&gt;3) Acoustic Release System R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Sally
Ride $46,730&lt;br/&gt; $315,346&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
