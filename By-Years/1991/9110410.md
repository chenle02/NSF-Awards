The scientific goal of this project is to develop and test new applications of
visual anthropology in cooperation with Native peoples of Siberia and Alaska. An
integral part of the project is a training workshop in ethnographic methods and
video documentation; this will provide a mechanism for Alaskan and Siberian
Natives to document their own cultures. The Siberian part of the project is
planned in collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Anthropology of
the USSR Academy of Sciences. The ethnographic part of the project will focus on
community studies, which have rarely been carried out in the USSR, and multi-
ethnic perceptions. This project will greatly facilitate the recording of
traditional knowledge in the Arctic and represents an advancement of the method
and theory of modern anthropology.
