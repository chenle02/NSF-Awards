This research focuses on the free radical oxidation of organic compounds.
Isotopically-labelled hydroperoxides will be used to detail the mechanism of the
radical oxidations of biologically relevant media such as micelles, lipid
bilayers and lipoproteins. Chiral metal complexes capable of acting as Lewis
acids will be bound to appropriately functionalized alkenes and used in a novel
manner to impose enantioselectivity on the radical reactions. Lastly, new free
radical copolymerization procedures will be examined as a route to
stoichiometrically well-defined alternating copolymers. Graduate and
postdoctoral students will be introduced to the synthesis and characterization
of isotopically-labelled compounds, and the use of these and other specifically
designed reagents as mechanistic probes of the reactions. With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research and
educational activities of Dr. Ned Porter of Duke University. Professor Porter
will focus his research on garnering fundamental information on free-radical
oxidations. Although known for some time, recognition of the role of organic
free radicals in different biochemical processes, as well as their increasing
applications in organic and material syntheses creates the need to elucidate the
chemistry of these reactive intermediates. This research utilizes unique
isotopically-labelled molecules to probe the mechanisms of free radical
oxidations of organic substrates, and novel organometallic adducts to examine an
innovative approach to imposing stereochemical control on the reactions.
Professor Porter's educational activities involve the training of graduate and
postdoctoral students. uÂ¬
