Recently it has been shown in the laboratory that various organic contaminants
can be mineralized in the aqueous phase using dioxygen over noble metal
catalysts at temperatures between 120o - 160√ù C. The work to date has been an
outgrowth of regenerative life support research funded in support of manned
space exploration. Contaminants studied have been those typical of contaminated
water streams aboard spacecraft such as hygiene waters, humidity condensates,
and urine distillates. The organic compounds occurring in highest quantity in
these contaminated waters are low molecular weight alcohols, carboxylic acids,
and urea. The experimental results have indicated deep oxidation of mixed
contaminant streams containing dissolved organic compounds at concentrations
between 10 - 50 mg/L in a single pass through a plug flow reactor. Studies
comparing this technique with other methods of organic contaminant reduction
such as photocatalysis, UV oxidation, and photoelectric oxidation have shown
heterogeneous catalysis to be vastly more effective in terms of reactor size and
residence time requirements. The extension of this technique to organic
contaminants which commonly pollute ground and surface waters is proposed.
Following demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, the Phase II program will
study a wider range of contaminants, evaluate alternative oxidants such as
hydrogen peroxide and ozone, work toward maximization of catalyst activity,
investigate minimization of vulnerability to catalyst deactivation, and optimize
reactor design and operational factors.
