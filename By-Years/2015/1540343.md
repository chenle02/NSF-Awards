The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United
States to attend the CPSWeek 2015 collection of conferences, which are to be
held April 13-17, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. CPSWeek is an annual
international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major
multi-day conferences, multiple one-day workshops and tutorials. It moves from
country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students
with a unique opportunity to listen to and learn from the keynote speeches,
presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical
systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPS research is expected to have positive societal
impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture,
water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems.
These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond
to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to
cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and
hardware, materials science and sensor design, software engineering, networking,
and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where
collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important.
CPSWeek brings together the U.S. and international CPS research community. For
these reasons, strong participation in this event, especially among students
(our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing
CPS research in the U.S. In particular, this project supports students from
groups and institutions that are underrepresented in the CPS research community.
