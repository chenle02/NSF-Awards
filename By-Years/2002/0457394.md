This grant supports the development of new integrated models and algorithms for
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning. IMRT is
considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer.
Current approaches decompose the treatment planning problem into several stages
and the corresponding subproblems are solved sequentially. Although this may
lead to inferior treatment plans, the lack of suitable model formulations that
allow for efficient solution methods has so far prevented the integration of the
subproblems. In particular, the subproblem that has received the most attention
is the central problem of determining an intensity profile or fluence map for
each of the beams used in irradiating a cancer patient. However, issues
pertaining to treatment-delivery efficiency and quality are known to have a
significant impact on IMRT treatments. Models that fully take into account both
potential and limitations of the treatment equipment as well as changes in the
patient anatomy over the course of the treatment will be developed along with
algorithms to solve the resulting integrated problems. All of the developed
models and algorithms will be tested on actual clinical patient data.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of patients receive cancer treatment by
radiation therapy. This project will provide highly effective and robust
integrated models for IMRT treatment-planning problems that integrate clinical
considerations that are currently not yet addressed satisfactorily. The
development of efficient approaches to solve the resulting integrated
optimization problems in realistic computational times will provide real-time
decision support to physicians and clinicians and will help them to find
treatment plans that do not require a choice between a good chance for a cure or
control of disease and the potential quality of life.
