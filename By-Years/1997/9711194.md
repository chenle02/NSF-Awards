Stinchcombe and Lounsbury This project will investigate the rise of mutual funds
from 1944-1990. The main contention is that economic and political explanations
of this phenomenon are inadequate. A more complete explanation addresses how
mutual funds became popularly viewed as a natural investment vehicle and how
corporations came to be summarized by their stock prices, which made possible
the rise of stock issuances and valuations. Multiple methods will be used,
including archival work, content analysis, and interviews. The research will
contribute to renewed interest in the social dimensions of economic activity.
