9402386 McMechan This research is to develop field experiment designs, data
acquisition strategies and software for quantitative analysis and interpretation
of ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. There is an increasing emphasis on
shallow, high-resolution geophysical techniques for a wide variety of
applications, including environmental investigations. In the past, GPR images
were generally interpreted with only rudimentary processing because nothing else
was available. With the advent of high quality digitally recording GPR systems,
new doors have been opened allowing extensive, quantitative data imaging and
inversion techniques to be applied to GPR data. This work will take advantage of
extensive 3-D seismic inversion development for this new application. ***
