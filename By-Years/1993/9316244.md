9316244 Honzatko The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of
the synthetase from E. coli reveals a folding topology of the polypeptide chain
heretofore unobserved in any other protein structure. yet, the synthetase has
residues which correspond to the GTP-binding residues of the p21ras protein.
Given the high level of sequence similarity between synthetases from bacteria to
mammals, the structure of the E. coli enzyme should provide a reasonable basis
for understanding structure-function relationships of synthetases from a wide
variety of species. Four different crystal forms of adenylosuccinate synthetase
from E. coli are under investigation. Each of the crystal forms diffracts to a
resolution of at least 2.8A. The four crystal forms will be used in the study of
ligand-enzyme complexes by the method of X-ray diffraction. The X-ray
diffraction studies will probe the conformational response of the synthetase to
each substrate or substrate analogue individually and in combination. In
addition to the diffraction studies, a series of directed mutations will be
performed on the enzyme, in order to confirm the significance of specific
residues in catalysis, substrate binding, and/or the structural integrity of the
enzyme. The structure of a limited number of mutant synthetases will be
determined, in order to better understand how structural changes give rise to
the altered properties of the mutants. Each of the structures above will be
refined, using HPCC facilities and state-of-the-art software. %%% The proposed
investigations will reveal the structural basis for mechanisms of catalysis and
inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Esherichia coli Adenylosuccinate
synthetase governs the first committed step in the de novo synthesis of adenine
nucleotides, converting the substrates Mg2+-GDP, and phosphate. Adenine
nucleotides support many biochemical functions, perhaps the most important of
which is the synthesis of proteins, RNA and DNA. ***
