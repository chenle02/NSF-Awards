Abstract for NSF Proposal DMS-0306294, "Singularity Behavior in Some Geometric
Variational Problems", Robert Hardt, P.I.

This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus, treating the
behavior of singularities and energy concentration for various optimal or
stationary functions, fields, or geometric structures subject to geometric or
analytical constraints. Specified investigations focus on the relation between
energy and topological obstruction in mappings between manifolds, liquid crystal
materials, improper slicing of polynomial varieties, transport problems, and the
regularity of relaxed energy minimizers. In various higher dimensional cases,
energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings may occur along sets of
infinite measure and is related to homotopically nontrivial mappings of spaces.
This concentration behavior corresponding to any rational homotopy invariant of
the target mapping can now be described. Singularities in liquid crystal
materials will be also studied in several contexts. The theories of improper
intersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry will be
investigated to understand related behavior in analysis and partial differential
equations. Combined transport systems such as occurs in postal routes, the
circulatory system, and plant root systems can be described variationally with
recently discovered geometric structures.

Underlying many physical phenomena is a least energy principle whereby certain
configurations or fields or geometric shape are distinguished by their property
of having less energy or area than competing objects. The external constraints
often lead to singularities, which are characterized by rapid changes of
structure occurring in very small spatial regions. For example, one observes
dislocation faults in solids under stress, domain walls in magnetized materials,
liquid edges and corners in soap films, and point, curve, and surface defects in
various liquid crystal materials. We deal with new mathematical structures and
theories necessary to explain and predict such phenomena. In these problems, the
theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the numerical computational studies of
applied mathematics, and the phenomenological studies from observation and
experiment all benefit each other and all have a crucial scientific role. The
present proposed research has many problems motivated by and applicable to
science and engineering. The new geometric variational tools are not presently
well-known in the broader scientific community, and communication of these
mathematical topics and techniques will be very useful.
