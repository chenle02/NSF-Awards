Lyberg, Lars SBR-9412727 This award provides partial support for an
International Conference on Survey Measurement and Process Quality, scheduled
for April 1995, in Bristol, United Kingdom. The conference is the fifth in a
series of conferences on survey methods organized by the Survey Research Methods
(SRM) Section of the American Statistical Association (ASA). A major objective
of the conference is to promote a shift of research interest from post-survey
quality evaluation and correction to quality control of ongoing survey
processes, like questionnaire development, interviewing, data capture, editing
and coding. Another important objective is to encourage international
interdisciplinary and cross cultural research and exploit the great interest in
these issues now emerging outside North America. An edited monograph of select
conference papers is planned. The monograph will widely disseminate research
results on survey measurement and process quality to the international survey
community.
