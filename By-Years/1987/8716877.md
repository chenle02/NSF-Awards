A share memory multiprocessorr will be provided for researchers at the
University of Illinois for research in the Department of Computer Science. The
equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer
and Information Science and Engineering program. The equipment will be used for
several research projects, including in particular: 1. An operating system
called Choices for parallel machines 2. Experiments in Parallel Computation for
Differential Equations 3. Object-Oriented Computer Graphics 4. Mentat, An
Object-Oriented, Macro Data Flow System 5. Parallel Discrete Event Simulation: A
Shared Memory Approach
