Doctoral Dissertation Research: Stakeholder Involvement, Collective Decision
Making and Institutional Change Public participation in decision making
pertaining to environmental problems has been proposed as a means of improving
the policy making process and its outcomes. Stakeholders can, however, be
involved in the decision making process in a variety of ways and little is known
about how different forms of involvement shape policy development and outcomes.
In this doctoral dissertation proposal, the researcher plans to evaluate the
influence of different configurations of stakeholder involvement on collective
decision making regarding the use of a common pool resource. Case studies of
recent decisions regarding interstate river basins will be employed for this
purpose.
