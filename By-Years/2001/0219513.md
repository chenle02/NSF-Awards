There are many different sources from which relevant information can
be&lt;br/&gt;obtained for an intelligence task at hand, such as an analysis of
operations&lt;br/&gt;planning by Al Qaeda. The accuracy of this information is
frequently&lt;br/&gt;imperfect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information obtained from
each source is frequently also different in&lt;br/&gt;structure and scope. XML
has emerged today as the standard for information exchange.
Its&lt;br/&gt;flexibility permits the representation of information from
heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;sources in a single unified
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to manage uncertain
(probabilistic) data,&lt;br/&gt;represented in XML. While there have been
previous efforts to develop&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic relational systems, the need
for representing and querying&lt;br/&gt;uncertain information is much greater
for loosely structured data not &lt;br/&gt;readily amenable to a relational
representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XML data poses several modeling challenges
that are the focus of this&lt;br/&gt;project: due to the data having (an
inclusion hierarchy) structure,&lt;br/&gt;probabilities cannot be assigned
independently; due to XML elements occurring&lt;br/&gt;at multiple
granularities, probabilities may be assigned at multiple levels;&lt;br/&gt;due
to the possibility of missing and repeated sub-elements, one may not
be&lt;br/&gt;able to obtain complete distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
