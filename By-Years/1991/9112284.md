This Research Equipment Grant (REG) provides funding for the purchase of a
Laser-induced Fluorescence (LIF) thermal imaging system. The Department of
Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University will dedicate this system
to support general thermoscience research. Near term research topics in which
the proposed system will be utilized include cooling of turbine components,
space shuttle propulsion, thermal control of computer disk data storage systems,
air pollution, electronic material processing, and fundamental turbulence
transport.
