This research is concerned with mesoscopic phenomena in gallium arsenide and
metal microstructures, primarily related to conductance fluctuations, tunneling,
and phase coherence. One- dimensional wires will be fabricated using electron-
beam lithograpy techniques followed by ion-beam irradiation that produces a
relatively sharp boundary between insulating and metallic regions. These one-
dimensional wires will be used to study quantum chaotic scattering, a new and
active field of physics. One-dimensional wires of beta-tantalum will also be
made to provide a cleaner system for the study of universal conductance
fluctuations. In a third area a Wheatstone Bridge will be constructed of four
gallium arsenide arms that will be utilized to detect single photons. A DX
center in the gallium arsenide will absorb a single photon leading to a
conductance fluctuation "step". This is a novel optical processing approach that
leads to a discrete known change in the configuration of scattering centers.
