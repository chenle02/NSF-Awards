Rabaey High Level Synthesis has undergone remarkable progress in recent years. A
number of powerful synthesis environments have been proposed in the area of real
time signal processing, both in Europe and the United States. Unfortunately,
most of the existing tools span only restricted application domains or very
specific architectural styles. To be successful at an industrial level, a
unification of the synthesis approaches is clearly essential. The goal of this
research is to boost the field of high-level synthesis for digital signal
processing by bringing together researchers from the IMEC Research Center at
Leuven, Belgium and the University of California at Berkeley. The objectives are
to exchange synthesis techniques and tools in an attempt to come to a unified
framework, addressing the global architectural domain. At the same time, this
cooperation will result in the training of researchers with a wider vision and
scope of expertise in the field of high level synthesis.
