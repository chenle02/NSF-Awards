The plasma-assisted laser deposition (PLD) technique has produced high critical
temperature and current films of high Tc superconducting materials at 400C. This
is the lowest process temperature ever reported for these materials for any in
situ method. The PI will investigate the oxygen stoichiometry and its
relationship to the substrate temperature and the "effective" oxygen energy flux
from plasma to film during growth process. This will be followed by a careful
study of the film/substrate interaction, including the effects of diffusion
barrier layers. The effects of crystalline grain size, mechanical stress, and
metallic-coating encapsulation on the critical current will be investigated.
