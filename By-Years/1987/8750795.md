Equipment needed to establish two continuous sampling and monitoring stations;
one for air, the other for water surveillance, has been recently acquired by the
Chemistry Department at Humacao University College. The availability of these
two systems has significantly enhanced the Environmental Chemistry laboratory
experiences of students enrolled in both the Associate Degree program in
Chemical Technology and the Baccalaureate Degree in Industrial Chemistry
curriculum. The air station continuously monitors basic air quality parameters
such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, organics, heavy metals, and
particulates. The water station continuously monitors basic water quality
parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, organics, and heavy
metals.
