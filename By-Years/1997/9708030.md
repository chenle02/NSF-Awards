This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
with instrumentation funding from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
supports research in the laboratory of Professor John Caradonna at Yale
University. The research involves a semisynthetic design approach to probe the
protein effects on the reduction potential and electron transfer activity of the
Fe/S cube in iron-sulfur proteins and the iron site in iron-containing
superoxide dismutase (SOD). Selectively mutated proteins have already been
designed by computer methods and constructed by biological techniques. The SOD
protein exhibits catalytic activity. The proteins will now be characterized by
an array of physical methods to systematically determine the effects of hydrogen
bonding, localized charges and dipoles on the electron transfer activities of
the metal centers in the proteins. This research utilizes a new achievement in
the study of metal centers in proteins by incorporating iron sites into host
proteins. The objective is to construct functional metalloprotein active sites
inside host proteins of known structure. This allows a high degree of control of
the environment of the metal center, which provdes for systematically studying
the effects of the protein on the metal site's activity.
