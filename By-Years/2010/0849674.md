This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially
targeted for support. There is a national need for professionals who have
expertise in aerospace engineering and this project is aimed at meeting this
need by graduating students from a nationally recognized aviation university in
two degree programs: electrical and computer engineering. Project personnel are
partnering with the Math-Science Regional Center to recruit student scholars
from participants in an Upward Bound program aimed at underprivileged high
school students in the southwest region. Student participants are also being
recruited directly from mathematics and science high schools in the region. The
students are being mentored by faculty and have access to specialized services
such as tutoring and advising. The project is based on the concept of
collaborative learning and a student study area is being utilized to facilitate
teamwork and cooperation.
