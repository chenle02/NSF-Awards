This infrastructure award is for the acquisition of equipment to support
research in distributed and parallel computing. The equipment consists of a
network of workstations to support distributed processing research and an
upgrade to an existing SIMD computer. The research supported includes the
evaluation of parallel random access algorithms, numerical algorithms for
modeling the flow of particles through a host medium, sequence planning for
manufacturing, fault tolerance and load balancing in distributed networks,
dynamic hard real time applications in a distributed environment, designing
distributed real time intelligent systems, and the development of a wide area
distributed robotics network. The future increases in raw computational power
will come from the utilization of many processors to work on computational
problems. There are many research problems associated with the effective
utilization of many processors. These range from how the processors should
communicate to the development of new algorithms to take advantage of multiple
processors. Texas A&amp;M University is building up a parallel computer
laboratory and a distributed computer laboratory to perform experimental
research on these issues.
