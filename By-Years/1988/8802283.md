Developing large programs for parallel, distributed computer systems is at least
as difficult as developing software for more traditional sequential systems. The
added difficulty is in the innovation required to exploit the multiplicity of
processors. Considerable effort has been expended to build operating and
networks so that they are conducive to distributed programming, and new
programming languages have been built to increase the expressive computation so
that it takes advantage of the structure of the support system. Program
designers do not have adequate tools to assist them in creating and evaluating
parallel, distributed computations. They also lack convenient ways to describe,
model and visualize these computations. The goal of the research is to study
mechanism that support the orderly exploration of parallel program structures,
and which provide varying amounts of feedback evaluation during that design
process.
