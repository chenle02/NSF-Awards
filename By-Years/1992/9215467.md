The goal of this research is to develop an approach and the necessary
methodologies and tools to allow circuit card assembly manufacturers to
determine the optimal strategy for circuit card assembly, and to rapidly
generate optimal or near-optimal plans. The objective is to maximize total
production rate over a desired product mix. The constraints are the equipment
capabilities, including material handling, the products' bills of materials,
component, technologies, and the production plan (quantities and lot sizes
required) for some planning horizon. The research challenge is to find enough
that is generic about each problem so that a useful generic solution method can
be derived. Two types of results are anticipated from the research. First,
models and algorithms will be developed for the process optimization for a range
of assembly equipment types. These algorithms will be demonstrated using case
study data from actual circuit card assembly operations. Ultimately, these
algorithms should provide the basis for automated or semi-automated process
planning tools. Such tools would enable process planners to create higher
quality process plans, with much shorter lead times than is currently possible.
The potential benefit to manufacturing is faster response to changing
requirements and continuous improvement of the assembly process. Second, given a
particular setup management strategy, models and algorithms will be developed
for optimizing the assignment of components among assembly equipment and the
grouping and sequencing of card types within the assembly system material flow.
In addition, the research will explore methods for comparing alternative setup
management strategies and for selecting the best strategy for a given situation.
