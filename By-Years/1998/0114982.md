The objective of this research is to improve the capability of controlling the
gas tungsten arc welding process for precise joining by emulating skilled
operators using intelligent automatic welding machines in order to produce
quality welds consistently. To this end, a novel sensing and control system will
be developed to measure and control the three-dimensional surface of the weld
pool. A new technique will be used to modify the traditional gas tungsten arc
welding process for better arc concentration and directionality. A numerical
model will be developed to analyze the behaviors of the modified process under
the varying welding parameters in order to simulate the performance of the
developed control technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of work addresses
basic physics, dynamic modeling, and robust control issues. The research team
will closely collaborate with industrial partners and governmental scientists on
both the basic research and applied issues. The investigator includes a plan to
educate graduate students in both the fundamental science integration and
potential for industrial applications. The investigator also plans to accept
undergraduate and talented high school students, including those from under-
represented groups, to work on carefully defined topics during the research. In
addition to the social impact, the impact on industry should also be significant
and several industrial partners are committed to case study support and
equipment/engineering support for the future development of this novel
technology at production level. &lt;br/&gt;
