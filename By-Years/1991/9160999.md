One of the major limiting factors in the development of X-ray lithography is the
lack of an optimum mask material. The combined requirements of X-ray a nd
optical transparency, toughness, high yield strength and sufficient internal
stress to maintain flatness, limit the list of candidate materials for
membranes. Of the various materials studied over the past several years diamond
is an extremely good candidate for an X-ray membrane. The X-ray mask structure
requires the formation of an extremely adherent, high atomic number absorber on
the membrane. At the same time the absorber layer should not develop internal
stresses during deposition as this will lead to pattern distortions following
subsequent etching and processing steps. Metallic diamondlike nanocomposites can
be synthesized virtually stress-free and exhibit extremely good adhesion to
virtually any substrate. The phase I proposal seeks to optimize the synthesis of
X-ray mask structures consisting of a diamond membrane and a W-diamondlike
nanocomposite absorber.
