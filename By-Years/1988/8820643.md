This proposal requests support fo continuation of a previous NSF funding in
order to study the application of theoretical quantum chemical calculations on
important processes in aeronomy. Specific attention will be placed on the
dissociative recombination of N2+ and NO+ as well as on quenching of O+ and N
from specific energetic states on interest in aeronomy.
