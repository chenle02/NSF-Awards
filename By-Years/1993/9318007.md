9318007 Kim Although it has been known since the 1920's that retinol, a form of
vitamin A, is absolutely essential for sperm production, it is still unknown as
to why retinol is required. Clearly, retinol is a signaling molecule that uses
protein mediators to control the expression of genes critical for sperm
production. In this proposal, two important protein mediators that work
together, kinases and phosphatases which modulate the activity of proteins that
control the retinol-regulated gene expression, will be investigated using the
testis. The information gained will be useful to formulate strategies to either
increase or decrease male reproductive efficiency. ***
