9317078 Gregory The history of Andean uplift is of great interest to both
climatic and tectonic studies. The Andes form the only major barrier to zonal
atmospheric circulation in the southern hemisphere and they extend throughout
the tropics, a sensitive zone where small changes in climate impact on a global
scale. In terms of tectonics, the Andes are one of the few modern examples of an
ocean-continent subduction zone with associated crustal deformation. As of now,
the development of Andean elevation is poorly constrained. The objective of this
study is to estimate the paleoclimate and paleoelevation of late Tertiary floras
from the Bolivian Altiplano using a new leaf physiognomy-based method. An
existing multiple regression model explains 93.3% of the variance in mean annual
temperature (MAT) using leaf physiognomy of modern vegetation. This model will
be updated by adding sites from modern tropical forests. A new MAT-leaf
physiognomy relationship will be derived and will be used to estimate the
paleoMAT of the samples from the Bolivian sites. When combined with coeval sea
level temperature and terrestrial lapse rate, the paleoMAT data from the
Altiplano can be used to estimate paleoelevation. These estimates of
paleoclimate and paleoelevation will address the following climatically and
tectonically important questions: 1) As the only barrier to circulation in the
southern hemisphere, how did uplift of the Andes impact global circulation,
especially in terms of the production of water vapor? Could Andean uplift have
been partly responsible for late Tertiary global cooling? 2) Did the uplift of
the Andes predate or postdate the desiccation of the Altiplano? Was this
desiccation a function of the elevation of the Andes, or of global climate
changes? 3) How do botanically derived estimates of Oligocene-Miocene tropical
paleoclimate compare with those from general circulation model (GCM) climate
reconstructions? 4) Was uplift of the Bolivian Altipla no coincident with
crustal shortening or did elevation develop in the late Miocene-Pliocene?
