9320353 Topka The purpose of this research project is to discover more about the
contribution that small magnetic elements on the surface of the Sun make to
solar luminosity variations. The basic data are high resolution digital images
of the solar photosphere coupled with simultaneous and registered digital
magnetograms. These are obtained with the ultra-narrowband tunable filter
imaging system which has been developed for the Solar Optical Universal
Polarimeter, the Coordinated Instrument Package for the Orbiting Solar
Laboratory, and by Lockheed Independent Research Funds. Preliminary research has
been performed; large amounts of data analysis and display software are in
place.
