This Americas Program award will support Prof. Joseph Chappell of the
University of Kentucky in a research collaboration with Prof. Edmundo Lozoya of
the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV),
Irapuato, and Prof. Victor M. Loyola of the Scientific Research Center in
Yucatan. The researchers intend to study the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and
its regulation. Isoprenoids are ubiquitous in nature, essential for life, and
mediate a number of interactions between organisms and their environment. In
addition, plants are a rich source for pharmaceutically important isoprenoids.
Recent results suggest that compartmentation of the biosynthetic machinery plays
an important role in regulating what type of isoprenoids are actually made.
Through novel experiments the researchers intend to test the hypothesis that
discrete metabolic units are dedicated to specific metabolic products. Results
from these studies will help to elucidate the mechanisms regulating isoprenoid
metabolism in plants, and will have important ramifications for future
manipulations of this pathway using genetic engineering technology.
