This is a continued study of methods for enhancing the cooling of small high
intensity UV lamps. The lamps are presently used for a variety of industrial
applications: lower power density light sources for drying industrial inks,
coatings and adhesives on papers, metals, plastic, and glasses; and higher power
density sources in the manufacture of semiconductor device and in imaging
applications. Phase I research made promising improvements on the efficiency of
jet impingement cooling and created a better understanding of the mechanisms
involved. Phase II research will optimize the improvements and apply the results
to actual lamp systems suitable imaging and semiconductor applications. In
addition, more advanced mechanisms of cooling will be investigated, such as
closed cycle helium cooling and evaporative cooling techniques. Improvement of
the cooling techniques for the lamps will allow the design and construction of
UV light sources with power densities even greater than the current limit of 500
W/cc, and these have new applications, including DUV (deep U.V.) optical
lithography for manufacturing semiconductors, and in the next generation
projection televisions.
