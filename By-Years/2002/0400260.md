This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is
concerned with the construction of highly efficient and statistically valid
procedures for comparing systems in the presence of stochastic constraints on
the system behavior, assuming that both the objective and the constraints are
implicit in a simulation model with few known properties. The goal is to develop
statistically valid comparison procedures for solving such simulation
optimization problems, and to improve the computational efficiency of the
procedures to the point where they can handle up to several thousand
alternatives. This involves the use of better variance estimators, common random
numbers, and tighter boundaries for comparing systems. The focus of the project
will be on optimization problems with discrete decision variables using fully
sequential comparison procedures; this is because decision variables in
industrial problems are likely to be discrete (e.g., choosing the optimal number
of workers and machines) and because sequential procedures have been shown to be
extremely efficient relative to other existing comparison approaches.

If successful, the research will enhance the use of simulation not only as an
assessment tool but also as an optimization tool. Ideally, this project would
lead to the implementation of statistically valid and computationally efficient
comparison procedures in simulation software; this would be achieved through
close collaboration between researchers at Georgia Tech and software vendors
(primarily Imagine That!). The addition of such optimization features to popular
simulation software packages would be highly valuable to practitioners with
respect to identifying process improvements and improved system designs in the
presence of constraints about the system behavior.
