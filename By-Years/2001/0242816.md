The Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) was formed as a
scientific committee under the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
in 1978. It is charged with the long-term responsibility to promote
international interdisciplinary programs, to facilitate cross-project
cooperation, to organize cross-disciplinary conferences, and to enhance multi-
national research collaborations, with the scientific goal of advancing
quantitative understanding of coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer
of mass, momentum and energy throughout the solar-terrestrial system. The
attendant broader impact of these activities is to improve the predictability of
the effects of the variable components of solar energy and interplanetary
disturbances on the terrestrial environment.
