This program of research by the Byer group will directly support the LIGO
project through laser development; studies of thermal effects from high power
operation; frequency doubling using nonlinear crystals. Laser stabilization, and
laser reliability will also be investigated. The work on laser development will
complete the construction and testing of a 13-W diode-laser-pumped Nd:YAG laser.
Studies of thermal effects will include both numerical modeling of these in
interferometers, as well as measurements of scatter, absorption, and stress-
induced birefringence in optical components. Research on frequency doubling will
investigate efficient doubling using materials such as LBO, magnesium oxide-
doped lithium niobate, and periodically poled lithium niobate.
