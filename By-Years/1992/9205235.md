This research involves a large-scale land and ocean bottom seismic array
experiment over the entire North Island of New Zealand and its adjacent regions
as an international cooperative project between Memphis State University of the
United States, ORSTROM of France, DSIR and Victoria University of New Zealand,
and the University of Leeds of the United Kingdom. At least 100, three-component
digital seismic stations will be deployed on land and 12 digital ocean bottom
seismographs wull be deploye dto cover the entire geometry of the Wadati-Benioff
zone beneath New Zealand. The results will refine the tectonic structure of an
active trench and strike-slip fault region and will bear on evaluation of the
seismic hazard of this active area. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
