The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
security by providing the strongest levels of network destination control with
minimum deployment requirements. This project addresses the problem of
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, which have been
used in recent years to silence a variety of organizations, including companies,
governments, and non-profits. The proposed mechanism defends against such DDoS
attacks, and can improve Internet availability for a variety of customers.
Bringing a DDoS-prevention mechanism to market prevents attackers from silencing
and denying service to their targets, enabling increased availability to
deployments of such systems.

This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential for a cloud-based traffic
filtering technology. The technology combines two significant, but distinct,
approaches to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) prevention - commercial
approaches that perform in-cloud filtering to remove the most obvious DDoS
traffic, and academic approaches that perform in-network filtering based on
protocol-specific fairness criteria. The technology explored combines the in-
cloud filtering of existing commercial approaches, together with a mechanism
called "capabilities" in the academic approaches, to create an in-cloud,
destination-driven enforcement of per-flow bandwidth allocations. This
destination-driven approach can enforce a wide variety of destination-specified
policies with a single mechanism, and each destination can choose the traffic
that it wishes to prioritize. As a result, the same mechanism can to be used to
defend against DDoS attacks and to provide priority to certain traffic.
