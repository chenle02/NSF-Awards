EPCC's research projects which will utilize the proposed instrumentation
include: (1) A study of the environmental factors that affect virus survival in
groundwater and surface water and the structural changes associated with viral
inactivation and reactivation. (2) Taxonomic studies of rattlesnakes in the
southwest by comparing chromatographic profiles of snake venoms. (3) Isolation
and characterization of microorganisms indigenous to the intertidal zone and to
the EI Paso, TX area. (4) The use of bacteria and peat moss in the design of
electrodes specific for heavy metals. (5) A study of Giardia Lamblia surface
antigens will require the use of the SMART system and liquid scintillation
system to purify and analyze the radioactively- labeled proteins.
