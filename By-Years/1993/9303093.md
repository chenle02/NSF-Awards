This award, made in the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division, will
provide travel expenses for U.S. participants and subsistence for participants
at the Bilateral U.S./France Workshop on Molecular Routes to Materials to be
held at the University of Texas/Austin, February 21-26, 1993. This Workshop will
provide a forum for the exchange of the most recent information, ideas, and
concepts and for the discussion of common problems in the emerging field of
"molecules to materials". The workshop will also catalyze increasing
collaboration between approximately fifteen U.S. and fifteen French chemists in
this important research area. The format of the workshop will be stimulating and
effective and will provide for in-depth discussion of a broad range of
materials-related topics. The location of the workshop will also permit
interactions between the workshop participants and the University of Texas
Science and Technology Center for the Synthesis, Growth and Analysis of
Electronic Materials. %%% Support of this workshop is wholly consistent with the
infrastructure-building goals among international scientists and with the
Advanced Materials and Processing Program.
