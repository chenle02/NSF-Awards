9408220 Rapaport Nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms studies will be
carried out at IUCF, LAMPF, and at the Ohio University tandem van de Graaff
accelerator. The principal activity will be proton- neutron charge-exchange
reaction studies, the objective of which is to understand the behavior of the
nucleon-nucleon tensor interaction in the nuclear medium. The energy dependence
of the interaction may provide insight into an important issue relating to
nuclear density dependence of the nucleon and rho-meson masses. ***
