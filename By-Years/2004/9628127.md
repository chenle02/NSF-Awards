9628127 Garnero This research involves the use of seismic broad-band digital
data to address fundamental questions about the structure of the deep Earth in
the vicinity of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) region. The work will concentrate
on the highly variable, 150-350 km thick, 2-3% above-average-velocity D" layer
which is just above the CMB. Key features to investigate will be scale lengths
of heterogeneity, scattering properties, preferred orientation of anomalies, and
a possible low velocity layer at the base of the CMB. The results bear on
questions of large-scale mantle circulation, localized convection patterns, heat
flow from the core, thermal boundary layer structure above the CMB, possible
chemical or partial-melt reservoirs, deep Earth plume sources, and deviations in
the Earth's magnetic field. ***
