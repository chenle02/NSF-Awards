&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for proposal EAR0106904 (PH #
45x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: High Resolution Imaging of Seismic Velocity
Discontinuities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anne F. Sheehan, University of
Colorado, Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic estimates of existence and depth
distribution of crust and mantle discontinuities are important for constraining
models of composition, rheology, and temperature in the Earth. This project
includes development, testing, and application of new methods for receiver
function imaging. A Kirchhoff-style migration methodology which utilizes a
point-scattering approach to handle nonplanar and laterally discontinuous
interfaces has been developed. An uncertainty in this analysis is the biasing
effects of three-dimensional discontinuity structure that could falsely project
features into two-dimensional models. The migration inversion will be extended
to three dimensions, and include back-scattered energy. Proper evaluation of the
accuracy and resolution of these P/SV migration methods will require development
of a synthetic seismogram method that can handle 3-D discontinuity topography
and velocity heterogeneity and which will include all converted phases and
surface reflections. A hybrid method will be implemented that will use ray
theory to propagate a P wavefront to a finite difference grid that will span the
region between the discontinuities and the surface. These techniques will be
applied to regional data sets from the southwest Pacific and eastern California.
These efforts are of great utility with appropriate data sets today and will
become increasingly important with data sets that will be generated by the
proposed USArray and similar projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
