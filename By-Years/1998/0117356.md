Science Summary: This proposal requests support to construct a detailed 14C
calibration data set for the period from 15 - 55 calendar Kyr BP using sediments
of the tropical Cariaco Basin. The varved sediments of the Cariaco Basin allow
annual resolution. Paleoclimate records from the Caricaco Basin show identical
variation to detailed records from the GISP2 ice core. The study will obtain a
series of high-resolution radiocarbon dates from Cariaco Basin and calibrate
them to the chronology of the GISP2 ice core record.
