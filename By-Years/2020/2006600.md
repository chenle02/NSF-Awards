Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are an important factor in star formation in
spiral galaxies and in the evolution of those galaxies. This project will use
high resolution observations from the ALMA radio telescope to map out the CO gas
content in M83 -- a nearby spiral galaxy. These observations will identify every
GMC in this galaxy down to the lowest masses of 10,000 solar masses. This map
will provide new insights on the connection between GMCs, star formation, spiral
arms, and galaxy evolution. The project will also develop and provide support
for radio instruments for educational uses in university
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will take an unbiased census of the
bulk molecular gas over the whole disk of M83, resolving the GMC distribution,
scaling relations, mass function, and their spatial variations. It will
characterize the CO 2-1/1-0 line ratio of every GMC over the whole disk and
investigate its variations as a function of galactic structures and star
formation activity. The simultaneous analysis of CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) over the
entire disk will provide unique reference for future studies of ISM evolution in
galaxies. The project will upgrade and redesign an educational radio
interferometer for use in university courses. Part of this upgrade will be to
shift the operating frequency to a band that is protected for
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
