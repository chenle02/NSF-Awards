Research radars have proven to be an extremely useful tools for a broad range
of meteorological topics. Such research has encompassed studies of the
precipitation producing characteristics of individual clouds, to investigations
of severe thunderstorms, to sampling of vertical wind structure for study of
large scale weather patterns, to the analysis of global water budgets. Major
practical applications of meteorological radar include the capability of
accurate remote sensing of rainfall for hydrological purposes and remote
detection of severe weather such as tornadoes, flash floods, hurricanes and
microbursts. Indeed, the benefits of these practical applications are the
primary reason for fundamental changes in the Nation's weather observing system
via installation of the next generation of meteorological radars (NEXRAD) and
vertical wind sounding systems (profilers). There is a need to continue state-
of-the-art research in meteorological radar and to train the next generation of
both research and operational radar meteorologists. This need for accelerated
research and educational activities has been emphasized recently in a report
issued by the American Meteorological Society based on a meeting focussed on
assessing the state of radar meteorological research and education. Accordingly,
the National Science Foundation issued a project solicitation for management of
a major radar facility in an educational/research setting. The Principal
Investigator of the winning proposal has put forth an impressive plan for
management of the radar facility in support of both in-house and external (to
the institution) educational and research activities in radar meteorology. These
activities include interactions between engineers, computer scientists and
meteorologists in an effort to continue to push back the frontiers of the
science and to train a new generation of radar meteorologists and radar
engineers. //
