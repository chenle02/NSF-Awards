This REU site program will engage undergraduate students in research experiences
focused in the area of hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV
and PHEV) technologies. Undergraduate students will be part of a research team
which will include faculty, graduate Ph.D. candidates, post-doctoral research
associates and technicians. In addition to the research experiences, the
students will participate in group meetings, seminars, and tours of industry
facilities. Ethics training is an integral part of this program. Activities in
ethics will be organized in coordination with the Center for the Study of Ethics
in the Professions (CSEP) which was established in 1976. CSEP is one of the
nation's leading ethics centers, and is internationally recognized for its work
on ethics in science and engineering. At the end of the program the participants
will make formal presentations of their work at the IEEC Vehicle Power and
Propulsion annual meeting.

As the US continues to rely more and more upon vehicular transportation, the
looming problems of fuel supply and pollution become more imminent. An immediate
solution to this problem is essential, and the most promising solution lies in
HEV and PHEV technologies. Automotive industries and research laboratories
nationwide are pursuing electric and hybrid vehicle research seriously and the
automotive industry is going through major reconstruction. This program will
train and educate students in an effort to address the emerging workforce and
educational needs of the U.S. automotive industry. The PI will place special
emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities for the program.

?This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
NSF REU program.?
