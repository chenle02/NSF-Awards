As a result of this project, 25 young women between the ages of 13 and 15 years
will serve as interns at Texas A and M University during the summer of 1992. The
duties and activities carried out by these young women will be assigned by a
woman faculty member or professional staff with whom the interns are matched. In
addition, the interns attend weekly lunch meetings and listen to speakers
addressing career choices. Specific scientific interest areas are addressed
through field trips and seminars. To help prepare them for their internships,
the first hour of each day is spent on computer instruction for the purpose of
learning wordprocessing and simple spreadsheets. This effort supports a diverse
set of excellent role models.
