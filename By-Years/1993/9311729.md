9311729 Fisher Michael Fisher is jointly supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry and the Materials Theory Programs to
continue his theoretical research in statistical mechanics and the study of
ordered states of matter, phase transitions between these states, and related
critical phenomena. The aim is to elucidate observed physical behavior,
uncovering general principles and applying them to specific cases. A variety of
theoretical techniques will be utilized including phenomenological,
thermodynamic and scaling analyses, renormalization group methods, Monte Carlo
simulations, exact mathematical solutions of model statistical mechanical
systems, and series expansions for singular thermodynamic correlation properties
and their extrapolation. %%% Significant progress in the production of new
materials has been aided in recent years by a detailed molecular level
understanding of the interactions which occur in condensed phases and at
interfaces between solids and liquids. Fisher's research seeks to find
theoretical explanations for phenomena such as interfacial tension, wetting, the
behavior of vesicles and membranes, and phase separations.
