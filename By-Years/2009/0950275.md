This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) planning grant from the University of New
Mexico seeks to address three issues in conjunction with a partnership proposed
for development of the fulldome medium as a technology and as an innovative
venue for STEM education: 1) the limited availability and expense of fulldome
venues; 2) the need to identify more avenues for commercialization of the
technologies developed in conjunction with the fulldome medium; and 3) the need
to elaborate upon a career path for students from the University of New Mexico
and its primary academic partner, the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA).
A special professionally facilitated workshop will combine the diverse talents
of university researchers and industry representatives to solve new challenges
and develop applications using the collaborative space of the fulldome.
Specifically, the development of new dome tools and technologies will stimulate
new research in user interfaces, image-based rendering, and new software
Application Programming Interfaces (API)

The proposed workshop will generate fresh ideas to enhance the potential impact
of deployment of full dome technology for education and workforce development.
This technology can serve as a medium for a wide range of applications in
scientific visualization, education games, and entertainment. Establishing this
consortium has the potential to help create a new high tech industry within the
state of New Mexico and add to the growing digital media industry in the state.
The University of New Mexico will join the IAIA and industry partners to share
the facilities and expertise developed as part of this consortium
