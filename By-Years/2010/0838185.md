The precipitous decay in the intensity of the Earth's dipole magnetic field
since 1840 is a robust feature defined by magnetic observatory data. The drop is
related to a low magnetic intensity region called the South Atlantic Anomaly,
which may be driven by the growth of a prominent reversed magnetic flux core
patch off the coast of South Africa. The magnetic dipole history prior to the
era of modern observatory measurements is uncertain because of the near lack of
archeomagnetic data from the Southern Hemisphere. A paleointensity record of the
geomagnetic field for the Southern Hemisphere is potentially held in Iron Age
(300 to 1800 AD) ceramics of southern Africa. The Paleomagnetism Research Group
at the University of Rochester is analyzing this record. They are combining
these paleointensity data with magnetic directions obtained from analyses of
oriented archeological materials and other field strength measures using a new
technique (the analysis of single grain pottery temper). The ultimate goal of
the project is to use the new magnetic records to test geomagnetic field models
and contrasting interpretations of the long-term nature of the modern dipole
decrease. A Southern Hemisphere archeomagnetic record is of interest to a broad
range of scientists, ranging from those studying processes active in the Earth?s
core to those interested in the efficiency of magnetic shielding from solar
energetic particles. The investigation involves international collaboration with
South African archeologists and geologists. The work incorporates graduate and
undergraduate student studies and a small number of K-12 activities. The latter
integrate the teaching efforts of the University of Rochester Paleomagnetism
Research Group with the Rochester community. Outreach activities also include
dissemination of the research results in South Africa. This award is co-funded
by NSF's Geophysics Program and the Office of International Science and
Engineering.
