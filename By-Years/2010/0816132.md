Synthesis of scientific research is critical for advancing our understanding of
fundamental ecological principles and for charting future research directions.
The PI will spend two years synthesizing a 21-year series of investigations on
the evolutionary and behavioral ecology of an isolated population of Savannah
Sparrows breeding at the Bowdoin Scientific Station on Kent Island, New
Brunswick. The project will have three main outcomes: (1) a comprehensive,
widely accessible scholarly monograph; (2) popular articles on how to enrich
undergraduate scientific education and on the importance of synthesis in
ecology; and (3) extensive long-term data sets made available on the web for
researchers, educators and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus will
be exploring how different biological traits are inherited in natural
populations. Making these extensive data sets available to researchers and
students will allow them to explore a wealth of scientific questions. A major
impact of this work will be the continued inspiration, training and mentoring of
students. So far, thirty-three undergraduates have co-authored publications
based on the research that will be synthesized here, highlighting the value of
integrating research with education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
