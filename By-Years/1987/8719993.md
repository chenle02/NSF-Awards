This research deals with an experimental and theoretical study of concentrated
polymer solutions in strong flows. The objective is a better understanding of
the changes in polymer conformation which occur as a consequence of the flow,
and conversely, the modifications of the flow which occur because of the
polymer. The proposed experimental measurements utilize a two-color
birefringence system to provide real-time data on polymer conformation in
transient conditions, and dynamic light scattering to obtain local,
instantaneous data on the velocity gradient in the flow. From a fundamental
point of view, the concern is with the relationship between molecular
parameters, particularly the molecular weight and molecular-weight distribution,
on polymer relaxation phenomena in the so-called "viscoelastic" regime of large
deformation from the equilibrium state. In a more general sense, the research
deals with the effects of various kinds if flow on polymer conformation, and
with the implications for polymer processing, including the potential for
manipulation of macroscopic properties of polymeric materials through flow-
induced modifications of conformation.
