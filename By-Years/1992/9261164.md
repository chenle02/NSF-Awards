Beta-Silicon Carbide has been known for many years to have excellent
theoretical properties for the production of high power microwave devices. The
combination of its wide bandgap, high saturated electron drift velocity, high
breakdown electric field, low dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity
give it a figure of merit for high power microwave applications that is 1100
times better than that of silicon and 183 times better than that of gallium
arsenide. The primary advantage of beta silicon carbide is higher carrier
mobility which, for electrons, has been measured and calculated to be high.
Another advantage junction power devices is the lower junction barrier because
of the smaller bandgap. Also the resistance for contacts developed to date are
lower for 3 cubic structures than for 6 hexagonal structures. Thus, the beta-
form is more desirable for high frequency, high power applications. However, a
process for growing high quality boules of beta- silicon carbide from which to
fabricate wafers and devices has not been developed. It is proposed to evaluate
two different approaches for growth of beta-silicon carbide single crystal
boules during Phase I. Further development of the most promising process will be
the primary Phase II objective.
