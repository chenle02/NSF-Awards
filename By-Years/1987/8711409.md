A number of investigators in chemical and biological oceanography are using
benthic flux chambers to measure chemical fluxes across the sediment-water
interface. Flux chamber measurements are expected to be a major component of the
Global Ocean Flux Program during the next decade. Placing a flux chamber on the
sea floor may in itself alter the flux of dissolved species into, or out of, the
sediments. Transport through the boundary layer lying just above the sediment-
water interface represents a significant impedance to chemical fluxes in certain
cases. Benthic chambers can provide accurate measurements of chemical fluxes
occurring on the unperturbed sea floor only if transfer coefficients through the
boundary layer are known, both inside and outside the chamber. This grant
provides funds to improve the reliability of a benthic lander, a device to place
experimental devices on the seafloor, and also to develop a method for measuring
transfer coefficients both within and outside of an experimental chambers. In
two years, upon completion of this work, a simple, reliable, and relatively
inexpensive system capable of measuring boundary layer transfer coefficients
(previously referred to as boundary layer film thickness) at a large number of
sites will be available. The system will be made available on a collaborative
basis to other investigators involved in benthic studies.
