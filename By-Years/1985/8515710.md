This research is on the presence of fungi in water distribution systems and
their role in changing the quality of the water and in deterioration of the
distributions system components. Field sampling will be conducted of water
distribution systems in the Philadelphia area. Results of this research will be
applicable to the engineering design of water distribution systems and treatment
processes.
