Abstract for award of Haiman DMS-0301072

Professor Haiman works on problems in combinatorics related to algebra, geometry
and representation theory. Using new discoveries on the geometry of Hilbert
schemes, he has recently proved the positivity conjecture for Macdonald
polynomials and established a formula in terms of these polynomials for the
character of a "doubled" version of the classical spaces of harmonics for
symmetric groups. Evidence suggests that these results fit into a larger
framework in which Nakajima's quiver varieties play the role of the Hilbert
scheme. In his continuing research, Haiman hopes to establish the validity of
this larger framework and further develop the connections between combinatorics,
Macdonald polynomials and Hilbert schemes. He also plans to work on unsolved
problems connected with q-analogs of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
introduced by Shimozono and Weyman and the q-Schur functions of Lascoux,
Lapointe and Morse. Finally, in collaboration with Grojnowski, he will return to
a study he initiated some years ago of Hecke algebra characters and their
connection with combinatorial properties of immanants.

Combinatorics is the mathematical study of things that can be described, counted
and manipulated in simple and explicit terms: things like trees, Young diagrams,
or strings of symbols, that we can write on paper or encode in a computer. In my
view, what makes combinatorics interesting is that deeply abstract mathematical
concepts--such as geometric spaces in many dimensions, or algebras of symmetries
--tend to have an underlying combinatorial structure. My current work connects
the geometric properties of special spaces such as Hilbert schemes and quiver
varieties with the combinatorial properties of Young diagrams and symmetric
polynomials. By understanding the connection, we can deal with these abstract
spaces on a concrete level and get important new insights about both the
geometry of the spaces and the rules governing the combinatorics associated with
them.
