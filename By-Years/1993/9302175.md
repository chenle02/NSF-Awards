9302175 Yuen In this project the PI's will numerically model (2-D and 3-D)
convection of fluids in the oceanic crust, convection in the magma lens beneath
a ridge axis, and interface dynamics between the low melt % mush below the magma
lens above. Such goals will be accomplished by the PI's with the addition of
heat and mass fluxes to their existing 3-D model using high-powered graphics and
supercomputers.
