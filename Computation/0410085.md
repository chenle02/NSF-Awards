Mathematical models based on partial differential equations, the calculus of
variations, and associated numerical techniques have had great success in image
processing, especially in segmentation and denoising problems. This project will
extend some of the most successful of these models, such as total variation
based image denoising, to curve and surface denoising tasks that are of
fundamental importance in computer vision and computer graphics applications.
Accordingly, a central theme of this project is to find novel and natural ways
to generalize models originally designed for processing images to processing
curves and surfaces. This leads to curvature dependent functionals that need to
be minimized over geometric objects. The project will draw on a variety of
numerical techniques, such as the level set method, to develop algorithms for
the solution of these challenging computational problems. It will also develop
new variational image denoising and segmentation models that are more effective
than current ones in multiscale decomposition of images.

The problems addressed by this project form a crucial step in diverse
applications of image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics. In
particular, surface denoising is a preliminary first step in many automatic
detection and recognition tasks that involve three dimensional shapes, such as
face recognition and target identification. It is also an essential component of
algorithms that fit surfaces to volumetric data, which is needed in many medical
imaging applications.
