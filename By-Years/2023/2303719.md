This award supports students at U.S. institutions to attend the Twenty-fourth
ACM Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2023).
HotMobile 2023, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, is held in Orange County, CA,
February 22-23, 2023. HotMobile is the premier workshop targeting mobile
computing and system integration fields. Attending this event will benefit the
scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical
content of HotMobile 2023 will inspire students to address the tough problems in
their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in
mobile computing.

Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop
but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In
addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in mobile
computing research will be strongly encouraged. Approximately 20 students will
receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2023.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
