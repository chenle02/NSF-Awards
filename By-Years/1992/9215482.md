The goal of this research is to investigate and develop techniques needed to
produce a tool that allows the applications programmer and computer designer to
work closely to increase uniprocessor performance. Computational units, such as
the floating-point units, are becoming faster and readily available because of
the rapid advances in technology and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. The
performance, however, is limited by the rate at which data is applied to the
units. To achieve good uniprocessor performance, one must efficiently utilize
the computational units, memory, and memory ports. This may require that the
applications programmer redesign the algorithms to better exploit the unique
features of the architecture or the computer designer utilize CAD tools to
design special-purpose processors that exploit the unique features of the
algorithms or for best results, both. This research will investigate and develop
(1) techniques for extracting statistics on the utilization of the
aforementioned processor resources and (2) methods for displaying the
performance statistics to benefit both the applications programmer and the
computer designer. The results of this research will permit the applications
programmer and computer designer to interact closely to address the problem of
efficiently solving challenging problems such as climate modeling, vehicle
dynamics, semiconductor modeling, and quantum chromodynamics, which are beyond
the scope of existing computers.
