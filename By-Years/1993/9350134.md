Dr. Rau's research addresses the question of how computer systems can
automatically construct and use representations of knowledge about what they
know. This is important not only for extending our understanding of human
behavior, but for increasing the intelligence, functionality, usability and
efficiency of current- day computer systems. The objectives are to develop
methods of extracting, representing and utilizing meta-knowledge automatically
derived from text. Previous research has developed methods of extracting
information from text, and methods of calculating the conceptual salience and
breadth of knowledge from databases. This research will leverage these advances
to develop novel methods of creating summary representations of the content of
text, and demonstrate their applicability to the problem of increased accuracy
and efficiency of conceptual information retrieval. The research methodology
employed is experimental computer science. Working programs will implement
algorithms that create meta- knowledge from text, and demonstrate advances by
exhibiting new functionality with real problems in information access and
retrieval. Interactive activities at the host institution include: hosting a
two-day workshop on Diversity Awareness; teaching a graduate level course;
putting together a program to provide educational and career opportunities for
women; and holding a series of special seminars on "Industrial Research: What's
it Like?" This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the
disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
