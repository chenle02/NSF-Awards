9451655 Melendez A 200 MHz FT-NMR with multi-nuclear and variable temperature
capabilities is being acquired to provide students of chemistry, biology and
health-related fields with opportunities to become proficient in theory,
operation and application of contemporary NMR spectroscopy. Innovative
experiments including 1D and 2D (13C, 1H) NMR techniques are being incorporated
into the chemistry curriculum in a stepwise approach beginning with the
introductory Organic Chemistry Course. Students in the other courses affected,
Spectroscopy, Organic Synthesis, Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry,
Biochemistry, then apply more advanced NMR techniques to learn: structure
elucidation of complex organic molecules and organometallic complexes,
determination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, determination of
substrate specificity and stereoselectivity of enzymes, and other principles or
techniques, as well. Also, the diversity and range of current and future student
research projects is being enhanced through new capabilities for multinuclear-
and variable temperature NMR applications.
