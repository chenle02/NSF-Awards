9626633 Bestvina The goal of this project is to understand large-scale geometry
of spaces of nonpositive curvature, boundaries of finitely generated groups and
groups of automorphisms of free groups of finite rank. Other directions of
research are study of configuration spaces of line arrangements and mechanical
linkages in homogeneous metric spaces in relation with the representation theory
of certain classes of finitely generated groups (Artin and Coxeter groups) and
investigation of the ``Riemann-Hilbert problem'' from the topological point of
view. The project focuses in part on the structure of symmetries of objects
naturally arising in geometry, algebra, and differential equations. The ancient
Greeks understood symmetries of Platonic solids, e.g., a cube. Platonic solids
are positively curved, and they have a finite number of symmetries. At the
opposite end of the spectrum are negatively curved objects, such as the
Lobachevsky hyperbolic plane (featured frequently in Escher paintings), and
these typically have infinitely many symmetries. Consequently, the structure of
these symmetries is both more interesting and harder to understand. Another part
of the project is the study of linkages. These are mechanical devices
constructed from rigid rods connected at joints. It is a classical problem to
describe the possible shapes traced out by an end of a linkage after affixing
another end with a nail. For example, a compass can be regarded as a (very
simple) linkage, and it traces out a circle. This project explores the
surprising relationship between the shapes traced out by a linkage and certain
symmetries of spaces of solutions of algebraic equations. The final part of the
project is concerned with symmetries arising from a system of differential
equations. ***
