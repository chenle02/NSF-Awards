The objective of this project is to provide immunology students with the
knowledge, procedures, and equipment to analyze the humoral immune response as
it relates to antigenic challenge and subsequent antibody analysis. Students
will prepare bacterial whole cell and cell-free extract soluble antigens for
subsequent immunization of rabbits. During the course of immune response studies
students will gain hands-on experience with practical immunological techniques
including: 1)immunoelectrophoresis; 2)immunodiffusion; 3) immunoblotting; and
4)enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays. These experimental methods will require
the students to think critically about both the procedures and the analysis of
their data.
