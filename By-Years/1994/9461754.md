An innovative multi-channel array (MCA) ground penetrating radar system will be
developed that, in many ways overcomes drawbacks of current single channel
systems. First, the MCA will reduce the total survey time dramatically; multi-
offset two-dimensional and zero-offset three-dimensional data can be efficiently
obtained. Second, the MCA reduces strong surface clutter by steering beams in
the downward directions, thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio of subsurface
reflections. Third, the MCA can focus a diffuse radar beam in an absorptive
medium for deeper penetration. The proposed R & D will produce a useful tool for
rapid subsurface investigation. The Phase I project involves two parts. First,
the advantages and feasibility of the MCA method for three-dimensional imaging
will be illustrated by numerical simulations, and second, a block diagram of the
proposed MCA system will be outlined for future prototype construction.
