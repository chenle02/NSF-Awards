This is for continuation of a long-term study of the petrogenesis of lavas from
Central American volcanoes. The PIs have been able to correlate chemistry with
thickness and dip of the slab. They will now try to: 1) characterize their
postulated four sources for multi component mixing, 2) analyze for Cs in the
slab-derived fluid, 3) attempt to determine regional variations in the mantle
through modelling, and 4) map the distribution of the slab component in regions
of diffuse, behind-the-front volcanism.
