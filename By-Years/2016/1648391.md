This award provides support to allow students and postdocs from U.S.
universities to participate in the fifteenth meeting of the International
Symposium on Ultrafast Intense Laser Science (ISUILS15), to be held October 2-7,
2016, in Cassis, France. This Symposium is held in the United States one out of
every five years, and offers an opportunity for students to present their
research results and to interact with senior scientists from across the United
States and the broader international community. As it is being held outside of
the U.S. this year, it is being supported by NSF's Office of International
Science and Engineering. The support of students through this award makes a
substantial contribution to the education and training of future U.S.
scientists. Students who graduate with a background in the Symposium topic
subdiscipline (atomic, molecular, and optical physics) acquire a broad range of
knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of
science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Symposium is on a topic that
is receiving particular emphasis this year because of a number of reports, such
as (1) "Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation," from the
National Research Council, (2) "Fast-Track Action Committee on Optics and
Photonics: Building a Brighter Future with Optics and Photonics," from the
National Science and Technology Council, and (3) "Optics and Photonics:
Transformative Research Opportunities in the Mathematical and Physical
Sciences," from the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee.
