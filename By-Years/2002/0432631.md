A Partnering Agreement between NSF/OPP and the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans, Canada is established to support the use of a Canadian Coast Guard (CCG)
vessel in support of a research project funded by the Division of Ocean
Sciences. The relevant NSF award is to Dr. Charles Paull of Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, award # OCE 01-17661. OCE and OPP jointly supported
the review and recommendation of the award, with OPP supporting the ship time.
Time on a US Ice breaker was not available in the requested year (2002) so OPP
requested support from Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans who
coordinate the science use of Canadian Coast Guard Ice Breaker assets. The
project was carried out in September of 2003 involving a two-ship operation and
an international research team working in Canadian waters off the Mackenzie
River Delta.
