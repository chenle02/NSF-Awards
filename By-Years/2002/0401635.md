Abstract, CNS-0401635&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will port the Astro-Fold
first principles methodology for protein structure prediction to the BlueGene
class of machines with primary objectives: (i) to conduct a performance analysis
of the BlueGene architecture, and (ii) to validate the architecture's unique
features of concurrency between computation and
communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop parameter
representation of the distributed system and will perform distributed computing
studies with different number of nodes so as to assess and understand the
performance of the network delays on the computations, the message passing and
the communications overhead. The project will also investigate and assess the
performance of the BlueGene class of machines not only on the individual levels
of distributed computations (i.e, the helical prediction, the loop prediction,
and the three-dimensional structure prediction), but also on the combined
distributed computing performance of all levels and hierarchy in the distributed
computations. This will be of major significance for the BlueGene class of
machines and for the Astro-Fold methodology.
