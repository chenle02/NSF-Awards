PI: Sharyn Elaine Perry Proposal number: IOS-0922845 Title: "Transcriptional
Regulatory Networks Controlling Higher Plant Embryogenesis"

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

During higher plant embryogenesis, the single celled zygote proliferates and
differentiates to form the mature embryo within the seed. During this phase of
the life cycle, not only must the plant body form (called morphogenesis) but
also storage products must accumulate to support early stages of seedling
development, and programs to allow the embryo to undergo desiccation to give the
"pause" in development that we recognize as the seed must occur (called
maturation). Despite humans" reliance on seeds, little is understood about the
mechanisms controlling development of seeds and the embryos that they contain.
Several genes have been identified that encode proteins that control gene
expression during embryogenesis, and when these proteins accumulate in plant
cells outside of the context of the embryo, they can drive embryo-specific
programs in these cells. One such gene is FUSCA3 (FUS3) that is also necessary
for normal seed development. This project focuses on better understanding
control of gene regulation by FUS3 with the long-term goal of understanding gene
regulatory networks during embryogenesis. Biochemical and molecular approaches
will be used to identify genes directly and indirectly controlled by FUS3.
Genetic approaches will elucidate the roles select FUS3 targets play in
embryogenesis. The project will also contribute to an understanding of
interactions between FUS3 and other genes that are key regulators of embryo
development. Basic knowledge about gene regulation during embryo development is
important for any molecular approaches to improving seeds to meet current
challenges in agriculture and could impact on aspects including yield,
nutritional content, and viability. The project will provide training for a
postdoctoral researcher including opportunities to assist the primary
investigator in educational activities.
