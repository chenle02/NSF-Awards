The University of Pittsburgh in conjunction with the American Association for
the Advancement of Scien(AAAS) will design a Train the Trainers of Trainers (T3)
model based on some of the leading research of Everett Rogers and others about
how .innovations are diffused into existing organizations. T3 will ramp up the
training of faculty to train others who train graduate students in responsible
conduct of research, conduct research and interviews to gather knowledge about
what has worked to date, plan the workshop for training the trainers, develop
workshop materials that address issues of pedagogy, program implementation
including, the development of support for ethics training, and design new
curricula units that relate to professional development issues that arise
unexpectedly, but are critical to the professional and ethical success of the
graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal addresses a critically important need
across all STEM fields?the training in responsible conduct of research and
ethical behavior throughout a STEM career. The model will rapidly multiply the
number of people capable of teaching ethics to STEM graduate students with new
workshops, curricula and websites. &lt;br/&gt;The collaboration with AAAS and
other professional societies augurs well for a fast and useful ramp-up of
materials and usage. While the project focuses on graduate students in NSF
related fields, it is anticipated that the curriculum materials and training
will be useful for teaching ethics to undergraduates, postdoctoral fellows, and
faculty, and staff in fields beyond those that are NSF related.&lt;br/&gt;
