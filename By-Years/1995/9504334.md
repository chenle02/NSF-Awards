Fuzzy Decision Trees The objective of this research is to explore ways to
utilize fuzzy representation to increase the representative power of symbolic
decision trees. Decision trees are a popular and easilyunderstood inference
mechanism for use in knowledge based systems. The use of fuzzy representations
for knowledge has similar comprehensibility advantages, and is particularly
natural in describing mixtures of continuous and discrete symbolic features.
Fuzzy representations can advantageously be combined with decision trees. This
project explores merging fuzzy representation and symbolic decision trees by
modifying both the tree-building routines and the inference methods. The latter
of these is quite challenging, and the results need to be empirically evaluated.
The overall goal in doing this is to utilize the existing methodologies while
preserving their important advantages, as mentioned above, in the combined
forms.
