This research program deals with several aspects of the theory of hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws and involves projects that can be divided into two
categories. The first category is the application of the method of vanishing
viscosity to (a) hyperbolic systems with weakly dissipative mechanisms such as
friction, fading memory, and relaxation and (b) special systems of hyperbolic
conservation laws with large initial data. These projects will establish the
existence, stability, and qualitative behavior of solutions to systems with
important applications; for example, porous media flows and the motion of
viscoelastic materials with fading memory. The second category is the continuous
dependence of entropy weak solutions to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws
on physical parameters such as the adiabatic exponent and speed of light. The
aim of these projects is to initiate an investigation on this issue of
dependence on nonlinear flux functions with applications to compressible fluids
in gas dynamics and special relativity.

This research project concerns problems lying on the interface between continuum
physics and the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Most of the
partial differential equations arising in the study of elasticity, plasticity,
fluid mechanics, semiconductors, gas dynamics, and combustion can be formulated
as conservation laws. This project investigates mathematical properties of
systems of such conservation laws, making use of the underlying physical
structure to direct the analysis, while conversely elucidating properties of the
equations to help better understand continuum physics. The results of this
program are also expected to suggest computational algorithms that will advance
numerical simulation of the systems.
