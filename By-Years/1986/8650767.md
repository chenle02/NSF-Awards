The primary objective of this project is to update laboratory instruction in the
field of molecular biology. The new equipment provides experience with
technologies commonly employed in a modern research laboratory for the isolation
and characterization of proteins and nucleic acids. Techniques such as
electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, chromatography and spectrophotometry are
associated with such currently productive fields as genetic engineering and
biomedical research. In this way, students are enjoying a greatly increased
exposure to techniques which prepare them for work at the forefront of science.
