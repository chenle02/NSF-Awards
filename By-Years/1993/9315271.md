The primary objective of this U.S. Hungary research project between Dr. Kenneth
Zeger of the University of Illinois and Dr. Gabor Lugosi of the Technical
University of Budapest is to examine source coding problems and classification
problems where it is desirable to conduct coding and classification together,
for the same source. The researchers will study neural classification and
consistency issues, universal vector quantization and empirical computer design.
Efforts should lead to a better understanding of empirically designed lossy
source coders, universal lossy source coders and statistical pattern
classification. Results are expected to yield rate of convergence information
for these techniques and may be applied to areas such as computer imaging in
nuclear medicine. This research in computer communications fulfills the program
objectives of advancing science and engineering by enabling leading experts in
the U. S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
