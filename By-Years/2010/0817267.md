Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training the next generation of
computing professionals to build secure software requires an emphasis on
teaching computer security foundations, principles, and skills. This project
takes the approach that an emphasis on security should pervade all aspects of
teaching software development. Based on a successful pilot study done
previously, this project is creating learning materials and teaching strategies
that are suitable for a minimally-intrusive introduction of security concepts
into multiple existing courses: introduction to computer science; introduction
to computer information systems; database systems; networks; and web
development. The materials are being tested at five institutions, including
three community colleges. The goals of the project are to increase the security
awareness of both students and faculty, to increase the ability of students to
apply security principles, and to increase the number of security-skilled
graduates. Because of the wide variations in students' academic and socio-
economic backgrounds in the participating institutions, the project's evaluation
plan includes identifying features in the materials being developed that work
well across the different demographic groups.
