This project involves two linked problems. Starting from the observation that
the spatio-temporal distributions of tracers in the atmosphere and ocean are
non-Gaussian, the first problem is to try and attach mechanisms to the different
types of non-Gaussian behavior by looking at models of various physical
processes and seeing what tracer distributions result. The second problem is to
try and develop ways of performing data assimilation that take account of the
non-Gaussian nature of data "errors" and of situations in which uncertainty
combines multiplicatively rather than additively.

One of the impacts of this work may be on the estimation and prediction of
oceanic flows, a topic that is becoming increasingly important for a range of
applications including coastal zone management and fisheries. Data from passive
Lagrangian platforms, one of the methods used to observe the ocean, are
frequently characterized by non-Gaussian statistics. Other potential areas of
application include the forecasting of the distributions of chemical tracers in
both the atmosphere and the ocean.
