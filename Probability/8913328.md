The principal investigator will continue his research in probability theory and
classical analysis. Using and developing techniques in classical analysis (i.e.
Dirichlet forms), he intends to obtain more precise approximations to certain
transition probability functions. Furthermore, he will continue to simplify and
extend known results in the area of large deviations, with an eye to applying
these results to the analysis of stochastic processes which arise in Ising-type
models of statistical mechanics. In this effort, the principal investigator will
collaborate with a postdoctoral associate.
