The major threat facing most animal populations is habitat destruction due to
urbanization (i.e., human development). Urbanization may be especially
destructive to populations of amphibians and reptiles, which are declining
precipitously in many regions. In this CAREER proposal, Dr. Dorcas will develop
a program based on undergraduate research to examine the effects of urbanization
on amphibians and reptiles. He will establish a study to explore reasons for an
already documented detrimental effect of urbanization on salamanders living in
small streams in North Carolina. Salamanders will be systematically sampled from
streams and their numbers compared before, during, and after development of the
streams' watersheds. The PI will also examine how semi-aquatic turtles
inhabiting small ponds respond to urbanization. Turtles will be trapped before,
during, and after development, and radiotelemetry will be used to monitor their
movements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because amphibians and reptiles may be more
sensitive to environmental degradation than some other animals, studies such as
this one can provide early evidence of environmental degradation. Many
undergraduate students will be presented with a wide variety of opportunities to
participate in high-quality research. Finally, an outreach program to the local
community and to local schools will intimately involve community members in the
research and will increase appreciation of amphibians and reptiles as important
parts of our natural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;
