Proposal Number: ECS-9708230 Principal Investigator: David Nolte Title:
Photorefractive quantum well devices and applications or optical scanning and
femtosecond pulse processing In this research, photorefractive semiconductor
quantum well devices will be in investigated in the context of three different
applications: (1) three dimensional laser scanning with the PRQW as the dynamic
holographic thin film component; (2) a laser-based ultrasound system with the
PRQW as the homodyne detection device; (3) femtosecond pulse shaping.
Photorefractive semiconductor quantum well (PRQW) devices are thin film devises
that operate as dynamic holographic media. They are strong candidates for
applications such as biomedical optical scanning, three dimensional parts
recognition and ultrafast optical pulse processing.
