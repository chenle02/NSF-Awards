This State-of-the-Art survey award will send a team from the Engineering Design
Research Center (EDRC) at Carnegie Mellon University, organized by Dr. Georgette
Demes, to Japan to expose the team members to design practice in five key
industries in which EDRC research has the broadest application. The team will
spend two days at each site, touring and asking a battery of questions sent
ahead. The team believes that design research in Japan is most advanced in
Japanese industry and that their center (EDRC) should play a role in
transmitting such information about Japanese research to American industry.
