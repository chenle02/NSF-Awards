This project supplements a current molecular biology course with a hands-on
labortory focusing on experiments that will lead to undergraduate research
projects. Equipment includes: horizontal gel electrophoresis (1/student pair,
Hoeffer), photographic materials (Polaroid), a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf), a
benchtop incubator (Precision) and material for PCR (thermal cycler, vacuum
blotter). Exercises include: plasmid isolation, restriction mapping, Southern
hybridizations, construction of cDNA libraries, screening techniques and PCR
reactions. The institution has a high enrollment of minorities (59% Hispanic).
