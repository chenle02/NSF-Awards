A series of experiments will be conducted to explore the psychological processes
underlying the effects of death-related thought demonstrated in previous terror
management research. The proposed research will: (a) explore the role of
implicit affect (i.e., the activation of cognitive structures associated with
affect without the direct subjective experience of emotion) in mediating the
effects of death-related thought on social behavior, (b) explore the effect of
death-related thought on the creative integration of new information and
experience with existing psychological structures, with emphasis on the role of
these processes in the stability and change of social stereotypes and self-
concepts, and (c) investigate alternative ways in which members of minority
groups and people alienated from the mainstream culture defend against death-
related thoughts. The proposed research has important implications for
understanding unconscious psychological defense, stereotyping, change and growth
in the individual self-concept, minority alienation with the mainstream culture,
and affiliation with deviant subgroups, such as gangs.
