This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
ultra high resolution spectroscopic techniques to explore the factors
responsible for the rates of intramolecular energy transfer in electronically
excited states of prototypical organic species. The research uses specific
excitation of single ro-vibrational states in selected electronic states of
organic molecules to map the energy transfer from these states to other ro-
vibrational levels. As a result of these studies one will gain an understanding
of the factors influencing energy flow in the systems chosen for study.
