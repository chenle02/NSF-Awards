9506607 NI This research is to expand the current shear-wave splitting data in
the U.S. through a comprehensive analysis of S and SKS, shear- wave splitting
using the three-component short-period analog data from the Long Range Seismic
Monitoring (LRSM) network which was in place during the 1960's. This analog
data, which will be digitized and made available to the scientific community,
presents a cost- effective and spatially extensive data set which will greatly
facilitate mapping of seismic anisotropy across the U.S., effectively
quadrupling the currently available measurements. Shear-wave splitting is a
measure of seismic anisotropy which can be used to infer mantle strain
associated with mantle flow and the relationship between subcontinental mantle
deformation and crustal deformation, the driving force of earthquake occurrence.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
