Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will use the lattice
(discrete space-time) approach to the strong nuclear force and to simplified
models of it to try to understand why quarks are confined inside the
"elementary" particles such as nucleons. There will also be an attempt to
overcome technical problems blocking the efficient use of numerical techniques
in studies of the strong force. The achievement of an understanding of quark
confinement is a challenge of fundamental importance, and the overcoming of
present technical obstacles in numerical studies of the strong force is
necessary for progress in this field.
