One of the significant recent developments in continental tectonics is the
appreciation of the widespread role of extensional structures is the evolution
of convergent plate margins. It is becoming increasingly clear that extensional
faults with large displacements can form during compression in convergent
settings. This project will utilize the south Tibetan detachment system of the
central Himalaya to study an active sample. The system contains a north-dipping
group of normal-sense shear zones that are thought to have accommodated
gravitational collapse of the Himalayan topographic front in Miocene time. The
work will focus on determining the possible multiple generations of extensional
activity during continent-continent collision by mapping, structural and
geochronological techniques. Results are expected to help define the causes and
mechanisms of large-scale extension within active convergence zones.
