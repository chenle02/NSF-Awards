Existing theories of voting in the United States emphasize the role of parties
and issues in voter choice. Recent research suggests however, that evaluations
of candidates may be more important than issues or party loyalties. The Research
Planning Award supports preliminary research to investigate the psychological
processes by which voters form images of political candidates. Drawing upon
recent research in cognitive psychology the research will attempt to develop a
research strategy to investigate the information encoding and retrieval
processes by which voters acquire and process information about candidates. Such
information has important implications for recent debates about the uses and
limitations of political debates, television advertising, the incumbency
advantage, and negative campaigning.
