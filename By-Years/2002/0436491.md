0436491 Stapleton

This U.S.-Argentina award supports Dr. Ann E. Stapleton, University of North
Carolina at Wilmington, as she undertakes a correlative study to identify
relationships of four factors to patterns of microbial diversity on plant leaves
of tomato and maize. These four factors are: plant species type; plant genotype;
U.V. radiation exposure; and exposure to insect pests. She will collaborate with
Dr. Carlos Ballare at the Agricultural Plant Physiology and Ecology Research
Institute (IFEVA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They will measure microbial
diversity using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE).

This work will increase our understanding of what is known about the microbial
ecology of this phylosphere. The project will combine the PI's expertise in
molecular genetics and genomes with her counterpart's expertise in ecology and
ecophysiology.
