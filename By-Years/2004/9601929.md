9601929 Anbar This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $294,772 as partial support of the costs of acquiring a
high- resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) with a
laser ablation microprobe capable of making rapid and precise determinations of
trace element concentrations and isotopic ratios in both aqueous and solid
samples with very low detection limits (parts per trillion or better) for
studies in environmental geochemistry, biochemistry and toxicology at the
University of Rochester. Specific studies to be undertaken with the capabilities
of this state-of- the-art instrument will include analyses of the distribution
of trace metals (i.e. Fe, Mn, V and Re) in sediments as indicators of paleoredox
conditions, analyses of isotopic ratios in biological samples for use as tracers
of the kinetics of trace metal uptake, analyses of trace element distributions
in black shales and mid- ocean ridge basalts as diagenetic and petrogenetic
indicators, analyses of the distribution of ultra- trace elements (i.e. Ir) in
natural waters and studies of the mobility of toxic trace elements in
groundwaters. ***
