The primary goal of this five-year system-wide project is to double the number
of minority graduates of Birmingham Public Schools (BPS) who are prepared to
enter college as science, mathematics, engineering, and technology majors. To
accomplish this goal, BPS has established a collaborative relationship involving
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Birmingham Compact, and the Alabama
Alliance for Minority Participation Program. Project activities will have an
impact on all 43,000 BPS students in grades K-12 and their 976 teachers of
science and mathematics. However, most academic enhancement activities will
serve teachers in grades 6-12. To achieve the project goal, these objectives
will be implemented: reform and enrich the K-12 science and mathematics
curricula, using national standards in mathematics and science as guidelines;
promote K-12 school-based leadership; enhance teachers' content knowledge and
increase the use of effective instructional strategies in mathematics and
science; provide students with a range of integrated enrichment activities;
provide students with effective social support networks; implement a plan for
effective use of school resources; and infuse appropriate technology into K- 12
instructional activities. Project processes and outcomes will be monitored
through a comprehensive and integrated evaluation model. Formative feedback will
be used to improve project functions throughout the duration of the grant.
Project descriptions outcomes will be thoroughly documented and will be
disseminated in various formats to a range of audiences. BPS, because of its
unique history, demographics, and economic situation, offers a unique challenge
for systemic reform. The success of this project may serve as a national model
for other similar school systems. ***
