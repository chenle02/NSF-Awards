*** 9760212 Somes This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate a new robot architecture for high-performance force
responsiveness. Current robot utility is hampered by low ability to control
environmental interaction forces. Operations trivial for humans (turning a
crank, snap assembly of components, polishing a surface) are beyond current
robot capabilities. The fault lies not in poor control of mechanisms, but in
fundamental performance limitations imposed by the dynamics of mechanisms
themselves. A new cable drive transmission has demonstrated outstanding dynamic
properties in a few select positioning applications, but it is unproved in force
control tasks. Its large envelope inhibits integration with many mechanical
systems. Phase I will evaluate the cable drive transmission for its capacity to
produce high-performance, guaranteed stable force control. Novel configurations
will be studied employing the drive for their practical implementations in
robotic manipulators. The expected performance of the conceptual manipulators
will be calculated and compared with existing robots. Success in this research
will apply towards single axis, torque-control mechanisms, with implications for
multiple degree-of-freedom robots approaching human-level force control
capability. Commercial applications are expected in: superior tensioning
mechanisms in web processing applications; automated finishing of fabricated
parts, including grinding, deburring, polishing, and blending; and automated
assembly of closely fitting components. Benefits are also expected in robots
that can work in close proximity and provide assistance to human laborers,
including the physically impaired.
