The subject of this research is topological properties of complex algebraic
varieties, especially their singularities. The investigator plans applications
of mixed Hodge modules to the topology of singularities, also application of the
algebraic version of the Thom-Pontrjagin construction to algebraic varieties.
Another topic is intersection homology of singularities and their higher
codimensional knotting. The tools are mixed Hodge modules, deformation theory,
intersection homology, and classical differential topology. ***
