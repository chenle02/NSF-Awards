While there is much conjecture regarding how jurors sort through and order
information in hearing evidence and making decisions, there is only limited
knowledge about what actually occurs and why. Some of the best work that has
sought to unravel how people reason posits a story model to explain how jurors'
judgments are reached. To date, based on experimental study, the story model has
generated a compelling theory about how jurors understand evidence and make
decisions prior to deliberation in juries. In contrast to additive and algebraic
models that posit that jurors add or average information to arrive at their
decisions, the story model emphasizes explanation-based components of juror
comprehension and reasoning. Dr. Pennington, who along with Dr. Hastie has
pioneered the story model, is now embarked on this next stage of the research.
The current experimental program aims (1) to specify the process components of
the theory by examining the inferences made during the comprehension of evidence
and the factors that influence which inferences are made at what points in the
comprehension process; (2) to determine the relationship and interaction between
processing stages proposed in the model--story construction, verdict learning,
and story clarification--which have been assumed to occur sequentially but might
occur in a more repetitive cycling fashion; and (3) to establish the robustness
and boundaries of the story model through the use of case materials less
immediately susceptible to story construction. The experiments are each labor-
intensive studies that use sophisticated methods to analyze the micro processes
of decisionmaking. The combined program should advance our basic understanding
of jury decisionmaking and of other types of legal judgments such as accounts of
disputes, litigant perceptions of events, and attorney and judicial
decisionmaking. Also, this research should add to our general knowledge about
the cognitive mechanisms that mediate social processes and decisions.
