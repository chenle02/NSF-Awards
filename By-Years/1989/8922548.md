A model for sorted patterned ground shows that some types arise from density-
driven Rayleigh free convection during thawing of water-saturated recurrently
frozen soils. The regularly spaced convection cells result in an uneven melting
of the underlying ice front. Frost action causes stones to be upthrusted and to
form in a pattern on the ground surface that mirrors the corrugation in the
underlying ice front. This award supports field work, laboratory experiments,
and modeling studies focused on obtaining pattern width-to-depth ratios for
underwater polygons. These will be supported by laboratory studies of underwater
polygons. A novel feature of the field and laboratory studies is the use of
infrared thermography to detect the free convection flows which precede any
visible patterning. Modeling studies will support these experimental
investigations of sorted polygons. Modeling studies will also be pursued to
determine the differential thaw penetration due to the heat transfer associated
with free convection in the active layer.
