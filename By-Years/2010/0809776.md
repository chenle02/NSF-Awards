This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Wenbin Lin at the University of North Carolina to
develop rational synthetic strategies toward homochiral and highly porous metal-
organic coordination networks (MOCNs) and to explore their applications in
heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis and chiral separations. Three key issues
concerning heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts based on homochiral porous MOCNs
will be addressed: rational synthesis of homochiral MOCNs with permanent
porosity and appropriate functionalities, development of novel strategies for
the synthesis of highly porous homochiral MOCNs from typically unresolvable
(achiral) building blocks, and the utilities of homochiral porous MOCNs in
practical enantioselective catalysis and separations. Highly porous chiral MOCNs
with desirable functional groups and appropriate metal linkers will result from
the proposed research, which should possess tailorable chiral pockets and
functionalities that are exploitable for enantioselective separations and
catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop new bottom-
up approaches towards efficient heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts that can be
readily recycled and re-used and can prevent the leaching of often toxic metals
from the catalysts into the organic products. Graduate students and postdoctoral
research associates participating in the proposed interdisciplinary research
will be trained with the skills that are crucial to their future careers as
Ph.D. chemists. The proposed research will also be integrated into the training
of undergraduates and high school students.
