The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to study the biological limitations of
expression systems used in the production of pharmaceutical proteins, initially
focusing on yeast as a model organism. The development of stable high copy
number recombinant vectors and hyper-secreting mutations in yeast are primary
goals. Achieving these aims will require fundamental research into the molecular
biology of amplified genetic elements and heterologous protein secretion. The
PI's approach to these problems will combine the analytical tools of traditional
chemical engineering with the experimental techniques of molecular and cellular
biology.
