Polar regions characteristically have marked seasonal variation in the
availability of food due to great reduction or elimination of primary production
during the winter. It is hypothesized that the evolution of large body size in
high-latitude planktonic organisms is a response to this extreme seasonality of
food supply and permits winter survival by increasing the store of body tissues
and lipids available for metabolism. Yen proposes to further examine the ecology
and lipid metabolism of Euchaeta antarctica, a predaceous copepod and the
largest species in this worldwide genus, to test the above hypothesis. She will
also examine the role of this species in the marine food web, and determine how
its life history and physiological specializations adapt it for survival in a
polar regime. Data from this project in combination with other information on
Euchaeta antarctica will advance present understanding of why this species is a
major component of Antarctic zooplankton and a dominant planktonic carnivore.
This project will examine lipid content and composition of female Euchaeta
antarctica, their eggs and their food. Rate of lipogenesis will be determined by
carbon-14 labeling. The project also will examine changes in lipid metabolism
with ontogeny and reproductive state, and as a function of environmental
temperature. Field work will be done at Palmer Station, Antarctica.
