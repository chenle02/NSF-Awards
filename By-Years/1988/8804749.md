This award is for a renewal of an REU site held by these two investigators last
summer. The project will involve faculty members, students and computing
resources from both the Universities of Colorado at Boulder and Denver. The
theme of the project is again nonlinear dynamics with a special emphasis on zero
finding algorithms and parallel computation. These are rapidly growing fields of
applicable mathematics which are quite accessible to undergraduates. It is
realistic to expect that with the supervision of the project investigators and
the combined resources of these two campuses, participating students can be
brought to the research level in these fields and make significant
contributions.
