0352912--Boss/Carnegie Inst of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An astrometric
camera will be built that will allow a long-term astrometric search for brown
dwarfs and Jupiter-like extrasolar planets in orbit around nearby southern
hemisphere stars. This search will reveal the presence of brown dwarfs or gas
giant planets moving on long-period (5 year or more) orbits. Masses or upper
limits to masses will be placed on extrasolar planets previously detected by
radial velocity surveys of southern stars. The search for extrasolar planets is
viewed with great interest by people both inside and outside the field of
astronomy.
