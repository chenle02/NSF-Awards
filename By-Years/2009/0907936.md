The focus of this research is to develop a practical catalytic method for CH
functionalization by means of carbenoid-induced CH insertion. This project
covers the design of new chiral catalysts and the application of unusual
carbenoid transformations into useful synthetic methods. Studies will also be
conducted to further define the scope of rhodium-carbenoid induced CH
functionalization with emphasis on refining the controlling elements for
regioselective CH functionalization and broadening the range of donor/acceptor
carbenoids that can be used in this chemistry.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Huw M.L Davies of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY at
Buffalo. Dr. Davies will focus his work on the development of methodologies for
metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations. The use of donor/acceptor-
substituted carbenoids to increase the scope of C-H insertion chemistry will be
highlighted by this research. The project has potential broader impact for the
pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries and the work provides an excellent
venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral
associates.
