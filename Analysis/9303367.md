de Branges 9303367 This project continues mathematical research on problems in
complex analysis and the application of methods of factorization of entire
functions to attempt a resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis. This venerable
conjecture concerns the roots of the so-called Riemann zeta-function. This an
important function in number theory which itself is not entire (having a pole at
the number 1). It is believed to have roots along the line perpendicular to real
axis passing through 1/2. Often forgotten is the fact that this function also
has roots at the negative even integers. The factorization theory employed here
derives from the spectral theory of self-adjoint second order differential
operators. Hilbert himself conjectured that the spectral theory contains a proof
of the Riemann hypothesis. This theory in itself does not contain enough
information about roots along the critical line. Work will be done in developing
another spectral theory for the purposes at hand. Factorization theory in effect
replaces the classical Euler product representation of the zeta-function with
two-by-two matrices whose entries are entire functions. The elementary factors
of the reciprocal of the Euler product are recovered from the determinants of
the matrices. The search for an answer to the question of the roots of the
Riemann zeta-function has a rich history, in which fundamental mathematical
ideas and structures evolved and a gained life of their own. This project,
whether or not it completes the search, will undoubtedly continue in this
tradition whereby the products of the research may prove to be more valuable the
goal itself. ***
