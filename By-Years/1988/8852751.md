This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the Department of Biology at
Clemson University. The first semester laboratory for freshman non-science
majors in biology will be converted to an investigative format in which students
plan and execute original experiments rather than following directions in
laboratory manuals. Biology educators generally endorse the concept of
investigative laboratories, but implementing an investigative format entails
numerous difficulties. This department plans to solve these long-standing
problems by a combination of wetlab experiments and an aquaculture computer
simulation called FISHFARM. They will develop videotape "methods modules" to
address the FISHFARM which will allow students to construct a coherent program
of experiments and give them the confidence and higher-order process skills to
attack big, multi- factor problems. In September of 1987, the Fund for the
Improvement of Post- Secondary Education (Department of Education) funded all
aspects of this project except equipment. This award will provide funds to
purchase computers and videocassette players to fully implement the
investigative laboratory curriculum. The grantee institution is matching this
NSF award with funds from non- Federal sources.
