This award is to develop a set of mathematical programming models and
associated heuristics for designing a set of standard modules. These models will
give the designer insight on designs that are easier to manufacture and easier
to expand when new products are developed. The objective of the models will be
to minimize design and production costs while satisfying technological
constraints (including quality constraints) and capacity constraints. The
research will incorporate both manufacturability and function as goals in
product design.
