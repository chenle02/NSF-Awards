9315872 Rieke Development of the cryogenic spectrometer was funded by the
National Science Foundation in 1989. At that time the instrument included
provision for upgraded capabilities which are now to be implemented. These
capabilities include increased resolution from approximately 700, or 3,700
depending upon the grating, to approximately 19,000. An existing tip/tilt mirror
system will also be adapted to the instrument to improve the effective
sensitivity by stabilizing star images on the instrument slit. The upgraded
resolution is to be accomplished with a new immersed-silicon echelle grating.
The novel design of the instrument provides the new capabilities at relatively
low cost in comparison with facility instruments at other observatories. The
spectrometer will be used with the telescopes of the Steward Observatory as well
as with the upgraded 6.5 meter Multiple Mirror Telescope. ***
