This project focuses on the equipment, training, and interpersonal skills
requirements of students preparing for high precision, highly automated
machining positions. The project is addressing these issues by retrofitting an
existing engine lathe with digital readouts and a Bridgeport mill to emulate
equipment found in small machine shops. Machinist students are acting as peer
trainers to high school students enrolled in similar programs. Students who
teach will truly learn their trade. In addition, the project is establishing a
website linking all high schools, BOCES, and interested industrial shops to the
college's site for the purpose of sharing information on projects, vendor
demonstration schedules, student mentoring activities, and job opportunities.
Students who are required to work in teams, and have some interaction with
industry, make a much smoother transition to the team-oriented work environment.
A coordinate measuring machine (CMM), SPC, and other digital readout devices are
being incorporated into the college's metrology course to better prepare
freshmen students for their summer co-op experiences and future work
environment. Engineering technology students are being provided with a metrology
course in which they can gain skills in SPC applications and concepts. Lastly,
existing machining and measuring facilities are being brought up to the
standards demanded by industry. *
