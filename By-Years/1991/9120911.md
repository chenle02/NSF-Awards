Research in human memory has shown that one's memory for an event is a
structured collection of different kinds of information. For example, if we meet
someone at a cocktail party, we might store visual information regarding the
person's appearance, phonemic and verbal information representing the person's
name and its spelling, semantic information and impressions, plus various kinds
of background context. This research will investigate the roles of different
kinds of information in recall and recognition. The research focuses on the
distinction between item-specific and associative information, a distinction
which has a long history in psychology, and is a cornerstone of current
mathematical models of memory. In 10 experiments (plus several variations),
people will study lists of words; the kinds of materials and the encoding
conditions will vary across experiments. Following list presentation, these
individuals will be tested using free and cued recall and item and associative
recognition testing procedures. These testing procedures vary in the kinds of
information and the kinds of retrieval processes which are necessary for
adequate performance. For example, recall and associative recognition depend
primarily on associations formed between words, whereas item recognition does
not. An important question in this research regards the role of nonnecessary
information. For example, associative information need not be retrieved in
making recognition decisions about individual words. What role does the
associative information play? Regarding retrieval processes, recall tasks
require the recovery and production of retrieved information, whereas
recognition testing does not. Comparisons among these test procedures and how
they are sensitive to manipulations in materials and study conditions will
provide important information concerning the representation and retrieval of
information from memory. Moreover, the results of these experiments will be
important in testing and developing current mathematical models of memory.
