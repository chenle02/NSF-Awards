The purpose of this grant is to provide support for the preparation of
background reports that will provide guidance on two research areas of growing
importance to the assessment and management of environmental risks. These
reports will contribute to an improved understanding of the role of risk
assessment in environmental decision making and will help to establish a future
research agenda that will encourage interaction among scientists involved in
risk assessment, public policy, and decision making. The two research areas are
closely linked, both by theory and by application. The first area is global
cumulative impacts, including impacts such as global warming, sea level rise,
and ozone layer depletion. The OEQ effort will provide a statement of scientific
principles to help focus attention on those environmental and health effects of
greatest concern and to assist in the development of appropriate mitigation
strategies. The second area is emerging technologies, which offer the promise of
various benefits to mankind including less environmentally invasive alternatives
to some existing technologies. The OEQ effort will provide guidance on the use
of techniques for assessing the health and environmental impacts associated with
these emerging technologies, under the premise that sensitivity to these
potential impacts is required at an early stage of technology development.
