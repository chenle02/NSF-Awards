This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professors Ziv Ran
and Mei-Chu Chang of the University of California at Riverside. Dr. Ran plans to
work on problems related to generalized linear systems and their applications,
higher Noether-Lefschetz loci, deformations of maps, and secants and projections
of projective varieties. Professor Chang plans to work on problems related to
the slope of moduli spaces of curves, and codimension-2 subvarieties of, and
vector bundles on, projective spaces. For the first year of this award, the
postdoctoral associate Dr. Angelo Lopez will continue his research on Noether-
Lefschetz theory and the Hilbert schemes of space curves. This is research in
the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in
Robotics.
