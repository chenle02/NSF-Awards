Formal Methods in Computer Aided Design (FMCAD) 2015 is the fifteenth in a
series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in
hardware and system verification. It provides a leading forum to researchers in
academia and industry for presenting and discussing ground-breaking methods,
technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about
computing systems. This grant will help support conference travel for up to 10
students enrolled in US institutions to attend FMCAD in Austin, Texas, September
27-30th 2015. The students will get the opportunity to present at the Student
Forum, which is a platform for graduate students at any career stage to
introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit
feedback.

Formal methods is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic
research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and
importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this
research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a
globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to
present at the Student Forum, learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed
to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of
expertise. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented
groups and from small universities without a formal methods program.
