The New Madrid region provides one of the best opportunities in eastern North
America to collect data that can help to resolve issues critical to seismic
hazard assessment. Since 1988, Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earthquake
Observatory has operated a network of strong ground motion stations in the New
Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ). The objective is to collect and disseminate seismic
data for use in earthquake hazard mitigation.

The array produces data for studying wave propagation, and for addressing the
issues relevant to the seismic hazard in the region. It also provides data
regarding significant engineering problems; especially site response and
attenuation.

This action is to supplement the existing USGS-supported stations with support
for additional instruments, together with the associated operation, maintenance
and communication costs. This will yield a 20-station configuration, with 8
stations accessible via telephone. It also includes partial support to unify the
data streams from both the NSF-supported and USGS-supported components of the
network.
