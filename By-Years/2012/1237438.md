This proposal is for travel support to approximately 25 U.S. participants to the
US-UK Joint Workshop on Arctic Research to be held at Clare College, University
of Cambridge, UK in 2012. The workshop will build on significant new investments
in arctic research made by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
through its Arctic Research Programme. The workshop will enable U.S.
investigators to discuss common areas of interest, potential collaborations, and
opportunities for sharing logistical resources with their UK colleagues.
Participants will be selected by a committee based upon their expected
contributions to the subject and their experience in relevant research themes,
disciplinary balance and geographical location. U.S. participants are
anticipated to be familiar with the goals of the Study of Environmental Arctic
Change SEARCH. SEARCH is in the process of developing an updated set of
scientific goals for the next five years, which currently include: improving
understanding and prediction of sea ice changes and the consequences for
ecosystems, human activities, and climate; understanding the consequences of the
loss of shallow permafrost on arctic and global systems; improving predictions
of future land?]ice loss and impacts on sea level; and analyzing societal and
policy implications of arctic environmental change. NERC is developing a program
focused on four linked scientific objectives, detailed in its science plan
(http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/arctic/documents/arctic-science-
plan.pdf): understanding and attributing the current rapid changes in the
Arctic; quantifying processes leading to Arctic methane and carbon dioxide
release; reducing uncertainty in Arctic climate and associated regional
biogeochemistry predictions; and assessing the likely risks of submarine hazards
associated with rapid Arctic climate change. This proposal will facilitate
international collaboration and furtherance of the two national initiatives to
study change in the Arctic.
