This award supports work on motives and algebraic cycles. One of the principal
investigators will work on motivic cohomology; a non-archimedean generalization
of the Riemann-Roch type theorem proved by Gillet and Soule; and a
generalization of Iwasawa theory to cycles and motives. The other principal
investigator will work on the existence of higher logarithms using families of
certain linear configurations over the Grassmannians, as well as explore the
relationship between the Grassmannian complex and the K-groups of the ground
field. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest
parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in
the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that could be
defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays,
the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and
topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in
theoretical computer science and robotics.
