This model project proposes to increase participation and retention of women in
computer science at Columbia Union College by two kinds of intervention:
participation and retention. Participation intervention involves two workshops,
one for colleges' female students who have not chosen a major and one for non-
enrolled high school graduates. The workshop will present career opportunities
available in computer science and discussion of career opportunities available
in computer science and discussion of barriers encountered by women and ways to
overcome them. Retention intervention will involve the use of health promotion
activities and stress reduction techniques to alleviate computer anxiety. Pre-
tests and post-tests will be used to assess the effectiveness of the
intervention strategies.//
