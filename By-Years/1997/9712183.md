ABSTRACT MATLOCK EEC-9712183 This award is for support for a two year phase out
period for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced
Steel Processing and Products at the Colorado School of Mines. The objectives of
the center are (1) performance of research of direct benefit to producers and
users of steel, (2) eduaation of graduate students by involvement in research
programs of theoretical and practical interest to the steel-producing and steel-
using industries, (3) enhancement of undergraduate education related to steel,
and (4) development of a national forum for steel producers, steel users,
government, and academe to stimulate advances in the science and technology of
the processing, quality, and application of steel. Efficient transfer of
technology is a major goal of the center, and it was among the top three centers
in the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Program last year in
technology transfer. More than 60 students have graduated with the M.S. or Ph.D
degrees resulting from Center support, and there are 23 graduate students
currently supported by the Center.
