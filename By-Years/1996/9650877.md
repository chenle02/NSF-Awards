Pasteurization is a cost-effective means of reducing bacterial populations in a
variety of materials and has been applied in the food industry, biotechnology,
and wastewater treatment. One of the major advances in pasteurization has been
the development of inline pasteurization units which enable industries to
continuously treat a liquid. With any procedure and its associated equipment,
responsible individuals must understand the process and be able to modify
procedures as conditions change. This ability to think through problems
associated with a process critically is difficult to teach without a hands-on
opportunity to use the equipment. The newly acquired equipment, a benchtop
pasteurizer with data logging capacity, duplicates industrial processes and
permits students to design and conduct experiments that address the complex
issues related to the pasteurization process. To accomplish this, students in
the Food, Dairy, and Industrial Microbiology course are assigned a problem to
solve that relates to pasteurization. The solution requires that the students
define the parameters to examine, conduct experiments on the pasteurizer to
evaluate possible solutions, assess the data collected, and determine the best
solution to their problem.
