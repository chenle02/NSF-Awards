This is a three-year project to conduct an observation and data analysis effort
centered on the incoherent scatter radar and optical facilities at the Arecibo
Observatory. The scientific focus of the proposed study is gravity waves in the
thermosphere over Arecibo, especially questions related to their detailed
characteristics and origin. A special radar technique based on Photo-Electron
Enhanced Plasma Waves (PEPW) as well as advanced analysis techniques developed
by the proposing team will be utilized. These provide electron density
measurements of unprecedented accuracy and allow for the identification of
gravity waves in the radar observations at all times, day and night. In addition
to collaboration with the radar staff at Arecibo, the proposal involves an
extensive collaboration providing auxiliary data from imagers, lidars, and other
instruments as well as widespread expertise on interpretation of these
observations. Undergraduate and graduate student research opportunities will be
provided as part of this proposal as well as other public outreach and
educational activities at the Arecibo Observatory.
