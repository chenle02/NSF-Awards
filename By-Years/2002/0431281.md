A fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is the study of the
&lt;br/&gt;nature of the moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g as an
&lt;br/&gt;algebraic variety. It is known that for low g this space behaves
&lt;br/&gt;very much like a projective space which means that one can
&lt;br/&gt;describe explicitly most curves of given genus. However for g
&lt;br/&gt;large the nature of M(g) changes completely and the investigator
&lt;br/&gt;studies this transition by constructing new loci in the moduli
&lt;br/&gt;space, which are of a completely different nature than those
&lt;br/&gt;studied by previous mathematicians. The geometry of these new
&lt;br/&gt;loci strongly suggests that the transition in the nature of
&lt;br/&gt;M(g) appears much earlier than the leading conjecture in the
&lt;br/&gt;field has predicted. The technical machinery developed by the
&lt;br/&gt;investigator to solve this problem is also employed to study
&lt;br/&gt;some open problems about vector bundles on general curves of
&lt;br/&gt;genus g. A different project concerns the moduli space of
&lt;br/&gt;pointed curves of genus 0. Obects of striking beauty, these
&lt;br/&gt;spaces are important because of their pivotal role in new
&lt;br/&gt;developments in enumerative geometry and because often
&lt;br/&gt;statements about curves of arbitrary genus can be reduced to
&lt;br/&gt;questions about pointed curves of genus 0. The investigator
&lt;br/&gt;studies several invariants of these spaces and the proposed
&lt;br/&gt;approach has been succesful in low dimensional cases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic curves are ubiquitous objects in mathematics.
They &lt;br/&gt;appear in complex analysis (as Riemann surfaces), in algebra
&lt;br/&gt;(as field extensions) and in algebraic geometry (as curves in
&lt;br/&gt;projective spaces). The most important problem in algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;geometry is to classify algebraic varieties. For one-dimensional
&lt;br/&gt;varieties (that is, for algebraic curves) this problem is
&lt;br/&gt;approached by considering the moduli space M(g) of all curves of
&lt;br/&gt;given genus. This is the universal parameter space for curves of
&lt;br/&gt;fixed genus and interest in its geometry comes from fields as
&lt;br/&gt;diverse as algebraic geometry, theoretical physics, number theory
&lt;br/&gt;or coding theory. By understanding this space not only can we
&lt;br/&gt;learn about families of curves but quite often the moduli space
&lt;br/&gt;itself has beautiful geometric and arithmetic properties which
&lt;br/&gt;one cannot expect to find on an arbitrary space. &lt;br/&gt;
