*** 9660223 Benassi This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
produce an instrument that will be useful in the research environment and , with
a more developed user interface, can be useful in many other research fields and
commercial applications. The research objectives are to determine the optimum
hardware architecture, the associated software algorithms, and the implements a
real-time imaging instrument. The research addresses: (a) the problem of low
signal to noise ratios in imaging systems, and (b) the need for real-time image
enhancement associated with electron microscopy and related fields. The latest
generation of microprocessor technology, specifically Digital Signal Processors
(DSPs), is now powerful enough to perform real-time image enhancement. An
existing SEM/TEM facility will be used to address these objectives. The proposed
technology has commercial applications in any field using video imaging for
analysis of presentation. The project is expected to result in the creation of a
research grade instrument for electron microscopy. Future commercial candidate
areas are radiology, flouroscopy, ultrasound, optical microscopy, scanning
tunneling and atomic force microscopy. ***
