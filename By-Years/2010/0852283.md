The International Chromosome Conference in Boone, North Carolina, is the 17th in
this series of triannual meetings, which have all previously been held in
Europe. In the past fifteen years, cytogeneticists have fully embraced the
molecular techniques that have been so useful in other areas of genetic
research. The primary objective of this upcoming meeting is to provide a forum
for researchers studying chromosome biology to present data, exchange ideas, and
initiate collaborations, both national and international. Another important
objective of the meeting is to provide students and postdoctoral fellows with
the opportunity to interact with other researchers as well as to present their
own research. Through its outreach programs, the North Carolina meeting will
both increase the awareness of science and genomic research among local high
school and college students, and spark these students' interest in careers in
scientific research. The meeting will continue the ICC's tradition of fostering
the intellectual exchange and growth in this field, while also providing
cytogeneticists in the United States with easier access to these
benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in the 45-year history of the
International Chromosome Conference series, the group will meet in North
America. This gives North American cytogeneticists the opportunity to have the
leaders in the field of chromosome research more easily available for
discussion, consultation, and collaboration, and will enhance the opportunities
for the United States scientific community in this important field.
