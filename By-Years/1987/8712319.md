The use of computers in modern chemistry departments is becoming more and more
essential for the support of meaningful research at the cutting edge of the
field. The acquisition of an upgraded departmental minicomputer for the
Chemistry Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst will be
supported by both the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the
Instrumentation for Materials Research Program. The acquisition will enhance the
following areas of chemistry: 1) Computational modeling of molecules with
unusual electronic and chemical properties. 2) Studies on the electronic
structure of hole-molecules and the electronic states of molecular defects in
condensed media. 3) Comparison of experimental and theoretical quadrupole
coupling data in molecules. 4) The dissociation dynamics of molecules on metal
surfaces.
