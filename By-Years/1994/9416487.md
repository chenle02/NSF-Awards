9416487 Wallace Current code provisions for structural walls with openings
result in substantial reinforcing requirements for both new construction and the
retrofit of existing construction. In the case of retrofit, the upgrade cost is
typically close to or exceeds the building replacement cost. Existing buildings
are commonly demolished and replaced with a building incorporating a potentially
less reliable lateral forced resisting system. The objective of this project is
to develop performance- based retrofit guidelines. A focused research project is
conducted to identify appropriate analysis and design methodologies for both new
and existing construction.The Northridge Earthquake provides an excellent
opportunity to study the performance of "older" reinforced concrete buildings
constructed with perforated shear walls. The primary effort of the research will
be to compare expected versus observed building performance and to assess
current retrofit strategies of buildings utilizing perforated reinforced
concrete (RC) shear walls for lateral load resistance. The results of the
research have the potential to significantly impact the development of design
guidelines for RC perforated shear walls. The project team for this research
project combines the talents of "research" and "practicing" engineers. This
collaborative effort will enable the project to encompass the broad spectrum of
design and retrofit issues associated with perforated shear walls necessary to
assess the current state-of-the-practice as well as future research needs. This
is a Northridge Earthquake project. ***
