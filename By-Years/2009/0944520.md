This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to enhance the
capability of an instrument for identifying and quantifying bio-molecules,
cells, microbes, and their interactions. The goal of the project is to
demonstrate the feasibility of a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor that,
for the first time, can operate in an extended wavelength domain, where
biological analytes are strongly differentiated by their absorption spectra and
consequential variation of refractive index. In comparison with current
commercial systems, this innovation, if successful, will provide enhanced
sensitivity and species selectivity. Large optical changes in biological
analytes will be observed as they bind reversibly to species-selective
biomolecular recognition elements attached to the sensor surface.

The broader/commercial impact of this project is to enrich and extend the proven
SPR biosensor technology by providing access to a new and important part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The SPR biosensor market is dominated systems that
operate entirely in the visible - near infrared spectral region with relatively
little spectral differentiation of chemical species. This project is intended to
result in a SPR Biosensor with significant improvements that will be of value in
life science, electro-analysis, drug discovery, food quality and safety,
environmental science, gas-and liquid-phase chemicals, forensics, defense, and
security. Of particular value will be its novel ability to delineate ultra-fast
kinetic interactions such as those from DNA sequencing, protein/protein
interaction, and ligand/receptor recognition. These improvements over currently
available chemical and biosensor technologies are expected to enable significant
expansion of the SPR biosensing market.
