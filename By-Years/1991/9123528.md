The PI proposes a one-year development program to design, construct and dock-
test a moored profiling instrument that will repeatedly profile a vertical water
column. This prototype will test the feasibility of a system designed to
continually profile to depths of 6000 meters and to obtain a time series
temperature, salinity and current velocity. Such a system would provide valuable
data at very low costs compared to the current shipboard data acquisition
systems. The system could also be deployed in remote locations that are seldom
traversed by oceanographic research vessels.
