This work uses geochemical techniques to study water from lakes in the Dry
Valleys of Antarctica to understand their origin and climactic change over the
last few thousand years. These lakes are unique in their age, stratification,
perennial ice cover, and location in closed basins. The consequence of these
factors is a high susceptibility to climate change, which their stratified
waters record in much the same way that sedimentary rocks record geologic
processes. This project will sample three lakes from varied settings. Water
samples will be analyzed for major ions, dissolved gases, stable isotopes, and
isotopes of helium, chlorine and iodine, each of which offers a unique
perspective on the water's source, age, and recent communication with the
atmosphere. Results will be coupled with information on lake levels, hypolimnia
formations, and ice cover occurrence to understand lake history and Holocene
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this work supports
graduate and undergraduate research, and development of an on-line site
describing lake chemistry and biology. The work also has application to
understanding the transport of brine in polar settings, which is relevant to
nuclear waste repositories. &lt;br/&gt;
