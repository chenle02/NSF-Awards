With this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Gruebele and his students will develop single
molecule absorption spectroscopy detected by a scanning tunneling microscope. In
this experiment, a laser beam excites a single molecule deposited on a
semiconductor or metal surface, and a nanometer-sized metal tip detects the
change of the molecular shape caused by the laser excitation. The laser
wavelength is then scanned to measure an absorption spectrum of the molecule,
while simultaneously visualizing the shape of the molecule's excited state. The
technique will also be used to study complex surfaces with defects, such as
conductive glasses. Absorption spectroscopy allows for the measurement and
visualization of molecules that do not fluoresce, and that cannot be detected by
single molecule fluorescence techniques. The broader goal of this research is to
understand how the excited states of large molecules used in molecular
electronics are tuned by defects and by a complex surface environment. The
carbon nanotubes, quantum dots and metallic glasses studied in this project have
applications ranging from displays to cell phone shells; however, much of the
fundamental physical chemistry needed to harness the properties of these
materials remains to be discovered. The undergraduate and graduate students
supported by this research project will acquire the knowledge and hands-on
skills needed to advance U.S. chemical technology and teaching in the area of
nanodevices.
