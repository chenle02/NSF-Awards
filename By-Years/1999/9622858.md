9622858 Chen The investigator will study various Boussinesq systems which
describe the two-way propagation of water waves in nonlinear, dispersive media.
Boussinesq systems with various approximate dissipative terms will also be
studied theoretically and numerically. Generally speaking, all the issues
studied for the famous KdV-equation, which describes waves traveling in one
direction, should be investigated. The major goal for this project is to decide
which system of equations and which dissipative mechanism is best suited for the
modeling of physical problems in fluid mechanics. The ideal system should at
least be mathematically sound, physically correct, have the least complexity,
and can be used to simulate a wide range of real water wave problems.
