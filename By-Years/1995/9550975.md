A project-focused laboratory curriculum in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry is
being developed to enhance the creation of an interesting and pragmatic
pedagogical interface between two traditional disciplines. In the search for
commonality, this hybridized approach to a problem also brings forth needed
relevance to the curriculum. It gives students the opportunity to work in teams;
to design their own unique procedures for synthesis, isolation, and
characterization of bioactive molecules; and to examine their reactivities and
activities. This approach enhances discourse and subsequent learning as well as
fosters mutual understanding. Exposure to modern techniques as well as state of
the art equipment certainly widens student horizons and improves the employment
prospects of those students who wish to stop at the B.S. level. In Organic
Chemistry, it presents a more cutting-edge technique to approximately 30 percent
of the sophomore class, each year, who will have the opportunity to indulge in
chemical and enzyme kinetics with state-of-the-art UV spectrophotometers and use
computational software to assess their results. In Biochemistry, students
utilize both low-pressure and high-performance liquid chromatography, as well as
spectroscopic studies, to focus their new structural perspective on the
isolation and biophysical characterization of enzymes, which are the target of
therapeutic agents and metabolic regulation.
