The investigator conducts and supervises research in graph theory with emphasis
on structural characterizations of various properties of graphs, and develops
efficient practical algorithms based on this research. The major areas of
interest are (i) Tutte's conjecture, Hadwiger's conjecture, and spatial
embeddings of graphs and applications, (ii) Pfaffian orientations of graphs,
(iii) Negami's planar cover conjecture, (iv) excluded minor theorems and tools
to prove them (splitter theorems), (v) a theory of reducibility for the double
cycle cover conjecture, and possible applications to the Four Color Theorem.

Graph theory is a relatively young field that has applications in
telecommunications, transportation, production, warehousing, storage allocation
and many other applied areas. It deals with problems that are discrete in
nature, such as how to optimally build a telephone network at the lowest
possible cost. The project studies structural aspects of graph theory from a
theoretical point of view, with the aim of converting theoretical results into
fast and efficient algorithms. An example of the investigator's prior result is
his solution (with Robertson and Seymour) of the `even directed cycle problem',
a computer science question that has been open for the last quarter of a
century, and has applications in mathematical physics, computer science and
economics.
