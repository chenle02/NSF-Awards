9419608 Winters This proposal from Catholic University requests partial support
to conduct a workshop that address strategic topics related to biomedical
engineering curriculum development. The purpose of the workshop is to enhance
the knowledge and capabilities of biomedical engineering faculty and to improve
the quality of the educational experience for undergraduate biomedical
engineering students. Engineering education is undergoing significant revamping,
and much of the curricula innovation that is occurring is tied to the area of
engineering design. This workshop will bring together biomedical engineering
faculty who teach courses involving biomedical engineering design, as well as
key outside experts in engineering design to share insights and experiences with
the participants. The second objective of the workshop is to use it as a
mechanism to create a BME Undergraduate Design Resource Guide. Participants to
the workshop will provide resource material, and the resulting guide will be
distributed to all participating institutions. ***
