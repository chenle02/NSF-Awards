This award adds three higher education connections to the MOREnet state network.
They are remote educational sites of Columbia College: Fort Leonard Wood, Rolla
and Saint Louis. Faculty and students at the sites benefit from access to the
resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition,
they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other campuses
in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
