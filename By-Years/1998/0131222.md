With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State
University will acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of
Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will facilitate research
in a number of areas: a) the synthesis of organic compounds, including large
porphyrin-based complexes; b) characterization of intermediates and products
involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosylated carotenoid myxoxanthophyll; c)
characterization of proteins that have undergone posttranslational
modifications; d) characterization of synthetic DNA binding polypeptides; and e)
proteomics study on extracellular enzymes that degrade phenolic comopounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-
of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining
accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with
extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore
become a standard technique in most DNA/protein core facilities. The ability to
obtain very accurate molecular weights of biomolecules is fundamental to all
biological and biomedical research and essential in a modern research and
training environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
