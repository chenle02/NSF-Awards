This award provides support for graduate student research focusing on research
in approximation theory under investigation by the principal investigator. The
principal investigator's research is supported by several other government
agencies. Work will center on problems of nonlinear approximation such as that
accomplished by wavelet compression, with applications to signal processing.
Particular emphasis will be placed on question of multivariate approximation
using both wavelets and rationalapproximation schemes. Other work concerns
applications to image restoration, neural networks and linear approximation to
shift-invariant spaces.
