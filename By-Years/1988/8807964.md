The integrity of genetic transfer in biological systems depends upon the
fidelity with which amino acids are transferred onto specific transfer RNA
(tRNA) molecules which are subsequently engaged in protein synthesis. This
coupling is carried out by means of a large heterogenous class of proteins
called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The twenty different amino acids each have
their own subfamily of tRNA molecules and their own synthetases as well. Even
though a great deal is known about the three-dimensional structure of tRNA,
there is still uncertainly concerning the manner in which the tRNA molecules
combine with such great specificity with their corresponding synthetases.*** The
goal of this project is to study the three-dimensional structure of RNA
molecules in various conformations, either alone or complexed to proteins. X-ray
diffraction analysis of crystals is the major technique being used. Dr. Rich
will undertake an examination of the manner in which the nucleotide sequence of
RNA plays a role in governing its three-dimensional conformation. He also plans
to investigate the nature of the interactions between proteins and RNA
molecules.***
