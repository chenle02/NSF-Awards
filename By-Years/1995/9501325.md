9501325 Stephens Recipients of this grant will investigate the relationship
between the structural and electrical properties of fullerene based compounds.
The sample preparation effort will be concentrated on conducting polymeric
fullerides of A-carbon-60 composition, where A is an alkali metal, and related
compounds. Materials obtained from collaborators will also be investigated.
X-ray diffraction and infrared optical spectroscopy will be performed in the
laboratory of the principal investigators at Stony Brook, and also at the
National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Direct
current electrical transport will be measured in Stony Brook. In addition to
being a potentially useful material in electronic and structural applications,
the carbon-60 molecule is also challenging for basic research, as it provides
systems in which the electron-phonon coupling (on the molecule) and the electron
transport (between the molecules) may be independently tuned. %%% Among the
myriad compounds synthesized from buckminster fullerene (the carbon-60
molecule), three groups have particularly interesting properties: the
superconductors, the organic ferromagnets, and the electrically conducting
polymers. The research team at Stony Brook has a proven track record in the
investigation of these materials, and continues to explore new compounds based
on this remarkable, highly symmetric molecule. The main focus of the research is
on the relationship between structural and electrical properties. The two most
extensively utilized experimental tools will be X-ray diffraction and optical
spectroscopy. This project will benefit greatly from the extensive use of
instrumentation and collaboration with scientists at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory. Research on fullerenes may lead to novel electronic and structural
materials. The effort funded here contributes significantly t o this broader
goal by utilizing the unique experimental capabilities available to the
investigators. ***
