This project, acquiring a high-performance computing (HPC) instrument, aims to
service the needs of a small liberal arts college in research and undergraduate
training. The instrument provides a powerful capability to 14 researchers and
approximately 80 undergraduates, and will specifically impact computer science,
biology, chemistry, economics, physics, and statistics, and enable
bioinformatics, genomics, image analysis, matrix operations, and simulations.
Saint Lawrence University has an active Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) grant where underrepresented students are
recruited to work on projects with senior and junior faculty. The institution
also has resources to recruit women and members of under-represented minorities
through S-STEM, Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), McNair Scholars,
and Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) initiatives. Aided
by the instrumentation, seminars will be offered on the R statistical software
package, and junior faculty will be mentored in HPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
instrumentation will be used in cross disciplinary and interdisciplinary
activities, including servicing and sharing with other universities (such as
Clarkson) for large scale parallelization. The cluster enables a new Data
Science major that will have access to run its
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
