The proposed study will explore factors that influence the adoption and use of
electronic networks by science and engineering faculty members in small
universities and colleges. The various factors that will be examined are
categorized as system factors, personal and professional factors, and
institutional factors. The results of the study will provide institutions of
higher education and science funding bodies with information on which to base
policy decisions regarding resource allocations and planning for electronic
networks.
