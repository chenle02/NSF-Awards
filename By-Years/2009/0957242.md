The Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) and Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP)
programs of the Division of Chemistry support Prof. Joel M. Harris of the
University of Utah to develop new approaches to characterizing the composition,
structure, and functioning of lipid vesicles and their bilayer membranes.
Optical trapping confocal Raman microscopy is being developed to probe the
composition and structure of individual lipid vesicles, with an aim to better
understand the relationship between the structure of the lipid bilayer and its
permeability. This in turn may provide control over molecular uptake and
release, which impact drug delivery and trace analysis applications.
Fluores¬cence microscopy tools are being developed to probe individual lipid
vesicles immobilized on glass surfaces, with an aim of assessing internal pH and
molecular transport rates, which can be detected as single-molecule events. The
work also seeks to devise means to measure the affiliation of small peptides
with supported lipid bilayers, and quantitative determina¬tion of membrane-bound
peptide populations and their kinetics of binding and
unbinding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide routes to new
understanding of the structure and functioning of lipid membranes and the
processes that affect them. These membranes are important components of living
cells, and their understanding is critical, for example, to the successful
development of membrane-active pharmaceutical products. The research provides
multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in
spectro¬scopy, microscopy, colloid science, and biological chemistry. The
project impacts K-12 education and public awareness through involvement in
classrooms, contributions to a new science center serving the metropolitan Salt
Lake City area, and new touring exhibits that are transported to rural districts
of the State of Utah.
