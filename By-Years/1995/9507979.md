IBN-9507979 Nordeen, Ernest J. Understanding how the production, specification
and survival of nerve cells are regulated to generate variation in neuron number
is an important goal of developmental neurobiology. In many instances, these
processes are influenced by steroid hormones such as estrogen, which act on the
developing nervous system to regulate neuron number and growth within specific
brain regions. This proposal concerns the biological mechanisms and cellular
populations through which these hormones exert control over brain cell number.
Several proposed studies will test the hypothesis that hormones prevent cell
death to influence neuron number within specific brain regions. Other studies
are aimed at identifying the cell populations actually mediating these
neurotrophic effects of steroids. More specifically, experiments will test the
notion that some neurons transiently express estrogen receptors during their
migration, and depend on this hormone for their survival during this period. In
addition, the work will address how glia contribute to the neurotrophic effects
of steroid hormones during development. The long term aim of these studies is to
use the hormonal regulation of neuron growth and survival as a tool with which
to explore the underlying cellular and molecular changes influencing a neuron's
decision to live or die. In so doing, a greater understanding of the factors
contributing to neuron death during development and in disease will be attained.
