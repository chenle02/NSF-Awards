Project continues work in determining the large scale structure of this earth.
Project develops theoretical approximations to the problem of modelling an
aspherical earth, applies these approximations to large data sets to recover
models of aspherical structure, and computes high accuracy synthetic seismograms
for these models to establish their ability to predict the data. Benefits
include improved understanding of the large earth structure, improved analytical
techniques.
