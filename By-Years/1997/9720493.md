The separation of gases by adsorption processes is a primary tool used by U.S.
chemical companies to produce large quantities of high purity gases for
industrial use. In this work, the PI, Dr. Robertson, will develop a microreactor
technologies. The microseparation column will be fabricated using silicon
micromachining techniques, and will subsequently be filled with a zeolite
adsorbent. The PI will engage in a collaborative research endeavor at her home
institution, Lafayette College and at Lehigh University. Funding provided will
impact students at Lafayette, exposing undergraduates to the challenges of
state-of-the- art engineering research endeavors. This funding is also expected
to provide Dr. Robertson with opportunity to forge a long-lasting research
relationship with Lehigh University, thereby allowing her to establish a
significant integrated research and education program.
