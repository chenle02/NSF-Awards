This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, is to define reaction mechanisms through
laboratory experimentation and mathematical modeling, and thereby determine the
contributions that gas phase and surface reactions can make in controlling
thickness and uniformity in low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD)
processes. The LPCVD process has the capability to deposit films of good
thickness uniformity. This feature makes LPCVD a most attractive process to be
used in step coverage for integrated circuit applications. The transport
phenomena effect on deposition rates (thickness) and uniformity can be
determined if the reaction kinetic effects are better established.
