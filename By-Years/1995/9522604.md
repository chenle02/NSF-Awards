With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Morton of the Univ. of
Cal. Riverside will investigate the mechanistic dynamics of gas phase organic
ion reactions. In this endeavor theory will be compared to the results and
classical reaction mechanisms. Specifically, the structures of perfluorinated
cations, the nature of vinyl cations, the mode of decomposition of t-butyl
ethers, isotope scrambling of primary alkyl phenyl ethers, hydride shift vs
oxygen bridging in ethanol and it derivatives and the electrophilic attack of
double bonds by protonated acetaldehyde will be examined. The nature of these
investigations, if successful, should provide new insights into very fundamental
organic processes. Reactions occurring in the gas phase have both a fundamental
and a practical value. The fundamental value results from the fact that the
reactants are unencumbered by solvent. Thus intrinsic data on a given process
can be obtained. The practical value in this case results from the fact that
these types of reactions occur in the atmosphere. Thus, our understanding of
such pathways provide a platform for understanding a variety of pollution
problems. This proposal addresses both of these concepts.
