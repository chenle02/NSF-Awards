Invertebrates represent the largest animal biomass on earth and from an
economic point of view their study is of great importance. During the past three
decades there has occurred a serious national decline in the quality and extent
of student training in invertebrate zoology. This decline in training has
resulted in several generations of undergraduate and graduate students in the
biological sciences with a drastically reduced awareness of the biological
diversity in which their scientific work is embedded. In conjunction, the
biological research community is losing the awareness of the diversity of
organisms which could be developed into models systems for the solution of
urgent research problems. A task group of eminent biological scientists, under
the direction of Dr. Willows, will convene to discuss the deteriorating state of
invertebrate teaching in American universities at the undergraduate level. This
committee is charged with suggesting how institutions of higher learning, state
and federal governments, can cooperate with the private sector to reverse this
serious trend in American education. The committee's recommendations and
prioritized actions could significantly enhance training opportunities in
invertebrate zoology.
