It is necessary to evaluate new laser materials with increased wall plug
efficiency. Currently semiconductor laser arrays hold the potential to be
effective optical pumping sources. In order to utilize the semiconductor arrays
effectively it is necessary to have laser materials with longer upper level
laser lifetime than the commonly used Nd:YAG laser. This work will study the
feasibility for the growth of ND:lanthanum fluoride crystals using the heat
exchanger method. These crystals have shown a lifetime of 670 microseconds and
interesting high temperature laser properties. Emphasis will be placed on
minimizing the contamination from the oxide and hydroxyl ions which is known to
degrade the optical quality of these crystals. The grown crystals will be
characterized for optical quality and laser performance.
