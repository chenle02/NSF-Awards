Professor Fortson and his research group are engaged in the search for the
electric dipole moment of the electron. According to standard theory, the
electron is a structureless point particle with unit negative charge and
therefore must have a zero electric dipole moment. However very precise, very
sensitive searches for a nonzero measurement are important because a nonzero
dipole moment would imply that parity-time reversal symmetry is violated in
nature. In his latest results Professor Fortson sees a suggestion of a possible
nonzero result just at the limits of his instrumental detection sensitivity.
This new grant would permit him to improve his sensitivity sufficiently to
declare with certainty whether or not the electric dipole moment of the electron
has been found.
