9614387 Hinzman Developing a generalized understanding of arctic climatic
dynamics requires a circumpolar comparison of processes and validation of
regional models in other areas. We propose to investigate current hydrologic and
thermal processes occurring in the Siberian Arctic and compare their dynamics to
watersheds we have studied in the Alaskan Arctic. Our approach will be to
synthesize hydrologic and meteorologic data collected by Japanese and Russian
scientists in two nested watersheds near Tiksi, Russia and apply our spatially
distributed coupled model to those watersheds. Spatially distributed hydrologic
models require spatially distributed calibration and verification data.
Collection of this data will be accomplished through utilization of Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Field ground truth will be collected by us to
develop and verify SAR imagery neural network training data sets. This research
will identify the applicability of utilizing SAR imagery for use in
developmental and operational hydrologic models in the Russian Arctic. It will
allow us to test and improve the capability of our hydrologic and thermal model
in simulating current physical processes and consequently improve the model's
forecasting capability. This research will also improve our understanding of the
global hydrologic cycle by improving our understanding of the physical processes
occurring in the Siberian Arctic, their variability and their interactions.
Finally, this research will enable a comparative analysis of hydrologic and
thermal processes between latitudinally equivalent sites, and also a comparison
of our ability to correctly simulate these processes. This research will also
enable an international meld of the GEXEX/GAME and ARCSS/LAII research programs
and an international collaboration of Russian, Japanese and American
investigators joining forces to share expertise and improve our understanding of
processes of inter-continental dimension.
