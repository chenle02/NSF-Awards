Wireless technology is gaining popularity very rapidly. Many predict a new
emerging market where millions of mobile users will carry small, hand-
heldterminals, capable of communicating over a wireless connection. Mobile users
will mostly need location dependent information such as local yellow pages,
traffic reports, shopping information, local directions, etc. Mobility,
bandwidth and energy limitations are the main new factors which have to be taken
under consideration in the design of wireless information services. Three basic
modes of wireless information dissemination are defined: (1) publishing, (2)
delta publishing, and (3) on demand. The publishing mode is the most energy
efficient scheme as it does not require the clients to submit uplink requests to
the Mobile Support Station (MSS) but just listen to the downlink stream of data
periodically broadcast by the MSS on its downlink channel. However, data which
is published has to be very carefully organized and multiplexed with the
directory information. Tradeoffs between different dissemination modes are
investigated, with the goal of developi ng energy efficient access methods from
battery powered clients. Different caching strategies in the context of frequent
client disconnections are also investigated. Finally, the implementation of the
above methods in the form of prototypical wireless information server (kiosk) is
provided.
