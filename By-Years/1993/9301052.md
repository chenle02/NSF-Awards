This project will study a diverse set of questions in games theory: a) Do Nash
equilibria exist for single controller and switching controller games in
arbitrary state spaces? b) Do ARAT games and switching control games admit
stationary Nash equilibrium for undiscounted games? c) Characterize multi-choice
nucleolus by suitably defining Sobolev's reduced subgames; d) Find an efficient
algorithm to solve for the nucleolus of flow games, linearly constrained games,
and homogeneous games. %%% Methods, techniques and ideas of games theory have
applications to economics, operations research, queuing theory, and control
theory.
