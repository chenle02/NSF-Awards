0118033 Swift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on understanding the
interactions of the Arctic Ocean outflow waters and Nordic Sea waters as they
create the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and the Iceland-Scotland
Overflow water (ISOW) on the one hand and the Arctic Ocean influenced layers in
the Nordic Seas on the other. Specific goals include: (1) determining the
sources and pathways of fresh water out of the Arctic Ocean and studying the
processes modifying downstream water masses; (2) determining the sources and
characteristics of intermediate and deep waters of Arctic origin and their
subsequent modification as they are exported in the Nordic Seas and North
Atlantic Ocean; and (3) determining the pathways of Atlantic water through the
Nordic Seas and into the Arctic Ocean and how it transforms Nordic Seas water
masses. This new synoptic survey of the Nordic Seas will provide a baseline
observation to understand the links between the various ocean basins in the
region. This project is collaborative with Swedish scientists and is a
contribution to the Climate variability and predictability program
(CLIVAR).&lt;br/&gt;
