ABSTRACT 9513102 Dowding The objective of this REU Site at Northwestern
University is to attract students to research careers on materials of interest
to civil engineering, to train students in the use of interdisciplinary research
teams, and to provide a model for and produce baseline data for implementation
of interdisciplinary team research programs for undergraduates that are
applicable for other fields of study, i.e., polymers, electronic materials,
environmental, biological sciences, etc. Plans are to recruit students from all
engineering disciplines and mathematics, chemistry and physics majors also.
Student activities will include attending an intensive course of study in
interdisciplinary research, conducting individual research, participating in
interdisciplinary research group meetings, regularly interacting with a faculty
advisor, writing a publication quality research paper and giving an oral report.
