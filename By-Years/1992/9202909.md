In this project, the PI will exploit available ship time on the German research
vessel, FS POLARSTERN, to study wintertime convection and transport in the
southeastern Atlantic Ocean, with focus on the Falkland Current, the poleward
extension and anticyclonic return of the Brazil current, and two major fronts of
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during the Austral winter of 1992.
Conductivity, Temperature vs Depth (CTD), oxygen, and nutrient measurements will
be made. Eight surface drifters will also be deployed to obtain absolute
Lagrangian current data for comparison with the hydrographic measurements.
