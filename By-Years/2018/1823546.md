While the general public typically focuses on processor clock speed as a measure
of microprocessor performance, it is often the memory system that limits overall
system performance, particularly for today's data-hungry uses of computing. This
project explores a transformative approach to designing computer hardware,
particularly the memory system: Rather than rely solely on human insight and
intuition, this approach adapts and leverages machine learning techniques to
explore larger and richer design spaces in a more thorough and systematic
manner. This approach enables hardware designers to consider more complex design
factors than are currently possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists
of two phases. The first phase seeks to dramatically improve traditional memory
system components, such as cache replacement policies and data prefetchers,
which have been heavily studied but are now ripe for innovation with the use of
machine learning. The second phase considers complicating factors such as
criticality, the interaction among these components, and the use of new memory
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
