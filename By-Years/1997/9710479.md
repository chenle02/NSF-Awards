The focus of this research is the preparation of beta-lactams which will have
the potential to act as serine protease inhibitors. The synthetic schemes will
accommodate an incremental exploration of binding interactions between the
inhibitors and the enzyme. The program stresses the involvement of undergraduate
students. With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. William P.
Malachowski of the Department of Life Sciences at the University of New England.
Dr. Malachowski will focus his work on developing syntheses of beta-lactams
which will be capable of trapping the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of serine
proteases. The compounds have potential use for the pharmaceutical industry. The
project offers a rich training ground for undergraduate participants.
