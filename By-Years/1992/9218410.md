This supplemental award funds the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Polymers (CUMIRP) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for
two years to support a sabbatical by Dr. Sheila Browne, Chemistry Department
Chair, Mt. Holyoke College. This sabbatical will be to perform a research
project at (CUMIRP). Dr. Browne will be conducting research on the enzymatic
processes involved in polymer formation in the granules of bacteria, in
collaboration with Dr. Robert W. Lenz and attending graduate polymer courses.
Dr. Browne plans to teach a polymer course at Mt. Holyoke College which will be
based on the material that she learns while on sabbatical at the University of
Massachusetts. This course will become a regular advanced course in the
Chemistry Department at Mt. Holyoke for chemistry majors. In addition, Dr.
Browne, who is part Cherokee Indian, will make a number of trips to visit
Cherokee tribes in North Carolina and Oklahoma to establish a program to recruit
American Indians into science and hopefully into chemistry. The Program Director
recommends that the University of Massachusetts, Amherst be awarded $64,000 for
two years for support of sabbatical for Dr. Sheila Browne.
