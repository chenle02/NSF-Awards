9315051 Cherniak This research planning grant requests support to investigate
silicon self-diffusion in minerals, with initial concentration on the study of
feldspar. Silicon diffusion will be measured directly with the use of a 30Si
tracer and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) for depth profiling of
the tracer distribution. Results from the experiments can be applied in better
understanding of Al-Si ordering, CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion, and chemical
diffusion involving elements of geochemical and geochronologic interest.
