Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) is an HBCU with the mission, degree
structure, much of the staff, and much of the equipment necessary to become
America's leading producer of high quality African-American physical scientists.
Its major problem is finding the appropriate facilities for the research work
now under way and soon to be added and for a significantly increased number of
graduate students. The award directly attacks that problem of allowing AAMU,
with matching funds from the State of Alabama, to convert two under- utilized 60
year old buildings into an attractive, modern research facility, and graduate
student facility aimed toward high quality work in quantum optics. AAMU is an
NSF success story. The MRCE activity begun here 4 years ago set the stage for
the hiring of top level physicists responsible for this project and the
acceptance by the University President of the dramatic research goals. The
quantum optics research to be housed in the renovated facility includes Quantum
Computing/Quantum Holography, Ion Beam Modification of Surfaces, and Quantum
Confined Structures. This renovation project should greatly improve the research
environment to attract more minorities into this area of science.
