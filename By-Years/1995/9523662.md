EEC-9523662 Shoureshi This award provides funding for a multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energy and Power Systems
between Purdue University and Colorado School of Mines with Wichita State
University as an EPSCoR affiliate. This multi-university operation will conduct
research to address problems associated with several types of industries:
electric utility, heavy electric power consuming industries, electric component
industries, and environment condition control industries. Therefore, a wide
spectrum of projects will be conducted in the following areas: 1) control system
for energy efficiency, optimal power generation, transmission, distribution, and
utilization; 2) modeling and simulation for nonlinear time varying events,
intelligent monitoring, and diagnostics; and 3) system management study to
improve the energy efficiency for electric components, equipment, and
facilities. Research activities will be coordinated between Purdue University,
Colorado School of Mines, and Wichita State University (as an EPSCoR sponsored
affiliate).
