A liquid scintillation counter will be purchased to enable undergraduates to
learn techniques utilizing radioisotopes. The equipment will be used for
demonstrations in lower division courses, and will be available for hands-on
experiments in the upper division courses such as Techniques in Experimental
Molecular Biology, Genetics, Cell Culture, and Experimental Endocrinology. It
will be utilized in laboratory exercises involving such topics as uptake by
cells in culture, radioimmunoassays, membrane permeability, pulse chase
experiments, and t-RNA experiments. It will also be used by students doing
independent research projects. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
