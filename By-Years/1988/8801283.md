This work concerns the intercalation or "pillaring" of layered compounds with
inorganic polymeric species. The proposed research will extend present knowledge
to a number of new systems in which lattice charge, pillar charge and size,
layer thickness, acidity, and other factors will be varied systematically so as
to uncover fundamental principles.
