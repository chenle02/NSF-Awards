The 1 st International Symposium on Nanotechnology in Construction will deal
with both&lt;br/&gt;nanomaterials and nanosensors for concrete construction,
which will be beneficial to the&lt;br/&gt;current research. Developments in
nanotechnology have already enabled better&lt;br/&gt;characterization of fiber-
reinforced cementitious composites with the use of fiber push-&lt;br/&gt;out
tests to determine fiber-matrix bond strength, an important factor in the
overall&lt;br/&gt;performance of such composites. The use of nanosensors in
concrete panels and other&lt;br/&gt;concrete construction, would increase the
understanding of hydration and damage&lt;br/&gt;evolution. In a research
setting, nanosensors could be used to detect crack initiation
in&lt;br/&gt;specimens under loading or to monitor the setting of concrete by
detecting the&lt;br/&gt;development of hydration products. The incorporation of
nanosensors in concrete panels&lt;br/&gt;would allow for real-time monitoring of
the structure, providing information on durability&lt;br/&gt;and early damage
detection. The application of nanotechnology to concrete
construction&lt;br/&gt;is still extremely new. Attendance at the 1 st
International Symposium on&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology in Construction will allow
the researchers to participate in an important&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas and
learn how best to apply these new ideas in developing their&lt;br/&gt;concrete
panels.&lt;br/&gt;
