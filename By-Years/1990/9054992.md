Michigan State University will initiate a seven-week, residential Young
Scholars project in various subdisciplines of the Life and Agricultural Sciences
for 28 high-ability students entering grades 11,12 from across the Nation.
Participants will engage in independent research under the guidance of a faculty
mentor and will be required to keep a daily log of laboratory-related
activities, give an oral presentation and write a scientific report of this
research at the end of the summer's activities. Students also will participate
in seminars, discussions and debates about issues of importance to their
particular area of research and to the broader scientific enterprise and will
have opportunities to investigate career opportunities in the sciences.
