This award is for a three year project with Dr. W. Wiebe. Both investigators
are at the Institute of Ecology and Zoology at the University of Georgia. The
studies address the hypothesis that bacterial production is temperature limited
in high latitude ocean areas and this limitation allows a larger fraction of the
surface production to reach the benthos. Such an hypothesis would help to
explain the productive bottom fisheries often found in high latitude waters.
This work also will examine the possible mechanisms responsible for the
hypothesized temperature effect.
