Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0113016&lt;br/&gt;P. Neogi, University of Missouri-
Rolla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-assembly of nanoparticles in 2-D and
3-D structures continues to receive considerable attention due to the
potentially unique optical and electronic properties that can be achieved. The
proposed work is on a variety of experimental and computational simulation
methods to study the rate of surface diffusion and formation of the 2-D gold
nanoparticles. The thin layer will first be formed with a droplet, and later in
the project with a spin-coater for this study. A number of techniques, such as
small angle neutron scattering, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light
scattering, and quasi-elastic light scattering are proposed for this study. The
computational simulations based on molecular dynamic simulations for single and
two-particle interaction followed by large scale Brownian Dynamic simulations
are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;
