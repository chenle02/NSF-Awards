Previous magnetostratigraphic work has (1) located the upper and lower
boundaries of the Olduvai magnetic Chron in lake sediments from Southern Death
Valley, (2) found similar boundaries of what is probably the Jaramillo Chron in
ancient lake Manix near Barstow in the Mojave desert, and (3) located what may
be the Mammoth and Kaena events in the Pico formation of the Ventura Basin. The
PI will sample these reversal horizons in high resolution to determine their
temporal, chemical,a nd geomagnetic characteristics. High-fidelity records of
the field are present, apparently including secular variations and geomagnetic
reversals.
