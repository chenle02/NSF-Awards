This project supports a CAREER program at the University of Illinois at Chicago
(UIC) to search for signatures of dark matter produced by possible new
fundamental interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using the
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment. A key signature of a massive dark matter
particle is that it escapes the detector without a trace, causing an apparent
large transverse momentum imbalance. The unique contribution of this project is
a generic, inclusive search for highly boosted hadronically decaying particles
in events with large missing transverse momentum, giving rise to "funny-looking"
jets, be they heavy boosted particles (top's, W's, Z's) or light color-singlet
boosted particles (axion-like particles), emitted in the cascade decay chains of
possible new heavy, pair-produced colored particles. This plan has the potential
to shed light on the origin of dark matter and could break new ground in the
search for new phenomena at the LHC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
are directed toward high schools in Chicago area, which use an active discovery
format of teaching developed at the University of Arizona, known as "Modeling
Physics", as well as inner city Chicago schools not using the "Modeling Physics"
method. Together with the UIC College of Education's certification program in
secondary science education, lesson plans will be developed within the "Modeling
Physics" methodology that enable high school teachers to incorporate some of the
latest and most exciting scientific developments of particle physics coming from
the LHC into their classrooms.
