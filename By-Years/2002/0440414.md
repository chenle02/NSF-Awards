This award supports a project to obtain stable isotope profiles from shallow
(&lt;100 m) ice cores from East Antarctica, to add to the growing database of
environmental proxy data collected under the auspices of the "ITASE"
(International TransAntarctic Scientific Expedition) program. In Antarctica, the
instrumental record of climate is particularly short (~40 years except in a few
isolated locations on the coast), and ice core proxy data are the only means
available for extending this record into the past. The use of stable isotopes of
water (18-O/16-O and D/H ratios) from ice cores as proxies for temperature is
well established for both very short (i.e. seasonal) and long timescales
(centuries, millennia). Using multivariate regression methods and shallow ice
cores from West Antarctica, a reconstruction of Antarctic climate over the last
~150 years has been developed which suggests the continent has been warming, on
average, at a rate of ~0.2 K/century. Further improving these reconstructions is
the chief motivation for further extending the US ITASE project. Ten to fifteen
shallow (~ 100 m) from Victoria Land, East Antarctica will be obtained and
analyzed. The core will be collected along a traverse route beginning at Taylor
Dome and ending at the South Pole. Age-depth relationships for the cores will be
determined through a combination of stable isotopes, visual stratigraphy and
seasonal chemical signatures and marker horizons. Reconstructions of Antarctic
climate obtained from these cores will be incorporated into the global network
of paleoclimate information, which has been important in science, policy and
educational contexts. The project will include graduate student and postdoctoral
training and field experience.
