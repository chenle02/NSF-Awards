9414696 Taya The research will explore the use of TiNi shape memory alloy
fibers and reinforcements in aluminum and epoxy matrix composites. The use of a
shape memory alloy for a fiber reinforcement can result in the production of
compressive residual stresses in the matrix phase of the composite. This can
result in increases in flow stress and toughness of the composite as compared to
these properties in the same composites when the TiNi was not treated to produce
a shape memory effect in the composite. The induced compressive stress in the
matrix as a result of the shape memory alloy treatment of TiNi is responsible
for the enhancement of the tensile properties and toughness of the composite.
The concept of enhancing the mechanical properties of composites by inducing
desirable stress states via shape memory reinforcements is innovative and the
research is well worth support. ***
