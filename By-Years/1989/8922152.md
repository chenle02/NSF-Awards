With this grant, Dr. Abir-Am is completing data collection for her ongoing study
of the role of research schools in the rise of molecular biology, 1930-1970. She
aims to clarify the historical and social processes enabling and constraining
transdisciplinary collaboration, innovation and policy in 20th century science.
The project revolves around systematic comparisons of four research schools, two
in the United States and one each in England and France. Among other things, Dr.
Abir-Am is examining the research programs, including both long term theoretical
visions and short term empirical strategies. These research programs constitute
the sources of conceptual coherence in research schools and of their capacity
for adaptation to changes in the disciplinary ecology at large. Comparisons of
schools that shared goals but differed in their methodological strategy reveal
relations of competition; while comparisons of schools that shared
methodological tools but differed in their conceptual goals reveal relations of
complementary cooperation. She is also examining the social networks,
institutional networks, and policy programs of these research schools. These
studies should clarify the interaction within and across research schools, the
historiography of molecular biology as a gradual or revolutionary event, and the
role of science policy in the development of new disciplines.
