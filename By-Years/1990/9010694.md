This is a one-year collaborative research project sponsored by the AIT-CCNAA
Cooperative Science Program between Dr. Donald Reed, University of California at
Santa Cruz and Professor Liu Char-Shine, National Taiwan University. This
project is part of a large international effort to understand arc-continent
collision and plans to conduct marine geographical studies on the Taiwan
collision Zone. The offshore region of Taiwan is one of the best areas in the
world to study the incipient processes of arc-continent collision. The work
proposed here can lead to major improvements in our understanding of the
structural and sedimentological evolution of arc-continent collision zone. This
project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.

undergraduates in science and engineering research as an important management
tool for encouraging young people to pursue careers in research and development.
This supplemental support for "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" at the
University of Tennessee will involve two students in an ongoing U.S.-Hungary
cooperative research project in nuclear engineering.
