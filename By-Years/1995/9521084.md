Abstract Sivashinsky CTS-9521084 Extension of research being currently carried
out by the PI for NSF in the area of hydrodynamics of flame propagation is
proposed. The objectives of the proposed work are twofold viz. to investigate
the interaction of local flame front dynamics with non-local hydrodynamic
effects, and to investigate the self-fractalization and self-fragmentation
phenomena in intrinsically unstable flames. New Models will be formulated in
which the influence of hydrodynamic and emission factors on speed, shape and
stability will be examined. The PI has identified several specific topics
relevant to these objectives which include: (1) the study of hydrodynamic
instability involving downstream vorticity effects which should provide
information on flame wrinkling and therefore, flame speed, (2) the study of
pattern formation through cracks in which the structure and dynamics of a
solitary crack will be investigated in order to determine its shape, propagation
speed and stability, and (3) the study of self-fragmentation in near-limit low
Lewis number diffusively unstable flames. Attempts will be made to reduce the
complexity of these topics to simple approximate problems tractable either
analytically or numerically by the use of asymptotic and perturbation
techniques.
