This award supports travel of U.S. participants to a U.S.-France workshop on
signaling by Notch-related receptors and their biological role, to take place in
Strasbourg, France, May 1997. The co-organizers are Judith Kimble of the
University of Wisconsin and Pat Simpson of the Laboratoire de Genetique
Moleculaire des Eucaryotes, the French National Center for Scientific Research,
Strasbourg, France. The objective of the workshop is to stimulate ideas and
collaborations for future research. They will discuss the biochemical mechanism
of signal transduction by LNG receptors and the cellular and developmental roles
of this pathway. Notch-related receptors regulate many cell interactions that
control cell fate during the development of multicellular organisms. The
workshop brings together researchers working on these receptors in a broad
spectrum of organisms.
