This project is working to advance the state of the art in the design of storage
systems for large-scale websites like Facebook, Uber, and Google that are an
integral part of our lives. The project aims to benefit society by making such
websites faster, easier to program, and less expensive to build. It will produce
research papers that guide industrial efforts and future researchers. It will
also produce and release working prototypes of new storage designs that
industrial practitioners and other researchers can build off of or compare
against. The project will advance discovery and broaden participation by
involving undergraduates from the University of Southern California and
institutions that serve under-represented groups in research experiences,
training graduate students, developing curriculum that integrates teaching and
research, and by conducting outreach to K-12 students at schools that serve
under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
understand the fundamental tradeoffs between power and performance. The scope of
power properties includes consistency models and transactions. The scope of
performance properties includes latency, throughput, and their combination. To
understand what is not possible we will formulate, conjecture, and attempt to
prove impossibility results. To demonstrate what is possible we will design new
systems that touch the boundary of our impossibility results. We will implement
our designs and publish the implementations publicly. We will evaluate our
implementation at large scale to validate they provide the claimed properties
and to quantify their benefits and overheads.
