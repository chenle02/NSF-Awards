This project investigates algorithmic techniques for optimization, with an
emphasis on problems related to graphs. The goal is faster and more space-
efficient algorithms. A special focus is the use of semidefinite programming for
modelling graph optimization problems. A new approach to approximately solving
semidefinite programming problems is being pursued. Using the work on
semidefinite programming as a guide, the project studies improving the
efficiency of a broad class of approximation algorithms for optimization.
