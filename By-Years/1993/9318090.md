9318090 Ward The Arizona Research Laboratories Biotechnology Computing Facility
at the University of Arizona will purchase a Digital Equipment Corporation
Dec3000/500 (ALPHA) computer and associated peripherals. The computer will be
dedicated to biotechnology research projects, primarily DNA and protein sequence
analysis at the University of Arizona. In order to provide maximum connectivity
to, and use of, the machine, we will also purchase two Digital Equipment
Corporation 90TL terminal servers, and eight high speed U. S. robotics modems.
The Biotechnology Computing Facility is an multidisciplinary facility that
supports more than 300 biotechnology computer users representing over 30
departments from 4 colleges. The specific research that would benefit from the
increased computer speed are: 1) analysis of genes involved in cellular
morphogenesis and differentiation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elgans; 2) the
identification and analysis of proteins of the actin cytoskeleton; 3)
identification and analysis of insect proteins involved in metabolite transport
and uptake and endocrinology; 4) insect protein, lipid, and structure/function
studies; 5) the genetic study of the olfactory system of Xenopus laevis; and 6)
software development of fast sequencing algorithms. The computer that currently
supports most of the DNA and Protein sequencing at the University of Arizona is
a Vax 3100/76. The Dec3000/500 has much faster computing speeds than the present
3100VAX system. The increase in computational speed from the 3100/76 6.6
SPECmarks to VAX 3100/76 118 SPECmarks will increase the efficiency and open
more computing options, both for the research projects described and for
students in laboratories and classes. Some of these options are not practical at
the speeds of our present computer. ***
