Most economists agree that the decline in the savings rate in the United States
over the past two decades is a cause for concern. But there is conflicting
evidence as to the reasons U.S. saving are so low. Much of this evidence is
based on models of savings under perfect certainty because realistic
intertemporal models of saving under uncertainty are intractable. The
contribution of this project comes from developing software for vector
calculations on a supercomputer that meet the substantial computing and
programming requirements of an intertemporal model of consumption and labor
supply with overlapping sources of uncertainty and a realistically large number
of periods in the model. Numerical methods will be used to estimate the
magnitude of precautionary saving, that is, saving caused by uncertainty about
future events. The magnitude of precautionary saving depends in an important way
on the extent that existing private and public insurance programs reduce
individual uncertainty. Existing and potential future government insurance
programs, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Medicare,
and catastrophic health insurance, create highly nonlinear or kinked budget
constraints which are impossible to model in the standard analytic framework.
The numerical solution techniques developed by this project will permit the
effects of these nonlinear insurance and tax programs to be measured accurately.
