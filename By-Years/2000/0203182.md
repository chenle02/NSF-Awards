Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0203182&lt;br/&gt;A. Ellis, University of Wisconsin-
Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is for travel support for
the speakers at the EC-NSF workshop on "Nanotechnology - Revolutionary
Opportunities and Societal Implications" to be held in Lecce, Italy on January
31-February 1, 2002. The workshop will involve approximately 16 U.S. speakers
and poster presenters and about the same number from the European Commission
(EC). The workshop is a part of a series of four workshops on nanotechnology
organized by NSF and EC in 2002. The objectives are to evaluate new trends in
research and education, to exchange information among leading research centers
in both countries, and to promote the exchange of researchers and establishment
of joint projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the rapid expansion of
Nanotechnology and the significant impact it has on products and services in the
society, it is important to periodically examine and explore opportunities and
implications on broad societal impacts.
