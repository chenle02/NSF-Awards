This project is based on recent advancements in geometry which generalize
hyperbolic geometry, and lie at the interface of mathematics and physics. There
are many distinguished subvarieties of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and flat
connections which this project ties together and analyzes how these spaces
change as defining data is varied. The PI uses tools coming from Higgs bundle
theory, deformation theory and geometric representation theory to tackle these
questions. Since both the objects and the tools used involve the interaction of
many different mathematical fields, this works has cross-disciplinary
implications. The award also supports out-reach programs aimed at youths in
demographics traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.

This project centers on the interaction between the geometry of surface group
representations, representation theory of Lie groups, and algebraic and analytic
techniques in Higgs bundles theory. In these projects, a central role is played
by the PI's work on Global Slodowy slices, which globalizes certain Lie
theoretic spaces to moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and holomorphic connections.
The main goals of the project center on elucidating which aspects of the
nonabelian Hodge correspondence change as the Riemann surface is deformed and to
identify structures and subvarieties which are constant under such deformations.
As a result, this will deepen the understanding of geometries associated to
surface groups and their relation to Higgs bundles and representation theory. A
special focus is placed on generalizing the Fuchsian locus in the space of
Quasi-Fuchsian representations to higher rank and explaining the role of the
conformal limit.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
