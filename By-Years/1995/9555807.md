9555807 Ash The Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center (COSC) will develop an
environmental curriculum implementation project called FIRST: Female Involvement
in Real Science and Technology. This comprehensive, sequential scientific
initiative will be developed and produced in collaboration with local school
districts, colleges, museums, and professional societies. FIRST will involve
students in grades 5 through 8, and their teachers, administrators, care givers,
and the families. The participants will explore critical environmental issues,
envisioning themselves as effective shapers of their environment now and in the
future. The program will reach 60 elementary schools and 15 junior high/middle
schools, with over 35,000 students total, and 1,200 teachers will receive
training each year. This project unites and builds upon the systemic reform
begun by previous NSF-funded projects at Mills College and Department of Energy-
funded collaborative education programs. Interactive environmental studies allow
middle and high school students and their families to enrich their knowledge by
discussing real life science questions. Teaching and learning in both formal and
informal settings will help teachers, students, and community members of an
urban multilingual, multicultural population explore environmental issues that
effect their lives on a daily basis. ***
