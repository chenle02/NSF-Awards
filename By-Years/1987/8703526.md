The objective of the research is to investigate the possibility of creating
modified graphitic structures in fibers or thin films via the thermal
decomposition of nitrogen- containing polymers. The program will emphasize
conversion of polycyanogen (PCN) to carbon fibers via thermal treatment above
1500 C., and characterization of the mechanical, electrical, microstructural,
and magnetic properties. The specimens will be doped with noble and transition
metals and metal chlorides in an attempt to alter their magnetic, electronic,
and mechanical properties in a controlled manner. The graphite materials being
investigated exhibit highly conducting, semiconducting, and metallic behavior.
The materials combine interesting electronic properties with high thermal
stability, good mechanical properties, and processability.
