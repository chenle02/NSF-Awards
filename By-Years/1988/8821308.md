A symposium on quantum fluids and solids will be held April 24- 28, 1989, on the
campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville. The objective of this
symposium will be to gather an international body of active researchers in the
field to present recent developments, to discuss the status of unsolved or
controversial problems, and to consolidate their understanding of the subjects.
In this way, future directions of low temperature research may be determined.
