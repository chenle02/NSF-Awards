9452084 Geisler The curriculum in the Department of Chemistry is being improved
by providing hand-on experience with modern instrumentation and laboratory
computers. The introduction of a 200 MHz FT-NMR is enhancing the students'
experiences in organic chemistry, physical chemistry, instrumental analysis and
advanced inorganic chemistry courses. The students' exposure to FT-NMR occurs
gradually but steadily through classroom lectures and in the problem-solving
setting of the laboratories. The project also is enhancing the ability of the
faculty to teach the fundamentals and advanced aspects of NMR spectra
interpretation. In addition, the instrument is being used to illustrate a number
of chemical concepts including reaction stereochemistry, equilibria, kinetics,
tautomerism, proton exchange and magnetic moments. An accessible NMR provides
the undergraduates with the opportunity to participate in research at a higher
level than would otherwise be possible.
