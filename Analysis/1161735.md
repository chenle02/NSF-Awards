This project will focus on a number of topics in complex analysis and related
geometric theories. These topics include the study of variational problems
connected with Fefferman's measure for real hypersurfaces in complex Euclidean
space; the exploration of a new biholomorphically invariant metric based on
Fefferman's Szego kernel; the development of the Mobius-invariant differential
geometry of real hypersurfaces in complex projective space; and the study of a
generalized Cauchy transform known as the Leray transform, with special
attention to the information it provides about pairing of Hardy spaces on dual
hypersurfaces in complex projective space. The last topic has potential
implications for the study of constant coefficient holomorphic partial
differential equations.

Functions of complex variables play an essential role in many parts of
mathematics, including partial differential equations, Fourier theory, and
integral geometry. These topics in turn provide vital infrastructure for physics
and engineering. For example, the study of complex analysis in projective space
and related settings contributes to the understanding of the integral transforms
used in tomography. The proposed project is focused on natural topics with
potential for opening up new directions within complex analysis and for
strengthening the connections between complex analysis and other parts of
mathematics. The project will involve students and younger investigators and
thus will help to ensure that expertise in this important subject is available
in the future.
