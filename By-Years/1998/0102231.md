Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0102231&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Xiao-Song Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of this
project is to explore as thoroughly as&lt;br/&gt;possible the significance of
the Jones-Witten and Vassiliev&lt;br/&gt;invariants to knots, links, and
3-manifolds as topological&lt;br/&gt;structures. To be more specific, we will
study the thermodynamic&lt;br/&gt;limit of the colored Jones polynomial using
various probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;models; to explore beyond a simple formulation
of the Casson&lt;br/&gt;invariant we found; to understand the congruence
relation among&lt;br/&gt;Ohtsuki's invariants through congruence subgroups of
the modular&lt;br/&gt;group; to find the normal form of a degree 1 map from a
knot&lt;br/&gt;complement to another knot complement; to study the cohomology
of&lt;br/&gt;knot complexes; to explore the applicability of
classical&lt;br/&gt;techniques in 3-manifold topology to the study of
Vassiliev&lt;br/&gt;invariants; and to continue the study of value and
root&lt;br/&gt;distributions of the Jones polynomial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
phenomenon of knotting is a fundamental feature of the space&lt;br/&gt;that we
live in, and knot theory is thus an important part of&lt;br/&gt;mankind's
scientific knowledge because it is aimed at&lt;br/&gt;understanding the
interplay of mathematical formulae and space&lt;br/&gt;structures. It is no
wonder that concepts and tools originated&lt;br/&gt;from knot theory have been
used in many areas of mathematics, as&lt;br/&gt;well as in chemistry, biology,
physics, and computer science. For&lt;br/&gt;example, geneticists utilize knot
theory to understand the&lt;br/&gt;processes of DNA replication and the function
of enzymes that&lt;br/&gt;"unknot" DNA strands, and chemists use knot theory to
understand&lt;br/&gt;and distinguish between different types of molecules. Our
ability&lt;br/&gt;to discern different knots could well be served as a test of
our&lt;br/&gt;scientific understanding of space structures.&lt;br/&gt;
