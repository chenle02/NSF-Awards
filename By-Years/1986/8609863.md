A new x-ray facility will be established to support contemporary research in
structural biology. A rotating anode, area detector, and VAX computer will be
acquired to support interdisciplinary research in biotechnology. Support will
also be provided for writing new computer software or code for structural
biology. Among the projects that will utilize the new equipment for
biotechnology are the design of new proteins and the prediction of protein
structure from sequence information. Other research projects include the three
dimensional molecular structure of the enzyme ATP synthetase from mitochondria,
a nasal epithelium receptor or odorant binding protein, the enzyme quinone
reductase, staphyloccal nuclease, genetically engineered mutant staphyloccal
nuclease species, and of DNA binding proteins. Also, artificial or rule-based
model building systems will be used to explore modifications or existing
proteins.
