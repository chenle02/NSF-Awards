On 28 January 1989, the Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran aground near
Palmer Station, Antarctica, spilling 180,000 gallons of diesel fuel, jet fuel
and heavy lubricants into the marine environment. The spill, which coincided
with the feeding, fledgling and dispersal stages of the area's six most abundant
seabird species, exposed 36,000-43,000 chicks and adults to the oil. The focus
of this study is to determine the impact this spill has had on seabird
populations in the Palmer area. From prior research at Palmer Station during
1987-1989, there is current data on the abundance, breeding success, diets and
growth rates of the more numerous members of this seabird community, including
marked chick cohorts form 1988 (not exposed to oil) and 1989 (exposed to oil).
This data will be used as baseline information in a comparative study designed
to assess seabird mortality in the area and determine the population's potential
for recovery. The availability of similar baseline data is rare among oil impact
studies on seabird communities as a whole. The proposed study thus becomes
uniquely valuable, not only in terms of assessing the impacts of an oil spill on
a comparatively pristine polar seabird community, but as a potential source of
critical data for seabird impact studies in general.
