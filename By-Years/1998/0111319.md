Professor Joshua Goodman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Rochester, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, explores detailed
mechanistic studies on different aspects of electron transfer reactions. The
proposed research is centered on the concept that coupling the electron transfer
processes to bond breaking and bond making events can increase the efficiency of
electron transfer reactions. The research plan deals exclusively with the
competition between return electron transfer (RET) and dissociative return
electron transfer (DRET). The former is an energy-wasting decay process that has
been widely studied in both singlet and triplet radical ion pairs. The latter is
a rather specialized process that occurs only for triplet radical ion pairs
under highly restrictive conditions for a limited set of substrates. Extensions
of the scope of the DRET process will be of interest to specialists in the field
of photoinduced electron transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bond coupled electron
transfer (BCET) reactions have the potential to drive chemical reactions. This
project seeks to investigate several of these reactions. Professor Goodman will
focus primarily on DRET reactions that involve cleavage of (1) C-C bonds in
disubstituted cyclopropanes and diarylethanes, (2) Si-Si bonds in disilanes, and
(3) C-halogen bonds in substituted benzylic halides. An improved understanding
of RET processes in photoinduced electron transfer reactions may eventually lead
to the ability to drive chemical reactions using light. For example, it may be
possible one day to employ polymerizations induced by light in imaging
applications. The proposed investigation on disilanes may have an impact on
developing lithographic resists, nonlinear optical materials, and one-
dimensional conductors.&lt;br/&gt;
