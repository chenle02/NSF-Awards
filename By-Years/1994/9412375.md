9412375 Bock The PI will organize and run a topical workshop on "Continuous GPS
Networks and Seismic Networks" for a group of about 40 participants, including
approximately a number of graduate students and postdocs. The workshop will be
jointly funded by Scripps Oceanographic Institute, UNAVCO, and IRIS and will
focus on how UNAVCO can best support PIs with global and regional products and
how IRIS might participate in the support of global observations. Global data
collection and analysis issues to be discussed at the workshop are directly
related to the HPCC initiative. ****
