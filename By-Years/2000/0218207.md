Discrete event systems (DESs) are systems evolving according to the occurrence
of certain discrete qualitative changes, called events. Examples of events
include the arrival of a customer in a queue, the termination of an algorithm in
a computer program, the loss of a message packet in a communication network, the
breakdown of a machine in a manufacturing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
proposal we consider stochastic DESs modeled by Markov processes, and study
control problems that satisfy qualitative properties. We outline a program of
work aiming to develop a unified framework for qualitative control of stochastic
DESs. In particular, we propose to study the control of stochastic systems with
general qualitative constraints such as safety, non-blocking, recurrence, and
stability; optimal control subject to qualitative constraints; control under
complete or partial observations; effects of using deterministic versus
randomized policies; and effects of using stationary versus non-stationary and
asymptotically stationary control policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety
constraints are specified as unit-interval-valued vectors serving as an upper
bound for the state probability distribution of the controlled Markov chain.
Non-blocking specifications require that the probability of hitting a target set
of states stays above a certain minimum value. Recurrence or liveness amounts to
the probability of hitting a target set of states infinitely-often being bounded
below by a positive constant, while convergence or stability demands that the
state probability distribution enters and stays in a `safe' set within a finite
number of steps.&lt;br/&gt;
