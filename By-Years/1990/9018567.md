This is an award to support research on developing a method for rapid detection
and identification of the HIV-I in environmental media by use of a method
involving extraction of nucleic acids from the samples and amplification of the
target deoxyribonucleic acid sequences using a polymerase chain reaction method.
This method has been used to detect low numbers of genetically engineered
microorganisms in environmental media. A similar method proposed for study in
this project has shown promise in improving the sensitivity for detection of
retroviruses such as the HIV-I in environmental media. The results of this
project are expected to be useful in developing a method for determining the
presence and amount of the target virus in environmental media and may lead to
development of strategies for use in engineering design of collection and
treatment systems for waste residues that are contaminated with viruses of
significance to public health.
