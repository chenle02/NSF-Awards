The thrust of this project is the development of the theory of the geometric
Langlands correspondence. The core idea of the Langlands phenomenon is that some
basic symmetry laws that arise naturally in mathematics come in pairs, known as
Langlands dual pairs. It has been observed empirically that mathematical
constructions that obey one set of symmetry laws are equivalent to fundamentally
different constructions for the dual symmetry laws. The goals of this project
are to formalize and make mathematically rigorous the underlying structures
responsible for this duality in the case of the geometric Langlands
correspondence.

In more detail, it has become clear that in order to understand the geometric
Langlands correspondence, one should perform a quantum deformation, in which
case the roles of the group and its Langlands dual become more symmetric, that
is, there is no more "automorphic vs. Galois", but rather "twisted automorphic
vs. twisted automorphic." After performing the quantum deformation, one sees
that at the origin of the geometric Langlands correspondence should be a certain
equivalence of local categories, proposed by J. Lurie and the PI several years
ago: this is the equivalence of the Whittaker category (for a group G) vs the
Kazhdan-Luztig category (for the Langlands dual of G). This project will
establish this equivalence and develop its consequences.
