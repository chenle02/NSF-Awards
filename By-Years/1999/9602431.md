Toledo Technology Academy Toledo's award winning Manufacturing Engineering
Technology Program, located at the Libbey Skill Center, provides an effective
school-to-work path for high school students, drawn from throughout a major
industrial city with its many attendant problems. Through a non-coercive,
cooperative learning environment, students acquire competencies in design,
construction, and maintenance of automated manufacturing machine systems.
Supported by over 80 companies, the two-year, half-day program will form the
model for a proposed full four-year, all-day high school program encompassing
two of the five Tech Prep manufacturing engineering technology competency
profiles. The proposed three-year project will address a key industrial need to
replace today's aging employees with tomorrow's skilled technical workforce. An
integrated curriculum, adapted from many existing proven models, will emphasize
cooperative learning strategies, the Quality School techniques of Glasser and
others, a full spectrum of real-world work experience for students, laboratory
expansion, and marketing to solve low student enrollment. Evening adult
education components, will allow special laboratories provided by industry to be
used by a larger community population. The UT Community and Technical College
will offer full articulated associate degree programs for graduates. The new
technology based high school program is being developed by a strong community
team consisting of: Edison Industrial Systems Center, Toledo Public Schools, The
University of Toledo, Toledo area industrial companies, and the Toledo Chapters
of the Societies of Manufacturing Engineers and Plastics Engineers. Industry
support and leadership are vital to the success of this initiative providing
input into curriculum, providing student and instructor mentoring, technical
assistance, product and monetary assistance.
