This Engineering Research Equipment proposal is for funds for a scanning
acoustic microscope to conduct a broad range of studies in materials
engineering, precision machining, physics, archaeometry, and fiber and polymer
science. True acoustic microscopes are recent developments that now have a
resolution equal to that of a light microscope. The important difference between
light- and acoustic- microscopy is in the causes of image contrast. Contrast in
light microscopy is due to the existence of and variations in optical indices of
refraction and coefficients of optical absorption. These basic parameters are,
in general, only indirectly related to the material's physical properties;
whereas, with the acoustic microscope, contrast within the image is due to
variation in the elastic, viscoelastic and density properties. The image is thus
not dependent on visible light transmission. Specific problems on which the
acoustic microscopy is to be used are: (1) to examine microscopic elastic and
viscoelastic moduli and density variations in ultra-oriented fibers produced by
flow-induced orientation and high-speed takeup; (2) to examine the interfacial
regions using a non-destructive procedure in reducing the moisture absorption of
epoxy resin/graphite fiber composites; (3) to characterize defects in
semiconductor materials and in developing new image analysis techniques; (4) to
investigate the interface during strain in polymer matrix composites (the novel
utility here is due to the composites being opaque to light but still
transparent to ultra- sound); (5) to assist the Precision Engineering Center
(newly formed at this university) in the characterization of subsurface damage;
and (6) to examine, count, and measure subsurface structures in archaeological
specimens.
