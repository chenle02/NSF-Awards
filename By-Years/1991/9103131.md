The central limit theorem is the most fundamental result in mathematical
statistics. It states that the partial sums of a sequence of independent
identically distributed random variables with finite variance can be normalized
so that they converge in distribution to a normal law. In the case of infinite
variance, convergence is still possible, and the limit is either normal or a
nonnormal stable law. For random vectors it is known that similar results hold,
but there does not yet exist a practical method for construction of the norming
operators. The principal investigator intends to develop such a method. This
work will bring the existing theoretical results on multivariable
generalizations of the central limit theorem one step closer to practical
applications. The principal investigator will work in the area of mathematics
concerning limits of random vectors. This research is in the center of the field
of probability and mathematical statistics. The principal investigator is
working at a small, liberal arts college, and this award is being made via the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions program.
