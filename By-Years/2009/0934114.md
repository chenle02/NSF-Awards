The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Hybrid Multicore
Productivity Research (CHMPR)" with a focus on hybrid multicore computing and
research on parallel processing algorithms as well as technology-driven research
questions. The lead of the proposed Center is UMBC with site locations at
Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

The proposed Center plans to develop, test, and optimize prototypes of
computationally intensive applications. A key contribution of the Center will be
the implementation of prototype applications on new architectures and
comparative performance analysis. This Center is needed to advance knowledge
both in high-performance computing as well as computer architecture communities.
The PIs are well qualified and the access to resources is excellent. The
combined computing facilities at UMBC and GT, respectively, are the largest most
advanced Cell Broadband Engine based multicore university systems available
today.

The proposed Center will address the future needs of the computer industry as
this new hybrid multicore processor technology evolves. The proposed Center will
provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on expertise
to address a wide variety of practical, hybrid multicore applications in areas
of climate prediction, defense, biomedical informatics, 3-D graphic
environments, finance and social computing. The Center has described efforts to
increase participation of underrepresented groups, and there are plans to
publish the results of research and education projects within an online Hybrid
Multicore Knowledge Repository.
