A key challenge in biology is to understand the link between brain function and
behavior. Knowledge of brain functional dynamics is especially important for
understanding how experience shapes the brain. This project couples state-of-
the-art techniques to measure and mathematically model brain metabolic activity,
using the honey bee as a model system and aggression as the focal behavior.
Experiments will determine whether experimentally induced changes in brain
metabolism cause changes in aggression, which is what is expected based on
previously collected correlative data. Additional experiments will determine in
which parts of the brain are the aggression-related changes in metabolic
activity. This new information will then be used to build a comprehensive model
of the bee brain's metabolic network, which will then be validated with
experimental work.

This collaborative project will provide integrative training for undergraduate
students, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates, and members of the
research team will give public presentations on the new insights into brain
function gained by this project in a variety of venues for retired people and in
K-12 settings. The Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be the facility to store and back up project
data, which include mainly RNA bioinformatic sequence-based and metabolomic
datasets.
