ABSTARCT &lt;br/&gt;PI: MOORE&lt;br/&gt;INST. HAWAII-MANOA&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #
0137224&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award is for a project to acquire and analyze all
available marine seismic reflection data from the Nankai Trough region. This
region is a high priority locality for drilling into an active seismogenic zone;
an important objective for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The goal of
this study is to identify the best transect along which to acquire the 3D
seismic surveys necessary for IODP rise drilling in the Nankai Seismogenic Zone,
and to locate the best sites for non-riser drilling of seaward reference sites
and landward prism test sites. This work will make it possible to assess
globally important subduction processes such as the effects of seamount
subduction /collision on accretionary prism evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
