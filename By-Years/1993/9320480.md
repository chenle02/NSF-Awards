9320480 Graves The first and second Material Handling Research Colloquia each
brought together forty researchers in the field of material handling to focus on
the current state of research in material handling and the critical issues to be
addressed in the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the
21st century. The goal of this project is to continue the effort of the very
successful first two research colloquia. These continue to build better
communication within the material handling research community by providing a
venue for academic and industrial researchers to network with each other about
material handling issues.
