This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop the Local
Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) to rapidly provide three-dimensional atomic-scale
imaging and elemental identification of nano-biotechnology devices. Structural
characterization of nano-biotechnology devices is currently problematic because
available microscopy and analytical techniques have substantial limitations in
quantitative imaging at the atomic-scale. Moreover, current microscopy
techniques cannot adequately resolve three-dimensional biomacromolecules, which
are intrinsic to nano-biotechnology devices. Until better analytical
instrumentation is developed, researchers will "fly blind" as they develop more
complex nano-biotechnology devices. The overall goal of this Phase II project is
to rapidly analyze the three-dimensional atomic-scale structure and elemental
composition of biological and organic molecules on nano-biotechnology devices.
The focus will be on developing technologies to analyze commercial specimens
using LEAP technology, and to initiate commercialization and marketing of this
technology to academic and industrial researchers. The commercial application of
this project will be in the area of bioanalytical instrumentation and nano-
biotechnology devices.
