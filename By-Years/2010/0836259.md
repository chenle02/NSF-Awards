The Workshop on the Question Generation Shared Task and Evaluation Challenge
aims at establishing a community consensus with respect to various issues
related to offering a shared task on Question Generation, including a clear
definition of the main task and subtasks, data collection and annotation
processes, data annotation schema, type of evaluation and evaluation metrics.
The Natural Language Generation community has currently identified shared tasks
as a potential venue to provide a focus of research in the field and increase
the visibility of Natural Language Generation research in the wider Natural
Language Processing/Computational Linguistics community. This award contributes
to this effort by defining a novel shared task, the Question Generation task.
The workshop organization is guided by the Desiderata for Evaluation of Natural
Language Generation outlined at the recent NSF/SIGGEN Workshop on Shared Tasks
and Comparative Evaluation in NLG held in 2007. The goal of a representative
group of researchers from various areas of research (Natural Language
Generation, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Artificial Intelligence in Education)
participating in the workshop discussions is to produce a to-do list for
preparing and offering a Question Generation task at Generation Challenges 2010.
A post-workshop report will outline the discussions and decisions of the
workshop and will be made available to the research community. Due to the
importance of Question Generation in learning technologies such as Intelligent
Tutoring Systems, the workshop will have broader impact on improving the
teaching and learning of STEM disciplines through improved educational software
applications.
