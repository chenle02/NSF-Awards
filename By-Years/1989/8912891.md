The Deep Submergence Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceano- graphic Institution
will undertake a cooperative project with the Naval Oceanographic Office to
upgrade the Teleprobe ocean science vehicle system. The Teleprobe system is a
towed photographic and side-scan sonar vehicle system with several integrated
environmental sensors. The upgrade will primarily consist of developing an
electro-optic tow cable and associa- ted hardware and data transmission
protocols for the vehicle using the new fiber optic link. Technological advances
needed to accomplish these upgrades will have direct relevance to long-term NSF
ocean science requirements for upgrading tethered and suspended research
instrumentation packages. Anticipated benefits that should accrue from this
project include: 1) enhanced reliability and cost reductions associated with
gathering data from the deep sea, 2) improved data quality and data flow because
of increased bandwidth over presently used coaxial cable, 3) broadened spectrum
of users of fiber optic technology and 4) further development, refinement, and
documentation of a technology base for fiber optic oceanographic cables.
