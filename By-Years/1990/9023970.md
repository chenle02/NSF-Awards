This project will advance three-dimensional X-ray image reconstruction by
developing cone-beam reconstruction algorithms via Fourier techniques that are
more efficient and accurate than existing methods. Such algorithms are crucial
in Computed Tomography, a method applied in particular to nondestructive
evaluation of industrial objects. Computed Tomography provides views of the
interior of objects by integrating data acquired by area detectors. The
integration of such data is a complex mathematical problem which this project
will advance. A successful high speed, high quality, and low cost reconstructor
is expected out of this project.
