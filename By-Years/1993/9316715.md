9316715 Taylor This award is for support to collect micrometeorites from the
bottom of the new water well at South Pole Station, Antarctica. The large volume
of firn and ice being melted provides the concentrating mechanism needed to
collect large numbers of micrometeorites that occur in low concentrations in the
ice. The first task of the project is to design a collection system to retrieve
the micrometeorites from the bottom of the water well. The collector must be
reliable, easy to operate, must collect all particles larger than 10 mm and
should not contaminate the well's water quality. Following successful design and
deployment of the collector, recovered particles will be catalogued and
distributed to interested researchers. ***
