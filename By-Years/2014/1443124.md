1443124&lt;br/&gt;Harmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for US Participants at the
2014 Gordon Research Conference in Green Chemistry, July 27-August 1, to be held
in Hong Kong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the
registration and/or travel for US participants to exchange new science and
technology ideas at the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Conference (July
27-August 1) and the 2014 Green Chemistry Gordon Research Seminar (July 26-27)
to be held in Hong Kong. These meetings will bring together an outstanding and
diverse group of scientists who will present their latest research and the most
important advances relevant to Industrial Green Chemistry. The students and
postdocs will have the opportunity to exchange expertise/ideas among themselves
across a broad range of green areas, approaches and methods. This conference
addresses many issues that impact the World today from Green Energy,
Bioprocessing to new types of Green polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green
Chemistry Gordon Research Conference focuses on the cutting-edge developments
required to design chemical products and processes that: have a smaller
environmental impact, both in their manufacture and use; are produced in an
energy-efficient manner with the least possible intrinsic hazards; and have been
designed for inherent safety for human health and the environment. A highly
distinguished group of invited speakers will present their unpublished research
on designing greener chemicals, greener processes, Green Energy, biopolymers,
new organic approaches to pharmaceuticals, life cycle analysis and green
chemistry education. The Green Chemistry GRC/GRS are particularly important and
timely because the outputs of Green Chemistry research are now driving
innovation in both academia and industry and are proving to be key measures of
competitiveness in major industries.
