The research activity into this proposed project will deepen our understanding
of two intimately connected mathematical fields, partial differential equations
and differential geometry, which may be viewed as extensions of advanced
calculus. Simultaneously, the project will also have impact on the areas on
which the equations studied in the project rest: some equations provide the
mathematical foundation for mirror symmetry in the string theory of modern
physics, which is a unified way to describe our physical universe; another
equation is an effective model in material science; solutions to the so called
Isaacs equations lead to the optimal strategy for certain random processes, for
example, in engineering and finance; Also Hessian equations are related to
nonlinear elasticity theory in mechanics, which studies the mechanisms whereby a
material that is stretched returns to its original size and shape.

The objectives for special Lagrangian equations are to derive Schauder and
Calderon-Zygmund estimates for the equations with critical and supercritical
phases, to answer the question whether any homogeneous order two solution in
dimension five or higher is trivial or not, and to study low regularity of
continuous viscosity solutions to the equations with subcritical phases. The
purposes for self similar solutions to mean curvature flows are to classify
Lagrangian translating solutions and study uniqueness of embedded sphere
shrinker in 3-d Euclidean space. The aim for symmetric Hessian equations is to
investigate Hessian estimates for quadratic Hessian equations in dimension four
and higher and also scalar curvature equations, to obtain Schauder and Calderon-
Zygmund estimates for 3-d quadratic Hessian equations, and to study the
Liouville problem for k-symmetric Hessian equations. The attempt for fully
nonlinear elliptic equations such as Isaacs equations in 3-d is to study the
regularity for general fully nonlinear elliptic equations in 3-d, in particular
for equations in the form of linear combinations of k-symmetric Hessians and
finitely piecewise linear Isaacs equations. The plan for complex Monge-Ampere
equations is to show the triviality of any global solution to complex Monge-
Ampere equations including self-shrinking equations for the Kahler Ricci flow
with certain necessary restrictions.
