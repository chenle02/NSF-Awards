0429975: "Angular momentum variability, atmospheric dynamics &amp; the
relationship with Earth Motions"&lt;br/&gt;Salstein, David A.; Atmospheric and
Environmental Research
Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will further
investigations in atmospheric angular momentum and the associated torques,
focusing specifically on various aspects of variability in the axial and
equatorial components of atmospheric angular momentum which have not been
closely examined in previous studies. Observational data, as well as climate
model data from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project will be used. The
availability of independent observations of changes in the Earth's rotation will
allow an independent test of atmospheric models using angular momentum computed
from the modeled wind and pressure fields. The mechanisms by which the
atmosphere drives Chandler wobble fluctuations will also be examined. The
results of this work will be made available to the scientific community via the
Internet and via peer- reviewed publications, and will, therefore, have broad
impacts related to climate dynamics and climate modeling.&lt;br/&gt;
