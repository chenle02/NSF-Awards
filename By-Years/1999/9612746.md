This proposal requests partial support of Gordon Conference meeting expenses
from the Computational Biology Program. Fundamental experimental, theoretical,
and computational underpinnings of macromolecular crystallography have
experienced explosive growth in recent years. In contrast to past Gordon
Conferences, these computational and experimental underpinnings will be
emphasized by bringing together major exponents of experimental and ab initio
phasing approaches. Sessions will also be devoted to issues involving new
experimental facilities, particularly the Advanced Photon Source.
