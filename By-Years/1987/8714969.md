The researchers are studying motion estimation for applications in image
processing such as motion compensation in image encoding. The researchers are
also using motion estimation for improving image sequence restoration and in the
problem of interpolating between two adjacent image frames. They have developed
a new approach to motion estimation which is model- based and uses a multi-grid
for computational efficiency. The method involves a careful solution of two
linear velocity equations resulting from a least-squares analysis. Also for
noise immunity, they approximate the relevant partial derivatives by low order
polynomial interpolation rather than first order differences. The new technique
includes an accurate detection of regions where the motion estimates are not
good enough to be useful for the above tasks.
