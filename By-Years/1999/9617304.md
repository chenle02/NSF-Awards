Clark 9617304 Two aspects of El Nino/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO), dynamics will
be studied using historical data and simple dynamical models. The first problem
deals the ENSO interaction between the western and central tropical Pacific
where evidence suggests that low-frequency sea surface temperature in the
western equatorial Pacific is associated with evaporation by anomalous winds. In
addition, the suppressed convection in the western equatorial Pacific during a
warm ENSO event results in winds being anomalously easterly there. These
Easterlies will generate an equatorial upwelling Kelvin wave with a westward
current that, by zonal advection in the central equatorial Pacific and upwelling
in the eastern equatorial Pacific, can slow and perhaps reverse the original
warm event as a negative feedback. The influence of this negative feedback will
be tested with a coupled ocean atmosphere model. The second problem will look at
the possibility that the decadal variability observed in the tropical Pacific
records is an intrinsic part of the ENSO mechanism using simple and an
intermediate coupled models.
