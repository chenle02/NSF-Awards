This award provides 38% of the funds required for the acquisition of a thermal
ionization mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences at Cornell University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The mass spectrometer
system will be primarily used in the research programs of the Principal
Investigator, several additional faculty members of the Department of Geological
Sciences, and their students in research projects supported by the National
Science Foundation. These projects employ the radiometric dating and isotopic
tracing techniques of isotope geochemistry and include topics such as the
evolution of the Archean crust and the mantle, the origin of the Galapagos and
Marquesa islands, the isotopic composition of seawater, and the study of
magmatism in the Andes.
