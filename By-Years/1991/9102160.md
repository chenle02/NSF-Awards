This awards supports the research of Professor K. Matsuki to work in algebraic
geometry. Professor Matsuki will study algebraic 3-folds. He will investigate
the basic properties of minimal models as well as try to extend Mori's program
to higher dimensional varieties. This research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding
theory and robotics.
