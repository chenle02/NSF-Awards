Developing enzymes that can catalyze efficient conversion of plant cell wall
material (lignocellulose) to fermentable sugars or high-value chemical building
blocks is an important goal of many industrial enzyme companies. However, the
current enzymes being used for plant cell wall degradation are active under a
limited set of conditions; they can't, for example, deal with very acidic or
basic conditions. This research project seeks to identify industrial enzymes
that can be used to break down hard-to-degrade materials such as plant cell
walls. Such enzymes are useful in producing energy and in remediating pollution.
This project seeks to find new enzymes that are active in diverse conditions
and, as such, maximally useful. The use of these improved enzymes would allow
industrial processes to be cheaper, higher volume and more efficient.

This research will result in a proof-of-concept, specifically the production of
at least one commercially relevant enzyme from the microbiome of household
insects. The project will also result in providing the basis for at least two
types of patents: 1) process of isolating lignocellulosic enzymes from camel
crickets and dermestid beetles and 2) the application of recombinant enzymes
identified in the course this project. The I-Corps program will enable the team
to seek out industrial partnerships to customize the proposed research to the
needs and interests of the industrial partners. In performing the research goals
outlined in this proposal, the team will foremost have the opportunity to mature
the development of an isolation and screening platform designed to identify
microorganisms and enzymes from household insect microbiomes that have utility
for biotechnological/industrial applications and to form relationships with
target technology companies. In addition the proposed research could also answer
several questions about the ecology of the household insects, their microbiota,
and the enzymes used by these insects to degrade and digest permanent household
materials.
