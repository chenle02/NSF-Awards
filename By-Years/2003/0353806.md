Institution: West Virginia University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0353806&lt;br/&gt;PI: Frances L. Van Scoy&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site: Virtual
Environments REU Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes an REU site
focusing on virtual environments and multisensory computing. It will build on a
prior REU Site award to establish undergraduate research internships in on-going
research projects at West Virginia University. The interns will also participate
in semi-weekly classes on virtual technology at the Virtual Environments Lab
(VEL). Projects will include research in functional brain imaging; computational
materials science; integration of geographical information systems (GIS) with
virtual reality; and applications of advanced visualization technology in
biometrics. The interns will work in teams of mentors, graduate students, other
undergraduates, and sometimes high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will support 11 students per year for a 10-week research internship. The
PI will continue to recruit interns from Puerto Rico as she has in the past. The
program will also emphasize student presentations and publication. &lt;br/&gt;
