The studies proposed here will provide a phenotypic and molecular
characterization of the facet mutations of drosophila. These mutations, which
map to the well studied notch locus, affect development of the eye. Preliminary
data indicate that these mutations alter non-coding regions of the notch
transcript, thereby suggesting the possibility that the mutations are
regulatory, rather than structural. This is consistent with the observation that
other notch mutations affect a well defined step in neurogenesis in the early
embryo, rather than morphogenesis of the eye. The eye defects caused by facet
mutations are less well described; the ultrastructural analysis proposed here
should increase our understanding of the relationship of the two different
phenotypes associated with mutations at the notch locus. Additional proposed
experimentation will identify other genes that play a direct role in controlling
the expression of notch, or in the function of its product. One of the central
aims of modern biology is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms that
control development of multicellular organisms. Study of drosophila has been one
of the most important approaches to this problem, in part because of the
powerful genetic analysis possible with this organism. A number of mutations
which affect cellular differentiation in drosophila are known; among these,
mutations at the notch locus have been shown to affect the decision of certain
cells in the early embryo to form either neural or epidermal tissue. Remarkably,
some notch mutations, called facet mutations, instead cause defects in the eye.
The proposed experiments will provide a careful analysis of these eye defects,
which have not been well characterized previously, and of the genetic
alterations which cause them. In so doing, they should provide important insight
into the kinds of mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell growth and
differentiation.
