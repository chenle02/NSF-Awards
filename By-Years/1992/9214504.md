This Gordon Conference on Glass will be held on June 29-July 3, 1992 at the
Tilton School, Tilton, NH. Its theme is Optical Phenomena in Glass. It follows
the traditional Gordon Conference format with two discussion periods each day
and nine discussion altogether during the week. In addition, this conference has
two poster sessions. Discussion topics link laser and glass in their multi-
faceted symbiotic aspects. The coverage of topics is extensive with the central
focus on the optical phenomena in glass. %%%% This Gordon Conference covers
topics which are very timely and important in many new and exciting
technological advances, such as glass fiber laser for telecommunication
industries, and new dopant ions and optical transitions in fluorescence
upconversion processes for new lasers.
