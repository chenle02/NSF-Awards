This project concerns one of the most difficult aspects of the changing electric
power industry, i.e. the delivery of market-driven power trades. In particular,
the problem of transmission provision and pricing for the evolving electric
power industry organizations is posed as a dynamically evolving process jointly
driven by the technological, regulatory and business factors. The objective is
to model and analyze this process for its short-term and longer-term performance
under various technological and regulatory solutions. Ultimately, a decision-
making problem for transmission delivery and its valuation is attempted as the
problem of multi-rate feedback design in response to technical, economic and
regulatory output variables. The major challenge here concerns management of
various uncertainties, both physical (real) and market-related (Pigouvian) and
their interdependencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project comes from viewing the transmission provision, pricing and regulation as
a single dynamic system. The current-state-of-art in any of the sub-disciplines
underlying this complex problem (engineering, economics, regulation, industry
organization, finance) is such that only particular aspects of the problem get
studied, assuming the other inputs to be exogenous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach envisioned in this project would be to thrive on formalizing the
interdependencies between the technical, economic and regulatory signals. For
this reason the project has a potentially huge broad impact on the way electric
power is delivered and valued in the future. The same approach is used to
develop new paradigms for the industry, as well as for developing educational
frameworks necessary for thinking about transmission delivery and its valuation
as a complex problem with many interdependencies.
