This project is developing a radically new approach to vector calculus that is
completely aligned with recent reform efforts in other college entry-level math,
science, and engineering (MSE) courses. As part of this larger MSE curriculum,
it brings more coherence and consistency to it, emphasizing the common
foundation for much of these courses. Sophisticated computer visualization is
vigorously exploited as it has opened a completely new avenue to vector
calculus, allowing to reconnect the concepts of vectorial derivatives back to
their foundation, local linearity. Students now can see the curl by zooming.
Connections to concepts of linear algebra and differential equations
perspectives are omnipresent. The curriculum is ideally suited for cooperative
learning environments where students are guided to make many key discoveries
themselves via often dramatic computer experiments. The new course is also
broadening the range of applications (beyond the traditional EM and fluid
dynamics) by drawing on modern geometric control which has ubiquitous
applications, even connecting to recent research achievements that fit into this
sophomore course. The curriculum is being implemented in the form of interactive
texts, and is using modern electronic media and the WWW for rapid dissemination.
Assessment of the enhanced learning experiences is an integral part of the
project. This curriculum is having a high impact on both MSE majors and future
math and science teachers by conveying a coherent and modern view of advanced
mathematics.
