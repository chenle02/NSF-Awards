Abstract: The Center for High-Pressure Research (CHiPR) at SUNY Stony Brook will
establish a Summer program to give undergraduates the opportunity to participate
in the excitement of a premier science laboratory. The goal is to recruit
students from the physical sciences and stimulate them to pursue a research
career in the Earth Sciences. Students will work with faculty of the Mineral
Physics Institute (MPI) on projects that probe the physical and chemical
properties of materials, with a particular emphasis on use of high pressure.
Working closely with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects
and discuss their progress during weekly seminars. During the program, students
will visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated with the MPI. CHiPR
has established a good record of recruiting and retaining minority students by
relying on personal contacts, especially with faculty at historically minority
colleges and universities. The best example of this is recruiting by a black
faculty member at an historically black university who received his Ph.D.
through the MPI and continues to work there during the summers. The close
mentoring he can offer his students is a key to their success.
