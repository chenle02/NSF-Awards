This project is the continuation of the South Pole Air Shower Experiment
(SPASE), a large phased array of scintillation detectors which was installed in
1988 to search the southern sky for astrophysical sources of ultra-high energy
(100 GeV) gamma rays. SPASE has been upgraded every year since its installation,
but to date has not found convincing evidence for a strong source, a result that
is consistent with similar detectors elsewhere. This one year grant will allow
SPASE to operate in conjunction with a new muon detector which has just been
installed at South Pole. This project is a collaboration between Bartol Research
Institute of the University of Delaware and Leeds University in the United
Kingdom.
