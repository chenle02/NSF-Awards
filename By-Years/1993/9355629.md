9355629 Chiss This is a project of the Chicago Children's Museum to develop,
evaluate and install a 2,200 square foot permanent exhibit called "Inventing:
The Process of Discovery." This exhibit engages young visitors (primarily from
6-10 yrs.) in inventive creativity, testing, and development, and teaches them a
meaningful sequence of activities for problem-solving. Museum educators and
adolescent interns act as multi-cultural role models in exhibit areas and
facilitate hands-on learning. Every year the exhibit will serve over 500,000
children, parents and teachers in Chicago's inner city and metropolitan
neighborhoods. A large percentage of this audience is under-served minority
children drawn from CCM's alliances with diverse ethnic community agencies. This
exhibit provides a safe haven where young multi-cultural, often disadvantaged
children may find support for science learning and be encouraged to grow and
participate in the many science fairs, science clubs, and invention conventions
available to adolescents in the Chicago area. ***
