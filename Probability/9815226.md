9815226 Howard The work under this grant comprises two areas of investigation in
the general category of probability theory. The first concerns rates of
convergence (to an associated asymptotic shape) and related properties of
infinite geodesics in the context of certain Euclidean first-passage percolation
models (Euclidean FPP). Rigorous unconditional results about infinite geodesics
(time-minimizing paths) in the context of standard FPP are quite sparse, largely
due to technical difficulties associated with lattice effects. Models of
Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson
process and their statistical properties enjoy complete invariance under all
rigid motions. In this sense, Euclidean models are a natural setting in which to
study FPP geodesics. The second area concerns a host of problems arising from
random walks on the integers where some fixed but possibly random coloring, or
"scenery", is assigned to the integers. In this context, a random walk on the
integers produces a record of scenery "observed" along the walk. The issues
under investigation concern, loosely speaking, what can be inferred about the
scenery by observing one such scenery record. The difficulty stems from the fact
that one does not know the steps taken by the walk, only the scenery observed
along the walk. Both areas of investigation involve stochastic processes
associated with some type of spatial structure. While the focus of this research
is the mathematical aspects of these models, models of this general sort arise
quite naturally in connection with a number of interesting physical phenomena.
For example, the standard FPP model was first introduced as a representation of
fluid flow through a random porous medium such as an aquifer or, on a smaller
physical scale, a membrane. There are also connections to other aspects of
materials science, including the formation and propagation of cracks.
