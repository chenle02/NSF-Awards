The project will use extreme value statistical techniques to study the upper
tail distribution of wind speed data. The estimation of the tails of probability
distributions of extreme events is a theoretical and engineering problem of
significance. Hurricanes, tornadoes and other high winds episodes produce every
year loss of life and substantive economic and structural damages which could be
curtailed if prediction of extremes would be enhanced. The purpose of this work
is to improve the extreme wind prediction capabilities and to close the gap
between the observed damage statistics and those obtained by using conventional
distribution calibration procedures. Current design winds speeds are based on
the analysis of few decades of weather service data at about 100 weather
stations. An updated data base will be used to test the hypothesis that the
distribution has a limited upper tail. The physical basis for the assumptions
made will be tested, followed by a calibration of conditional exceedance and
validation of this statistical approach.
