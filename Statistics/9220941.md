This interdisciplinary effort will examine geologic processes, such as
hydrogeologic processes of coupled fracture growth and fluid flow, that are
directly influenced by the spatial structure and evolution of rack fractures.
Modelling will incorporate physical models of fracture formation and stochastic
process models. This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the
development of a research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the
geosciences. In particular, the mathematician statistician and the geoscientists
will focus their attention on developing a physically-based stochastic model for
rock fractures. This will meld probabilistic ideas with geologic understanding
to address the phenomena of rock fractures and fluid flow through them.
