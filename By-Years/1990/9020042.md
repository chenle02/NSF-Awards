Numerous formerly authoritarian regimes appear to be undergoing transitions to
democratic government. The process of democratization, however, is highly
diverse. Just as there are many different types of authoritarian regimes and
different types of democracies, there are many different paths from
authoritarianism to democracy. This award supports research on the development
of opposition parties in formerly one party political systems. It does so
through intensive field studies of the development of opposition parties in
Mexico. Specifically, this research uses interviews with urban political elites
to examine the nature and exercise of political power in Mexico, to assess the
effectiveness of emergent opposition parties in responding to the challenges of
exercising local political power, and to assess the viability of ongoing
democratization processes in Mexico. Although focussed on Mexico, the results of
this research should have broader implications for the transition to democracy
of other non-communist, one party political systems. When completed, this
project should contribute to our understanding not only of the nature and
viability of the democratization process in Mexico but to the prospects more
generally for developing opposition parties in one party states.
