This award will support travel and attendance costs for students, postdoctoral
fellows, and faculty speakers at the 31st Center for Vision Science (CVS)
Symposium on Active Vision. The Symposium will be held at the University of
Rochester June 11-14, 2020. Active vision, the study of vision in the context of
natural motor behavior, has grown and expanded greatly in recent years, in part
due to advances in computational power, display technology, and ability to track
body movements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rapidly growing body of evidence
indicates that motor activity plays a critical role in the computational
strategies used for establishing neural representations and achieving task
demands. By bringing together a diverse array of viewpoints and creative
methodological approaches to the study of the visual system in action, this
symposium aims to uncover common principles of visuomotor computation, identify
promising new research directions, disseminate knowledge of recent advances in
the field, and attract and help form a new generation of
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
