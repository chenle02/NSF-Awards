Abstract: Professor Bromberg plans to study spaces of hyperbolic metrics on a
fixed 3-manifold. Two types of questions will be investigated. The first of
these is a study of hyperbolic cone-manifolds. Finite volume cone-manifolds
arise naturally as a link between cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and closed
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Bromberg's goal is to parameterize spaces of infinite
volume hyperbolic cone-manifolds and use this parameterization to understand
non-singular hyperbolic structures. The second question involves the topology of
deformation spaces of complete, infinite volume metrics on open 3-manifolds.
Anderson and Canary have shown that the space of such metrics on a manifold of
fixed homotopy type has a very complicated topology akin to that of the
Mandelbrot set studied in complex dynamics. In joint work with J. Holt, Bromberg
has shown that this complicated behavior persists even if the deformation space
is restricted to metrics on a 3-manifold of fixed homeomorphism type
generalizing work of McMullen. Complex projective structures naturally appear in
both of these topics. Bromberg also plans to study projective structures with a
given discrete holonomy representation.

This project lies in the field of low dimensional topology and geometry. The
main objects studied are three-manifolds which are spaces with one more
dimension than a surface (a 2-manifold). Three-manifolds, such as the space that
we live in, are some of the most basic objects in mathematics yet there are many
simple questions about them that we cannot answer. A metric is a way of
measuring distance on a 3-manifold and a hyperbolic metric is one of a special
class of metrics such that at every point and in every direction the geometry
locally looks the same. The work of W. Thurston has shown that "most"
3-manifolds carry a hyperbolic metric and earlier work of Ahlfors, Bers and
others has shown that an open 3-manifold that has an infinite volume hyperbolic
metric will in fact have many hyperbolic metrics. There is a vast program to
understand all such metrics of which this project is a piece.
