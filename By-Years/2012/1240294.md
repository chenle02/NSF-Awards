This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to explore how
engineering fluid dynamics can be taught by engaging students from the arts on
engineering teams. The study explore development of students' perception of
fluid mechanics, contrasting what is learned with more traditional, mathematical
approaches via the impact on learning outcomes and retention. A mixed-methods
study and perceptual training study will be conducted to explore expertise
development.

The broader significance and importance of this project arises through the
potential for such alternative pedagogies to address both motivation and
retention of students who are currently retained in engineering at a lower rate
than peers. Combining students from visual arts and engineering backgrounds to
explore fluid problems may lead to insights on communicating engineering to a
broader audience. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for
addressing societal challenges through engineering.
