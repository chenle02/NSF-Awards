The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together Polish and U.S.
sociologists, political scientists, economists, and social psychologists to
design longitudinal research projects on the reconciliation of self-interest of
individuals with national collective interests in an emerging democracy. Dr.
Robert Zajonc of the University of Michigan and Dr. Miroslaw Kofta of the Polish
Institute for Social Sciences, Warsaw, will serve as co-organizers. During the
workshop, participants will review and evaluate proposed longitudinal designs,
standardized measures, uniform data collection and management processes as well
as linguistic equivalence for follow-on joint projects to be carried out in
Poland and the United States. Resulting proposals for research support are
intended for consideration by the National Science Foundation and its
counterpart organizations in Poland.
