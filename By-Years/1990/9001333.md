This REU site involves a twelve-week summer research program for senior
undergraduates. Nine faculty will participate in the program, with research
interests in biotechnology electrochemistry, interfacial phenomena, statistical
thermodynamics, polymer characterization and materials science. The program will
include a tutorial series on statistics, computer programming and experimental
methods for analysis. A seminar series will use the resources in other
departments on campus and neighboring institutions as well as researchers from
local industrial and public laboratories. In this manner, the collaborative
possibilities in cross-disciplinary research open to chemical engineers and the
research opportunities which exist outside the university will be made known to
the student. The program will conclude with a day of public seminars, where the
students will present their research activity and accomplishments.
