9614004 Harvell The project is supported as a high risk, rapid response project
to investigate the causes and consequences of a disease epidemic in a dominant
soft coral (gorgonian) of Caribbean coral reefs. An apparent epidemic of unknown
cause is casing widespread but not total mortality in the genus Gorgonia. This
rapid response award will allow Dr. to attempt to identify the causes of the
disease, the response of the host gorgonians, and the efforts taken by the host
animal to establish resistance. Diseases in marine systems are very hard to
investigate, the pathogens are difficult to separate from secondary infectious
organisms and the chemical mechanisms of resistance are virtually unstudied. Yet
there have been numerous epidemics in dominant marine species over the past two
decades that have fundamental influences on the underlying ecology of the
ecosystem in which the target host once existed. This study, while very high
risk, may yield some new insights on disease vectors and organism adaptations in
the marine realm.
