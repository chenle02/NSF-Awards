This exploratory project will form a partnership between Arizona State
University?s (ASU?s) Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering and three community
colleges (CCs) across the state of Arizona. The program is designed to
significantly increase the number of community college transfer students,
especially women and underrepresented minority students, who graduate with B.S.
degrees in engineering and computer science. Student populations to be targeted
are high school and community college students enrolled in pre-
calculus/calculus, engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, and geology courses
at Arizona CCs and their local high schools. The partners, Arizona Western,
Central Arizona, and Cochise CCs have been selected because they possess a
significant pool of untapped engineering talent, a high percentage of women and
underrepresented minorities, and they have enthusiastically embraced the vision
to reach out to students in an effort to attract them to exciting engineering
careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to our future competitiveness to
help stem the decrease of U.S. and permanent resident students earning
engineering degrees. This project will impact university-CC interactions across
the nation. It will also significantly improve our understanding of which
interventions are most effective in encouraging CC students, including women and
minority students, into engineering and transitioning them to a four-year
engineering programs. Another result will be an exploration of how and to what
extent university-CC-high school-parents collaborations impact these
interventions. The outreach efforts will inform and encourage more undecided
students to consider engineering. Moreover, the METS program, with its emphasis
on research, will produce more engineers with a broadened view of engineering
opportunities, including graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;
