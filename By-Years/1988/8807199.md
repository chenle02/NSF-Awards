This project deals with the dynamic control of the welding process. The
objective of the research is to investigate simultaneous adaptive control over
two variables of the welding process. This will be accomplished by using
advanced infrared sensing techniques to monitor the thermal field in the
vicinity of the weld pool. While both theoretical solutions and experiment agree
sufficiently to enable dynamic control of one weld variable such as seam
tracking, the simultaneous identification, sorting and correction of two or more
perturbations presents an immense problem in theoretical and practical analysis.
This research will develop theoretical and experimental tools to identify, sort
and understand changes in surface temperature distributions resulting from the
simultaneous encountering of two or more defects. Theoretical models of heat
transfer will be advanced to describe the surface temperature distribution for
simultaneous perturbations in the process. Computer hierarchial methods of
analyzing the thermal fields and the implementation of the control responses
will be developed. The ultimate result of this research will be the advancement
of the scientific basis upon which future machines may be produced that are
capable of eliminating defective welds and increasing the productivity of the
welding process.
