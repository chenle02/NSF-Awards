This award supports the development of millennial scale climate records from
Lake Hovsgol in Northwest Mongolia. The Lake is located along the present summer
pathway of the subpolar jet stream over interior Asia that controls the westerly
transport of moisture into the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
research are to advance the understanding of large-scale atmospheric circulation
patterns in the Northern Hemisphere and document changes in meridional heat
gradient during interglacials. Specifically, the researchers will examine a 1.4
million year lacustrine sediment core recovered from the Lake and covering the
Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The importance of this Transition is the apparent
change in orbital variability from a system dominated by obliquity (40,000-year
orbital cycles) to one dominated by eccentricity (100,000-year orbital cycles).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly interdisciplinary and international research
project will help support a Master's level graduate student and support
international partnerships among the University of South Carolina, the Siberian
Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, and several research institutions and
universities in Japan and South Korea.
