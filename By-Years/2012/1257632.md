This project will document a suspected peak in marine animal diversity in the
Earth?s most diverse marine realm. Investigators from the California Academy of
Sciences (CAS), in collaboration with numerous other US and Philippine
institutions, will document the kinds of marine organisms in the Coral Triangle
of Southeast Asia, focusing on the "center of the center of biodiversity," the
Verde Island Passage (VIP) of Luzon, Philippines. Researchers will assess the
extreme biodiversity across the VIP to determine species distributions, analyze
genetic diversity among species, and discover new species, including in the
Twilight Zone, accessible through advanced underwater technology that allows
exploration at depths below those reached with traditional scuba diving.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish crucial baseline information on
biodiversity at key VIP localities before further impact of global climate
change and human development activities. Results will inform regional and global
conservation and management policies, and engage the public in protecting coral
reef communities integral to oceanic and human health. Data and collections will
be preserved and cataloged, and will be available for study into the future.
