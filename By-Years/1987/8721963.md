The Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Alaska has requested
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumen- tation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The equipment includes: -A Disk drive system for
increasing shared-use computing capabilities, -A rapid-flow chemical analyzer
for precisely measuring various chemical parameters in seawater, and -several
precision reversing thermometers. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research
and engineering projects.
