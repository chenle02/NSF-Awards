LAY ABSTRACT Proposal # : IBN-0133734 PI Name: Paul Colombo

This career development plan integrates teaching, mentoring, and research goals
within the context of Tulane University's mission to promote neuroscience
research and education. The educational goals include development of lecture and
laboratory curricula for the new undergraduate neuroscience major, and
recruitment of undergraduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented
in the neurosciences to participate in research training internships during the
summer months. The broad research goal of this project is to systematically
define relationships between two brain regions known to support different types
of memory among mammalian species: the neostriatum and the hippocampal
formation. Although the roles of these two systems have been dissociated
experimentally, the extent to which they function independently, cooperatively,
competitively, or in temporal sequence is not known currently. Moreover, the
time courses and cellular mechanisms of memory formation supported by these two
systems are not well understood. Memory formation is accompanied by brain
region-specific changes among neurons involved in information processing.
Hypotheses that these changes are memory- and brain region-specific will be
tested: neostriatal activation supports response, nonspatial, and procedural
memory, whereas hippocampal activation supports place, spatial, and declarative
memory. The current proposal employs two primary research strategies. The first
strategy is to use behavioral manipulations to induce learning-related changes
in cellular mechanisms of memory formation and to quantify those changes within
the neostriatum and hippocampal formation. The second research strategy is to
test the effects of highly selective protein inhibition on acquisition and
retention of neostriatal- and hippocampal-dependent memory. By combining these
research strategies, relationships between the hippocampal formation and
neostriatum will be elucidated during multiple types of memory formation at the
behavioral, brain systems, and neuronal levels of analyses.

In addition to the research goals of this proposal, two additional goals both
involve integration of research, teaching, and mentoring. The first of these
goals is to increase opportunities for neuroscience education and research
experiences for students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the
neurosciences by mentoring students in the laboratory during the summer, and by
outreach visits to colleges in the area. The second goal is to continue to
develop the undergraduate major in Neuroscience at Tulane University.
