In our own and in other species, physiological responses to stress can be
regulated in important ways by the social environment. Although much is known
about how the presence of key social partners can reduce the secretion of stress
hormones in challenging circumstances, almost nothing is known about how the
perception of the presence of the companion is transformed into neural signals
that ultimately reduce the stress hormone secretion. These questions will be
studied in guinea pigs, a species in which the ability of social partners to
reduce stress hormone secretion is well documented. This project will use
pharmacological procedures, which temporarily inactivate selected brain regions
to determine the effect of those specific regions on stress hormone secretion
during challenge, as well as on the reduction of stress hormone secretion in the
presence of a close social companion. These studies will provide new basic
information on the neural pathways through which stress hormone secretion is
regulated by the social environment. The results will also inform later studies
aimed at managing the negative consequences of stress exposure. The work will
integrate research and undergraduate education by involving promising
undergraduates interested in careers in the life sciences in every aspect of the
studies.
