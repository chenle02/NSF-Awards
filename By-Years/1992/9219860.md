One of the remaining fundamental questions in extensional tectonics is the role
of intrusive rocks which commonly are emplaced during extension. The Miocene
intrusive complex of the Eldorado Mountains of southern Nevada was emplaced
broadly synchronously with extreme crustal extension. It provides a unique
opportunity to investigate the nature and genesis of granitic and more mafic
magmas in extensional settings and the interplay between tectonism and igneous
processes. This project will employ field, geochronologic, petrographic and
barometric data to assess the role of the plutonic rocks in the tectonic and
volcanic history of this region. Results should apply to the general questions
of the relationship between pluton emplacement and extensional deformation, the
chemical and mechanical effects of plutonism on the upper crust and the origin
of petrochemical "fingerprints" of extensional igneous rocks.
