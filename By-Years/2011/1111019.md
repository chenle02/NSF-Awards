This project represents an interdisciplinary research effort to investigate the
effects of social identity on lender behavior in an online microfinance
community (kiva.org) and the selection of social identities. Social identity
research in economics predicts that a salient group identity and group
competition increases individual contribution to public
goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will apply social identity and
social preference theory to analyze the Kiva lending data at the individual and
team level. Results from the analysis will yield insights to one of the most
important yet unresolved problems in social identity research, the selection of
identity and the formation of norms within a social group. This work represents
the first attempt to bridge text and network data mining techniques with social
identity theory. Novel text mining and machine learning models will be developed
that advance the state-of-the-art of mining of online
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than one billion people globally live in
absolute poverty, most also excluded from the formal banking sector. To
alleviate poverty, microfinance programs emerge in many parts of the world to
provide small loans to the poor. Currently about 10 million households are
served by microfinance programs. This research investigates incentives to
increase lender participation and lending activities on Kiva. Preliminary
analysis indicates that the lending teams program is effective in increasing
loan activities. Results from the analysis will benefit Kiva and other
microfinance programs. Increased participation and lending activities will help
realize the World Bank's goal of serving 100 million poor households.
