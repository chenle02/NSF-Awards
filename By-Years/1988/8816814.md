The Wyoming Province of the western United States contains well-exposed
proterozoic to latest Archean igneous rocks that were accreted to the North
American Craton during Pre Cambrian times. The paleomagnetic technique offers
the possibility of determining the location of the origin of the Wyoming
Province and tracking its subsequent approach and assembly. This project will
collect paleomagnetic data from a number of mafic dikes and plutons using modern
techniques and 40 Ar/39 Ar age dates to establish crystallization ages and
cooling histories. Results are expected to make considerable improvements to the
present understanding of the Wyoming Province and to provide critical data
needed to follow the assembly of the large precambrian super-continents.
