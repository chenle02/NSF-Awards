The objectives of this research are to understand some of the principles of
chromosome function that relate to the control of gene expression, i.e.,
transcription. Specific area to be addressed concern (i) the mechanism and
evolution of dosage compensation in Drosophila (ii) the human fragile-X
chromosome: effect of imprinting, and erasure of the imprint, and transcription
of genes at that fragile site, Xq27.3. The methods to be employed include
genetic, molecular, somatic cell genetic, cytogenetic, and pedigree analysis.
The significance of this proposed research is expected to be an increased
understanding of chromosome function as it relates to transcriptional control.
Understanding is expected to be enhanced by the use of chromosome from two of
the best- understood organisms-Drosophila and humans. The basic biological
principles discovered in fruit flies sometimes have direct application to human
genetic biology; the converse is also true. This proposal gives two specific
examples of this relationship between research in Drosophila and humans in which
mutations that lead to the fragile-X syndrome, and Huntington's disease, provide
a basis for renewed investigation in Drosophila of chromosome imprinting and
dominant position-effect variegation.
