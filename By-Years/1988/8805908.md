A hierarchy of numerical models will be used to investigate the interactions
between radiation, dynamics and chemistry of the atmosphere, especially in
regard to climatic effects of increases in atmospheric trace gases. The three
year project will utilize 2-D models of the stratosphere and the troposphere to
study effects of trace gas increases on global and regional ozone production, as
well as the combined effects of changes in ozone and other radiatively active
trace gases on the tropospheric climate. There are significant differences in
initial radiative forcing between increases in CO2 versus other radiatively-
active trace gases. General circulation model simulations using the Community
Climate Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research will be carried
out to investigate any differences in subsequent climatic feedbacks caused by
increased CO2 and other trace gases. This project should enhance our capability
to model important physical and chemical processes that affect the climate
system and may lead to improved understanding of the extent to which C02
greenhouse warming will be augmented by other atmospheric trace gases.
