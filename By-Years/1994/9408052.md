9408052 Green This research will investigate the regulation and function of the
RNA-degrading enzymes (RNases) of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our
initial work has led to the biochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis
RNase profile and the cloning of three RNase genes. To augment these approaches,
several mutants of Arabidopsis with altered RNase patterns have been isolated.
Based on these studies, the objectives of the present project are as follows: 1)
Generate and utilize antibodies to study the location and regulation of
Arabidopsis RNases; 2) Characterize the RNase mutants by analyzing the progeny
of various genetic crosses; 3) Examine the function of Arabidopsis RNases via
mutant analysis and antisense approaches. Emphasis will be placed on the
identification of RNases that contribute to mRNA stability and/or phosphate
remobilization. This research should provide important insight into the roles of
RNases in fundamental processes that may be unique to plants or of broad
significance. Beyond its contribution to basic knowledge, this work could
identify RNases whose manipulation might lead to crop improvement. ***
