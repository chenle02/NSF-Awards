Deep sea high-temperature hydrothermal vents spew metals leached from rocks in
the seafloor up into the ocean as jets of concentrated fluids. When these hot
metal-charged liquids hit cold seawater at the bottom of the ocean as they exit
the vents, recent research has shown that nanoparticles of Fe, Fe-Cu, and other
metal sulfides form and are wafted upward into the water column. This research
investigates these particles and how far they are able to travel from their site
of origin. It involves complementary fieldwork at three deep sea hydrothermal
vents on the mid-Atlantic Ridge and laboratory experiments. The fieldwork allows
collection of new vent fluid samples containing dissolved and nano-crystallized
nanoparticles. Lab work consists of characterization of these natural particles
and a study of their chemical makeup, in addition to experiments designed to
determine their resistance to oxidation in seawater and fluids that range in pH
from 7 to 8. A primary goal of the work is to discover naturally occurring
mechanisms that allow these metal nanoparticles to resist aggregation, settling,
and oxidation in the ocean, allowing them to be transported long distances at
abyssal ocean depths where they form essential nutrients for chemosynthetic
organisms. The broader impacts of the work include a strong workforce
development piece that reaches from the high school to the graduate student
level. Both undergraduates students and a high school teacher will be involved
in the research and the teacher will also accompany the scientists to sea. The
work has impacts outside of its field in that it will (1) dramatically improve
our understanding the distribution and sources of essential chemosynthetic
nutrients in the deep sea and (2) improves our understanding of the behavior of
anthropogenically generated metallic nanoparticles in the ocean.
