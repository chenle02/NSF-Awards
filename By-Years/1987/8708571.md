This project extends past and current research on Bayesian inference,
econometric modelling and forecasting techniques. In particular, in the area of
Bayesian inference further research will be done: (1) to assess the properties
of estimates and predictions relative to asymmetric loss functions; (2) to
extend and elaborate work on optimal information processing and Bayes' Theorem;
(3) to report and extend results on invariant maximal data information prior
distributions; and (4) to continue research on minimum expected loss estimates
for structural coefficients. In the area of econometric modeling and forecasting
techniques, work on Bayesian state-space models have been developed and applied
in forecasting annual and quarterly data for the U.S. and eight European
countries. These models will be further refined and applied to data from nine
additional countries.
