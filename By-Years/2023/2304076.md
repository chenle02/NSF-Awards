The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of
an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit
organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship
opportunities via the organizationâ€™s National Hispanic Internship Program
(HNIP). Through HNIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and
Puerto Rico receive quality internship assignments through various federal
government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the
Federal sector that serve to help students make informed decisions and solidify
career objectives. By partnering with the Federal government, HACU has
successfully placed over 15,000 students in internships since HNIP commenced in
1992. To continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation,
a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will
broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM). Internships create a unique opportunity for
the Foundation to actively participate in strengthening the human capital
infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education and developing a
competitive STEM workforce.

The HACU HNIP program provides a robust internship experience that includes an
extensive recruiting process to attract a diverse pool of students in STEM
disciplines. The program is open to all students, regardless of race, ethnicity,
age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or veteran status. The
application, matching, and selection process are designed to connect students
with internship opportunities that best match their academic interests. Students
receive mentoring and professional development training throughout the
internship experience.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
