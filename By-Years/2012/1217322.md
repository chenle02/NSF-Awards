The investigator studies algorithms for problems that combine graph theory with
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One component of the proposal concerns sets of
circles that do not overlap, but meet at points of tangency like coins pushed
together on the surface of a table. The investigator will seek out efficient
algorithms for constructing circle packings and use them to find "Lombardi
drawings", a form of information visualization in which graph edges are
represented as circular arcs. These drawings resemble soap bubbles and the PI
plans to use them to characterize the patterns of adjacency that soap bubbles
can have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second component of the proposal concerns the
graphs formed from geometric objects by linking nearby pairs of objects by
edges; these graphs have many applications in data clustering, collision
detection in physical simulation, and architectural design. The investigator
will develop efficient data structures for maintaining mutual nearest neighbors
of dynamic points, and study nearest neighbors in tree-like non-Euclidean metric
spaces for which previously known methods are
inapplicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a third component of the award, the
investigator will study efficient algorithms for constructing cartograms,
visualizations of geographic data in which geographic regions are shown with
stylized shapes and distorted areas that represent numeric information such as
population. In addition he will study compact three-dimensional visualizations
of graphs as the sets of vertices and edges of three-dimensional polyhedra with
axis-parallel edges and to study Barnette's conjecture on Hamiltonian cycles for
the graphs of axis-parallel polyhedra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the
applications of these problems in information visualization, scientific
computing, and engineering, the broader impacts of this proposal include open-
source implementations of algorithms and the public dissemination of knowledge
via the creation of relevant Wikipedia articles.
