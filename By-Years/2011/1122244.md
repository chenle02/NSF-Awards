The Pacific field cricket has been introduced to Hawaii, where it is subject to
a parasitoid fly that finds its host by listening to the calling song of the
male crickets and depositing larvae that burrow inside the cricket and
eventually kill it. This puts the cricket in a dilemma, because calling is his
means to attract a mate, but also places him in danger. In some Hawaiian
populations, 50-90% of the male crickets now have a mutated wing that lacks the
apparatus necessary for calling. They are thus unable to call, which protects
them from the fly, but they then face challenges attracting a mate. This project
examines the consequences of such extraordinarily rapid evolution (the change
occurred over 16-20 generations) for the mating behavior of the crickets. The
hypothesis for the ability of this novel mutation to become established is that
pre-existing behavioral plasticity has enabled the silent crickets to achieve
reproductive success. The mutation and its effects will be monitored in the
field, and laboratory experiments will examine how early experience with the
acoustic environment influences mating behavior. During presentations to
university students and the public this research provides a compelling
introduction to many topics in evolutionary biology and animal behavior because
it features familiar animals ? crickets ? in an attractive place ? Hawaii ?
evading an unpleasant ?Alien?-like parasite via natural selection, which then
places the males in a dilemma with regard to reproduction.
