With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof.
Emanuel Waddell of Morgan State University will develop an in-situ near infrared
Raman probe laser ablation system for chemistry research. This multi-wavelength
pulsed UV laser ablation system with a controllable xy-stage will allow for the
fabrication of microfluidic systems and analytical sensors in polymer
substrates. It will also be capable of performing in-situ investigations of the
polymer surface via near infrared Raman spectroscopy. The instrument will result
in a clearer understanding of the surface chemistry that results as a function
of laser ablation, and will provide insight into the effects of local atmosphere
and ablation wavelength on the resulting moieties on the polymer surface.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The in-situ near infrared Raman proble laser ablation
system is a unique instrument as it will allow the in-situ, real-time
investigation of the polymer surface during the ablation process. The near-
infrared Raman analysis will provide a nondestructive method to probe chemical
reactions on the polymer surface. Development of this instrument will
significantly enhance research in the polymer sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
