Society's need to manage Arctic natural resources presents a pressing and
distinctive case for a methodology to integrate conflicting economic, social and
environmental considerations. This project will compare Russian and American
approaches to decision analysis and will focus on an enviromental concern
affecting all Arctic nations and calling for joint solutions: the past and
potential contamination of the Arctic and the impacts of industrial development
on northern regions and societies.
