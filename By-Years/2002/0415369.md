This project is focused on the development of new and effective methods for the
synthesis of conducting polymers and an understanding of how to optimize their
electronic and optical properties. Highly conducting, self-assembling block
copolymers containing conducting stereoregular polythiophenes that undergo
polymer phase separation to give conductive nanowires and other interesting
morphologies will be explored. Directed self-assembly will be achieved through
designed side chain and end group modification. The design and synthesis of very
stable conducting polymers will be coupled with the development of new
conducting polymer sensors, focusing on transitioning fundamental discoveries
into materials with commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Richard D. McCullough, of the Department of Chemistry
at Carnegie Mellon University. Professor McCullough's research efforts target
the design, synthesis, and study of conducting polymers. For these materials to
evolve from academic curiosities to components in real technological
applications (e.g., ink-jet printing, wires and contacts, polymer switches and
colorimetric biosensors), new, easy, and inexpensive synthetic methods and an
understanding of how to optimize electronic and optical properties are required.
The goal of this research program is the design, synthesis, assembly and
engineering of new conducting polymeric materials in order to optimize material
properties and to create new functional properties.
