This project, performed by the research group of Professor Cynthia Friend at
Harvard University and funded through the Chemical Catalysis program in the
Division of Chemistry at NSF, aims at understanding how to design new types of
materials that have the potential to improve energy efficiency and to reduce the
amounts of noxious pollutants in the air. The overall goal of this work is to
explore the potential for harnessing sunlight to drive chemical reactions
important in reducing energy use and improving the environment. The project is
focused on understanding how to capture the energy in visible light using small
structures (nanostructures) of metals and to use that energy for chemical
reactions. Training of members of the next-generation scientific workforce will
also be achieved through this interdisciplinary research.

The research will uniquely focus on versatile nanoporous materials because of
the potential for fuller utilization of solar energy through plasmonic
excitations that span the solar spectrum and because they are structurally
robust. Model systems, consisting of Ag (Au) nanoparticles supported on titanium
oxide(110), will also be investigated using a combination of theory, molecular-
scale imaging, and reactivity studies. The investigation of these model systems
will elucidate how important system properties (for example, the alignment of
the electronic states of the acceptor reactant molecules or the semiconductor
overlayer with the SPR excitations, the spatial extent of the SPR excitation,
the size and thickness of the semiconductor layer) affect the photo-induced
processes. Understanding of the reactivity of chemicals that are either volatile
organic chemicals (VOCs) or key reactants in chemical synthesis will be the
focus of the work.
