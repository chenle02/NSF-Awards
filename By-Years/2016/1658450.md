The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes
providing an unobtrusive blood volume pulse sensor that can be used for a
variety of applications. Through home health monitoring, the proposed sensing
product can be potentially improve health outcomes of recently discharged
cardiac patients. This will also reduce chances of heart failure after release,
which is one of the leading causes for hospital readmission. While application
can provide significant benefits to the health community, the proposed product
can be used for other services as well. The device can also serve as an
unobtrusive means to collect information for personal health, athletic training,
etc. The device can also be potentially useful in human-machine systems
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a flexible, thin
film heart rate sensing array. The device uses quantum dots, which have proven
to be an effective functional element for optical microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) devices. The proposed technology will use quantum dots in a MEMS device
as a new approach to optical measurement of Blood Volume Pulse. The materials
chosen allows the MEMS device to be a thin, flexible film, which will allow it
to be easily installed on flat, contoured surfaces such as a phone, computer
mouse, or clothing. This contribution to sensing technology will allow Blood
Volume Pulse to be measured when users come into physical contact with these
items.
