This project addresses concern that robots encounter great difficulty in
performing complex manipulation tasks because their control systems are unable
to meet the real time demands of advanced control algorithms. The research goal
is to address this issue by improving a recently developed computer architecture
which has shown promise in this area. The architecture combines multiprocessing
and vector processing to achieve extremely high computational speeds. Some
preliminary effort has been devoted to the development of the concept entitled
Robotic Instruction Processing System (RIPS). The research objectives of the
project are (a) to optimize the RIPS architecture by analyzing operating system
requirements, high level language compiler requirements, overall execution
speed, idle processor time, breaks in the execution pipeline, and requirements
on memory and register file size, and (b) to perform cooperative manipulation of
two robot arms using a dynamic force control method. The RIPS architecture is to
be optimized by performing two experiments, one involving the development of a
two arm robot control system, and the second involving the design of system
software.
