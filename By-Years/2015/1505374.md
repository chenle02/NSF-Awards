A critical barrier in drug safety is the inability to utilize public data
resources in an integrated fashion to fully understand the actions of drugs and
chemical compounds on biological systems. There is a need to integrate the
heterogeneous datasets pertaining to compounds, drugs, targets, genes, diseases,
clinical trials, and known drug side effect, and to develop effective network
data analytical techniques to identify or predict important biological
relationships. The integrated and associated information can be used to support
practices in drug development, evaluation of drug side effects, and related
scientific research and assessment. The proposed work can also be applied to
analyze patient payment patterns and predict their paying capability for coming
bills, and recommend better life-style by analyzing monitoring data from
patients. This can save cost of manual labor for searching and analyzing data,
and avoid errors generated by manual labor, and allows healthcare budget focus
on stringent issues of bringing better healthcare for the
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology (Data2Discovery DataHub
Platform) uses semantic integration and searching technologies to integrate
siloed data sources related to drug safety and enables search to find and
interpret associations which are hard or impossible to find using other methods.
The team will seek to commercialize the following tools or approaches: 1)
DataHub Integration: integrating data sources related to drug safety into a
graph database and connecting related entities across different datasets; 2)
DataHub Browser: allowing users to browse data/entities across different
datasets; and 3) DataHub Predictor: predicting semantic association based on
pre-defined path patterns and biological similarities. These tools can be used
to facilitate domain experts to generate hypotheses, and end users to understand
side effects of drugs that they are taking. These technologies have the
potential to revolutionize how knowledge is derived from data in domains where
the important datasets are large, complex and heterogeneous, such as healthcare,
life science and business analytics.
