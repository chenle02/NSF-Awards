Alan Goldman and Karsten Krogh-Jespersen, Department of Chemistry, Rutgers
University, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for the development of transition metal catalysts for the
insertion of unsaturated small molecules into carbon-hydrogen bonds. Their
approach includes computational screening, synthesis, evaluation of potential
catalysts, and mechanistic studies incorporating both experiment and theory. The
synthetic and computational catalyst development is based on an iridium complex
with a tridentate pincer ligand. The first generation catalysts in this system
show promising activity with respect to the insertion of carbon monoxide and
olefins into carbon-hydrogen bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
incorporates experimental and computational approaches to catalyst design and
may develop methods and approaches applicable to many other systems. Students
and postdoctoral research associates will learn how to use both sets of tools.
The activation and functionalization of carbon-hydrogen bonds is a major
challenge in catalysis science. Potential applications, in areas ranging from
organic synthesis to petroleum chemistry, include alkane dimerization,
carbonylation of alkyl groups to give aldehydes, and the alkylation of
aromatics.&lt;br/&gt;
