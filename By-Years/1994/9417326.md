9417326 Thompson This research program creates analytical models to describe the
evolution of microstructure in metal alloys experiencing steep thermal gradients
during rapid continuous heating, such as in the heat-affected zone of weldments.
The research develops analytical and numerical solutions to microstructural
evolution at and above the eutectic temperature. The models for microstructural
evolution predict grain size, precipitate dissolution, liquation during heating,
and solidification during cooling of liquid films that form along the grain
boundaries. Experimental studies compliment the analytical and numerical models.
Four experimental alloy systems are studied: a high purity metal (minimal solute
drag on interface migration); a binary solid solution alloy (solute drag on
interface migration); a two-phase binary alloy with no solid solubility (Zener
pinning with minimal solute drag); and a two-phase binary alloy with solubility
(Zener pinning with solute drag). A finite element heat flow model of the weld
heat-affected zone thermal cycle is tested by the data analysis. Carefully
prepared autogenous gas tungsten arc welds are made on the experimental systems.
The grain size, precipitate dissolution, and liquid film thickness are measured
as a function of position in the heat-affected zone. Analytical transmission
electron microscopy analysis is performed on samples specially prepared to
accentuate precipitate dissolution microstructures. A goal of the analysis is to
generate data on interface and matrix chemical composition gradients for
comparison to the analytical models of precipitate dissolution. %%% The strength
of welded assemblies depends on the strength of the weld metal and base metal
adjacent to the weld (referred to as the weld heat-affected zone). This research
provides a means of predicting microstructure-related defects and provides
design information to avoid their occurrence. ***
