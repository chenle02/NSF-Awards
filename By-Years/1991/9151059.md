Students are participating in a newly developed Nonlinear Lattice Dynamic
course, one of a set of experimental mathematics courses being developed at
Northwestern and one which cannot be taught without significant computer
facilities. Displaying features of systems of equations on the screen in the
classroom laboratory makes it possible to discuss and analyze how the whole
family of solutions depend on their initial conditions and to compare and
contrast how the nonlinear solutions are approximated by their linear
counterparts.
