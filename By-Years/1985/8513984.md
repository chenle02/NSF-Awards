Access equipment and 100 CPU hours on the Gray XMP/24 at Boeing Computer
Services will be obtained and very detailed finite element solutions for plane
strain growing cracks will be generated. The computations will determine the
evolution of the near-tip stress and deformation fields during stable crack
growth and estimate its functional dependence on the crack growth history. Crack
growth simulations will be performed for a deeply cracked bend geometry under
conditions which progress from small scale to large scale, including yielding.
Accurate numerical description of the near-tip fields will be sought for
different judiciously chosen load versus crack length histories. The overall
goal is to utilize these results on ductile crack growth equations and verify
them with experimental results.
