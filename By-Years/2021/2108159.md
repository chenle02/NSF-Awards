Most galaxies in the Universe are significantly smaller than the Milky Way and
are referred to as dwarf galaxies. The dwarf galaxies have shallow gravitational
potentials that enable them to spread the products of stellar nucleosynthesis
far and wide. The program will study how the gas surrounding dwarf galaxies is
connected to the stars within the galaxies. The investigator and her team will
deduce how dwarf galaxies acquire gas, process gas into stars, and finally
release gas and metals into the Universe. The program will also support
astronomy classes for inmates at an Arizona state prison. The investigator will
host workshops for graduate students involved in the prison education program on
evidence-based teaching techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will conduct a
census of stars and interstellar medium via optical imaging and spectroscopy
from multiple observatories and 21cm HI spectroscopy with the Green Bank
Telescope. These data will then be combined with QSO absorption spectroscopy to
unveil correlations between the content and kinematics of the circumgalactic
medium, interstellar medium, and stars in dwarf galaxies. By comparing the
results to predictions from various simulations, the investigator and her team
will identify the nature and impact of gas flow from dwarf
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
