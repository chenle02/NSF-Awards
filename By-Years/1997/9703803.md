9703803 Freund This Americas Program award will fund a 2-year cooperative
research project between Dr. Robert Freund, MIT, and Dr. Jorge Vera Andreo,
Universidad de Chile. They propose to study condition numbers on various
mathematical programming problems, with the purpose of improving various
algorithms. The aim is to understand the relationship between algorithms
performance and the inherent "conditioning" of a given optimization problem, and
to take advantage of such relationships to construct more efficient algorithms
for convex optimization. Convex optimization problems, and algorithms for their
solution, are of fundamental importance in applied mathematics, operations
research, and theoretical computer science. Through this research, the
investigators hope to shed new light on the underlying mathematics and on the
computational complexity and efficiency of solving those problems. ***
