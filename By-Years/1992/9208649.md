Identifying the way in which information is transferred from one nerve cell to
another in the spinal cord is important to understanding how the spinal cord
functions to produce normal motor behavior. Information conveyed by a neuron is
encoded in the rate and pattern of action potentials, or "spikes" transmitted
along its axon. While one neuron's average rate of firing has clear effects on
the firing of other neurons that it contacts through chemical connections called
synapses, there is little experimental evidence as to what details of firing
pattern may be transmitted from one neuron to another, especially for synapses
that have small individual effects. That evidence will be provided by the
research to be done under this award to Drs. Timothy Cope and Brian Clark. The
work will use the synapse of type Ia muscle spindle sensory neurons onto spinal
motoneurons, which is part of the familiar stretch reflex circuitry. In
addition, this work will yield important new information on how multiple sensory
neurons interact when their firing becomes partially synchronized, a situation
that appears to typify the action of stretch-sensitive sensory neurons during
dynamic changes of muscular length. The results of this research will be
significant in two ways: first, it will reveal what features of the spike trains
of sensory neurons are actually important for the control of muscles and
movements; and second, it will detail the influence between neurons that have a
relatively weak synaptic connection, thus shedding light on the mode of
information transfer across synapses. This basic research will contribute to
understanding the way in which the central nervous controls movement.
