To achieve maximum benefit from tiling, compiler optimization must exercise
more control over data movement and storage assignments than is commonly done.
Hierarchical tiling takes responsibility for several phases of compilation and
code improvements that are traditionally done separately, such as scalar
replacement, register allocation, generating message passing calls, and storage
mapping. It uses the mechanisms of explicitly naming and copying data to control
the movement of data up and down the memory hierarchy and to exploit all levels
of parallelism. Its effectiveness as a systematic framework for hand-crafting
highly optimized code has been tested on scientific applications for IBM SP1
system. This project will extend the research in compiler optimizations by
investigating the following: (1) Develop a parameterized machine model that
captures the architectural information needed to guide hierarchical tiling. (2)
Study interactions between tiling at various levels of granularity. (3)
Incorporate hierarchical tiling into the SUIF toolset. (4) Extend the work to
disk storage, explicit I/O and implicit paging virtual memories. (5) Validate
the approach using various programs on different parallel machines.
