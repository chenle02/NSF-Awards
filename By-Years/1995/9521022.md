Abstract Matalon CTS-9521022 The proposed work is essentially an extension of
research currently being carried out by the PI in the area of flame dynamics.
The primary objective of the proposed effort is to re-examine, extend and
generalize a model that the PI has developed for the flame speed dependence in
terms of curvature, strain and non-steady effects in the thin premixed flamelet
regime. Specific topics will include the investigation of the following: (1)
time dependent flame structure in which unsteady perturbation and large
amplitude solutions will be considered, (2) propagation in near-stoichiometric
mixtures, (3) effects of nonuniform mixtures on the unburned gas, and (4)
effects of interactions of a premixed flame with surfaces and in confined
environments. The general methodology will involve the use of large activation
energy asymptotics based on one-step global kinetics, with the addition of
allowing for density changes from unburned to burned gases.
