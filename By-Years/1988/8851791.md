This project enhances two undergraduate courses that make use of this
institution's existing human factors laboratory. Students using the laboratory
experiment with real-time data acquisition in a data- intensive (e.g., 50 to 100
sample/second) environment. Using the data acquisition setup supported by this
award, students take many more samples for longer durations than previously
possible. The data acquisition system also pre-processes the data from the
interfaced human factors devices to give students a greater degree of confidence
in their experiments than with manual systems. The equipment supporting this lab
includes networked Apple Macintosh computers (II's and SE's) with A/D interfaces
and data acquisition software. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
