The structures of a number of helical plant viruses will be determined at
resolutions sufficient to describe the intact viruses in molecular detail, using
the fiber diffraction methods already used successfully in this laboratory for
tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the U2 strain of TMV. The viruses to be studied
include viruses distantly related to TMV (cucumber green mottle mosaic virus and
ribgrass mosaic virus), and the unrelated potexvirus papaya mosaic virus (PMV).
The structure of the isolated coat protein of PMV will be determined
crystallographically. Mutants of TMV, predicted from the structure to be
deficient in assembly or disassembly, will be designed here and made by
collaborators. Their assembly and disassembly properties will be studied here by
electron microscopy and other measurements. Structures of mutants showing
significantly changed assembly properties will be determined. %%% These rod-
shaped viruses are the only viruses in which the entire nucleic acid genome can
be seen using x-ray diffraction methods. Studies of their structures are
important to understanding protein-nucleic acid interactions and the processes
of molecular assembly and recognition in biological systems. Assembly and
recognition are essential steps in many cellular processes, as well as in the
processes of viral infection and propagation. The studies proposed here are
therefore relevant to a wide variety of cellular systems of both medical and
agricultural importance.
