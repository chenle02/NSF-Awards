This project is establishing the Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering
(MACSER) Scholars program. The scholarships provide financial support to full-
time students who have demonstrated need and are enrolled in or plan to enroll
in our mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering
technology programs. Both part-time and non-traditional students are being
encouraged to apply for MACSER scholarships. Offering financial support to those
students whose current economic situation prevents them from attending college
on a full-time basis provides a mechanism that enables the student to shorten
the amount of time required to complete his or her respective program. It also
leads to an increase in the number of full time students enrolled in the
mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering technology
programs. By providing scholarship opportunities, the project is relieving some
of the burden full-time employment places on them, and helping to ensure
academic success. Extra efforts are being spent on increasing the number of
women and underrepresented minorities in the targeted majors as well.

The program provides a support network for scholarship recipients, which builds
community and is the cornerstone and strength of the MACSER Scholars program.
This network includes personal advising, academic support, mentoring, peer
tutoring, a virtual community, and MACSER workshops. These serve to increase the
academic success of students enrolled in the MACSER Scholars majors.
