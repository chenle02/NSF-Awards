Ralph Wheeler of the University of Oklahoma is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program for research on the development of principal
mode analysis (PMA) as a computational method for simulating the vibrational
spectra of polypeptides. Preliminary results from Wheeler's lab show that PMA
analysis is a robust new method that is more computationally efficient than
traditional Fourier transform techniques. The method is being applied to the
simulation of intra- and inter-molecular vibrational spectra of solvated
polypeptides and, thus, has a broad impact on molecular biology, particular in
the area of biomolecular simulation techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
