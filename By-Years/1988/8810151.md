The sensory cells of the inner ear are called hair cells, and they are
responsible for hearing and balance. With modern tools, there has been a new
sophistication in analyzing how these receptors work at the cellular level. This
conference will bring together biophysicists, biochemists, pharmacologists,
physiol- ogists and anatomists to focus on three major topics: hair cell
motility, information processing, and intercellular connections among hair cells
and nerve cells. The emphasis will be on reaching some consensus on these three
topics, since they have recently emerged as leading issues, as the technology to
address them has advanced in the last decade. The impact of this meeting is
likely to be a new formulation of the role of interactions between the
peripheral sensory system and the central nervous system, and will be important
to understanding sensory processing in general, as well as understanding
auditory and vestibular function in particular.
