This award supports an international workshop on electron systems and
superconductivity in condensed matter physics to be held in Rio de Janeiro from
July 9-13, 1990. The U.S. organizer is Pedro Schlottmann of Temple University in
Philadelphia. His Brazilian counterpart organizer is Dr. Gaston Barberis of the
University of Compinas in Sao Paulo which, along with the University of Sao
Paulo, is a very strong center for solid state (now called condensed matter)
physics. The participants will be an international group of leading physicists,
listed as an Organizing Committee (from the major universities in Brazil) and as
an International Advisory Committee in the proposal. In addition, this funding
will support the attendance of at least eight young investigators to be chosen
from those submitting abstracts. Two Latin American countries with strength in
low-temperature physics which will send representatives are Argentina and Chile.
The workshop is clearly in a critical area of physics, one in which both the
U.S. and Latin America have strong research groups. There has not been a
conference in this field of valence fluctuations on the American continent since
1981 so it is certainly timely to hold one now. Presentations of recent work in
the U.S. as well as Brazil, Argentina and Chile will stimulate future
developments and further collaborations between these scientists. The topic is a
major problem in condensed matter physics and is of currently intense interest
in the U.S. and Latin America as well as the rest of the world physics
community.
