Shen DMS-9500635 This project continues mathematical research on problems in
partial differential equations. Work will be done on boundary value problems for
elliptic systems in domains with rough boundaries which arise naturally in
practise. More precisely, resolvent estimates and fractional powers of the
Stokes operator in three-dimensional Lipschitz domains will be studied. The
results obtained will be used in the investigation of Navier-Stokes equations
which model the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid. Methods to be employed
include singular integrals, layer potentials, formulas obtained through
integration by parts, and interpolation. A second line of research concerns
Schrodinger operators with degenerate electrical potentials and magnetic fields,
which governs the dynamics of particles in quantum mechanics. Work will be done
on boundedness of certain operators which are the analogues of Riesz Transforms,
the non-classical eigenvalue asymptotics and exponential decays of
eigenfunctions. The approach to be used is based on a refined version of
uncertainty principal. Finally work will continue on the unique continuation
problem for the degenerate elliptic operators. Partial differential equations
form the backbone of mathematical modeling in the physical science. The role of
mathematical analysis is to provide qualitative and quantitative information
about the solutions. This include answers to questions about existence,
uniqueness and smoothness. The research supported by this award, aside from its
interest in partial differential equations, is very important in the areas of
applied mathematics and mathematical physics. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
