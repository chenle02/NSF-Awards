This project developments a "curriculum model" for the integration of mechanical
design and manufacturing. The design process begins by converting a concept into
a database using Computer Aided Drafting (CADD). The project equipment is used
in the study of computerized manufacturing systems and utilizes the CADD
geometry files as the basis 1)for Computer Aided Design (CAD), especially
analysis with finite element analysis, and 2)for Computer Aided Manufacturing
(CAM) including the creation and execution of Computer Numerical Control (CNC)
part programs. Learning progresses from topics courses in mechanical design and
manufacturing to a "capstone" semester-long group design project integrating the
design and the manufacture of a product. The equipment support for this
undertaking includes six (6) CAD/CAM workstations with appropriate peripherals
and software; and two (2) manufacturing workcells consisting of a CNC milling
machine, a CNC lathe, an educational robot, a vision system, bar code system,
manufacturing system components and a Statistical Process Control System. The
award is being matched with a greater amount (102%) by the principal
investigator's institution.
