Under this SGER grant, the PI will implement a physically-based parameterization
of the spatially varying vertical diffusivity in the ocean component of the
Community Climate System Model (CCSM). Recent observational studies show
vertical mixing in the ocean can be strongly enhanced over rough bottom
topography. The PI will evaluate the impact on the ocean's circulation, its heat
transport and its role in climate. The work is important because it will provide
strong diagnostics underpinning of simulated climate variability of the CCSM
using a new physically-based scheme for diffusivity in the ocean model.
