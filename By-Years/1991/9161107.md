The proposed research intends to develop a highly integrated package that will
allow the forest manager to use forest stand information contained within a
geographic information system (GIS), as input into a forest growth and yield
model (FGYM). Spatially oriented projections of future stand volume will be
created for incorporation into the GIS. The projections will also be used as
input into a timber harvest optimization routine (THOR). The optimization
routine will give the forest manager the economically optimum and scheduling
solution that meets mill, harvesting equipment, and personnel constraints. This
package will be microcomputer based and rely on the Erdas 'GISMO' GIS modelling
language. Initial program development will focus on the Great Lakes region. The
program architecture will be robust, thus permitting export to other forest
regions and to agriculture.
