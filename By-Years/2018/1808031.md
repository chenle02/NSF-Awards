Proteins are the microscopic workhorses of biology and are able to exquisitely
perform a wide variety of functions when used in biotechnology. A common problem
with proteins though is their poor stability to environmental conditions.
Proteins can rapidly lose activity at elevated temperatures or in chemically
harsh environments. A common strategy employed to address this issue is to
directly attach a polymer to the protein to improve upon stability. Prof.
Pokorski and his team at the University of California, San Diego are designing
new approaches to streamline the synthesis of protein-polymer hybrids, introduce
new function into the polymeric element, and develop methods to modify the
protein precisely without impairing its natural function. Furthermore, the team
will utilize the research platform to train high school, undergraduate and
graduate students to continue to position our nation as a leader in science and
technology for future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pokorski and his
team are developing approaches to perform ring-opening metathesis polymerization
(ROMP) directly from the surface of a protein macroinitiator. ROMP is
challenging under aqueous environments and in complex media that includes
proteins. The team aims to optimize grafting-from chemistry in order to
precisely control molecular weight, introduce new function to the polymers, and
site-specifically label proteins distal to their active sites. The research
focuses on three specific aims: 1) optimizing the protein macroinitiator complex
to create living polymerization process where molecular weight and dispersity
are easily controlled, 2) expand the monomer scope to include zwitterions,
oxanorbornenes, and cyclooctene monomers, and 3) site-specifically label
proteins and the N- and C-terminus, as well as specific amino
acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
