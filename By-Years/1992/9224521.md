This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research explores
computer vision for recognition of three- dimensional curved objects. A new
technique for object modeling and recognition will be developed, based on
representing objects by discrete meshes of points, and mapping of the meshes to
a spherical representation. The algorithms developed in this project reduce the
problem of matching and pose determination to one of finding the best rotation
between two spherical maps. This is done without using any combinatorial search.
These algorithms lead to a robust and computationally deterministic approach to
object recognition. By removing most of the shape constraints imposed by
conventional methods, they make object recognition possible in a wider range of
applications. Finally, by allowing for shape matching in the presence of
occlusions, they remove a major limitation of existing approaches based on
spherical representations.
