9602893 Hammock Specific Degradation of Juvenile Esterase Hormone The objective
of this collaborative research project between Dr. Bruce Hammond of the
University of California, Davis and Drs. John Oakeshott and Terry Hanzlik of the
Division of Entomology, Black Mountain Institute of Plant Production and
Processing, Canberra, Australia, is to examine the role of specific uptake and
degradation of juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) in insect metamorphosis. The
investigators will test the hypothesis that JHE titer is in part regulated by a
specific and efficient system for its degradation. The first approach will
involve the cloning and expression of the JHE from one or more evolutionary
distant species of insects. A second step hypothesis will be tested regarding
uptake and degradation based on a combination of chemical and molecular
approaches. The long term goal of this research is to expand our knowledge of
insect development. ***
