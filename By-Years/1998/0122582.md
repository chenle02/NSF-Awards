EI: An Integrated Undergraduate Program in Bioinformatics

This project involves the development of an interdisciplinary, integrated
undergraduate program in bioinformatics. In particular, the project's goal
includes the design of a program of undergraduate study that embodies an
interdisciplinary synthesis of the topics in computer science and biology
required for graduates to successfully pursue careers in bioinformatics. The
project also plans to implement, test, and refine the program of study so that
it may be used as a prototype for similar curricula at universities nation-wide.
Pedagogy foci are to design, integrate, and test approaches for teaching topics
in bioinformatics while providing research experiences for all students in the
program. The project is strengthened by the participation of a group of
academic, government, and industry bioinformatics researchers and professionals
who act as an advisory committee. The emerging science of bioinformatics seeks
to develop computational algorithms and techniques for analyzing large
biological databases in search of information that can be applied to specific
problems in the life sciences. This project addresses the education of
professionals with a background in this field and contributes to satisfying a
nationally growing workforce need.
