9361838 Pang Title: Design and Implementation of Network Protocols for Desktop
Multimedia Communications This project is funded under the National Science
Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is
designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small
high technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR
program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the
firm can do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project.
Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial
applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture
capital or other non-federal financing. This PhaseI project addresses the
networking requirements of desktop multimedia systems. Research is being done in
four areas: 1) network resource management to support multimedia traffic, 2)
multimedia transport protocols including multicast support, 3) multimedia
conference control, and 4) multimedia internetworking with existing room
teleconference equipment. ***
