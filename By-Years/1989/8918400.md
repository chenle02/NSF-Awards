One of the major anatomical differences between humans and apes is in the
construction of the pelvis (hipbones) which permits humans to walk with
habitually upright posture, whereas apes cannot. Although these bones are well
known from living humans and living apes, fossil fragments of this important
part of the skeleton are infrequently found and complete fossil pelvic bones are
exceedingly rare. Recently a nearly complete hipbone of the Miocene ape,
Proconsul, was discovered in East Africa together with fragments of additional
hipbones. The purpose of this research is to describe, analyze, and interpret
the functional morphology of these bones. They will be compared with bones from
a large sample of living and extinct anthropoid primates in order to interpret
their locomotor and positional repertoire. Some investigators have suggested
that Proconsul represents a mixture of hominoid, cercopithecoid and unique
features. This analysis will help resolve this question about the exact
phylogenetic position of Proconsul, a topic currently under considerable debate.
