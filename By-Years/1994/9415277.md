This proposal seeks partial support for a nonprofit workshop to be conducted
solely for the benefit of researchers and practitioners in the signal
processing, telecommunication, and mathematical statistics communities.
Participation from individuals in academia, industry, and government will be
strongly encouraged. This will be the second such workshop on cyclostationary
signals, and will be organized by the PI (Stephan V. Schell) and Dr. Chad M.
Spooner of Mission Research Corporation. It is organized partially in response
to the consensus among attendees of the 1992 workshop that another workshop
should be held, and partially in response to continued interest in the theory
and applications of cyclostationary signals among researchers and practitioners
in academia, industry, and government. NSF support of this workshop would be
used exclusively to encourage recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students working in
the field to attend the workshop. This encouragement would be accomplished by
providing an offset to the travel expenses incurred by these participants.
