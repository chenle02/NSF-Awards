Recently, a novel method for feedback control of linear systems called
"Generalized Sampled-Data Hold Function Control" has received attention. This
method uses extensively the power of microprocessors. The original feature of
the method, as compared to conventional sampled data control, is that one of the
design variables is the hold function itself, rather than just the coefficients
of the compensator. A preliminary study has shown advantages of this method as
compared to dynamic compensation: it has the efficacy of state feedback without
requiring state estimation, it easily allows simultaneous controller design, it
requires few on-line computations, but uses only computer memory. The purpose of
this research is threefold. The PI intends to achieve a better understanding of
the use of Generalized Sampled Data Hold Functions by solving a greater variety
of problems which are specific to this method, to formulate and quantify all the
design tradeoffs involved, and to develop rules of thumb for use in the
practical implementation of this method. Among specific problems to investigate
are: inter-sampling behavior, period optimization, stability margin
optimization, simultaneous stabilization, robust synthesis, tracking and
disturbance rejection, amplitude limitations, and nonlinear system
stabilization.
