9634337 McNider It is the purpose of this project to develop tools and linkages
between climate models and the hydrology of the Tennessee River. Specifically,
we will examine the relationships and techniques for assessing the thermal
quality of the waters of the reservoirs and stream sections of the Tennessee
River System. Previous studies have shown that the thermal quality of water is
critical to maintenance of the ecology of the river system and is a regulatory
constraint for industries along the river. This also a river attribute which may
be sensitive to changes in hydrological characteristics such as precipitation
evapotranspiration as well as changes in temperature. Thus, it is of concern in
climate change scenarios. In order to build and test thermal quality assessment
models we will emphasize modeling the 1988-1989 period which represents the
biggest hydrological contrast in the present climate record for this region. The
project will utilize mesoscale atmospheric models to develop higher resolution
inputs to the hydrologic models, physically based hydrologic models to
characterize streamflows and a reservoir analysis model to translate physical
information into economic and environmental quality measures. The objective of
the study is to determine whether a global scale model can capture the important
interannual signals affecting regional hydrology and whether this information
can be propagated with fidelity through a mesoscale model through a hydrology
model to a thermal quality model to replicate actual impacts.
