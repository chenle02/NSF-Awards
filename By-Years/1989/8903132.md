This award supports the resarch of Professor G. Neil Robertson of Ohio State
University and his postdoctoral associate Dr. Igor Kriz. The project is a
continuation of joint work of the Principal Investigator with P.D. Seymour on
problems related to well-quasi-ordering of finite graphs under minor inclusion.
The beginnings of Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but it is
mostly in the last half-century that the field has become an active, fertile,
and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of lines ("edges")
joining points ("vertices"), so that the language of graphs becomes a natural
way of describing interrelationships among separated entities. The uses of Graph
Theory abound not only in Communications Theory but in surprisingly many parts
of mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as Theoretical Computer Science.
