Professor Chen will work on the problem of prescribing curvature on manifolds
which have the topological type of a sphere. In addition, he will attempt to
apply variational methods to reprove the classical uniformization theorem and
prove an extension of the theorem to surfaces with conical singularities.
Variational methods will also be used to classify solutions of some nonlinear
partial differential equations of differential geometry and to study solutions
of nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems for domains in Euclidean space.
The research supported by this award is frequently referred to as global
analysis. It attempts to find and describe global solutions to nonlinear partial
differential equations on a surface or manifold. These equations describe local
properties of the surface such as curvature. The research, therefore, seeks to
relate local information to global information.
