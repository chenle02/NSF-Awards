The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the use of ortho-quinone
methides (o-QMs) as building blocks for organic synthesis. This study will begin
with work on ways to use o-QMs to provide access to phenols which have been
functionalized ortho to the hydroxy group. Ortho quinone methides are generated
in situ and then trapped by 1,4 conjugate addition to directly provide
functionalized phenols or trapped by 4 + 2 cycloaddition reactions. Asymmetric
protocols for the 1,4 conjugate addition to o-QMs will then be developed and the
adaptation of this o-QM chemistry to solid supports will be studied. The
synthetic methodology developed in this project will be used in the syntheses of
natural products, robustadial A, heliquinomycin and diinsininol. In this CAREER
proposal, Dr. Pettus also presents ideas for modifications to the undergraduate
organic chemistry lecture and laboratory classes at UCSB.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational plans of Dr. Thomas R. Pettus of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Santa Barbara. Dr.
Pettus will explore chemical reactions of compounds which contain a functional
group (reactive site) known as an ortho-quinone methide (o-QM). Ortho-quinone
methides can be generated in situ and then used to produce a variety of aromatic
compounds which have heretofore been difficult to make. The synthetic
methodology developed in this project will be used in the syntheses of natural
products, robustadial A, heliquinomycin and diinsininol. These natural products
posess a wide range of biological activities. Students trained during the course
of this research work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical and
speciality chemicals industries. In this CAREER proposal, Dr. Pettus also
presents ideas for modifications to the undergraduate organic chemistry lecture
and laboratory classes at UCSB.
