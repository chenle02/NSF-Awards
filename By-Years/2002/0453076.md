This doctoral dissertation research project will be conducted in two parts.
First, a series of agent-based computer simulations will be run. These
simulations will build on previous efforts to replicate biased networks that
look like actual social networks and will incorporate empirical information
about the extent to which the personal networks of participants in existing
studies are systematically biased on the basis of personal characteristics or
structural properties of relationships (clustering). Second, predictions based
on simulations of voter turnout within these biased networks will be tested
against recorded voting behavior in a large, urban county in the Southern U.S. A
series of interviews with candidates and political parties will be conducted,
and information about campaign activity and voter turnout will be mapped using
geographic software in order to test the predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project advances understanding in both the substantive study of voter turnout
and in the methodological study of social simulation. Substantively, the project
provides a formal model of voter turnout that generates realistic turnout
levels, is compatible with both rational self-interest and extra-rational
motivation, and can replicate numerous empirical findings. This model provides
novel predictions about the best ways to maintain and further increase voter
turnout levels in both local and national elections, as well as how to increase
the representativeness of the electorate. Methodologically, this project
contributes to the specific problem of modeling social context. The intensive
modeling efforts detailed above will allow improvements to and verification of a
less computationally intensive, more user-friendly approach to modeling social
context to be made available to other researchers as a network construction
class in a popular simulation toolkit. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research
Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising
student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
