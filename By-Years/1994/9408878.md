9408878 Rose The award is for the development of appropriate ultrasonic sensors
for monitoring of powder injection molding processes. Ultrasonic sensors will be
used in the die cavity to sense conditions such as short shot/incomplete
fillings, flash, jetting, coring, porosity or voids, cracking, feedstock
inconsistencies, and density variations. Real time monitoring of the melt front
is also proposed. In addition to bulk wave techniques, guided waves techniques
will also be used to enable more complete in situ monitoring of the material in
the die cavity. Material characterization studies will also be performed and
will include bulk and shear moduli from the ultrasonic measurements. Improved
understanding of the powder injection molding process will result from use of
the sensors to be developed here. High performance products developed for
aerospace, automotive, and medical applications are expected to benefit form
this technology.
