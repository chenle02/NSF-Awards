Undergraduate students in two research methods courses are being provided with a
computer lab to give them direct exposure to research methods. The computer lab
is used by research design students to simulate experiments that illustrate
fundamental design principles. The lab is used by research applications students
to perform replications of some important recent experiments in a number of
fields of psychology, and to select individual final experiments from a large
number of studies already in the literature or to create variations of those
studies. The equipment consists of a network of 12 stations and a
controller/file server as well as additional hardware and software to conduct
and simulate the experiments. Undergraduates can gain hands-on experience with
some of the most important psychological experiments while learning the
principles of research and research design. This should help them learn problem
solving and probabilistic reasoning as well. Students should learn more and be
more enthusiastic about research as a result of using this lab. The university
will contribute an amount equal to the award.
