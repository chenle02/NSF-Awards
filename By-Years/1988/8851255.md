This project will support a microcomputer laboratory for the purpose of
exploring the uses of interactive computer graphics in teaching calculus and
developing laboratory activities for each of the courses in calculus at the
University of the Pacific. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated goal of improving
"the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop
new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses
in science, mathematics, or engineering." Laboratory exercises will be devised
and tested with the objectives of developing students' conceptual understanding,
furthering their mathematical intuition and capacity for three-dimensional
visualization, and promoting their interest in mathematics. Laboratory manuals
will be published for each course in the calculus sequence.
