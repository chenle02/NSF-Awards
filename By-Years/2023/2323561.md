This travel grant supports 12 early career scientists to attend an international
workshop in Cargese, France that will gather researchers from around the world
to present results, discuss, and collaborate around the theme of subduction
dynamics. The workshop will be held in October, 2023, building on international
momentum to support this multidisciplinary subduction zone research.

Subduction zones are a natural laboratory to investigate a number of significant
geohazards that pose risk to society, including earthquakes, tsunamis,
volcanoes, and mass wasting events. Facilitating international collaboration and
fostering new connections between early career scientists will enable the
multidisciplinary and international science of subduction zones. The workshopâ€™s
structure is designed to train and support students and early career scientists
who are starting their careers in subduction zone science by: (1) providing them
an overview of state-of-the-art science; (2) training them in using novel
methodologies and approaches; and (3) creating opportunities to make new
connections with colleagues from around the world. The travel support will be
broadly advertised though various venues that support sciences related to
subduction zones and earthquakes processes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
