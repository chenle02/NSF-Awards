We propose to purchase a photon-counting video imager capable of recording
digital images of low level biological luminescence. This instrument will be
used primarily by a group of faculty in experimental plant biology, most of whom
are already collaborating in a research and training program sponsored by the
McKnight Foundation. A common theme among major users is the need for a non-
destructive gene expression assay. Our experiments require repeated analysis of
the same material during various physiological and developmental transitions,
and we wish to develop mutant isolation procedures for which a non-destructive
assay is absolutely required. We propose to meet these needs by using by using
photon counting video imaging techniques to visualize and quantify gene
expression in transgenic plants containing chimaeric genes with firefly or
bacterial luciferases as reporters. Individual projects will seek to identify
mutations affecting trans-acting regulators of plant gene expression or viral
DNA replication, to identify developmentally regulated enhancers in plants by
"enhancer trapping", to follow virus movement during the infection process, to
monitor transgene expression in vivo in the early stages of plant
transformation, and to study genes involved in heterocyst development in
cyanobacteria.
