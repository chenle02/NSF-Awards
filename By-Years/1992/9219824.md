9219824 Rubin Field observations indicate that zones of inelastic deformation
produced at the tips of propagating dikes can be much larger than those produced
at crack tips in laboratory rock fracture experiments. This is in direct
conflict with the concept that "fracture toughness" is a rock property,
independent of scale and loading configuration. Even at shallow depths, rock
fracture in the Earth takes place at sufficiently high confining pressure that
standard concepts of engineering fracture mechanics do not apply. These results
have been applied primarily to interpreting outcrop-scale observations of
inelastic deformation produced by dikes and their geologic implications. This
work will extend this analysis and approach to larger scales of deformation, and
in particular to the interpretation of earthquakes associated with magma
transport in volcanic regions. ***
