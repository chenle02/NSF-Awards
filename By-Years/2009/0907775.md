Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (University of Georgia) proposes to support
technical services on R/V Savannah, a 92? general purpose UNOLS research vessel
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. They will provide a technician on most cruises to maintain and
assist scientists in the use of shared-use instrumentation at sea. The technical
services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items
from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget in this
proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
