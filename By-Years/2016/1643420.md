This award, under the direction of Professor Ronen Plesser of Duke University,
supports a series of regional conferences in mathematical string
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is the leading contender to unify
general relativity and quantum field theory, two of the most significant
developments of twentieth-century physics. This award provides support for a
series of bi-annual regional meetings in North Carolina and Virginia which focus
on the mathematical aspects of this subject. Research in this area not only
advances our understanding of fundamental physics but has also proven to have
extremely fruitful interactions with mathematics. As a result, research in this
area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science. These
meetings fill a critical need by regularly bringing together isolated research
groups to collaborate and hear research talks on various aspects of mathematical
string theory. These meetings also provide essential training for students and
postdocs, both by exposing them to a wide array of ideas as well as giving them
a forum in which to give talks, thereby substantially aiding both training and
research efforts.
