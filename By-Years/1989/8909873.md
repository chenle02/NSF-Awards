Conventional probability theory has, since the 17th century, been enormously
successful in characterizing chance, uncertainty, and indeterminate phenomena.
Its success has been so great that there has been little interest in developing
alternatives to the conventional position. Professor Fine and his students are
continuing their long-term study of the structure, interpretation and
application of one alternative, the frequentist theory of lower probability,
which they believe offers considerable advantages over the traditional approach.
By "lower probability" they refer to a probability-like but superadditive
nonnegative and unit formed set function, examples of which include the familiar
countably and finitely additive probability measures, the widely discussed
belief functions pioneered by Demster and Shafer, the lower envelopes studied by
Kyburg, Levi, Suppes, Walley and others, and the class of undominated lower
probabilities introduced by Professor Fine and his students. Under this renewal
grant, they aim to develop lower probability- based reasoning about
nondeterministic physical and natural phenomena and particularly the development
and study of a theory of statistics that can coordinate time series data with
the lower probability models that are provided by the statistical theory. They
expect to exploit their recently developed definition of lower expectation as a
basis for a theory of estimation and for learning from observations through
conditioning. While the interpretations of lower probability offered by others
have been of either subjective or epistemic varieties, their efforts will
continue to concentrate on the possibilities of an objective frequentist-related
interpretation. This research on an objective interpretation of lower
probability should also enhance our understanding of such interpretations for
conventional probability.
