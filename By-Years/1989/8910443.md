A new class of foam materials which exhibits overall negative Poisson's ratio
and high resilience has been developed in early experiments. The concept is
based on developing re- entrant walls or edges in the individual foam units by
simple manipulation of a regular foam. Extension of the concept to various
polymeric and metallic materials will be explored and the relationships between
structure, processing, and properties will be examined in order to develop
deformation maps and determine potential areas of application.
