This award to Cornell University's Department of Geological Sciences is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire a digital image processing system. The
University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The
equipment will be used in the University's undergraduate geoscience courses from
the introductory to the senior research projects level in order to make possible
student access to the University's considerable research library resources of
digital data. Images for analysis and study will be drawn from sources such as
the Landsat Thematic Mapper, SIR-B Shuttle imaging radar, SPOT satellite
imagery, COCORP reflection profiles of the U.S. continental crust, and various
other gravity, topography and seismicity digitized data sets. The library
provides a rich source of images of landforms and earth-interior geophysical
information for illustrating structures in introductory courses and for problem
solving exercises based on real examples for more advanced courses.
