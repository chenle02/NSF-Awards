WORKSHOP ON UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION AND ERROR ESTIMATION

A workshop will be held at the Johns Hopkins University on November 13-14, 2003
to developa research plan for the role that Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) can
and must play within Computational Science and Engineering. In particular, it is
postulated that UQ contributes to broaden the definition of Error Estimation to
include errors associated with models, data, statistical analysis, and inverse
analysis. From this perspective, it is desirable to seek a framework whereby all
of these errors can be abstracted and modeled simultaneously. This will provide
a rigorous and rational bridge between model-based predictions and experimental
evidence. The workshop will bring together experts in the fields of Error
Estimation, Uncertainty Quantification, Experimental Mechanics, and a variety of
Application areas. Their charter is to identify an ambitious albeit achievable
mission for UQ. The first day of the workshop will involve seven overview
presentations that will underscore the state-of-the-art in the key individual
science areas. The second day will involve eight break-out sessions developed
around an application area which is meant to highlight certain the significance
of Uncertainty Quantification to the state-of-practice, and a path for achieving
that. It is anticipated that a synthesis of the outcome from all break-out
sessions will give a more defined shape to the significance of UQ and its role
in science and technology.
