This action is to recommend Dr. Janis Weeks for the Presidential Young
Investigator Award. Her specialty is the electrophysiology of invertebrate
systems. She has already contributed a great deal to the understanding of the
leech nervous system and how it produces the swim rhythm. Her work on the
characterization of moth eclosion motor patterns established her as one of the
premier neurobiologists in the business of explaining pattern generation in
neural terms. She has also made major contributions regarding how specific
hormones control motor programs in invertebrates. This body of work has lead her
into the area of hormones and how they effect the developing nervous system and
behavior. Since most of our detailed information about the human nervous system
comes from earlier studies first done on invertebrate preparations it is wise to
support the best and the brightest of these scientific types. Dr. Weeks is of
that category.
