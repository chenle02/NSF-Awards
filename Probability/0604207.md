The project aims to establish new results in three diffeent topics of stochastic
analysis. First, a new approach for estimating the negative moments of the
solutions to linear stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type
will be developed. These estimates will allow us to derive the regularity of the
probability law of the solution at a finite number of points using the
techniques of Malliavin Calculus. A second objective is to further develop the
stochastic calculus with respect to the fractional Brownian motion and related
processes using both Malliavin Calculus and path-wise techniques. Our third goal
is to establish chaotical central limit theorems for the asymptotic behavior of
different types of functionals of a Gaussian process. Examples of these
functionals include the self-intersection local time of the fractional Brownian
motion, and power variation and related functionals of stochastic integrals.

Stochastic analysis is a modern area in mathematics which aims to study ordinary
and partial differential equations perturbed by a random noise. These equations
play a central role as models in many areas in physics and economics. In order
to derive important properties of the solutions, like to compute the probability
that the solution takes values in some interval, one needs to apply suitable
mathematical techniques like the Ito Calculus and the Malliavin Calculus. We aim
to make substantial contributions to the development of these thecniques and
their applications to stochastic partial differential equations. On the other
hand, while the classical input noise used has independent increments, motivated
by some applications in hydrology, telecommunications and mathematical finance,
there has been a recent interest in input noises possessing a long memory
property like fractional Brownian motion. The development of a stochastic
calculus with respect to these long memory processes is also one of the aims of
this project.
