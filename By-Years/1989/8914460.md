Global climate changes occur naturally over long periods of time, but recent
measurements and theories indicate that man is accelerating these changes as a
result of industrialization. Since these changes may be irreversible, it is
essential that they be predictable and that society adjusts to avoid possible
catastrophic consequences. Support is being provided for a national workshop to
identify the engineering research needed to ensure the implications of decisions
made are fully understood. Attendees will be invited from all engineering
disciplines to become better informed on this multi-disciplinary problem, and to
contribute their expertise to a rational and orderly response. The workshop on
the engineering response to global climate change will be held in June, 1990.
Proceedings will be disseminated to help guide future research efforts.
