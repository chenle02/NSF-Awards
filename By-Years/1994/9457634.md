Automatic planning, as a sub-discipline of AI, has been around for over thirty
years. While formal foundations of the field have grown increasingly
sophisticated, progress has been slow in terms of applications of AI planning
techniques to realistic problems. An important reason for this state of affairs
is the lack of adequate understanding of search-control and efficiency issues in
planning. Accordingly, the PI proposes to develop systematic approaches for
improving efficiency of AI planning techniques, so as to facilitate their
application to realistic planning tasks. Specifically, he will (1) study the
fundamental design tradeoffs in planning algorithms, and use that understanding
to design more efficient planners, (2) start a multi-pronged project to
integrate speedup learning techniques, including plan reuse, search control
rules, derivational replay and abstraction into partial-order planning
framework, and (3) develop hybrid planning architectures capable of facilitating
structured interaction between planners and other types of domain-specific
specialists, including humans. Through industrial and inter-disciplinary
collaborations, he proposes to evaluate the resulting planning frameworks in
realistic planning tasks such as manufacturing planning.
