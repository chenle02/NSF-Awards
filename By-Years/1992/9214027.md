This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Dr. Joseph S. Merola of the Chemistry Department, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, on oxidation addition reactions of various organic
substrates to iridium phosphine complexes. The substrates involve E-H bonds,
where E = H,B,C,N,O. The reaction chemistry of the series of E-Ir-H compounds
thus generated will be investigated, especially with respect to the insertion of
unsaturated molecules into the E-Ir and H-Ir bonds. Thus, fundamental processes
occurring at the metal center in chemistry related to hydrogenation, catalytic
hydroboration, C-H bond activation, hydroamination, and hydroalkoxlylation will
be studied. Anionic groups on the iridium will be varied in order to promote the
catalytic activity of these systems. Some of the reactions will be carried out
in aqueous solution. %%% Oxidation addition reactions play an important role in
both catalytic and stoichiometric reaction chemistry of organometallic
compounds. The long range goal of this project is to develop catalyst systems
for the addition of E-H bonds to unsaturated organic compounds. This could have
important industrial implications but since the reaction chemistry of these
potentially significant processes is not well known, fundamental advances are
also anticipated.
