OIA-0313709&lt;br/&gt;Bissell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds
for core support for the National Academy of Science (NAS) Committee on Science,
Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP). Since its inception, the NSF has
provided support for this body, which serves as a principal surveyor of the
scientific and engineering landscape on issues of critical importance to the
nation. The committee interacts closely with the President's top appointees,
including the Director of the NSF and Chairperson of the National Science Board,
and chairpersons of key congressional science and technology -related
committees. COSEPUP undertakes major independent studies of national concerns in
U.S. science and technology policy. In recent years, for example, the committee
has administered prominent studies on the principles guiding the applications of
the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) to research, capitalizing on
investments in science and technology, international benchmarking of U.S.
leadership, and national goals for science and technology. In addition it has
developed a number of guides for students and faculty on responsible conduct of
research, mentoring students in science and engineering, and careers in science
and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
