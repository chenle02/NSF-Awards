9314412 Ramakrishnan This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research among three research groups at the State University of New York, Stony
Brook, the CNRS' Research Center in Information Sciences, and at the Nancy
campus of INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Information Sciences
and Applied Mathematics). The U.S. investigators are I.V. Ramakrishnan, Leo
Bachmair, and Jieh Hsiang and the French investigators are Helene and Claude
Kirchner and Michael Rusinowitch. The objective of their research is to
investigate the use of constraints in the design and implementation of high
performance deductive computing systems. They will focus on parallel automated
deduction with constraints; methods for fundamental operations in deductive
systems and program analysis of logic programs. This project takes advantage of
complementary expertise of the U.S. and French groups. The U.S. investigators
bring to this collaboration their strengths in theory and application. The
French group at Nancy are considered leaders in software development as it
relates to term rewriting and constraints. This investigation will impact
software design for high performance computing systems and has important
applications in logic programming. ***
