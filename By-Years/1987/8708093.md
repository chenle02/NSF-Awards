This grant will support experimental studies of heavy ion collisions at
energies between 6 MeV/u and 100 MeV/u. The objective is to gain information
concerning the mechanisms governing these complex nuclear reactions. The
experiments will be carried out using accelerators at Argonne National
Laboratory, the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State
University, and at the GANIL accelerator in France. Undergraduate students from
Hope College will participate extensively in the research. The grant is awarded
under the auspices of the NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
program.
