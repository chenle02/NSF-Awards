This project is to study magnetic NDE methods for surfaces. The research will be
conducted in conjunction with the Fraunhofer Institute at the Universitat des
Saarlandes. A main component of the research will be the study of NDE magnetic
effects related to the surface residual stresses such as are developed during
shot peening.
