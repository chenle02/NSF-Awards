This project concerns the application of two theoretical tools-successive linear
combination algorithms and blossoming- to a variety of curve and surface schemes
in CAGD (computer aided geometric design). A successive linear combination
algorithm is any algorithm that proceeds by taking successive linear
combinations of (usually) pairs of points or vectors. Examples include the de
Boor algorithm and Boehm's knot insertion algorithm. Blossoming is the technique
of associating with a polynomial curve or surface a multivariate multiaffine
symmetric polynomial that contains information about the curve or surface. The
two tools are related, and have been applied previously to Bezier and B-spline
curves and surfaces with great success. Here these tools will be applied to many
of the other curve and surface types-such as rational B-spline, Catmull-Rom,
Chebyshev, and multivariate spline schemes-that are of interest to CAGD.
Successful application of these tools will result in derivation of new
algorithms and new properties for these schemes, development of new surface
schemes, simplification and unification of parts of the theory of CAGD, and
ultimately in better practical tools for design and manufacture using freeform
curves and surfaces.
