This research program is centered on experiments addressing fundamental issues
of nuclear physics. An experiment is being designed to search for the neutron
electric dipole moment, an observable that violates the reversal of time and
plays an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics and on
the observed asymmetry of matter and anti-matter in the universe. Another
experiment will measure second order effects in electron-proton scattering to
address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there are on-going
experiments with cold neutrons measuring neutron decay parameters and the
strength of the weak interaction among quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will give research
experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute
to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The
advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of
this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes
the ASU's technical workforce and that of the society at large.
