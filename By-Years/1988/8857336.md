Research will be undertaken in the field of laser cooling and trapping,
particularly in studying the interactions between atoms in this ultra-low energy
sub-milli Kelvin temperature regime. These include direct (collisional)
interactions such as associative ionization, radiative association, and charge
exchange and indirect radiation effects such as super-radiance and radiation
trapping. One project is to create a sample of ultra-cold dense Rydberg atoms
and trap them using DC electric fields. It may be possible to observe a phase
transition (Mott transition) from an insulator to a metal when the size of
Rydberg atoms becomes a significant fraction of the average interatomic spacing.
