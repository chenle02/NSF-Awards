This award provides partial support for participants in the 2019 East Coast
Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held on the campus of The Ohio
State University October 12-13, 2019. The symposium expects between 50-70
participants, including many graduate students and postdocs. This will be the
seventeenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series.
The first meeting was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in the Fall of
2003, and since then, meetings have been held each Fall.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von
Neumann algebras) and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide
array of disciplines, including ergodic theory, number theory, representation
theory, and mathematical physics. The ECOAS enables participants to become
acquainted with the forefront of research in operator algebras and non-
commutative geometry and neighboring disciplines, while also providing early-
career researchers with the opportunity to present their own work, and network
and interact with each other along with senior researchers. More information can
be found at the conference website:

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
