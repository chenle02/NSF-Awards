This project is part of a cooperative magnetotelluric experiment with the
French on the South Pacific superswell. Instruments will be deployed for 4
months using French ships. The purpose is to determine conductivity structure
beneath the superswell the data should help discriminate models of plumes and
lithospheric thinning. Data will also be used to look at oceanographic motions
and these will be used to remove noise from data for analysis of earth
conductivity. Modelling will also be done. %%% Electromagnetic techniques
provide data on the deep structure of the earth that cannot be obtained by other
means. The data obtained here should proved a unique view of deep mantle plume
structure that will be important for providing constraints on the effects of hot
spots on oceanic lithosphere. Dr. Filloux is a pioneer in the field of oceanic
electromagnetic sensing.
