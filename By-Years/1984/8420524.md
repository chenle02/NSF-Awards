A severe problem for the nation's highway pavement is the determination of the
condition of the pavement and the question of the degree of deterioration.
Pavement managers are faced with the decision of when to repair or replace the
pavement. Current methods of determining the degree of deterioration of the
pavement are based on visual data which is slow and expensive to acquire. This
project will design and fabricate a prototype video imaging system which
consists of a moving vehicle with a suitable imaging instrument to record the
condition of the pavement. The interpretation of the images will be established
and a scoring system developed which will be used by highway agencies to assist
them in their management of pavements.
