0236378&lt;br/&gt;Whaley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Australia workshop on quantum
information science. The organizers for the meeting are Professor Birgitta
Whaley, University of California - Berkeley, Professor Paul Kwiat, University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Professor Robert Clark, University of New South
Wales, and Professor Gerard Milburn, University of Queensland. The workshop will
be held in Sydney Australia in January 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop
will bring together solid-state and optical approaches to quantum information
science, and explore opportunities both to advance research in the discipline,
as well as to strengthen collaboration between researchers in Australia and the
United States. Most of the participants will be senior graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and assistant professors, with the intent of fostering
international linkages that can then be developed during the researchers'
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
