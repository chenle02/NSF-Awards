Abstract CTS-0124536 G. Harrison, Clemson University

This project will investigate the effect of small amounts of elasticity on the
performance of fluids flowing through spray nozzles. The work is motivated by a
desire in the agricultural spraying industry to produce relatively monodisperse
drop size distributions that can be effectively targeted to specific crop
regions and can avoid dispersion over adjacent land. This general problem is
complicated by several issues, including (1) variations in nozzle design and
application method, (2) variations in fluid properties, and (3) requirements for
different sized drops for different applications. The research described in this
project will provide fundamental experimental results that will address all of
the issues outlined above. It is well known that adding polymer can enhance the
drop properties in spraying applications. This work will focus on well-
characterized elastic liquids that will be employed in carefully designed
nozzles to determine the impact of material properties and geometry on spray
properties.
