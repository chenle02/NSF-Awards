9522240 Chiang This Nano 95 award is for the development of a unique, variable
temperature UHV AFM/STM instrument which will allow unique control of the sample
temperature from 4K to 400K. In addition, the instrument will be coupled to a
surface analysis and preparation system for controlled sample conditions. New
types of scientific problems will become accessible with such an instrument,
including the adsorption of molecules on surfaces at low temperatures, the in
situ observation of chemical reactions as a function of temperature the
observation of surface transitions in both physisorbed and chemisorbed systems,
the direct measurement of forces used to move atoms on surfaces, and the atomic
scale mechanical properties of surfaces at low temperature. %%%
