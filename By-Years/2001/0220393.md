Many biotechnology applications related to secreted proteins have relied almost
exclusively on the sec pathway mode of protein transport. However, many
recombinant proteins are incompatible with secretion via the sec pathway for
various reasons. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes research to overcome
the limitations of secretory protein expression in bacteria by capitalizing on
the remarkable properties of the Tat secretion pathway. The PI proposes to
exploit the unique features of the Tat pathway to overcome the limitations
associated with secretory protein production and to develop completely new
technology platforms for combinatorial protein screening and analysis. It is
proposed to: (1) develop a useful technology for the high level expression of
secretory proteins via the Tat pathway, specifically the PI will: (i) employ
genetic means to identify leader peptides that maximize the flux of proteins
exported though the Tat pathway; (ii) utilize cell engineering methods to
further optimize protein secretion and (iii) examine in detail the effect of
growth conditions on secretory protein production, (2) develop methods for the
display of protein libraries by utilizing the Tat pathway and then investigate
the hypothesis that altering the pathway of protein secretion will result in the
isolation of additional and/or novel proteins capable of performing a desired
function, and (3) develop a new technology for the detection of protein-protein
interactions analogous to the yeast two-hybrid system by exploiting the Tat
pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
