Funds are provided to construct novel, light-based microscopes with a resolution
which is not limited by the wavelength of light and which are sensitive to both
the local dielectric constant and the local Raman spectrum. The instrument
exploits the properties of plasmons (resonant oscillations of the electrons in a
metal) to enhance the local electric field of a plane, line, or point-like
metallic structure to a level far above that of the applied light field. The
enhancement of the field heightens the radiated Raman intensity through the
well-known surface- enhanced Raman scattering effect. An image is formed by
scanning a probe; the probe is either: i) a point-like structure which results
in surface plasmon radiated light or ii) a small dipole plasmon resonator (e.g.
a silver sphere). The instrument has a wide range of applications for examining:
1) nanostructured materials, 2) patterns in integrated circuits, and 3) three
dimensional imaging of the internal structure of a biological or other soft
samples which are robust enough to survive "piercing" by a probe. In all cases,
the contrast of the images will be controlled by the local dielectric constant
and Raman spectrum. Thus, information on the location, structure and chemical
nature of the materials can be identified and mapped. The development of this
project will involve the participation of students and postdoctoral fellows. It
is anticipated that the microscope eventually will be licensed to companies for
marketinq and sales.
