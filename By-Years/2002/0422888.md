NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0206631&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Large
Solutions to Systems of Nonlinear
Equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0206631
Jenssen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this research is threefold. First, we
seek a better understanding of solutions to systems of hyperbolic (inviscid)
conservation laws that are large in either amplitude or variation. New examples
of explosive behavior will be considered, as well as conditions preventing
singular behavior. Next, we will consider the multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations for a compressible fluid and establish global existence of large
solutions with spherical or cylindrical symmetry. Finally, we will consider flow
describing combustion. This is modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations augmented
by equations describing the chemical processes. In this case we are particularly
interested in the stability of wave patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
deals with mathematical analysis of solutions to nonlinear partial differential
equations. The research will investigate systems of conservation laws,
compressible fluid flow, and equations describing reactive flow. Much of the
existing theory for such nonlinear equations applies only to small solutions.
However, large solutions are of great interest in applications such as gas flow,
combustion, and detonations, and study of these solutions requires new
techniques that will be developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;
