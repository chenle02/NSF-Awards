This award funds research on a class of multilayer perceptron- like neural
networks for classification problems. The algorithm uses linear programming
methods to incrementally generate hidden layers in a restricted higher-order
perception, which is trainable in polynomial time. The research will investigate
extensions of the algorithm to address classification problems with large
training sets, which normally take a long time to converge. Behavior of the
algorithm will be evaluated on representative problems from computer vision and
robotics.
