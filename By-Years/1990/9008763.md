Professor Eoff will study the linear topological properties of two spaces of
functions which turn out to be quasi-Banach spaces under their natural
topologies. One of the main problems involved is to characterize the Banach
envelopes of these spaces. In the case of one of these spaces, Professor Eoff
has a conjecture she will try to verify. The spaces involved are rather unusual
from many points of view in that many of the basic properties familiar to
mathematicians who work on function spaces are absent. However, these spaces
arise naturally in the analysis of certain types of functions and thus are
important to understand. Professor Eoff's research will remove some of the
mystery surrounding these spaces. This project is part of the Research
Opportunities for Women activity.
