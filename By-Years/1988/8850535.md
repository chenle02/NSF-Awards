The Education of Hispanic students, particularly in mathematics, continues to
be a pressing issue. Language factors such as bilingualism and limited-English
proficiency play important roles in Hispanic achievement in general; however,
the influence of language factors on the development of mathematical meanings
for this population has yet to be studied in detail. The purpose of this project
is to investigate linguistic factors (Spanish and English) which help or hinder
the acquisition of mathematical knowledge and understanding. This project will
conduct an ethnographic study of mathematics teaching in four elementary
classrooms with students of varying levels of English proficiency. The objective
is to gather contrastive data based on teacher-student interaction during
mathematics instruction. Data analysis will be guided by theoretical frameworks
drawn from research on mathematics teaching, on teacher discourse and the
development of meaning, and on bilingual learners. The results will be
disseminated to both researchers and practitioners and will contribute to our
understanding of the teaching of mathematics in general and the improvement of
instruction for Hispanic students, in particular.
