The problems of packing a set of objects into a finite container and of
covering some space by a set of objects are known to be hard (NP- complete)
computational problems. Geometric versions of these problems have many
applications in areas such a stock cutting in computer-aided manufacturing and
object recognition by templates in computer vision. The research is directed
towards tractable, yet interesting formulations of these problems by considering
the internal density of the packing or covering, that is by determining the best
way of arranging objects in an infinite space, ignoring boundaries. In the area
of path planning it will be investigated how the configuration of a set of
obstacles in the plane affects the structure of shortest paths that avoid the
obstacles. The research is particularly concerned with the conditions under
which the shortest path between two points is monotonic, that is, it does not
reverse direction relative to the line segment joining its start and goal
points. Monotonic shortest paths are of interest, because (1) shortest paths can
be found efficiently if they are known to be monotonic, and (2) many
applications of path planning involve shortest path queries that are monotonic.
