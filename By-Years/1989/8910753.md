Using available data, and in collaboration with scholars of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences (CASS), the official research arm of the Chinese government,
this study analyzes collective violence events in over a thousand counties and
in around a millenium of China from the Three Kingdoms period to the Southern
Song Dynasty (220-1,279). When completed, the project will generate the first
machine-readable, continuous, county-level historical statistical series for
over a millenium in China, not only on collective violence events but also 15
socio-economic explanatory variables like natural calamities, famine relief,
local constructions, level of taxation, number of academic degree holders, and
proximity to administrative capitols. As the first descriptive task, the study
will analyze the level of magnitude, socio-economic profile, spatial-temporal
distribution, as well as forms and repertoires of collective violence events. To
account for the above pattern, the researchers will relate levels of violence to
ecological and socio-economic conditions such as the intensity of calamities,
the availability of famine relief, the location and size of government troops,
as well as the proximity of mountain refuge, in order to determine their effects
on the motive and opportunity for participation in rebellions and banditry.
Beyond its intrinsic scientific merit, this first collaborative project between
the Institute of History of CASS and an American scholar will also enhance CASS'
readiness to collaborate with other U.S. social scientists.
