The PI proposes to explore a range of factors implicated in the maintenance or
reacquisition of a set of complex skills. He focuses on those skills that are
not used or reinforced for long periods of time after their initial acquisition.
The project is designed to test the efficacy of interventions, during initial
training and post-training, manipulating such factors as (a) massed versus
distributed practice, and (b) observation-based rehearsal. It will also examine
cognitive as well as personality individual difference factors. Many
professionals, including those central to emergency preparedness, receive little
to no follow-up training.
