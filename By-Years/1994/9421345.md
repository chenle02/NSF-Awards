9421345 Tarduno This award provides one-half the funding required to obtain
laboratory equipment for paleomagnetic research, including a superconducting
magnetometer, a thermal demagnetizer, an alternating field demagnetizer, and a
magnetic susceptibility bridge. This instrument system is to be installed and
operated in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University
of Rochester. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The equipment will be used
primarily in the research of the Principal Investigator and his qtudents in
three general areas: (1) Tectonics-geodynamics, (2) Magnetostratigraphy and
geomagnetic reversal chronology, (3) environmental magnetism and the fidelity of
the geomagnetic record. ***
