9629348 Wofford The 470,000-specimen herbarium of the University of Tennessee
contains significant collections of fungi, bryophytes, and lichens in addition
to vascular plants primarily from Tennessee and the southern Appalachians. At
present, the collection is overcrowded, and some specimens are stored in
substandard cases. This project will purchase a compactor system and 152 new
cabinets, some of which will replace substandard ones, but most of which will
provide expansion space and space for future growth of the collection. The
University is partnering with the NSF by providing building renovation and
increased floor space for all its collections including the herbarium; this will
be complete by late 1998. As a result of this project, the specimens will be
better curated, and therefore more accessible for scientific study (particularly
in support of a PEET project) and education. This abstract is on the H drive:
