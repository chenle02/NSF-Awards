9401197 Regev This award funds the research of Prof. Amitai Regev in algebraic
combinatorics. Prof. Regev will study the asympotics of character sequences, PI
algebras and Kronecker products. This work has implication for combinatorics,
representation theory and algebra. This research falls in the broad category of
combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At
its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting. Counting can be
incredibly difficult when the objects are difficult to list, and combinatorists
look for general methods for overcoming these difficulties. Today's
combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern
mathematical techniques. Although its roots go back several centuries, the field
has had an explosive development in the past few decades. This growth comes from
its importance in communications and information technology and from the success
of modern techniques to problems of counting.
