This research is a study of non-orthogonal multiaccess signalling schemes, a
generalization of the conventional orthogonal approach, in bandlimited and/or
fading channels. These signalling schemes are studied from the information
theoretical viewpoint and the work seeks the capacity regions , the ultimate
performance limit, of channels using these signalling strategies. Moreover, the
study will address the issue of designing signature waveforms to achieve these
performance limits, and attempts to establish relationships between signature
waveform design and multiuser coding theory. Following fruitful analysis in the
code-division multiaccess (CDMA) channel, a special case of non-orthogonal
signalling schemes, the project suggests the extension of the work to include
the general model. It is hoped to develop a unified theory in multiaccess
signalling that includes conventional signalling strategies as well as the
recently developed CDMA scheme. This approach will broaden understanding in
multiuser communications and lead to innovative designs in multiuser signalling.
Practically, the outcomes of this project are likely to play an important role
in mobile communications where bandwidth efficient multiaccess signalling
strategies are crucial for development.
