This project will connect observable features such as spiral arms, rings, and
holes in the disks of spiral galaxies to the physical processes that drive their
formation and evolution, using a combination of state of art hydrodynamic
simulations of galaxy evolution and multi-wavelength radiative transfer
simulations. The primary goals are: (1) to identify the physical processes
responsible for spiral structure, by comparing model predictions of infrared
continuum, neutral hydrogen, and carbon monoxide emission with available data;
(2) to explore the origins of multi-armed and few-armed spirals; (3) to
determine the spiral pattern speeds and stellar velocity distributions in Milky-
Way-sized disks and constrain the role of spiral arms in the dynamical heating
and radial migration of stars; and (4) to assess the effects of impacts by
satellite galaxies and dark matter clumps. The Principal Investigator and the
graduate student supported by the project will produce an atlas of simulated
galaxy images for comparison with multi-wavelength data. They will also create
an educational website containing an interactive presentation of their
simulation atlas and real images; and supplement the web presentation with
images and videos for planetaria and museums.
