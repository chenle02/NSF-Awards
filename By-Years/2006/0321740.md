This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel technology for laser-
enabled analysis and processing (LEAP) of living cells. The ability to load
cells with compounds is critical in many areas of research and medicine such as
drug discovery and gene therapy. Current methods have limitations with respect
to specificity, efficiency, toxicity, and/or throughput. Optoinjection is a
novel and versatile procedure for cell loading that has been demonstrated in a
few laboratories. Unfortunately, this is a slow, laborious procedure carried out
on specialized microscopes. Oncosis has developed the LEAP platform for high-
speed cell imaging and purification via lethal laser effects on unwanted cells.
Phase I results demonstrated feasibility for using the LEAP platform to
implement optoinjection in a high-throughput, cell-specific manner that would
enable the commercialization of this novel form of cell loading. Phase II
studies are proposed to optimize and implement optoinjection in biologically
relevant experimental systems, resulting in data supporting this powerful new
tool for the analysis and manipulation of living cells within a physiological
environment. The instrument design will then be configured for successful
commercial manufacturing, and further improvements in capabilities will be
pursued in order to maintain market leadership and to expand into other markets.

The commercial application of this project is in the areas of cell-based life
science research and drug discovery. Over $ 2.6 billion was spent during 2001 on
research instrumentation in academic life science research and commercial drug
discovery, and growth to $ 5.3 billion by 2005 has been forecasted. For the
specific application of optoinjection, LEAP provides many advantages over
current techniques including simplicity, robustness, efficiency, speed, high
viability, and specificity. The commercial opportunity for this platform is
therefore significant, as is the scientific enablement of experimentation that
is not currently possible.
