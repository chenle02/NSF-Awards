The overall goal of this project is to integrate quantitative analysis with
biology to provide a systems approach to understanding hepatocyte (liver)
metabolism in order to gain insights into Type II diabetes. The specific goals
of the project are to: (1) characterize a comprehensive set of metabolic
alterations in the hepatocytes induced by environmental factors with the aid of
metabolic flux analysis, (2) incorporate physiochemical information; namely,
kinetic binding data to provide a mechanistic insight into hepatic metabolism
beyond that obtained with metabolic flux analysis alone, and (3) develop a
phenomenological model using multivariate analysis to identify candidate
pathways or factors that contribute most to the diabetic phenotype. The
objective is the development of a model capable of identifying the potential for
diabetes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
