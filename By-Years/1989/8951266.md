The Department of Biology at Bemidji State University is presently upgrading its
offerings in the area of cell and molecular biology. A new advanced project
laboratory course in cellular and molecular biology will be implemented. Two
faculty members will commit 33% of their time to this new laboratory course. To
support this curricular improvement, plant and animal cell culture laboratories
are being constructed, and will be equipped with biological safety cabinets,
inverted phase microscopes, table top centrifuges, and incubators. These new
facilities will result in significant improvements in the laboratory portions of
existing courses and enable advanced students to engage in long term independent
research projects. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
