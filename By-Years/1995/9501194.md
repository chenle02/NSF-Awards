9501194 Haber The 1995 FASEB summer research conference on Recombination will be
the sixth bi-annual meeting on mechanisms of exchange of DNA strands in
recombination and in DNA repair. This meeting has been one of the most over-
subscribed of the FASEB meetings and the planned meeting will respond to the
demand by increasing the number of participants to about 200. The proposed
meeting includes speakers who are the leaders in the study of the biochemistry,
molecular biology and genetics of homologous, site-specific and nonhomologous
mechanisms of recombination. The organizers have endeavored to expand the range
of topics in this meeting to include a session on medical aspects of genetic
recombination and a broader survey of genome rearrangements associated with
development. The major topics of discussion will be: Enzymatic Mechanisms of
Recombination; Genome Rearrangements and Development; Recombination during
Meiosis; Recombinational Repair of DNA Damage; Initiators and Enhancers of
Recombination; Medical Aspects of Recombination; Genetic Control of
Recombination; Nonhomologous Recombination; Molecular Structure of Recombination
Components. ***
