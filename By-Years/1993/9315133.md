9315133 Lamb The investigators will use the techniques of condensed matter,
nuclear, gravitational and computational physics to study the properties of
matter under the extreme conditions found in and near neutron stars, black holes
and white dwarfs, to study the structure and evolution of neutron stars and to
study the physical processes that occur in accretion onto these objects. The
results of these fundamental studies will be used to model systems containing
compact stellar objects for comparison with observation. This work will
contribute both to our understanding of compact stars and our understanding of
physical processes at very high densities. ***
