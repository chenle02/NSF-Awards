The Prague Summer School on Statistical Mechanics has traditionally been a
meeting ground for students, postdocs and researchers working at the area
between statistical mechanics and related mathematical disciplines. This year's
school, planned for August 28-September 9, 2011, offers a list of very
distinguished lectures and lecturers. The main program will consist of five
minicourses with the following (confirmed) speakers and (tentative) titles:
Michael Aizenman (Princeton) and Simone Warzel (Munich): Quantum spectra and
dynamics under random potential Benjamin Schlein (Bonn): Spectral properties of
Wigner matrices Herbert Spohn (Munich): Growth processes, directed polymers, and
the 1D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation Daniel Ueltschi (Warwick): Quantum
Heisenberg models and their probabilistic representations Balint Toth
(Budapest): Scaling limits of self-interacting walks and diffusions with long
memory The topic of this year's Tutorial Program is probability theory and mass
transportation. The leader of the Tutorial Program is: Theodor Sturm (Bonn
University)

The support is requested for 10 US graduate students.
