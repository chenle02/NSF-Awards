As the need for qualified individuals to fill STEM jobs rises, community
colleges increasingly seek evidence-based, high-impact practices to encourage
student retention and graduation in STEM disciplines. Many factors influence a
student's choice of a major or career, but some students do not consider STEM
options because of a perceived inability to master STEM skills. The Building
Opportunities for STEM Success (BOSS) project will implement evidence-based
tools, resources, and instructional models that improve instruction in STEM
study skills for students at Florida State College at Jacksonville, a community
college. BOSS will develop and embed new study skills modules in six key STEM
courses (College Algebra, Earth and Space Science, Hardware Configuration, Life
in its Biological Environment, Introduction to General Chemistry, and
Introduction to Engineering) with the aim of improving students' learning gains
and interest in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has shown a connection
between study skills and academic success. BOSS will generate new evidence
regarding the impacts of embedding study skills modules into STEM courses. BOSS
faculty will come together in a professional learning community that will
develop modules that address STEM skill development. The overall framework for
modules will remain consistent across the STEM courses, with flexibility to
tailor instruction to the needs of different subject areas. Long-term, the
initiative will help broaden the STEM pipeline to include a more diverse
population. Evaluation research questions will focus on the relationship between
new study skill strategies and STEM self-efficacy, self-regulation, and student
success. Partners include the Northeast Florida STEM Hub, the Florida Department
of Education, and the JAXUSA Earn Up Initiative, who will support dissemination.
This project serves the national interest by educating community college
students for the technical and scientific workforce.
