The department of mathematical sciences at the University of Delaware will
purchase an IBM PowerStation 550 and four Sun SPARCstation IPX workstations
which will be dedicated to the support of research in mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
1. The numerical solution of fluid-structure interaction problems in three
dimensions, 2. A study of finite element methods for Maxwell's equations, 3. The
computation of viscoelastic and transonic flows, 4. The numerical modeling of
wave phenomena in composites, 5. A study of 3D hp and p version finite elements
on multilevel tetrahedral meshes.
