The objective of this proposed project is to develop efficient computational
algorithms for two important classes of problems. The first is to develop
efficient numerical methods for material transport on moving interfaces with
global dynamics. The main difficulty is the coupling of the global dynamics, the
moving interface and the material distribution on the interface. The
investigator will develop efficient and robust methods that can (1) track
material transport on moving interfaces, (2) couple interfacial dynamics with
global dynamics. In particular the developed numerical methods will be used to
study the effect of surfactants in two phase flow. The second is to analyze and
extend the fast sweeping method, which is an efficient iterative method recently
developed for Eikonal equations on rectangular grids, to unstructured grids and
general Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Convergence and error analysis will be
carried out. The fact that the fast sweeping method for a nonlinear problem
converges in a finite number of iterations is a remarkable result. Further
exploration of this method in the general framework of iterative methods will
not only provide efficient numerical methods for may important applications but
will also shed insight for constructing iterative methods for other nonlinear
problems. The above research projects will involve interdisciplinary
collaborations and will be integrated with education at different levels.

Numerical computations play a crucial role in modern science and technology
while development of efficient and robust numerical algorithms is the underlying
basic task. This project is aimed to the development and analysis of efficient
numerical algorithms for two classes of challenging problems with important
applications in fluids, materials, biology as well as computer vision, optimal
control, and geophysics.
