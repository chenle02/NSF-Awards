This is a systematic geochronological study of Olduvai Gorge, Lake Natron, and
Laetoli, three hominid bearing geological sites in northern Tanzania. The
purpose is to combine several types of data (stratigraphy, mineralogy,
geochemistry, trace elements and isotopes) which, together with existing
geochronological data, will refine the chronology of these important
anthropological sites. The study will add new age determinations using a
relatively new technique, 40Ar/39Ar single-grain laser fusion dating, and will
correlate the stratigraphic horizons at the three localities. Previous
geological results suggest correlations among these sites, but do not provide
firm chronological correlations. It is important for understanding human fossil
history to know the geological dates of these sites and exactly how they are
related temporarily to each other. This study should help provide the needed
firm correlations.
