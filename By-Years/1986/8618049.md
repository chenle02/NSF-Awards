This research is an attempt to apply a new kind of computational model,
connectionist or parallel-distributed-processing models, to a number of complex,
higher-level cognitive phenomena. These models are important, because a number
of investigators claim that they are anatomically and physiologically more
plausible than other sorts of models, and it is important to see how far they
can go in accounting for the behavior of humans in the sorts of cognitive
experiments that psychologists typically run. The first set of phenomena,
involving attention and configural learning, includes the observation that over
the course of discrimination learning, people come increasingly to "pay
attention to" relevant cues, those that predict validly the correct response,
and to ignore irrelevant cues. The second set of phenomena include
generalization enhancement and distributed representations. The third set of
phenomena involves representation issues, the issue of how different featural
representations of stimuli should be mapped onto connectionist models. All of
these issues will be approached with a combination of modeling and
experimentation.
