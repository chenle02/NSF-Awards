This award is in support of one element of the PALE activity (Paleoclimates
from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries). Research is focused on a lake coring program
in the Eastern Canadian Arctic with the goal of recovering continuous records of
environmental change for the last 10 to 15 thousand years. Baffin Island lies in
a key location and analyses of climatic data indicate that this region serves as
a bellwether for the circum-arctic climate system. This project will reconstruct
past climates from down- core changes in the pollen and diatom assemblages,
stable isotopic ratios and physical characteristic of the sediment in cores. The
lakes will be strategically located along a N/S temperature transect, and across
the E/W marine/continental climate gradient. Cores form these lakes will allow
examination of questions related to climate change, including regional glacial
history (timing and extent of the last continental ice advance and the pattern
of deglaciation), sea level change (both postglacial emergence and the more
recent submergence), and renewed development of cirque and mountain glaciers in
the late Holocene (Neoglaciation). Sampling will be undertaken with a density
commensurate with PALE objectives, i.e. decadal to centuries resolution
depending on the accumulation rates within the different lake basins.
