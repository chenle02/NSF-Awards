0226822 Herron This award supports mainly graduate students and junior faculty
from US universities to participate in a workshop on geometric function theory
at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, June 16-19, 2003. The workshop will
focus on three main themes: Analysis in Metric Spaces, Potential Theory in
Metric Spaces, and Mappings of Finite Distortion. Those topics are the focus of
research by a wide range of mathematicians from across the globe. This award
will support travel by eight graduate students and seven junior researchers and
is designed to stimulate international contacts that will lead to future
collaborations. The University of Jyvaskyla will publish a proceedings of the
workshop which will include submitted papers, problem sets from the workshop
sessions, as well as summaries of the sessions. The Math Department at the
University of Cincinnati will host a web site to disseminate the information and
to facilitate communication among those interested in the workshop.
