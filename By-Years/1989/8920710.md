The fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, tends to colonize newly disturbed land in
large numbers, creating initially very dense populations of newly founded
colonies. As these colonies grow, they compete with one another through brood-
stealing and territorial warfare. The resulting colony mortality causes the
population to self-thin as colonies and their territories grow. Large colonies
expand at the expense of small ones. By a combination of experimental and
statistical methods, Dr. Tschinkel will determine how colony size differences
are created and how they and initial colony density affect the density, spacing
and size distribution of colonies during thinning. He will also study the
factors which predict growth and survivorship of individual colonies and the
behavioral aspects of competition. This research will make important
contributions to understanding population dynamics of these social insects,
especially the importance of colony size and similarities between ant and plant
populations. In addition, the work has practical implications since attempts at
fire ant control or management have often failed because of the poor
understanding of its population dynamics. This study will help fill this gap and
thus improve future control strategies.
