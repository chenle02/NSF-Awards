The scope of the recently discovered gem-dimethylation reaction based on the
Tebbe reagent will be explored. The reaction provides a one step route to the
important gem-dimethyl substructure by the direct conversion of a carbonyl
group. The substructure is found in many important natural and synthetic
products. The work will seek to provide an understanding of the structure, or
structures, of the actual active species generated from the titanium-based
reagent. The studies will explore the preparation of analogous reagents and will
probe the mechanistic pathways for these species. The synthetic scope of the
reaction with different types of carbonyl groups will also be explored. %%% With
this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic Synthesis
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Stanley H. Pine of the Department of
Chemistry at California State, Los Angeles, University. Dr. Pine's work focuses
on a new synthetic reaction based on a bimetallic organometallic compound
containing titanium and aluminum. The reagent will accomplish, in one step, the
transformation of a carbonyl group into a group that contains a carbon bound to
two methyl groups, a process that now requires two or more synthetic steps. The
development of the reagent will increase the ease and directness of the
synthesis of a number of terpenoid natural products. The program will also
involve undergraduates in a meaningful way.
