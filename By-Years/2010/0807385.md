AST-0807385&lt;br/&gt;Fragile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much progress has been made
recently in the theoretical and observational understanding of black-hole
accretion disks and jets. However, an often overlooked free parameter is the
angle between the spin axis of the black hole and the angular momentum axis of
the inflowing gas, which can have a profound impact. For example, tilted thick
accretion disks appear to have higher accretion efficiencies than their un-
tilted counterparts, and it seems that jet orientations are affected by the tilt
angle. This project will study the structure and observational appearance of
tilted black-hole accretion disks and their attendant jets, through advanced
numerical relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, fully incorporating the
effects of the black hole space-time as well as magneto-rotational turbulence,
thought to be a primary source of angular momentum transport. Results will be
post-processed to create simulated observations, with particular emphasis on
identifying features that might indicate tilted disks, such as variability
patterns in the light curve, or complex reflection
features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astrophysical black holes still have the capacity
to captivate public audiences and the imagination of young students. The results
of this work will be included in existing public outreach programs and public-
interest web sites, and incorporated into classroom lessons. The research itself
directly involves graduate and undergraduate researchers.
