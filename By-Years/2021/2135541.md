The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is derived by
significantly lowering the production costs of cation-exchange membranes. By
replacing expensive membranes with low-cost alternatives, this technology may
find application in redox flow batteries used as utility-scale energy storage
devices. The reduction of the production costs of redox flow batteries may
enable increased adoption of wind and solar energy sources since large-scale
energy storage is a bottleneck that currently impedes growth of renewable
electricity markets. This technology may also find application in hydrogen fuel
cells. The reduced fuel cell production costs could allow for easier adoption of
fuel cell-powered vehicles resulting in the reduction of emissions in the
transportation sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops
proton-exchange membranes comprised of perfluorophosphonic acid-zirconium
polymers. These membranes are derived from affordable natural materials
resulting in the potential for low-cost manufacturing via a new synthetic
strategy that employs novel free-radical coupling reactions. Proof-of-concept
investigations show that these new membranes demonstrate high proton
conductivity in water and may significantly reduce vanadium crossovers for redox
flow battery applications. This I-Corps project may help identify potential
commercialization pathways for these materials and process
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
