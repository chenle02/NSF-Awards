This award provides funding for a faculty development workshop to be held in
conjunction with the Venture Well Open Conference, which promotes and supports
innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering education. Participants will
learn to develop and use physical simulations and moving analogies to help
students learn innovation and entrepreneurship skills and concepts in the
classroom. Since the Venture Well Conference attracts a wide group of faculty
and students from varied institutional types, the workshop will have strong
potential to affect engineering education practice broadly.

The workshop offers two tracks for the 40 to 60 participants anticipated, one
track for those who are new to the pedagogy and one track for those who are
experienced with it. This project has the potential to broaden and improve
student learning of innovation and entrepreneurship concepts as well as to
engage faculty who teach these concepts so they can explore and implement
effective teaching practices. The activities following the workshop aim to build
a community of practice through a series of virtual sessions and to provide a
mechanism to sustain and expand the network of participants engaged in the
development and implementation of evidence-based educational practices in the
context of engineering innovation and entrepreneurship.
