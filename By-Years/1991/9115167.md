Dr. Wade Sherbrooke is the Director of the Southwestern Research Station, which
is owned and administered by the American Museum of Natural History. The Station
is located in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona in an area of
diverse desert and montane habitats. Research projects conducted at the Station
focus on a broad spectrum of species and topics. Dr. Sherbrooke proposes
construction of enclosures for behavioral studies and acquisition of museum
storage cabinets for specimens collected during research projects, specimen
freezer, analytical balance, and electric current stabilizer. The behavioral
enclosures will facilitate research by a large number of visiting investigators,
and will open up new research projects on diverse organisms. The specimen
storage equipment is critical for the proper curation of reference specimens and
for preservation of frozen tissues for biochemical analyses. These items of
equipment will provide significant benefits to a variety of research projects.
