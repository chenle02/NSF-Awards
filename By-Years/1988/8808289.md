The description and analysis of relationships among individuals, organizations
and other social actors is a central sociological issue. Network analysis
permits the documentation and study of transactions which take place among
social systems as well as among individuals. The proposed research examines a
number of network exchange theories, and will use computer simulations to
compare, test, extend, and integrate alternative theories of linkages within
networks. The goal is to understand how information and resources are exchanged
in a variety of settings, such as social groups or large organizations. Network
exchange theorizing has, on the one hand, shown signs of having great potential
explanatory power in a wide range of real life contexts. On the other hand,
theories are spawned in near complete isolation. The work of testing alternative
paradigms remains to be done. This study, therefore, can offer insights that
will be invaluable to the further development of network exchange simulations
and research.
