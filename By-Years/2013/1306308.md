An atom interferometer will be used as an ultra-sensitive tool for measuring
perturbations to atomic motion. Laser beams usually attract or repel atoms, but
this project will identify wavelengths of light that leave atoms unperturbed.
Measuring these so-called "tune-out wavelengths" with unprecedented sub-
picometer accuracy will serve as a benchmark test for sophisticated atomic
structure calculations. This work will establish measurements of tune-out
wavelengths as a novel way to test calculations that are needed to support
atomic clocks, quantum computation, and atomic parity violation
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include training students to
pioneer new applications for atom optics. Atom optics refers to the art of
manipulating atomic de Broglie waves, much like ordinary light waves, by
reflection, refraction, and diffraction. This project also teaches students to
use nanotechnology, such as nanostructure diffraction gratings that serve as
beam splitters for atoms.
