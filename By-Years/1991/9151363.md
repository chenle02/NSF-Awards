The goal of this project is to establish a new course in genetic engineering
techniques that provides students with the opportunity to carry out basic
experiments in gene manipulation. The gel electrophoresis equipment,
centrifuges, spectrophotometers, transilluminators and vacuum blotters are used
to excise genes from source DNA, insert these genes into plasmid vectors,
transform bacterial cells with these plasmids, screen for clones containing
inserted genes, and produce DNA
