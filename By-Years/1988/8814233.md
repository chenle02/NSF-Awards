This project involves the development of a framework for constructing an expert
system based multiple objective decision support system. The approach is to
conceptually decouple the decision making activities from the mathematical
programming computations, and then employ AI techniques to efficiently determine
preferences and interactively solve the multiple objective LP problem. This
approach is novel and could lead to exciting developments for interactive, on-
line decision support systems for operational systems. It is also quite timely
and deserving of immediate attention. The interface of operations research and
artificial intelligence is an area that was identified in a recent OR workshop
as an important area for future direction of research. Ben Malakooti is a young
scholar with demonstrated capabilities for conducting this research and Case
Western Reserve University provides an excellent environment for the study. A
novel award is recommended.
