The aim of this project was twofold: to enhance spectroscopic capabilities
afforded by the chemistry department for the education of chemistry and chemical
engineering students, and to develop and implement summer workshops for regional
high school science teacher to sharpen their knowledge, interest, and enthusiasm
for chemical science so that they would function more effectively in the
classroom. In this context, the institution acquired a nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer to implement their aims. The instrument has been the
focus for the development of: new chemistry experiments for undergraduate
students developed by five faculty members and incorporated into existing
laboratories, a new spectroscopy course which included other recently acquired
instrumentation, increased opportunities for undergraduate research, and summer
workshops for high school science teacher which included modern spectroscopic
methods as an integral component. This project enhanced the quality of science
education for the undergraduates and stimulated the interest of regional high
school science teacher in the chemical science, an interest they have
transmitted to their students. The institution contributed to the project in an
amount equal to the NSF funds.
