On occasion bargaining orders are invoked as a means of instructing employers to
bargain with unions. The scientific question which arises is whether imposed
orders to bargain have a meaningful impact on the viability and life course of
unions when these unions have evolved not through having been elected but as a
result of concerns about unfair labor practices. Drs. Bethel and Melfi's study
investigates the bargaining order empirically and aims to assess how it effects
subsequent collective bargaining relationships. In so doing, their work will
contribute systematic empirical data and measurable insights leading to a
broader understanding of the impact of law in the area of labor relations.
Specifically, Drs. Bethel and Melfi study all unions that achieved recognition
by bargaining orders over fiscal years 1979-82 and examine and compare them to a
sample of unions that obtained recognition through elections. Their research
addresses questions pertaining to the durability of the status of unions,
changes in amount of employee support for them, and concessions won by them.
