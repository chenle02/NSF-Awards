9602479 Kangari Cooperative research will be conducted with professor Yuri
Villman at Robotics Lab in Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, Moscow,
Russia, on robotics in construction and environmental restoration operations.
This study will be focused on analyses of the feasibility of telerobotic and
autonomous systems in construction and hazardous environment. The robotics
center at Moscow State University has focused on comparing traditional, human
operated systems with telerobotic and autonomous systems in environmental
applications to determine the feasible uses of automated equipment in
construction, mining, and environmental cleanups.
