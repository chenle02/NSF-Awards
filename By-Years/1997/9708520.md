9708520 O'Melia This is an award to provide Renewal Support for research
originated under NSF Award No. 91-12766 that dealt with the theory, measurements
and applications relating to the stability of colloids in aquatic environments.
In the research being conducted under this award, the investigator plans on
refining and extending the conceptual model developed in prior research to more
complex aquatic systems than were considered in prior research based on
interactions of single Brownian particles with stationary surfaces. In the
renewal work, the PI will give special consideration to reversible aggregation
and deposition processes, validate the model experimentally and apply the
theoretical and experimental results to considerations of particle transport and
fate in ground and surface waters. Results of this research are expected to
provide insight and predictability to the processes by which small particles
deposit and become part of the sediment burden of surface waters and the
processes by which colloids move through groundwater aquifers. This knowledge is
likely to be applied in the engineering design of processes for removal of
particles from suspension in surface waters and in designing systems for
decontamination of groundwater aquifers. ***
