PI: John Tucker Proposal Number: DMS 9714380 Project: Statistical Methods in
Computational Modeling and Virtual Experiments Abstract: The Committee on
Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) will convene a multidisciplinary study
panel on statistical methods in computational modeling and virtual experiments.
The panel will recommend sound methods for identifying and quantifying
uncertainties that arise in simulation experiments. The panel will develop
recommendations for improved and, where necessary, new statistical methods and
data analysis techniques for use in simulation modeling and virtual experiments.
It will also recommend appropriate statistical methods to assist practitioners
in their use of experimental data when validating simulation models or assessing
model fit and predictive performance. These recommendations will address
modeling and simulation limitations associated with ever increasingly complex
systems. The panel's report will provide examples to illustrate the complexity
of evaluating model combinations that arise from varying assumptions,
parameters, and initial conditions within the models, will point out possible
approaches for addressing those complexities from existing experimental design
techniques, and will highlight areas needing further research. Experts may be
consulted from the communities concerned with computer simulation, discrete
events systems, and dynamic systems modeling, and any other scientists,
researchers, or engineers with significant technology or methodology to
contribute. A National Research Council panel of experts will examine the state-
of-the-art for statistical methods used in computer simulation and modeling, and
computational experimentation. This is needed because of an ever-growing
dependence upon these kinds of simulations and "virtual" experiments in
designing and evaluating such complicated devices and systems as semiconductors,
automobiles, aircraft, spacecraft, or in very complex application areas such as
transportation networks, government intelligence, and battlefield scenarios. The
study will address how modeling and simulation tools can be developed with the
robustness and reliability to handle the demands of emerging intelligence,
domestic, and military technology. It will also look at limitations on modeling
and simulation with respect to these increasingly complex systems.
