Meurer&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229702&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stillwater complex is a
large body of layered mafic igneous rock formed by fractional crystallization of
a basaltic magma--the most common type of magma generated in the Earth. As
minerals grow and separate from a crystallizing basaltic magma, its composition
becomes increasingly enriched in elements not included in the minerals, termed
incompatible elements. Incompatible elements are used in the study of igneous
rocks to document tectonic settings, extents of melting of a source region, and
extents of fractional crystallization. This study will document the behavior of
incompatible elements during the final stages of the crystallization of the
Stillwater complex by examining the distribution, abundance, and composition of
the last rocks to have crystallized. The Stillwater complex is of both economic
and academic interest, as it hosts the bulk of the platinum reserves of the US
and is a natural laboratory for understanding basaltic liquid crystallization.
An understanding of the end stages of fractional crystallization in this
intrusion will provide a more reliable basis for interpreting incompatible
elements concentrations in igneous systems in general. It will also help in
understanding how platinum was concentrated to more than 1000 times normal in
the mineralized parts of this intrusion. &lt;br/&gt;
