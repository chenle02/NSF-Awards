ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0943629&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;PI: S.
DeBow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the vessel
operated by University of Rhode Island (URI); namely the R/V ENDEAVOR. The
requests specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF
inspections, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred
by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve
safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due
to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards
normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of
the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on
past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V ENDEAVOR supports federally
funded scientific research in the Atlantic in order to expand human knowledge of
the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate
and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also
achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house
events, and participation in both the Teachers at Sea and MATE programs. The
ENDEAVOR is scheduled to complete over 140 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
