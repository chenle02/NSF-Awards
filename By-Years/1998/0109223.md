This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "Evolution of herbivore defense strategies in an invasive
plant." The invasive weed Hypericum perforatum, L. (St. John's wort) is being
used in this study of the evolution of defense strategies against insect
herbivory. The genetic basis of resistance and tolerance are being determined by
developing a genetic map of resistance and tolerance traits, investigating
tradeoffs between traits conferring resistance versus tolerance, and examining
whether tradeoffs vary between native and introduced populations with differing
histories of biological control. &lt;br/&gt;
