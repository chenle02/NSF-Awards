The investigator has done work related to several fundamental invariants of the
moduli space of curves of genus g. In particular he has studied the nature of
the moduli space M(g) as it changes from being a unirational variety (for small
g) to a variety of general type. Recently the investigator has found a series a
counterexamples to the Harris-Morrison Slope Conjecture on the cone of effective
divisors on M(g). In other works, the investigator has used moduli of curves to
prove the Minimal Resolution Conjecture for canonical curves and has studied
geometric stratification of moduli spaces of spin curves. This project proposes
a new technique of defining intrinsic coordinates on the moduli space of curves
that would reduce many problems about linear series or vector bundles over M(g)
to combinatorial questions having a toric geometry flavour. In particular, this
approach is expected to provide a uniform bound (independent of g) on slopes of
effective divisors on M(g), and thus prove a weak version of the Slope
Conjecture. This would show that any modular form on the moduli space A(g) of
g-dimensional abelian varieties which has sufficiently small slope, vanishes on
M(g) which would give a novel solution to the Schottky problem of distinguishing
Jacobians among all abelian varieties. In a different direction, the
investigator proposes to introduce a new stratification of M(g) defined in terms
of syzygies of certain special linear systems of curves. This geometric
stratification can be thought of as a more subtle analogue of the classical
stratification of M(g) given by gonality where the analogue of hyperelliptic
curves are sections of K3 surfaces. One application would be a construction of a
birational model of the moduli space F(g) of polarized K3 surfaces of sectional
genus g which could be used to describe the intersection theory of F(g). A
different project (joint with S. Grushevsky) involves the study of the linear
system of 2-theta functions on the Jacobian of a curve. Using a mixture of
algebraic geometry and theta function theory, the investigator hopes to
understand the stratification of this linear system given by multiplicities
along the higher difference varieties of the curve and relate them to the
projective geoemtery of secant varieties of canonical curves.



The guiding problem in algebraic geometry is to classify algebraic varieties up
to isomorphism. For varieties of dimension 1 this problem is approached by
considering the moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g. This is the universal
parameter space for curves of genus g and M(g) is an algebraic variety of
dimension 3g-3. This space is of enormous interest to algebraic geometers and
string theorists and the last decade has seen major progress in understanding
the geometry of M(g) involving ideas from geometry, number theory and physics.
