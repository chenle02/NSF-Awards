This work is to continue basic studies to develop new technology for the early
detection and characterization of cartilage degeneration. The method relies on
previous findings that electrical current introduced via surface electrodes
produces a measurable stress, and that this stress varies as a result of
chemical degradation of the cartilage. Different frequencies of current and
spacial arrangements of active electrodes will be used in order to localize the
site of degeneration in 3 dimensions. If successful, this cross-disciplinary
research will result in a new research tool to study cartilage degeneration; the
results may also prove useful for the early clinical detection of degenerating
cartilage.
