Four main directions are selected for advancement in this project: (a) Time-
frequency independence conjectures and related topics; (b) Quantification of
localization for nonabelian coherent state frames; (c) Applications to affine
pseudodifferential operators (broadband time-varying filters); (d) Multiwavelet
development of the shearlet transform and construction of compactly supported
shearlets. Each of these interrelating topics contains deep mathematical
questions directly related to fundamental issues in redundant representation and
transformation of signals. Each topic reaches into a broad range of areas in
mathematical analysis, and progress requires a synthesis of different ideas from
both abstract analysis and applied harmonic analysis, including
pseudodifferential operator theory, noncommutative Banach algebras, and new
forms of multiresolution analysis suitable for two-dimensional and higher signal
processing.

The problems addressed in this project concern fundamental questions regarding
the basic mathematical tools that underlie modern signal processing, including
such applications as wireless communications, radar, seismic sensing, and image
processing. Progress on these topics yields applicable mathematics with
potential impact for real-world scientific and engineering programs. All aspects
of this work are intimately tied with educational endeavors, both at the
graduate and undergraduate levels. Students of the investigator cooperate
directly in this research, receiving a breadth and depth of knowledge and
experience that will foster a continued commitment to cross-disciplinary
interactions among mathematics, physics, and engineering. Topics related to this
project and progress on the problems of the project are incorporated into
courses and seminars directed by the investigator. The investigator continues
his strong record of producing graduate students, working with undergraduates,
mentoring postdocs, producing Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups, and
encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue research.
