A three-week workshop, involving about 20 residents at any one time, will
discuss current needs and future strategies for developing the ability to
identify and predict the presence of complex functional units on sequenced, but
otherwise uncharacterized, genomic DNA. This focus will address the need for
computation-based, automatic tools for synthesizing available data about
individual consensus sequences and local compositional patterns into the
composite objects (e.g., genes) that are -- as composite entities -- the true
objects of interest when scanning DNA sequences. The workshop has been
structured to promote sustained informal contact and exchange of expertise
between molecular biologists, computer scientists,and mathematicians. No
participant will stay for less than one week, and most will attend for two-three
weeks. Computers, software, and databases will be available for use as
"electronic blackboards."
