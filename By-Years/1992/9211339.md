Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be performed using both
large scale numerical simulations and analytical techniques to study the
properties of homogeneous, inhomogeneous and artificially fabricated
superconducting systems. This work is motivated by experimental discoveries and
will, in turn, lead to predictions which can be tested by experiment. The
problems to be studied include quantum fluctuation induced transitions;
metastable magnetic properties; and, real time vortex dynamics, including self-
field effects. The results obtained from this research will enhance our
understanding of the physics of photolithographically fabricated arrays of
ultrasmall Josephson junction arrays and of high temperature superconductors.
%%% Research on a variety of problems of current interest in condensed matter
physics revolving around the properties of very large arrays of ultrasmall
Josephson junctions - a type of superconducting switch - will be undertaken.
These arrays are important in their own right for possible applications to
superconducting microelectronics and are also important for what they can tell
us about the basic physics of high temperature superconductors and problems in
disordered systems.
