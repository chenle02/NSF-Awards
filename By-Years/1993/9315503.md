9315503 Monbouquette An important goal of this project is to develop a
laboratory course in precompetitive microbial bioprocesses for senior
undergraduate and beginning graduate students. An inter- disciplinary team of
faculty from the departments of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and Chemical
Engineering well into the academic curriculum recent progress in this field of
fermentation technology with emphasis on the newly developed technologies for
culturing microorganisms that grow under extreme environmental conditions and
bioprocesses related to these organisms. The development of this course will be
undertaken in parallel with an assessment of biochemical
engineering/biotechnology laboratory teaching efforts across the country. A
joint industry/academic workshop is envisioned to evaluate the laboratory
program.
