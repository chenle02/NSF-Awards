This projects provides instruments to be used in a new, campus-wide Institute
for Materials and Advanced Processes (IMAP), to be housed in a new building to
be constructed for the College of Mines and Earth Resources (COMER) at the
University of Idaho. Faculty and students conducting research in IMAP will share
these instruments with scientists in engineering and the biological sciences.
Research on materials and materials processing has been identified as one of
five research areas to receive special attention at the University of Idaho.
COMER has the only Ph.D. granting materials program in the State of Idaho.
Acquisition of these instruments will provide a major improvement in the
research infrastructure being undertaken by IMAP and COMER.
