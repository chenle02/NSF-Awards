This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support Dr. L.E Scriven of the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities in a research collaboration with Eng. Marcio S. Carvalho,
Eng. Paulo R. Souza-Mendes, and Eng. Luis F. Azevedo of the Pontifica
Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC). The primary objective is to
document experimentally, explain theoretically, and reduce to computer code for
process analysis, design and optimization two phenomena: 1. The film-splitting
instabilities and generation of mist that limit productivity of roll-coaters,
which are widespread in industry. 2. The breakdown of steady, coherent flow in
fast slot-coating to form a thin liquid layer; this breakdown limits
productivity of slot coaters, a common precision device in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid applied coating processes are an enabling
technology in about 11% of total industrial production in the U.S., E.C. and
Japan, and of increasing importance in advancing economies such as Brazil's.
This collaboration will combine the expertise of researchers at PUC in coating
flows, polymer processing, and experimental technique in fluid mechanics with
the expertise in coating processes at Minnesota, one of the leading centers in
the country in this area.&lt;br/&gt;
