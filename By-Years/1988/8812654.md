As an interdepartmental, interdisciplicary facility of Duke University, the
Marine Laboratory serves as the focus for marine research and educational
programs of a resident research faculty of 34 representing five departments
within the University with a supporting staff of 50 persons. In 1987, 47
investigators from 33 different institutions throughout the world utilized the
facilities for periods ranging from two weeks to one year and a total of 3639
students and staff visited the Laboratory for shorter periods of time. Capital
research equipment, wet and dry laboratory facilities, research vessels,
dormitories, dining facilities, apartments, and vehicles are provided for the
resident and visiting scientists. The Laboratory also maintains an electronics
technician, mechanical, woodworking and computer equipment, and the A.S. Pearse
Memorial Library. With the University of North Carolina, Duke maintains and
operates the UNOLS vessel R/V Cape Hatteras. Recent trends in the research
programs of resident and visiting scientists have demonstrated the need for
modern equipment to permit the ananylsis of fixed and moving images. This
project will provide funds for the purchase of a motion analysis system, a
static image analyzer, and a drafting plotter.
