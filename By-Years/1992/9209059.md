This research attempts to characterize the main factors influencing well or
aquifer dewatering and aquifer contamination potential in subsiding
environments, examine their effect, quantify their magnitude in advance of
mining and propose methods to mitigate undesirable effects. Previous work has
illustrated that strata dewatering above longwall mines is controlled by the
deformation and fracturing patterns induced by ground subsidence above the
panel. Hydraulic conductivity and storage changes may be represented by simple
physical models and used in numerical models to determine dewatering potential a
priori. It is proposed to extend this work to determine transient behavior and
provide a logical extension in defining changes to water quality.
