Six Indiana school districts, in partnership with industry, universities,
libraries, data retrieval services, and a museum will develop and implement
programs to give middle school students experience in computer data processing
and literature searching. Through a summer workshop teachers from the school
district will work with industry and university scientists to design scientific
studies their students can pursue, both by data-generating experiments and by
literature searching. Teachers, and in turn their students, will learn how to
create data bases for their own results and how to access and search commercial
data bases for complementary information. During the summer workshop the
teachers will have an opportunity to test their programs on students in a museum
prior to taking these programs back to their own classrooms. Materials and
procedures developed during the project will be widely disseminated. Cost
sharing by the partners will total 17% of the NSF funding.
