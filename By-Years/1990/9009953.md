An important aspect of a parallel architecture is the interconnection network,
which can be represented as a graph. Many graphs have been proposed as suited to
parallel computation. Previous research has partially answered the questions of
which graphs to use for which problems and of which graphs are most generally
useful for parallel processing. What has been lacking are uniform techniques and
a comprehensive theory for analyzing parallel networks. The central thesis of
this research project is that analogies to the mathematical theory of algebraic
topology can provide a foundation for a theory of parallel networks. New
topologies for graphs are defined that capture the essence of the graphs as
parallel networks. Topological invariants are defined that facilitate comparison
and evaluation of networks, and efficient algorithms are given to compute these
invariants. The standard technique for simulating one parallel network by
another is via graph embeddings. In the topological framework, a graph embedding
is a special kind of continuous function between topolical spaces. Algorithms
are given to compute the homotopology and homology groups of a graph and to
compute the group homomorphisms induced by a graph embedding. Techniques are
developed to prove upper and lower bounds on the ability of one network to
simulate another. The ultimate result of this research is a unified mathematical
theory of graphs as parallel architectures.
