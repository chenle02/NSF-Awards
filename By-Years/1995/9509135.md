9509135 Marchal This SBIR Phase II project aims to design and implement a
prototype of interactive multimedia software to support Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) courses and evaluate its impact in an ODE laboratory course
setting. The proposed software combines mathematical simulation, graphic
animation, digital video, and hypermdeia to create an engaging learning
environment that builds upon contemporary learning theories of contextual
learning and constructivism. The Principal Investigators work with the NSF-
funded Consortium for ODE Experiments to (a) identify all required mathematical
content elements required to support an introductory ODE course, (b) identify
specific topics to support a laboratory-based ODE curriculum, (c) develop
software module specifications, (d) identify and develop application-specific
software needed to support the modules, (e) implement the software modules, (f)
evaluate the prototype in a classroom setting, and (g) provide recommendations
for the development of a commercial product. The anticipated benefit of the
software is that it provides a convenient and challenging way for students to
study and explore differential equations, giving them a bridge between the
physical world and mathematics.
