9320257 Pritchard If engineering and engineeering education are to encourage
responsible engineering practice that goes beyond simply avoiding or preventing
wrongdoing, it is essential to provide examples of ethically commendable
engineering. This project is intended to help fill this unmet need. The goal of
the project is to develop a set of detailed stories about exemplary engineers
and engineering practice. Prior to the research period, the investigators will
initiate contact with engineering societies, primarily in Michigan, engineers,
and their managers, to identify appropriate candidates and arrange for
interviews. They will prepare a questionnaire for the interviews. Presentations
to engineering societies and interviewing will continue throughout the project.
Qualified graduate students will assist in the interviewing and assessing the
findings. From extensive interviews with at least 20 engineers and managers, the
investigators will develop a set of detailed stories about ethically commendable
engineering. These will be shared with students in classes in engineering
ethics, business ethics, communications ethics, and professional ethics. The
most promising stories will be prepared for publication. The investigators will
also prepare summary results of preliminary efforts to identify criteria for
exemplary engineering that are commonly acknowledged by engineers and their
managers. These will include not only examples of exemplary engineering but also
reflections on the qualities of character that seem to underlie such conduct. In
addition, the investigators will summarize their findings about factors that
seem either to facilitate or to present obstacles to exemplary engineering.
Because the proposed project would help to understand engineers in context, it
should contribute as well to overall understanding of what engineers do. Results
will be disseminated through presentations, articles, and educational materials.
