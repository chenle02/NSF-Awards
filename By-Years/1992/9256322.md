This Graduate Research Traineeship will enable Lehigh University to support
five trainees, initiate two new research thrusts and expand two existing
research areas in the Materials Science and Engineering (MS&E) Department at
Lehigh University. Since 1988, four new and experienced faculty have entered the
Department and two more start in 1992-93, thus creating the need for more
graduates. The trainees will work in materials processing, characterization, and
theory/modeling, which comprise a 1992 Presidential Initiative:-the Advanced
Materials and Processing Program. %%% This initiative highlights the importance
of MS&E to the industrial and economic growth of the USA. To enhance the
trainees' experience, they will participate in an internship at a major US
research laboratory. Letters of commitment have been obtained from nine
companies and two National Laboratories. The trainees will have the opportunity
for research at one of six European Universities and will teach in an
undergraduate laboratory course at Lehigh. To overcome barriers that dissuade US
undergraduates from entering Ph. D. programs, the NSF stipends will be increased
and, where possible, the time to complete the Ph. D. will be reduced through an
intensive precursor Master of Science level program.
