This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Arkansas
Fayetteville for the renovation and repair of the physics building which houses
the research and research training activities of the Department of Physics. This
building was constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated since that time. The
ARFMP grant of $500,000 and $590,250 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. The
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by
providing central air conditioning; adequate power lines; and adequate power,
water, vibration-free tables, benches, shelves and other essentials; and
additional fume hoods. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science
by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of undergraduate and graduate students at the only institution in the
state of Arkansas that offers the doctorate in physics.
