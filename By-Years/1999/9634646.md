The focus of this research is to develop a combinatorial approach to lock a
given short peptide sequence into a variety of different conformations. The
sequence of interest is then incorporated into a macrocycle containing a
template that serves as a conformational tuning element. The conformational
properties of the template molecule influence the conformation of the
intervening tetrapeptide sequence thus affording a template-constrained cyclic
peptide. The potential target peptides will use two tripeptide sequences, Arg-
Gly-Asp (RGD) and Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) which are recognized by the cell adhesion
integrins. With this GOALI award, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and
the Synthetic Organic Program are supporting the research of Dr. William F.
DeGrado of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of
Pennsylvania and Dr. Mark A. Scialdone of DuPont Central Research and
Development. The team will focus on developing methodologies for the
presentation of peptides in a variety of coformational states. These methods
should have use for the design and synthesis of peptide mimetics that inhibit a
variety of peptide/protein and protein/protein interactions. Such compounds
might be useful directly as pharmaceuticals, diagnostics or agricultural
products.
