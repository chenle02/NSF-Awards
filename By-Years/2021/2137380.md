This award will support student travel to the 2021 New Security Paradigms
Workshop to be held in New Hampshire, in October 2021. The New Security
Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly interactive
forum for innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW encourages graduate
students and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas within computer security.
It also strongly encourages non-computer security experts from economics,
sociology, psychology, and other disciplines to bring their expertise to bear on
computer security paradigms. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel
expenses for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the workshop.
Supporting junior researchers' travel to attend professional conferences and
workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The projectâ€™s broader
significance and importance lie in training the next generation of researchers
in this important research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSPW special emphasis
area this year is interdisciplinarity and translation zones in the context of
emerging technologies. Computer systems are not designed to support security.
They are designed to perform some function, whether that is banking, grades,
writing, or communication. Applying security principles to systems with
consideration of those other principles is both interdisciplinary in nature and
crucial to aligning incentives between system users and security
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
