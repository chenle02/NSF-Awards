This is to support the Committee for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)
outreach project. This proposal will support one or two scientists per workshop
per year who are actively engaged in the CCSM to visit university departments to
give seminars and/or otherwise interact with faculty and students for the
purpose of presenting scientific results from the CCSM and discuss opportunities
to work on and with the CCSM.
