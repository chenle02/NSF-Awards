The National LSAMP Community has expressed a need for a resource document
containing general information about each alliance and participants for
collective dissemination purposes. Also, there continues to be national requests
for an updated directory of LSAMP alliances with sufficient contact information
for each partnership. Such documents were last published in 2011. The directory
will serve as a quick reference for communicating with the alliances and a
resource for university faculty, students and other professionals in STEM fields
seeking to network with LSAMP participants. The University of Alabama-Birmingham
(UAB) will develop and publish both documents in four color format and
distribute to the alliances. UAB has a record of producing quality publications.
Both publications will be produced electronically and will have limited
hardcopies for the alliances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two documents in four
color format will be disseminated to the LSAMP community. Other interested
individuals and organizations will be able to access this compilation of
partnership information in electronic form. The project's objectives are to
provide a resource for faculty, students and others seeking to establish contact
with students in a particular field; to foster networking among faculty and
students at LSAMP institutions across the country; to alert the public to the
educational and human resource impact of the LSAMP projects, collectively and
individually, within geographic regions of the country; to provide a valuable
resource document for the general science, technology, engineering and
mathematics community; and to provide a valuable tool for the recruitment of
students into research and graduate programs.
