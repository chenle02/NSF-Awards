Mark Kirkpatrick of the University of Texas at Austin will conduct studies of
theoretical population genetics during the next five years using the funds
granted by a Presidential Young Investigator Award. Dr. Kirkpatrick formulates
genetic models of evolution and most recently he has been focusing on selective
forces that relate to characters associated with one sex of animal or plant
(hence the term, sexual selection). These traits are behavioral and
morphological, and can affect mating success and survival within the contexts of
a variety of social systems and environmental conditions. A second area of
investigation pertains to the analysis of experimental data to determine if and
how complex traits (or characters) are constrained by genetic and developmental
mechanisms. Generally, Dr. Kirkpatrick's research contributions have been
recognized for their sophistication and elegance, and this has led to his
prominence and recognition.
