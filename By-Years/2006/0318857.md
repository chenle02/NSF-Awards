This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop methods for preventing oxidation of air or moisture sensitive metallic
or ceramic nanoparticles used for electronic devices. The specific problem this
proposal addresses is the need to process nanometer sized tantalum particles
such that they do not spontaneously oxidize on contact with air or moisture and
that the particles may be integrated into the manufacture of capacitors. This
project will examine the use of organic molecules to derivitize tantalum
nanoparticles as produced by the Sodium Flame Encapsulation (SFE) process. It is
anticipated that derivatization should provide an oxidation resistant coating
allowing for the production of low oxygen materials for electronic applications.

Commercially, the research will contribute to the commercialization of products
derived from SFE process, initially limited to tantalum, but ultimately
applicable to a wide range of nano-scale metals and ceramics. This research has
the broader implication of bringing the SFE process for nanoparticles
manufacture to commercial realization and it enables further discovery in the
areas of materials processing of these important new particles.
