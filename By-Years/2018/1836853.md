The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to provide the next generation of
combustion researchers and practicing engineers with comprehensive knowledge in
the areas of combustion chemistry, theory, experiment, computation, and
application. For the past seven years, the summer school session has offered
daily morning and afternoon lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five
days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion
chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses on practical
combustion systems and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants
has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The
proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to
partially offset part of the costs for travel and lodging (on Princeton's
campus) at the 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on Combustion. The camp-
like environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact
intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves. Such a
learning opportunity is usually not offered on a university campus and should
help develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and industry for
the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
