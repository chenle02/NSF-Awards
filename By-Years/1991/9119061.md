This is research to test the basic assumptions underlying many of the existing
models of manufacturing systems. Modern manufacturing systems now may have
combinations of robots, complex numerically controlled machines, automated
guided vehicles, and automated storage and retrieval systems as part of an array
of equipment in use in the system. Each of these innovations serve to lower the
inherent variance associated with the operation of the system. In addition,
computer networks maintain system state information, opening the door for more
sophisticated control of the manufacturing system. This project takes a serious
look at the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying models of the modern
manufacturing system.
