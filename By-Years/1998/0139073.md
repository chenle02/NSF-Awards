Duan 9973204 The investigator studies complex geophysical flow phenomena modeled
by finite or infinite-dimensional deterministic or stochastic differential
equations. The research focuses on transport and mixing in random geophysical
flows, nonlocal transport in-geophysical flows, variational methods for
geophysical models, and stochastic geophysical flow modelling. In the area of
transport and mixing, the investigator quantifies fluid transport and mixing in
geophysical flown by computing escape probability and mean resident time. The
work on nonlocal transport studies-the mean advoctive and eddy transport of
passive tracers or pollutants in geophysical flown, when the eddy diffusivity
depends on time and space. For the research on variational methods for
geophysical models, the investigator gains better ' uncftrotanding of the
rotating shallow water dynamics, by studying steady patterns, spatial and
temporal periodic patterns and homoclinic motions via emrging techniques in
calculus of variations. Finally, he derives a simplified coupled atmosphere-
ocean model by averaging over random wind forcing and over intrinsic fast waves,
quantifies the approximation error of the averaged dynamics, and studies some
aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system using this averaged mod 1. The
geophysical flows in the oceans and the atmosphere affect our environment and
our society in profound ways. This project is motivated by the need of better
scientific understanding of the environment and global change. The investigator
takes random or uncertain effects into account to describe geophysical flows. He
develops both daterministle.and stochastic, numerical and analytical techniques
to understand complex geophysical flow phonanuma. This research improves our
knowledge about dispersion, transport and mixing of pollutants in our
environment, and about evolution and pattern formation of geophysical flows. The
techniques resulting from this research are also useful in studying other
emerging problem in engineering and
