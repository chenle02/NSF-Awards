1638492-Wei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of travel and
registration fees for undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and
under-represented, female and junior faculty to attend and present at the
symposium on "Biomaterials for Tissue Regeneration" at the Fall Materials
Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Boston, MA, November 28-30, 2016. The
symposium will address recent advances in the development of biomaterials used
for regenerative medicine. Topics to be addressed include: 1) delivery of
bioagents to promote tissue regeneration; 2) biomaterials as cell delivery
vehicles; 3) biomaterials as tissue engineering scaffolds; 4) biomaterials to
modulate immune responses; 5) evaluation of biomaterials for in vivo
applications; 6) biomaterial design to influence cell interactions; 7) high
throughput biomaterial screening and testing for regenerative medicine; 8) novel
imaging techniques for studies of biomaterial-cell interactions; and 9)
commercialization of biomaterials for regenerative medicine. Though in depth
discussions will consider tissue engineering scaffolds, stem cells, and growth
factors, the focus will be on scaffolds and improving scaffold design and
development and their in vitro and in vivo performance. Broader impact will be
achieved with a larger attendance by graduate students, postdoc researchers, and
junior faculty, especially from the under-represented groups made possible by
the availability of NSF funding. The organizing committee will select high-
quality student and post-doctoral contributions during abstract review.
