Go to any meeting or lecture with the younger generation of researchers,
business people, or government, and there is a laptop or smartphone at every
seat. Each laptop and smartphone is capable not only of recording and
transmitting video and audio in real time, but also of advanced analytics on the
data (e.g. speech recognition, speaker identification, face detection, etc.).
Yet this rich resource goes largely unexploited mostly due to lack of good
training data for machine learning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
step in exploiting this resource is to collect a corpus of audio, video, and
annotations of "natural" meetings using the participants' own laptops and
cellphones, allowing both analysis of the meetings and training of machine
learning algorithms. This one year planning project involves design of the
corpus, including collection protocols, signals, formats, and annotations,
collection of a small pilot corpus, and ongoing interaction with the community
through mailing lists, forums, wikis, and a workshop hosted at ICSI in Berkeley,
California. The annotations include the words spoken, events such as laughter, a
telephone ringing, or a new participant entering the room, who is speaking, who
appears on which camera, head and hand gestures, the participants' focus of
attention, and summaries and topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful planning
for the collection of a significant number natural meetings from a variety of
settings using the participants' own laptops and cellphones allows for a new
generation of analytic tools for meetings including browsing, search,
collaboration tools, and teleremote aids.
