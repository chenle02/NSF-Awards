Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
of Rice University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of
research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Synthesis of small
ring alkenes and organometallic chemistry 2) Asymmetric induction in organic
synthesis 3) Total synthesis of molecules of biomedical interest 4) Study of the
kinetics of the reactions of azoalkanes 5) Total synthesis of complex natural
products 6) Biosynthesis of natural products.
