In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Bruce S. Hudson of the University of Oregon will continue and extend a
series of investigations on the ultravilolet resonance Raman spectroscopy of
excited electronic states and dynamics of small polyatomic molecules. Both gas
and liquid phase systems will be investigated. New investigations will be
conducted on molecules in solution. These include studies of structural
solvation effects on hydrogen bonding and dielectric properties, static and
dynamic modifications attributed to fluctional solvent effects, and excitation
driven solvent effects. The feasibility of using liquid xenon, sulphur
hexafluoride, and carbon tetrafluoride as solvents will also be investigated.
Resonance Raman spectroscopy provides a `snapshot` view of the very early time
dynamics of atomic motions following electronic excitation. This instantaneous
response is of interest from the point of view of molecular structure theory.
The overall goal of these studies is to test and refine theoretical descriptions
of excited electronic states.
