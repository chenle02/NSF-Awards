This project continues the development of ozone sensors for ocean buoys. An
ozone measurement system is being deployed at a coastal observatory and on the
Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM) to measure ozone in the marine boundary layer for
four to six months in each location. An ozone measurement system previously
developed will be deployed in the field along with a new, cheaper but untested
instrument. The longer-term goal of the project is to study intercontinental
transport of pollution over the ocean, demonstrate the feasibility of making
atmospheric chemistry time-series measurements from buoys, and study the diurnal
and seasonal cycles of ozone in the marine boundary layer of the North Atlantic.
