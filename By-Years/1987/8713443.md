The objective of this project is to present a basic understanding of the
freezing mechanism of pore water and by this knowledge establish criteria of
assessing the freeze-thaw durability of concrete. The damage to concrete depends
upon the internal cyclic stresses developed during freezing and thawing because
of the flow of water and ice.
