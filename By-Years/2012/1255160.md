The PI will reconstruct the origin of the Milky Way's stellar halo by studying
the chemical compositions of its constituents: extremely metal-poor stars in the
halo itself and metal-poor stars in the least luminous dwarf galaxies orbiting
about the Galaxy. She will leverage her access to the Australian SkyMapper
Telescope to identify large numbers of stars in the Galactic halo, and combine
these data with high spectral resolution observations using the Magellan
telescope. She will therefore assemble a legacy data set of the most metal-poor
stars in the galaxy, which will substantially advance our understanding of the
early universe and the build-up of the old stellar halo of the Milky Way. In
concert, the PI will produce accompanying theoretical frameworks that allow for
a cosmologically informed interpretation of stellar abundance measurements. The
program has three specific goals: (1) to perform stellar archaeology, giving us
new constraints on the major physical processes that drove early star formation;
(2) to perform dwarf-galaxy archaeology, allowing us to better understand galaxy
formation; and (3) to determine the role of metal-poor stars as tracers of the
accretion history of the Milky Way halo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will
disseminate her research to a broad audience by publicly releasing her new
measurements on the chemical abundances of stars. She will also collaborate
closely with the MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community
(MOSTEC), which is a free online education and enrichment program for high
school seniors from underserved and underrepresented communities. Finally, the
PI will also create a series of short videos designed to show students how to
observe with the Magellan telescopes, thereby encouraging them to be informed
participants in how astronomical data are gathered.
