Dr. Polvani is an NSF Young Investigator whose research will span a wide range
of topics. He will investigate the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere and ocean,
as well as other planetary atmospheres, emphasizing nonlinear wave and vortex
phenomena. He will also carry out an ambitious teaching program focused on
applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, and atmospheric and ocean sciences.
