This project is focused on studying the effects of the phase state (e.g., gas-
particle partitioning) of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) on atmospheric
processes at regional or global scales. The parameterizations that will be
developed can help to predict multiphase chemistry processes and aerosol
composition and concentration. The ultimate goal of this research is to evaluate
the global impacts of phase state on atmospheric aerosol processes to better
predict the aerosol effects on climate, air quality and public
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current large-scale SOA models represent aerosol
physicochemical processes using highly simplified schemes with equilibrium gas-
particle partitioning. This project will evaluate under which conditions and to
what extent these assumptions may or may not hold in the global atmosphere. The
tasks to accomplish this goal are as follows: (1) Implement a method in the
GEOS-Chem model to predict glass transition temperatures and the viscosity of
SOA; (2) Derive the equilibration timescales of SOA partitioning and water
uptake in global atmosphere using kinetic multilayer modeling; (3) Apply a
scheme of kinetic partitioning of SOA with effective mass accommodation
coefficients to consider the effects of phase state; and (4) Evaluate model
predictions of the SOA budget and phase state against
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new aerosol phase state developments will
contribute to improvements of the public version of the GEOS-Chem model and will
be openly available for all users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
