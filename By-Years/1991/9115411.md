The proposal comprises three projects, each investigating phase- coherent
effects in microfabricated, multiply connected, thin-film structures, each
requiring sensitive dc-SQUID magnetometry or potentiometry to probe the phase
coherence and phase dynamics: 1) Macroscopic quantum phase phenomena - a study
of macroscopic quantum tunneling in multidimensional systems to test the
validity and applicability of quantum mechanics to macroscop-ic physical
systems. 2) Phase coherence and vortex dynamics in superconducting arrays -
measurement of the static vortex config-uration in arrays by a scanning SQUID
detector and vortex dynam-ics by noise and non- equilibrium transport
experiments. 3) Phase coherence in mesoscopic devices - measurement of
persistent currents and screening in normal-metal rings, arrays and SQUIDS to
study the role of phase coherence and scattering. %%% Phase-coherence effects in
superconductors and in normal-metal "nanostructures" are important both in the
development of high- sensitivity detectors and other electronic devices, and in
the study of the fundamentals of condensed-matter physics. //
