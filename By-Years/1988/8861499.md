The proposed research is aimed at building a compact laser pulse source which
has been the bottleneck for five years in development of an ultrafast optically
triggered oscilloscope, an instrument imprtant in the evaluation of high speed
integrated circuits and microwave devices. Current laser pulsers are large,
require continuous maintenance, and consume up to 15 kilowatts of electricity.
The pulse source proposed here uses low maintenance diode laser, is small, and
draws a few watts of power. This very special instrumentation is needed to test
the new highspeed integrated circuits, GaAs microwave devices and picosecond
transistors, for picosecond synchronization of electron beam devices and high
energy lasers, for generating precise waveform high power microwave bursts, and
for driving analog to digital converter with 30 GHz sampling rates. Picosecond
resolution is needed to extract the maximum speed and efficiency and therefore
economic advantage from ultrafast electronics. The pulse optical source use
multiple semiconductor lasers which operate at different frequencies and are
phaselocked together to produce pulses. This unique approach solves the
bandwidth and group velocity mismatch problems rater than fighting with them as
in done in present modelocked lasers. The project objectives include a simple
preliminary demonstration of the concept and enough modeling to interpret the
results..j.>***//
