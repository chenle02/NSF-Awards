0121898 Valocchi The objective of the proposed research is to improve
fundamental understanding of reactive transport with the ultimate application to
remediation processes and the management and regulation of hazardous waste
sites. A particular goal is to determine the effects of pore-scale mixing on
reactive transport. The specific objectives of this research are to: (1)
determine the effects of local velocity, pore geometry, and reaction rate
constant on the extent of reaction in a homogenous pore network, (2) determine
the effects of local velocity, pore geometry, and reaction rate constant on the
extent of reaction in heterogeneous pore networks, and (3) develop relationships
that allow the effects of pore scale-mixing on reactive transport to be
accounted for at the continuum-scale. A combination of micromodel experiments
and Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) simulations will be used to quantify these phenomena.
The LB method is a kinetic theory-based numerical technique for solving
hydrodynamic and diffusive transport problems in complex pore structures. ***
