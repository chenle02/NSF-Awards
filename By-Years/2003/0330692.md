0330692&lt;br/&gt;Winful&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal
requests $3500 to support the 2003 Gordon Research&lt;br/&gt;Conference on
Nonlinear Optics and Lasers. The funds will be used to enable
more&lt;br/&gt;graduate students to attend this conference. Highlights of this
year,s conference include&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear optics in periodic mcro/nano-
structured materials, relativistic nonlinear optics,&lt;br/&gt;the generation of
ultrahigh harmonics, nonlinear microscopy, quantum optics and&lt;br/&gt;quantum
information science, the counting and control of optical cycles, and the
physics&lt;br/&gt;and applications of microstructured fibers. All of these areas
have seen significant&lt;br/&gt;advances since the last Gordon Conference in
2001, and many of these areas have&lt;br/&gt;significant controversies
associated with them making the subject matter ideal for a&lt;br/&gt;Gordon
Conference. This will be a fantastic conference for students and young
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This interdisciplinary conference will bring
together leaders in the&lt;br/&gt;field as well as graduate students and young
postdocs in an intensely stimulating and&lt;br/&gt;interactive environment.
Substantial time is allocated for discussions within the
technical&lt;br/&gt;sessions. We will actively seek out and encourage
participation by minority and female graduate &lt;br/&gt;students.&lt;br/&gt;
