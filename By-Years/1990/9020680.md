This award provides funding to construct large-format Charge Coupled
Devices(CCD) cameras as facility instruments for the telescopes on Mauna Kea.
These cameras will house custom CCDs purchased by the Institute for Astronomy
(using State of Hawaii funds) from Ford Aerospace. Two full CCD camera systems
will be constructed for use on the mountain. In addition to the two systems
destined for Mauna Kea, a third system that can operate a variety of detectors
will remain in the CCD Laboratory at the IFA in Honolulu, and will be used for
device testing, selection, characterization and optimization.
