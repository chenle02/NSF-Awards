National Geographic Television requests $1,121,583 (35%) of a total project
budget of $3,192,249, to produce a documentary series in 13 half-hour and one
hour-long special, "Facing the Wild: The Crittercam Chronicles," with associated
informal science education materials and programs. This project will feature the
natural histories of some of the Earth's most enigmatic and charismatic marine
species, highlight the groundbreaking technology employed to study these
extraordinary creatures and celebrate the scientists who devote their lives to
understanding marine creatures. The project's goals include: to educate
audiences about the vital importance of the world's oceans to the health of the
planet; to celebrate the ingenuity of novel technology developed for science and
exploration; to illustrate that many tantalizing mysteries remain yet unsolved
and a great deal of exciting science and exploration has yet to be done; to
provide viewers with scientific role models and help motivate them to pursue
careers in science. Employing cutting-edge remote imaging tools, including
"crittercam", and National Geographic's trademark storytelling, Facing the
Wild's strong conservation message is designed to appeal to a national and
global audience. A robust web site, virtual teacher workshops and Student Ocean
Conferences will augment the impact of the series.
