Topology, as a branch of geometry, seeks to classify, characterize and explore
those abstract spaces known as manifolds. Manifolds are locally like ordinary
euclidean spaces(the line, the plane, etc.); however, they are allowed to have
global twisting, curving and holes (e.g., circles, spheres, tori). They arise in
many models of physical and biological phenomena. Manifolds with singularities,
or stratified spaces, are even more ubiquitous as they appear as solution spaces
of algebraic and differential equations and as limits, degenerations and
compactifications of manifolds. Hughes has made a breakthrough in the
understanding of topologically stratified spaces by establishing a theory of the
neighborhoods of the singularities. This allows one to use geometric techniques
almost as if the singularities were not present. The current project is largely
concerned with exploiting this technique to further the understanding of
manifolds with singularities. As an example, Hughes will investigate the extent
of periodicity near the singular sets.

The proposed research concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds,
stratified spaces, trees and metric spaces. The investigations are in the areas
of stratified spaces, trees, ultrametrics and noncommutative geometry and the
fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory. The main tools are controlled
topology, surgery theory and C*-algebras of groupoids. Specific questions
concern periodicity in the neighborhood of the singular set of a manifold
stratified space, the classification of stratified h-cobordisms and stratified
pseudoisotopies, and non-locally flat topological embeddings. In addition,
techniques from noncommutative geometry will be applied to study the geometry of
infinite trees and other non-compact spaces at infinity.
