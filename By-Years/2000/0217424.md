This IGERT project will develop a graduate program of cross-disciplinary
research and training in Mathematical Biology. The goal of the program is to
give students a solid training in core mathematics and genuine expertise in an
area of contemporary biology. Such training will bring to bear the power of
mathematics on the exciting and challenging problems of modern biology. Students
will be recruited from a broad spectrum of mathematical, scientific and cultural
backgrounds. It is expected that the graduates of this program will receive
Ph.D.'s in mathematics, but by virtue of their broad-based training will be able
to contribute to collaborative research efforts in numerous academic and
industrial settings. In the process, the program seeks to build many new bridges
between mathematics and biology potentially reshaping research for a new
generation of mathematical biologists. The research and training program will be
organized around the four research themes of biofluids, ecology and evolutionary
biology, neuroscience, and physiology. A unique feature of this research and
training program will be the establishment of Special Interest Groups (SIG's).
Each SIG will be led by one or more faculty members with activities that include
discussion of research problems, discussion of recent seminars, formal and
informal talks about recent papers, student presented talks on background
literature, etc. The training of students will also include formal coursework in
both Mathematics and Biology, laboratory rotations or field work in an area of
the life sciences, mentoring by both mathematics and life science faculty, and
journal clubs, laboratory group meetings, and workshops. In these ways, the
training of students will put great emphasis on collaboration and interaction
across traditional academic disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-
wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists
and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical,
professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.
The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by
establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a
fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional
disciplinary boundaries. In the fifth year of the program, awards are being made
to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of
science and engineering supported by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
