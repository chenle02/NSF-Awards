9316021 DiPietro In the Pakistan Himalayan orogen, the Himalayan arc bends
sharply around a feature known as the western Himalayan syntaxis. The purpose of
this study is to develop a tectonic synthesis of the India-Kohistan collision
with special emphasis on the origin and development of the Indus syntaxis and
the Swat-Peshawar Basin region of Pakistan. Results will provide insight to
nature and tectonic development of the western Himalayan syntaxis and its role
in the development of the Himalayan orogen.
