With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A)
Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Franz Geiger of
Northwestern University to prepare and study films of iron and its oxides that
are 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. This approach makes it possible
to literally shine light on important technological problems connected to iron,
such as corrosion and environmental cleanup. By directly and indirectly
interacting with students, teachers, lawyers, and policy makers, the Geiger
group is also communicating science to the general public, specifically in the
context of the Village of DePue, a superfund site located in the state of
Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron and its oxides are dark and heat up upon
light exposure. Therefore, it is difficult to study their surfaces with
instruments that use light, such as a microscope or a laser, and the
understanding of many technological applications involving the surfaces of iron
and its oxides remains limited. The project invokes a concept that dates back to
1729, when it became clear that diluting colored solutions allowed increasing
amounts of light to pass through them. Applying this concept to iron solids, the
Geiger group researchers will prepare and characterize nanometer-thin films of
iron and its oxides and study their dynamically changing chemical and structural
responses upon contact with technologically relevant fluids using a variety of
interface-specific laser methods. Special attention will be paid to determining
mechanisms of surface passivation so as to develop methods for rejuvenating iron
substrates that otherwise deactivate over time.
