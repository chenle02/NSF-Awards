Among the best documented empirical regularities in criminology is the positive
association between past and future criminality. One interpretation of this
association (termed state dependence) is that prior criminal involvement
actually increases future criminal propensity. Another (termed population
heterogeneity) is that the association is not a reflection of a causal
relationship but rather is attributable to persistent differences across
individuals in their propensity to engage in crime. One or the other of these
interpretations is suggested by many competing general theories of crime. Yet
there has been little research attempting to distinguish these two fundamentally
different explanations. This project will statistically distinguish the relative
importance of the two explanations for the observed positive correlation between
past and future criminality. Two widely known panel data sets will be used for
the research--the National Youth Survey of U.S. youths and the Farrington and
West longitudinal survey of English males. Not only will this research address
the relative contributions of state dependence and heterogeneity in explaining
the positive association of past to future delinquency/criminality, but also it
will illuminate the nature of the association of a variety of individual,
familial, and behavioral factors to criminal involvement. Thus, the research
will make important contributions to extant general theories of crime.
