9309775 Lee The objective is to conduct research for the development of
synthetic-aperture tomographic imaging techniques and the implementation of
microwave and acoustic prototype systems capable of quantitative NDE of civil
structures and materials. The long- term goal of this research is the
realization of high-resolution, cost-effective, portable imaging devices for
accurate visualization of quantitative characterization of the condition of
civil structures such as bridges, roadways, harbors, dams and buildings. These
imaging devices can be used for not only existing structures for maintenance or
safety considerations, but also for newly constructed facilities for
verification and inspection purposes.
