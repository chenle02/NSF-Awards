Deep-sea cores provide the basic raw material for studies in paleoceanography,
paleoclimatology, sediment dynamics, and chemical oceanography. The curation
facilities provide an invaluable service to the marine geology and geophysics
and chemical oceanographic communities. Funds are provided for the continued
support for three years of the core repository at LDEO. These funds will defray
the costs of core handling, description, curation, sample distribution and data
management.
