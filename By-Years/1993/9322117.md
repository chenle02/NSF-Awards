9322117 Scotti Dr. Scotti will obtain and reduce charge-coupled-device (CCD)
observations of the unusual cometary object P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 which is
predicted to impact on the planet Jupiter in July 1994. The objective is to
obtain accurate astrometry of the brightest of the individual nuclei of this
comet so that improved predictions for the actual impact times may be made in
advance of the event. The image data will also be useful in characterizing both
the morphology of the comet and the large scale structures associated with the
comet.
