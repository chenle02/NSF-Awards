The physical structure of the "30 nm" chromosome fiber is a fundamental unknown
of eukaryotic genetics. The fibers play an integral role in gene storage,
segregation, expression, replication, recombination, damage, and repair.
Detailed knowledge of the 3-dimensional structure of chromatin fibers will give
insight into the essential protein and DNA contacts that stabilize chromosome
structure, constraints imposed on DNA sequence and structure, and constraints
placed on the enzymatic machinery that interacts with the genome. Those insights
will be important to understanding the normal and abnormal regulation of growth
and differentiation. The research supported by this award will focus on how
nucleosome are packed into "30 nm" fibers under physiological conditions. This
team of researchers proposes to determine important structural parameters of
chromatin fibers by quantitative cryoEM and x-ray scattering, using specially-
chosen fully hydrated chromatin molecules. In addition, the research team will
make the first attempts to study the structure of chromatin designed to have
homogeneous properties. We will determine the following structural parameters:
1) radial distribution of density; 2) radial distribution of protein, DNA, and
counterions; 3) radial distributions of HMG14/17; and 4) diameter, axial repeat,
mass per unit length, and helical symmetry satellite chromatin chosen to be
homogeneous by virtue of strong phasing of nucleosomes along the repetitious DNA
sequence. Our goal is to determine a model-independent, low resolution maps of
protein and DNA in thick chromatin fibers, which can be combined with higher
resolution crystallographic information about the nucleosome cores to determine
the pattern of interactions stabilizing chromatin fibers in cells.
