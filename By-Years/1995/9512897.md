This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical
physics between Pierre Ramond at the University of Florida and Pierre Binetruy
at the Theoretical Physics and High Energy Laboratory, University of Paris,
Orsay. The investigators are studying the implications of superstring theory for
Yukawa couplings (or fermion masses). They are focusing on the hierarchy of
quark and lepton masses, with the aim of relating it to the fundamental,
standard model for low energy manifestation. The project benefits from U.S. and
French expertise in superstring theory.
