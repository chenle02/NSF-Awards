NSF has made an award in support of travel for invited speakers (5) and graduate
students (5) coming from the United States to attend a Biophysical Society
Thematic Meeting "Single Cell Biophysics: Measurement, Modulation, and Modeling"
being held at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, June 17-20, 2017.
Speakers (30 total) will come from the United States, Asia and Europe. Students
will be selected for short presentations and presented travel awards based on
abstracts submitted in response to an invitation posted in the Biophysical
Society newsletter. Five student awardees will likewise be selected from Taiwan.
The meeting focuses on one of the grand challenges of biophysics: how to
understand the complexity of a single cell, which is multi-scale in time and
space. The meeting brings together engineers and scientists for the purpose of
discussing experimental, computational and theoretical advances in the single
cell biophysics field. Topics include advances in single-molecule, single-cell
and tissue imaging, dynamics and spatial organizations of cellular structures
and processes, responses of cells to three-dimensional microenvironments, new
experimental and computational methods for single cell analyses, and the
interaction of cells with materials. The meeting provides a unique opportunity
for participants from the US to interact with participants from Europe (e.g.,
Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Great Britain) and Asia (e.g., Taiwan, China,
Korea, Japan and Singapore). Results from this workshop, in the form of a
report, will be published in the Biophysical Society newsletter and made
available on their website.
