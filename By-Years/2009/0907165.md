This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three main goals. The
first is to develop new techniques in time-dependent molecular quantum mechanics
that are specifically designed to describe proton transfer reactions. These
reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological processes. The second
goal is to study Anderson localization phenomena for certain random quantum
mechanical models recently developed by physicists. These phenomena are crucial
to the understanding of how electrons move in various materials. The third goal
is to study the breakup of chemical states that have finite lifetimes. Secondary
goals involve the study of electric dipole moments of molecules, bound states of
rapidly rotating molecules, and molecules in magnetic
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators, their collaborators,
and their graduate students will concentrate on mathematical problems in two
areas. One area is chemistry, where the project will develop new techniques for
use by computational chemists studying chemical reactions. The second area is
the physics of disordered media, where the project will provide further insight
for why some materials are conductors while others are insulators.
