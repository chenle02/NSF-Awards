9417389 Hughes This grant is to provide approximately 20% of the support for the
operations of the International Seismological Centre, in cooperation with the
University of Reading, UK, which is the world's repository for seismic data from
about 1,850 stations world-wide. These data are used to compute hypocenters for
approximately 36,800 earthquakes and explosions per year. This service
represents the most complete source of seismic event occurrences available, and
the event locations and raw phase data are a major resource for researchers for
structure of the earth and for seismic hazard and statistics. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
