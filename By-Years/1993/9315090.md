CTS-9315090 University of Colorado Richard D. Noble ABSTRACT Ag{SYMBOL 43 \f
"Symbol"}- doped Nafion and block copolymer, ionomer membranes will be prepared
for separations involving alkanes, monoenes and dienes. Preliminary data
indicate high selectivities with these systems. Adsorption isotherms and
transmembrane fluxes for single component and multicomponent feed mixtures are
to be measured. Microstructure will be varied by means of solvent swelling and
synthesis of different block copolymers in order to understand the results with
Nafion and to extend them to other classes of polymers. Interest in membrane-
based separations derives largely from possible savings in energy and associated
environmental and economic costs. Many consumer products from automobile tires
to electronic devices to detergents depend on purification of olefins for high
quality.
