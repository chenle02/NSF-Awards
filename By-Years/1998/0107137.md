Gurnis &lt;br/&gt;0107137 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to
develop dynamic models of the interaction of plate tectonics with mantle
convection and continental deformation. They will continue with modeling studies
in which mantle dynamics is placed within an explicit plate tectonics framework,
such that models are tested with observations in both the time domain (for
example geological constraints on surface uplift) and present day geophysical
observations (such as seismic tomography). They will explicitly focus on three
problems which are well posed within a plate tectonics framework: 1.) The large-
scale flow since the Early Cretaceous associated with the breakup of
Gondwanaland; 2.) The time-dependent evolution of the Tonga-Kermadec subduction
zone since its inception during the Eocene; 3.) The deformation of western North
American lithosphere and upper mantle since the Middle Miocene. In all cases,
they will use a common methodology in which the convection equations are solved
within a spherical domain using a finite element code capable handling problems
with very large variations in viscosity. They will solve large, well-resolved
problems using the parallelized software on an in-house 312 processor Beowulf
computer. &lt;br/&gt;
