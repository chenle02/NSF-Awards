The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improved reliability for coronavirus
detection. The proposed project will develop a tissue purification technology to
extract (purify) virus from patient samples. Purer samples (more coronavirus,
less confounding materials) is anticipated to improve signal from virus and
reduce signal from non-virus materials, and is therefore anticipated to improve
the reliability of testing (fewer false positives and false negatives). This can
potentially impact the social distancing of the pandemic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project of a system to extract purified samples for coronavirus testing for
downstream testing, such as PCR-based analysis. The system is a novel
purification technology that uses biological (antibodies) and other physical to
quickly and reliably extract target microorganisms (here COVID viruses) from
human samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
