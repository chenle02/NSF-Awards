Contact lines arises as the intersection of fluid interfaces with solid
surfaces. For a long time, this area of study has been plagued with conflicting
theories and uncertainties regarding how the problem should be modeled. The main
difficulty stems from the fact that classical hydrodynamics (specifically, the
Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip boundary condition) predicts a non-
integrable singularity for the viscous stress at the moving contact line. In
this project, the moving contact line problem is to be systematically studied
with the help of macroscopic thermodynamics, microscopic molecular dynamics, and
numerical simulations. A ``first- principle'' contact line model is derived
based on principles of thermodynamics and molecular dynamics simulations. Novel
numerical methods will be developed for the contact line model, and will be
applied to study problems of both practical and theoretical interests, including
the contact line dynamics on heterogeneous surfaces. The asymptotic behavior of
the contact line model as the slip length goes to zero will be investigated with
the help of numerics and asymptotic analysis.

A contact line is the intersection of three phases, ofter two fluid phases and a
solid phase. The two fluid phases can either be two immiscible fluids such as
water and oil, or two phases of the same substance, such as the liquid and vapor
phase of water. The solid phase is usually the container for the fluids. For
this reason, the contact line is also the boundary of the interface between the
two fluid phases, and is therefore an ubiquitous part of interfacial phenomena.
Contact lines also arise in many applications such as coating, printing, oil
production, and in many micro-fluidic devices. The main difficulty of the moving
contact line problem stems from the fact that classical hydrodynamics predicts
an infinite rate of energy dissipation which simply implies that contact lines
cannot move. In this project, the PI will derive a first-principle contact line
model based on thermodynamics principles and molecular dynamics simulations.
Novel numerical methods will be developed and will be applied to study problems
of practical interests, such as the contact line dynamics on heterogeneous
surfaces.
