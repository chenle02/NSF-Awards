9720162 SPELL This award provides funding to establish the Nevada Isotope
Geochronology Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Terry Spell in the
Department of Geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This facility
will be able to process geological samples from academic, industrial, and state
and federal government laboratories. At present, researchers must wait for
extended periods of time to have samples processed at laboratories outside of
Nevada. The laboratory will enhance research for scientists investigating
subject areas ranging from genesis of ore bearing strata to dating of fossil
materials. In addition, the specialized instrumentation capable of surface
exposure dating of very recent strata will be applicable to studies of climate
change, constraining erosion rates and volcanic hazards assessment. Support is
provided primarily for equipment (a MAP 215-50 Rare Gas Mass Spectrometer and
related instrumentation and analytical equipment) and salary and benefits for a
full-time technician committed to running samples and maintaining the
instrumentation. Establishment of a Geochronology Laboratory in Nevada will
provide important infrastructure of use in both basic and applied research,
facilitate the research of scientists from a breadth of academic disciplines,
and contribute to economic growth and development in the state by serving
industrial clients involved in ore and petroleum exploration.
