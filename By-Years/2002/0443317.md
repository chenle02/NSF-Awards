Mathematical Sciences (21) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the
absence of textbooks and courses for prospective K-8 teachers that provide an
introduction to discrete mathematics and how it can be used both to help
prospective K-8 teachers achieve a better understanding of mathematics and to
help their students achieve state and national standards in mathematics. The
project develops an interactive discrete mathematics textbook for prospective
K-8 teachers, changes prospective K-8 teachers' views of mathematics by exposing
them to a college-level mathematics course which is taught interactively, and
conducts high-quality professional development workshops for college faculty
members who teach mathematics to prospective K-8 teachers. The project builds on
the materials developed in a previous NSF-funded professional development
project for K-8 teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
