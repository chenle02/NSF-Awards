At six year intervals since 1998, members of the evolutionary biology community
have convened to discuss future research directions in the discipline. In recent
years, evolutionary biology has grown at an enormously accelerating rate. The
discipline is now awash in comparative genomic data, and major conceptual and
empirical advances have been made in several areas. In June of 2011, the
American Society of Naturalists, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the
Society for the Study of Evolution will hold a two-day workshop to discuss
future directions in evolutionary biology. The goal of the workshop will be to
outline important areas for future research directions, and how scientific
societies and the field at large can act to advance such research. This workshop
will be the first of such society-sponsored events that will allow an ongoing
dialog within the evolutionary research community on the assessment and
development of focal areas for research.
