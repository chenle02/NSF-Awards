The Cleveland Collaborative for Mathematics Education has developed a three-year
program to support four integrated education and research postdoctoral
fellowships in mathematics. This initiative brings young research mathematicians
into direct contact with elementary and secondary mathematics teachers, students
and parents of the Cleveland Public Schools. The postdoctoral fellows do
research under the auspices of one of the following institutions of higher
education participating in the Collaborative: Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland State University, John Carroll University; they work under supervision
of the Collaborative on education projects in the Cleveland City Schools.
