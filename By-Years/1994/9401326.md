9401326 Shoureshi Electric power source has a major impact on the overall
electric power distribution on a national level. The optimal process of energy
generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization directly impacts
economics of every industry. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Advanced Control of Energy and Power Systems at Purdue University could
provide a better mechanism to stimulate industrial innovation in the development
of new technologies in the advanced control system or methods for energy and
power systems. A number of companies have committed to support this effort.
Currently there are seven sponsors for the Center committing approximately
$400,000. The Principal Investigators are internationally recognized scientists
who have the resources and capability to run this Center. The Program Manager
recommends Purdue University be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-
year continuing award. Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager
and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division will
review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria requirements,
including the following: 1) the extent to which the university/industry
interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the support base is
developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program is developing.
If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for
the next period of this continuing award.
