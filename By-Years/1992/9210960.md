In order to understand how the brain analyzes visual information, it is
essential to study the details of connections that are made between the eye and
brain. The present research seeks to understand this circuitry by analyzing
retinal ganglion-cell anatomy in relation to their electrophysiological
properties and the type of connections they establish in the midbrain. Single
optic-nerve axon staining methods are used to reveal the detailed anatomy of
neurons that form connections between the eye and the brain. Once such
connections are fully understood, it will be possible to determine how these
connections may change following injury. These experiments will also provide
information about the ability of nerves to regenerate functional connections
following injury to the optic nerve.
