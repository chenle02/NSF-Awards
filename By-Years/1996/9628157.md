This project would address the way in which school district spending patterns
influence student academic achievement and other educational outcomes. It
includes an analysis of the ways in which different types of spending
(instruction, administrative, etc.) influence the academic achievement such as
effective school organization. The study would use a number of multivariate
techniques such as structural equation models to analyze nationally
representative linked data bases from the Common core of Data and the National
Assessment for Education Progress. These two data bases combine the financial
information of school districts with student assessment data of districts.
