The Department of Geological Sciences at Cornell will act as a Site for
Research Experience for Undergraduates. Twelve undergraduate students will
choose from seven projects directed by 10 faculty during the summer of 1987.
Cornell has a new building, an expanded faculty, and an administrative
commitment to strengthen the undergraduate program. The variety of opportunity
is such that the program should prove most attractive to undergraduates studying
within 250 miles of Cornell, the population from which the students attending
this program will be selected.
