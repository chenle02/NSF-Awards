Professor Bo Zhang of the University of Washington is supported by the Chemical
Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry to introduce and
utilize a fluorescence-based analytical method to increase the sensitivity of
electrochemical detection. A key concept of this method is to use a fluorogenic
reaction to report the kinetics of a conventional electrochemical reaction of
interest, e.g., oxidation of dopamine. As such, this method could significantly
improve sensitivity in electrochemical detection and enable new capability. This
project will focus on developing a more comprehensive understanding of coupled
reactions on bipolar microelectrodes and optimizing fluorescence-enabled
electrochemical detection to achieve single-molecule sensitivity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new analytical strategy could have significant impact
on many important fields, such as neurochemistry, environmental analysis, and
electrocatalysis. This work will provide excellent training opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of electrochemistry, sensing,
and fluorescence microscopy. Graduate and undergraduate students, including
female students and minority students, will be recruited into this research
program. They will be actively involved in numerous training opportunities such
as using state-of-the-art analytical instruments, designing new electrochemical
experiments and analyzing results, presenting at group meetings and attending
national conferences, and publishing in leading journals in this field.
