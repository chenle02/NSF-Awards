The project aims to establish and strengthen rich connections between
mathematics and theoretical physics which will serve to advance both fields. In
physics, M-theory is an approach to unifying the different string theories,
which themselves provide a theoretical framework for unifying the forces of
nature: gravity and particle theory. The PI's recent mathematical advances will
provide rigorous calculations and predictions of quantities of physical
interest. In addition, the PI will continue to supervise young mathematicians,
run seminars and disseminate and speak widely about the research. Beyond this,
the PI will serve the broader community by continuing to run a math circle and
by continuing to play an central role in the summer Bridge program of
Northwestern University.

PI Zaslow, in a number of works, spearheaded the use of sheaf theory in
symplectic geometry and mirror symmetry. His recent work on invariants of
Legendrian knots and Lagrangian surfaces found new connections to cluster
theory. In the present work, Zaslow will extend these linkages to the dimension
of great interest to the physics of M5-branes in string theory: three-
dimensional Lagrangians and two-dimensional Legendrian surfaces. New and
interesting phenomena occur at this critical dimension. Zaslow will do the
following:

1. find superpotentials encoding counts of holomorphic disks bounding Lagrangian
fillings of Legendrian surfaces and establish Ooguri-Vafa integrality in all
framings;

2. explain how such counts are determined by (Seiberg-like) mutations from
cluster theory (at each genus, Donaldson-Thomas transformations relate them to
simple building blocks);

3. establish "framing duality" (i.e., prove that the genus-g moduli space
computes, via different framings, DT invariants of all symmetric quivers with g
nodes);

4. extend these results in complex three-space to the nonexact setting of the
resolved conifold by incorporating Q-deformations into the sheaf theory via
twisted sheaves;

5. apply this machinery to knot conormals to explain large-N duality using sheaf
theory;

6. prove the Lagrangians found by Zaslow-Treumann have special-Lagrangian
embeddings;

7. explain the Goncharov-Kenyon-Beauville integrable system via mirror symmetry.
