Three seismograph stations have been deployed in eastern Kazakhstan, around the
Soviet nuclear test site as part of a cooperative agreement negotiated between
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
Data from these stations represent a unique seismological dataset and are
crucial to the better understanding of several seismological problems. Until
now, these problems could be addressed only by analysis of data collected
outside this region or from the Soviet literature. Regional data prior to now
has all been from stations to the south in Iran, Afghanistan, and India. Paths
from this area of the Soviet test site to each of these regions cross
tectonically active regions which can seriously bias the results. This proposal
request funds for the preparation of the data for distribution to the
seismological community and for the examination of several seismological
problems.
