AST-0407374&lt;br/&gt;Cowie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sub-millimeter observations
with the revolutionary SCUBA (Sub-millimeter Common-User Bolometer Array) camera
on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope revealed the existence of a population of
dust-obscured ultra-luminous galaxies at high redshifts that constitutes a
substantial fraction of the cosmic far-infrared background. A full determination
of many aspects of the history of the universe requires a comprehensive
understanding of this dust-enshrouded galaxy population, and although enormous
progress has been made, there are still many areas of uncertainty. One
difficulty arises with galaxies with no known radio or X-ray counterpart, whose
distance (redshift) cannot be measured because their location on the sky is only
poorly known. The new Sub-millimeter Array telescope will be able to provide
accurate positions and thus to fix this problem. In addition, the paucity of
information about faint sources will be addressed with deep sub-millimeter
observations in a region of the sky that has both current and planned data in
various other wavelength regions. This research is fundamental to understanding
the star formation and active galactic nucleus histories of the Universe, and
will form the thesis of a graduate student, who will be well trained in this
burgeoning field.
