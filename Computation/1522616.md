Fluid flow control problems are ubiquitous. They arise in important applications
such as drag reduction (with the benefits of saving fuel or improving
range/speed), enhancing mixing (for more efficient combustion), reducing
structural fatigue, improved solidification and die casting, and efficient
cooling in large indoor-air environments. However, the ever-increasing need for
improved accuracy and complexity of the underlying flow problems lead to very
large-scale dynamical systems whose simulations and control make overwhelming
and unmanageable demands on computational resources. This research project aims
to develop novel computational techniques and a new rigorous mathematical
framework to solve large-scale flow control problems very efficiently. In
addition, the project will develop a year-long graduate course on Model
Reduction and Flow Control and will provide students with valuable
interdisciplinary education.

The current state-of-the-art is to solve flow control problems by using reduced
models constructed using the proper orthogonal decomposition. However, these
models are limited in that they are only guaranteed to be accurate for a pre-
selected range of inputs. This project will provide significantly improved tools
for the efficient analysis and approximation of large-scale dynamical systems.
It will also have direct application to model reduction for problems with
bilinear and quadratic nonlinearities. Bilinear models arise in control problems
for heat exchangers, and nonlinear partial differential equations with quadratic
nonlinearities include the Korteweg-de Vries (shallow waves), the Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky (turbulent flames), and the Landau-Lifshitz (magnetic fields in
solid state physics) equations. Using rational interpolation, this research will
lead to new algorithms to systematically perform high-fidelity, in most cases
optimal, model reduction for linear and nonlinear systems associated with
(discretized) flow equations. These reduced models will be used to design
optimal feedback laws. The new framework will offer major advantages: First,
unlike current approaches, the proposed control design will not require
expensive full-order, time-accurate simulations for specific input trajectories
or solutions of large dense matrix equations; the computational efforts lie in
computing a steady-state solution and solving a modest number of sparse linear
systems. Second, the reduced models will be uniformly accurate for a wide range
of input profiles and will not depend on specific input trajectories. Third, the
methodology will naturally create reduced models that respect the stability
properties of the original flow.
