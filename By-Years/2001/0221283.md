This dissertation investigates privatization of energy and water utilities in
Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Privatization has become one of the leading strategies
in international development circles and yet most of our knowledge is based on
the experiences of developed countries. This study will compare the recent
experience in two Central American countries with different histories of
privatization. In Costa Rica, privatization has been slow and deliberate while
Nicaragua has embraced international pressures to privatize quickly with less
public participation. Secondary data will be used to document the type and
extent of privatization in each of the industries in each country. Interviews
with government, business, and union leaders in the two countries will evaluate
who the important actors were in the transition to privatization, what the
perceived benefits and costs have been as a result of privatization, and how
state regulation has played a role in the water and energy industries.
