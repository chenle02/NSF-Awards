The intended two-year LSC Pilot project is a collaborative effort of eleven high
poverty districts in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and Tennessee. Working
together with universities and science rich institutions serving the area and
building on positive results realized through the Appalachian Rural Systemic
Initiative (ARSI), the districts have targeted K-6 science as high priority
(nine of these districts are working with ARSI). The intended project will
prepare a cadre of 22 teachers and 11 administrators at 11 pilot schools (one in
each district). Through summer institutes, academic study groups, job-embedded
reflective tasks, and online facilitated discussions the teacher leaders
strengthen their knowledge and skills in pedagogy, science content, and
mentoring. Quality of professional development is assured through the
involvement of national consultants, scientist and science educators from the
University of Tennessee, Eastern Kentucky University and Oak Ridge National
Laboratory.
