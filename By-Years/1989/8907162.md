This work involves the development and building of a uniquely designed self-
propelled mobile robot. The objective of the research is to determine if such a
robot can move and locate itself in a manufacturing cell with sufficient
accuracy and precision such that it can perform manufacturing and assembly
tasks. This design will involve mounting a small industrial robot on an air
pallet as the mechanism for mobility. The arm and its existing joint actuators
will be used for propelling the base to its new locations. Existing fixed robot
arm control algorithms will be applied to the different stages of the robot's
operation. These will be integrated into an overall control system. This project
will examine the expansion of manufacturing cells' work envelopes as
circumstances warrant. The research can lead to the enhancement of the
flexibility, capacity and capability of unmanned cells.
