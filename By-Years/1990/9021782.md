This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Guam for the
renovation and repair of the University of Guam Marine Laboratory which houses
marine sciences research and research training activities and is the only U.S.
marine laboratory facility in the region. This building was constructed in 1970
and last renovated in 1975. The ARFMP grant of $130,795 will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities which are located in a
harsh and corrosive tropical marine natural environment that necessitates an
unusually large amount of maintenance and repair of facilities. This project
will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by adding
and replacing laboratory counters, providing a laboratory space for
photomicrography and microbiology and a capacity for boat storage, and
eliminating the problems of fluctuations in water temperature and salinity and
algal fouling of the outside water table and aquarium area. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of undergraduate
and master's degree students. The Guam Marine Laboratory plays a unique role in
the nation's scientific base due to its geographical location and the specific
research expertise that it represents. It provides research opportunities for
native Pacific Islanders living on the U.S.- affiliated islands of Micronesia,
and indeed, outside of Hawaii, which is many thousands of miles away, it is the
only facility where local people can obtain undergraduate and graduate degree
experience and conduct research involving the local marine environments.
