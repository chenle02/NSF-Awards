Dr. Jeffrey I. Zink, Chemistry Department, University of California - Los
Angeles, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for an investigation of the
electronic excited states of metal-containing molecules. Detailed single crystal
polarized electronic absorption, emission, and resonance Raman spectroscopic
measurements will be made on volatile organometallic compounds, which could be
precursors for laser assisted chemical vapor deposition, and molecules that well
test theoretical predictions about excited state couplings and non-totally
symmetric modes. The results of these experiments will be used to determine the
geometries, distortions, properties, and reactions of the metals in their
excited states. When a metal containing compound absorbs light energy, it
becomes `excited`. In the `excited state` many of the properties of the compound
change and, e.g., chemical reactions can occur that normally do not take place.
In this study the excited states of metal compounds will be studied to establish
theoretical methods to predict and rationalize excited state behavior, and to
uncover the pathways by which metal compounds can be made to decompose into
valuable advanced materials.
