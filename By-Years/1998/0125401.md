Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Geology at Kansas State University is
obtaining several exploration geophysics instruments, including a differential
global positioning system, gravimeter, and ground penetrating radar system, in
order to build an undergraduate field geophysics teaching program adapted from
the successful SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) program led by
the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The instruments are also enhancing our
existing teacher education program. During the past two years, the department
has made a commitment to improving its undergraduate geophysics curriculum by
increasing the number of geophysics courses from one to five, and by increasing
the number of geophysics faculty from zero to two. The geophysical equipment is
being integrated into introduction to geophysics, field geophysics,
hydrogeology, exploration geophysics, field methods, field camp, and
introductory geology for education majors. The field geophysics course is taking
advantage of a local field site, the Big Blue River valley, and students are
mapping the subsurface geology using a variety of geophysical
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
