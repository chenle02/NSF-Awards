9504964 Klinkhammer This project will use chemistry of stable isotopes and trace
metals in pore waters and in shells of benthic foraminifera to examine the
effects of (1) organic matter and 92) metal remobilization upon the
biogeochemical record in the shells. Carbon isotopes and trace metals (Cd,Ba)
are widely used as tracers of past ocean production and deep water circulation;
the Pis have preliminary evidence that both are affected by early diagenesis.
The project will examine this effect in a range of environments differing in
surface water production (hence, carbon flux to the sediment) and in sediment
oxidation state. ***
