This project builds and expands upon a successful Calculus Reform Project
focused on recruiting and retaining minority students in the calculus sequence
at CUNY-Manhattan. The program emphasizes collaborative work on complex, real
world problems, using appropriate technology, making film animations of
algorithms, creating portfolios and doing research. This project extends this
interactive, dynamic learning environment to pre-calculus courses as well as to
statistics courses. Project results should reflect an increase in the number of
women enrolling in calculus courses, improve the retention of women in pre-
calculus and statistics courses, and improve the likelihood of women becoming
mathematics majors.
