This two year project will implement the Jaime Escalante Math Project at Hiram
Johnson High School and its West Campus and Feeder Middle Schools in the
Sacramento City Unified School District. During year-one two HJHS teachers will
be trained in the methodology and strategies used by Mr. Escalante. This will be
done in the academic year during a series of Saturday workshops taught by Mr.
Escalante. Then, in the summer these project associates and Mr. Escalante will
team teach three classes of 30 students each. During the second year of the
project six more teachers will be trained in JEMP and then practice these new
methods and strategies during the second summer in classroom settings. Also
included are student tutorial sessions Monday through Thursday during the second
academic year and a series of one-day presentations on JEMP to elementary school
teachers in the SCUSD which are Feeders for the middle schools. Cost sharing
equals 177% of the NSF award.
