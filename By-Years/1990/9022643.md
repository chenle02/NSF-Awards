This project contributes methodologically and substantively to our
understanding of the relationship between long-term and short-term interest
rates. It explores surprisingly robust empirical regularities in the term
structure of U.S. interest rates obtained earlier by the investigator in joint
work with applied empirical economists using financial data from Goldman and
Sachs. The project uses these empirical results as guides toward developing
theoretical models that capture the dynamics of financial markets much better
than other existing models. New statistical methods for estimating the
characteristics of non-linear dynamics from discrete economic data are also
developed. The research addresses a number of fundamental theoretical questions
about financial markets. It will provide new insights into the determinants of
the volatility of financial markets. The research consists of two main projects.
The first one estimates an unobservable states, Markov chain model of interest
rates using a time series of prices on different interest-rate- sensitive
instruments such as U.S. treasury bonds, bond futures and options on bond
futures. The presence of futures and options on the data should enhance the
estimation of the process that determines the volatility of interest rates. The
use of a time series of different bonds allows for the estimation of the risk
premiums embedded in the securities' prices. The second project aims at
developing moment conditions to be used in testing and estimating continuous
time stochastic models while avoiding either the use of continuous data or the
use of numerical solutions for the conditional distribution of the state
variables.
