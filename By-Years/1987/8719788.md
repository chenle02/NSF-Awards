The objective of this project is to complete an investigation of structural
failures and performance data concerned with constructed facilities. The
investigation will identify causes and types of failures for such structures as:
bridges, buildings, pavements, and other public works. The data derived from the
project will be widely disseminated to decision-makers for corrective action.
