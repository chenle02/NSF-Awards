9753075 Jasiuk This research program investigates the mechanics of bone,
treating bone as a multiscale material. Major goal lies in the passage from the
molecular level comprising thousands of mineral fibers and collagen matrix
(micron scale) to an effective continuum level (scale of centimeters). Local
fields and constitutive laws of bone for elastic, inelastic, and fracture/damage
regimes, on those larger scales will be sought. The proposed project will be
involved numerical and analytical investigation but close contact with the
experiments being concurrently conducted at Emory University will be maintained.
These experiments, along with already published results, will provide a basis
for verification of our computational micromechanics modeling. ***
