This research is to continue analysis of earthquake data collected in the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake aftershock series by means of the PASSCAL seismic
instruments. This data will be augmented by the USGS Calnet stations and other
portable arrays and refraction data. The current project is solving for Vp/Vs in
a single-step inversion. The next step is to iteratively solve for Vp and Vp/Vs.
A 3-dimensional image of the subsurface properties will be determined which will
be used to investigate properties of rocks at depth relative to locked versus
creeping portions of the San Andreas fault. The results will also be used to
improve locations of earthquakes in the region to investigate geometry of faults
and the complex tectonic system. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
