This award supports the research of Professor Dinakar Ramakrishnan in the theory
of automorphic forms and representations. This work involves three problems with
relations to number theory, which have L-functions as a common theme. The main
focus is on a program to prove multiplicity one for the space of cusp forms on
the special linear group SL(2). The second problem concerns fine versions of the
strong multiplicity one theorem for the general linear group GL(n). Finally, the
principal investigator seeks to complete a proof of the Tate conjecture for all
quaternionic Shimura surfaces. Historically, automorphic forms arose out of non-
Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians
and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental
importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is principally
concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and
analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems in
areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in
information theory.
