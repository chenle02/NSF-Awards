The University of Houston (UH) seeks to establish a CyberCorps(R): Scholarship
for Service (SFS) program to prepare graduate students for government service in
order to help secure, protect and defend our Nation's information systems. UH
proposes to support 3 PhD students and 9 MS students. UH is classified as a Very
High Research University, is classified as a Hispanic-Serving institution, and
has been designated as a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
Education since 2009. This project seeks to address the needs of the Gulf-coast
region and beyond, the need of the nation for cybersecurity professionals, and
the need for more women and underrepresented minorities in
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project is on enriching
cybersecurity education with related fields such as data mining, machine
learning, statistics and natural language processing. UH proposes to build a
community of well-qualified scholars in trusted computing, provide a rich set of
theoretical and applied cybersecurity experiences for the students, foster
diversity in the student pool, and disseminate successful models of
cybersecurity education to the nation. The education plan includes the use of
cyberwar and laboratory exercises for community building and peer mentoring.
Professional development activities planned include workshops focused on
professional skill development, seminars, and external visits to government
agencies and research institutes.
