The Fourth FASEB Conference on Plant Gene Expression will bring together cell
biology and molecular genetic approaches to the study of plant development. The
meeting topic was chosen in light of recent success in gene cloning combined
with technological advances that permit analysis of developmental events at a
finer level than previously permitted. The session cover topics ranging from
gametogenesis through reproduction. Attempts to balance the use of genetics and
cell biology will be focused on in each session, including a consideration of
the factors that influence cell fate, such as neighboring cells, the
environment, the cytoskeleton, and meristem prepatterning. The meeting should
provide an atmosphere for the exchange of data and ideas gained from different
experimental systems. The FASEB meeting will focus on development, rather than
attempting to cover all areas of plant biology. By combining genetic, molecular
and cell biology approaches to questions of development, scientists should come
together who may not normally attend the same meetings.
