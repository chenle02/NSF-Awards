This research emphasizes interaction control and reflex control in autonomous
systems. Physical interaction with the environment (e.g., opening doors; moving
obstructions; complying with mechanical constraints) is a key ingredient of
reactive autonomous systems, and impedance control will be furthered to provide
such behavior. In particular, stable and "gentle" manipulation behaviors will be
investigated and constructed using principals of passive physical equivalents.
The target resulting behavior should achieve stable interaction among any number
of independently- controlled machines. Such physical behavior will provide a
suitable platform for investigation of reflex-like, higher-level controllers.
Reflex controllers, like conventional control systems, generate commands based
on sensory inputs. Unlike traditional control, though, reflex-like responses
invoke logic- based and switched-mode actions that cannot be analyzed in the
traditional terms of linear superposition of inputs or outputs. Use of such
nonlinear control constructions has proven highly valuable in understanding
control in biological creatures, though such control is inadequately understood
to be applied to machines. In this research, biological stimulus/response
behaviors will be mimicked in constructing computer controls for the purpose of
experimentally investigating stability properties and design techniques for
behavior-based systems. //
