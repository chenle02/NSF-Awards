Churchwell, Edward B. AST 96-17686 Dr. Churchwell will study the formation
processes and early evolution of massive stars in our Galaxy using a variety of
observational techniques in the radio and infrared. His research program focuses
on a study of the environment of ultra compact HII regions, the earliest
manifestations of high mass stars. He will use observations of molecular lines
in the radio and the infrared to investigate the velocity structure, chemistry,
energetics, and physical conditions in the gas near these stars. He is
particularly interested in understanding the properties of molecular outflows
and the accompanying accretion disks believed to be associated with young
massive stars during their formation. ***
