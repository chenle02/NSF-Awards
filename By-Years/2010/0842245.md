0842245&lt;br/&gt;Fluegeman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition
of table top scanning electron microscope, a Hitachi Model TM-1000 Tabletop
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), which can scan uncoated samples at low
vacuum and is equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to permit
semi-quantitative compositional mapping. The SEM would support a range of
faculty and student research at Ball State University including: 1) sedimentary
petrography; 2) understanding the effects of underground CO2 sequestration on
reservoir rock petrophysics; 3) foraminiferal micropaleontology, biostratigraphy
and paleoceanography; 3) igneous petrology; and 4) high temperature geochemistry
and petrogenesis of geothermal deposits. Extant undergraduate departmental
research immersion programs will foster student research experiences with
electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
