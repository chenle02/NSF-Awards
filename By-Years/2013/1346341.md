This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project?s primary
objective is to develop a glucose-responsive platform for 24-hour delivery of
insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which will cover the patient?s entire
daily dose in a single administration. The company?s drug delivery technology
platform is designed to passively deliver the right amount of insulin at the
right time. Successful development of this technology is expected to 1) make
basal and prandial insulin obsolete (a projected $32 B market in 2018), 2)
reduce the need for constant monitoring and multiple injections per day, 3)
improve glucose control, via a self-regulating system that requires no patient
intervention post-dose, 4) better protect patients against long-term diabetic
complications, and most importantly, 5) give those with diabetes a chance at a
normal life.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. If
successfully, the proposed platform could enable hundreds, if not thousands, of
other stimulus-responsive medicines. The proposed delivery system can
encapsulate many other types of drugs within the core particle system, and we
have identified stimulus responsive elements that respond to hypoxia,
inflammation, etc. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination of
scientists. If medicines are released on a controlled basis, upon other types of
stimulus, this technology may open up a world of continually personalized
medicine that will substantially improve the health and quality of life for
patients worldwide.
