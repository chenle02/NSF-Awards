New techniques are proposed for the handling and fabrication of scintillating
crystal radiation detectors such as NaI(Tl), which is highly valued because of
its exceptionally good energy resolution. This crystal, as well as others used
for radiation detection, is extremely fragile and hygroscopic. It is grown,
cleaved, and packaged in a dry atmosphere. The new techniques proposed include
the use of water free, liquid bathes for cleaning and handling, and optical gels
for packaging and mechanical shock isolation. In addition, it is proposed to
fabricate larger detectors from irregularly shaped by-product crystals. The
possible benefits of the proposed work are: (1) less expensive detectors for
radiation measurements; (2) easier to handle detectors; and (3) larger detectors
than previously available for high energy photon measurements.
