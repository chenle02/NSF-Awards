The research objective of this award is to integrate optical instrument designs,
biomechanical, biochemical, and microstructure analyses to elucidate and
characterize relationships between collagen fiber re-alignment and failure under
dynamic loading conditions. This investigation will provide systematic
engineering analyses and predictive models to enable the assessment of tissue
injury and degeneration for better optimization of the recovery processes. The
broader vision for the research is that it will culminate in synergistic
activities between experimental and clinical efforts aimed at a breakthrough in
clinical treatments of damaged tendon-to-bone insertions. This research will
make important contributions to fields within health care, science, engineering,
and society as a whole. To transfer the outcomes of this project outside of the
academic community, the PIs will work with the NC Biotechnology Center. Through
presentations to local companies and interaction with startup incubators, this
experience will permit us not only to advertise these outcomes to companies in
the field of tissue engineering, but also collect feedback from them on the
experimental data essential to their technology development. The proposed
research will form the basis of our graduate courses, including the basics of
the structure of materials and biological aspects of tendon-to-bone insertion.

Tendon-to-bone insertions are functionally-graded connective tissues whose
anisotropic biomechanical functions depend intimately on the regional
biochemical composition and structure, thus functioning to alleviate stress
concentration at the junction of these tissues. Studies conducted under this
award will expose and quantify properties of tendon-to-bone insertions subjected
to different magnitudes of loading, associated loading time-scales (e.g., strain
rate), mutual interactions, as well as the order in which these events occur. In
parallel, constitutive and finite element models will be developed to predict
the response of tendon-to-bone insertions under different loading conditions.
