0140214&lt;br/&gt;Myhrer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of the research is to
investigate nuclear-hadronic&lt;br/&gt;dynamics with a particular emphasis on
its relation to quantum&lt;br/&gt;chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental dynamics
of quarks and gluons. We&lt;br/&gt;are particularly interested in the role of
chiral symmetry, which is one&lt;br/&gt;of the basic symmetries of QCD.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral perturbation theory offers a systematic and
practical framework&lt;br/&gt;to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of
hadrons, particles that&lt;br/&gt;actually constitute nuclei. Our research makes
extensive use&lt;br/&gt;of this formalism. At the same time, for those phenomena
which are at&lt;br/&gt;present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation
theory, we&lt;br/&gt;resort to models that preserve chiral symmetry and that can
be applied&lt;br/&gt;to complex nuclei. Specifically, we study: &lt;br/&gt;(1)
Consequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to&lt;br/&gt;few-
nucleon systems; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Muon capture on light nuclei and its relation to
neutrino&lt;br/&gt;interactions with light nuclei; &lt;br/&gt;(3) Radiative
corrections for the neutrino-deuteron cross sections,&lt;br/&gt;corrections that
will be of importance for next-generation high&lt;br/&gt;precision solar
neutrino data to be obtained at the Sudbury Neutrino&lt;br/&gt;Observatory;
&lt;br/&gt;(4) Comparison of the sigma model and chiral perturbation theory; and
&lt;br/&gt;(5) Strangeness condensation in dense matter.
