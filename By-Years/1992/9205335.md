This U.S.-Mexico award supports Professor Janos Fendler of Syracuse University
in a research collaboration with Professor Luz Alicia Focugauchi of the
Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares in Mexico. The researchers
intend to prepare and characterize surfactant-vesicle- entrapped semiconductors,
liquid crystals, and polymerized liquid crystals. Molecules that contain
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are called surfactants (surface active
agents), amphiphiles, or simple detergents. They are the building blocks for
aqueous and reverse micelles, microemulsions, liquid crystals, polymerized
liquid crystals, vesicles, and polymerized vesicles. All of these systems have a
common theme in that they mimic the functions of biological membranes. For this
research, the U.S. investigator will contribute his expertise in many facets of
membrane mimetic chemistry, while the Mexican investigator will bring to bear
her expertise in the application of positron annihilation techniques to the
study of surfactant based organized media.
