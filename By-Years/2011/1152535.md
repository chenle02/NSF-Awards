The PI is a prominent geologist at MIT who has spent more than 25 years studying
and mapping the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. Much of this work has been funded by
the Continental Dynamics Program. The results of this body of work form the
basis of a book about to be published, ?Tectonics of the SE and E Tibetan
Plateau and Its Foreland?. It is the first such summary of the geology of this
region with a major new synthesis for its evolution. This work will serve as a
basic framework for tectonic research in this part of China as well as SE Asia
in general.

This award will provide support to complete the plates for the maps that are an
essential component of the book. The plates are unique in that they are a
digital and layered presentation in two basic formats that can be fully
manipulated by the reader. Such a presentation may represent impetus for other
Earth scientists to publish maps in this format, which may represent the future
style for publication of geological materials.
