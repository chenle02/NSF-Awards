With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. The new instrument will support the research of
major users in the Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Molecular Biophysics and
Biochemistry Departments. Some of the studies that will exploit this instrument
include a) EPR studies of photosystem II and Mn model complexes; b) site
directed spin labeling studies of protein secondary structure; c) de novo design
of metal ion binding sites in proteins; d) bioinorganic studies of actIV cyclase
and transition metal uptake; e) characterization of metal oxide catalysts; and
f) EPR studies of RNase P. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information about
the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to
obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often
essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular
biological chemistry.
