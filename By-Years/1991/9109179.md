Many pesticides are chiral--that is, their chemical structures exist as a pair
of "hand" enantiomers. Generally, only one of the pair of enantiomers exhibits
the desired biological activity. Despite mounting evidence that critical
pesticides should be developed and marketed as single enantiomers, more than 90%
of the synthetic chiral pesticides are marketed as racemic mixtures, which
contain both enantiomers. The principal reason is because of the high cost and
technical difficulty of preparing the enantiomerically pure chiral intermediates
needed to prepare the chiral pesticide. The goal of this program is to develop a
simple, cost- effective process to prepare enantiomerically pure (s)-m-
phenoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin, an important chiral intermediate used in the
synthesis of pyrethroid insecticides--a commercially important class of highly
effective insecticides. In Phase I, we demonstrated the technical and economic
feasibility of our approach, which is based on dual-membranes enzyme-reactor
process. In this Phase II program, we plan to characterize and optimize the
process and, through construction and operation of a bench-scale unit, generate
the data necessary to commercialize the process with our probable Phase III
sponsor, a major manufacturer of m-phenoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin.
