This grant if for support of the operation of the University of Rochester's
Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory for the calendar years 1993-94. The
research exploits heavy-ion beams from the upgraded MP tandem Van de Graaff
accelerator and a powerful arsenal of equipment such as the Recoil Mass
Spectrometer, split-pole magnetic spectrometer, gamma-ray detector array and
accelerator mass spectrometry system, for a broad program in nuclear science.
The investigations of nuclear structure at high spin and isospin involve
measurements of nuclear shapes, pairing correlations, spectroscopy of normal and
superdeformed states, and nuclear moments. The nuclear reaction programs involve
studies of breakup, pre-equilibrium processes, and transfer in heavy-ion
reactions. A study of electron- positron emission in heavy-ion collisions is
another major thrust of the program. The accelerator mass spectrometry program
encompasses a wide range of science with important applications to environmental
science.
