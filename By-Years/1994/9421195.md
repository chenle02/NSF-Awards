Dr. Lindzen will continue research on a variety of topics in dynamic
meteorology, climate dynamics, and geophysical fluid dynamics. Specifically, he
will (1) examine the roles of potential vorticity mixing in conjunction with
radiative forcing and Hadley circulation dynamics in determining the
atmosphere's meridional temperature distribution; (2) further explore the role
of gravitational tides on the outer planets; (3) expand a study of this process
in the Milankovich mechanism; (4) continue studies of the upper tropospheric
water vapor budget and its parameterization; (5) investigate the stationary
waves that were forced by the major ice sheets during the last glaciation and
their role in observed rapid climate changes; (6) study the nonlinear
accommodation of a fluid to the saturation of Rossby waves when their enstrophy
exceeds the available mean enstrophy; (7) study the excitation of radiating wave
packets by the Orr mechanism; and (8) determine whether barotropic stabilization
accounts for the supercritical equilibration of two-level monlinear models of
baroclinically unstable flows. The water vapor studies will be conducted in
collaboration with scientists from the Center for Ocean-Land- Atmosphere
Interaction (COLA) and COLA GCM; the other studies will be conducted mechanistic
models of varying complexity. All of these studies will contribute to better
understanding of the basic physics of weather and climate and the dynamics of
planetary atmospheres. The water vapor studies will contribute to the goals of
the Role of Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global Climate Change Program.
