Research is proposed in two areas within the field of high- temperature
superconductivity: continued testing of the univers- ality of the electronic
Raman continuum by studying new high- temperature superconductors (HTSCs) and
variations on existing HTSCs; and the careful comparison of Raman spectra with
other measurements on well-characterized, single-crystal samples. Even as
research on high-temperature superconductivity is becoming more mature and more
orderly, the pace of discovery, the intensity of competition and the complexity
of the subject make it unique in condensed-matter physics and materials science.
