HRD-0430112&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Herb Schroeder has been on faculty at the
University of Alaska at Anchorage since 1996. The PAESMEM nomination clearly
lays out Dr. Schroeder's activities and his approach to mentoring that spans
educational levels, emphasizes and succeeds at retention, and provides related
opportunities to the local communities of indigenous people. Dr. Schroeder's
extended goal is to effect systemic change in the hiring patterns of Indigenous
Americans in the engineering and science professions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for
Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to
recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the
participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics,
and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
