This CPATH Conceptual Development and Planning project creates linkages between
computer science and many other disciplines at the University of Nebraska
through a redesigned computing core and an infusion of computational thinking
concepts and learning environments into a broad range of courses and academic
disciplines. The faculty team plans to use a holistic approach called
Renaissance Computing that covers both computer science and other disciplines
and creates a computing student population with multidisciplinary backgrounds.
The activities include arranging workshops and meetings to determine the needs
of the many participating departments, designing a cohesive curriculum to
support computational thinking, conducting a pilot study of two
interdisciplinary courses, and developing an implementation plan for full scaled
institutional transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
the project lies in expertise and commitment of a large interdisciplinary
project team from a number of different academic divisions across the campus.
The holistic approach and computational thinking vision are sound and timely.
The project has the potential for national impact and to provide new models for
computing education of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
the project lie in the potential to address changing demands on computing
professionals and to attract a diverse audience of students. The project has the
potential to engage the entire faculty and student body and to foster
computational thinking throughout each academic program, thus producing students
much better prepared for the computational intense professional careers of the
future. The project includes outreach to high school students as well as
dissemination of resources and results to a broad computing
community.&lt;br/&gt;
