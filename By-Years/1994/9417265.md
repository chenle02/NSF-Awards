9417265 Theofanous This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. scientists
in a U.S.- Japan seminar on Intense Multiphase Interactions, to be held in Santa
Barbara, California from June 9-13, 1995. The co-organizers are Dr. Theofanis
Theofanous of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Professor Mamoru
Akiyama of the University of Tokyo. This seminar will address a single, very
special, phenomenon known as Steam (or Vapor) Explosion. The phenomenon is of
great interest to several diverse fields including volcanology, industrial
safety, and in the production of specialty materials. Progress in the
understanding of this phenomena has been slow but definite, due primarily to
major advances in computing power and experimental techniques. This seminar will
also enhance progress in this area. The U.S. participants provide a broad cross
section of expertise and geographical representation in the area of heat
transfer and fluid mechanics, and were selected on the basis of being the most
active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives
of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
international collaboration. ***
