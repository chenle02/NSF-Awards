The P.I. will investigate the potential impacts of agriculture on methyl halide
emissions to the atmosphere by quantifying biochemically related sources of
methyl bromide, methyl iodide, and methyl chloride. Controlled experiments will
take place on a variety of rice cultivars and other crops in a greenhouse to
evaluate the factors that influence methyl halide emission rates, such as
temperature, light level, and plant-development state. A hypothesized enzyme-
driven process of production of methyl halides will be investigated by assaying
enzyme activity in leaf-disk samples as emissions are measured, along with
enzyme-inhibition experiments using caffeic acid. Experiments will cover the
growing season of rice to determine if emissions are concentrated during any
plant-development stage and if emissions correlate with those of methane.
Similar experiments will study other crop plants (wheat, barley, broccoli,
rapeseed).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EF) are also newly
identified sources of methyl bromide and iodide; related fungi have been known
as significant emitters of methyl chloride. The environmental occurrence of
these fungi is great enough to indicate potential significance for the global
atmosphere. This project will survey emissions from EF species in lab studies
and will study environmental controls on these emissions. The project will also
measure emissions from salt marshes and mangroves, building on new observations
of methyl halide emissions from these habitats. Researchers from Stanford
University and the University of Pennsylvania will collaborate in the project.
The results of the project will be useful as input to atmospheric
photochemical/transport models to assess impact on regional tropospheric ozone
amounts. The emissions data should lead to significant improvement in our
understanding of the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic sources of
methyl chloride and methyl bromide, and also to new views of terrestrial sources
of methyl iodide.&lt;br/&gt;
