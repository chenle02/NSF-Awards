9301833 Siver This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support the
collaboration of Peter Siver of Connecticut College and Maria Vigna of the
University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The project aims to examine the
biodiversity and ecological requirements of the algal flora Chrysophyta in the
Parana River system. The Chrysophyta, especially the scale-bearing species,
represent one of the most important bioindicator groups of aquatic organisms.
Their biodiversity in subtropical waters is poorly understood. This project, an
initial phase of a large-scale study, will describe the composition and
distribution of species along environmental gradients for the river's deltaic
region. The flora will be compared to other subtropical, tropical, temperate,
and arctic regions in order to understand the spatial distribution of this algal
group. Organisms not known to science will be identified and described. Both the
U.S. and the Argentine sides will benefit from development of a database for use
in paleolimnological inference work aimed at understanding the effects of human
disturbances on aquatic resources. ***
