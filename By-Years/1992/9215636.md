The emphasis of this research project is on accurately modeling the friction
characteristics so that its effect can be predicted in simulations. Friction has
a significant influence on control systems since it limits their accuracy and
speed, and may even induce tendency to instability, In addition to extending the
reset integrator model, a new method of adaptive friction compensation is
introduced. With this approach it is possible to estimate the coefficient of
friction while the system is in operation, and to use this estimate to cancel
out the friction component by an opposite term in control. The technique is
verified by simulation, and the utility of adaptive compensation is validated
experimentally via an apparatus designed and fabricated during the research
period.*** //
