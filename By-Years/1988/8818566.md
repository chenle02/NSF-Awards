The subject of this research project, to be carried out at this predominantly
undergraduate institution, involves measurement of D-Region absorption effects
on high frequency radio signals. The mesospheric water vapor concentration and
lightning induced changes in the ionosphere. This is the major research effort
within the physics department of this undergraduate institution and
significantly contributes to the stimulation of both the faculty and
undergraduate students.
