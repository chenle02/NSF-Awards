This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of bioanalysis. During the tenure of this three-year continuing
grant, Professor Meyerhoff and his students will pursue fundamental studies
relating to the use of enzymes as labels in several novel binding assay methods
of analysis of biomolecules. Three specific research thrusts utilizing enzyme-
linked binding assays (ELBAs) will be pursued, namely (1) the development and
study of a new lectin-based homogeneous ELBA, with the specific intent of
synthesizing more useful enzyme-oligosaccharide conjugates and demonstrating
that such conjugate/lectin systems can be used to probe rapidly the carbohydrate
structures of intact glycoproteins; (2) assessment of the applicability and
analytical limits of using multiple enzyme labels in conjunction with multiple
binders to perform simultaneous ELBAs of biolmolecules in a single mixture; and
(3) exploration of the feasibility of implementing in situ electrochemical
release of substrates for potential use in ELBAs for the detection of specific
proteins. %%% This research builds upon results obtained under NSF grant CHE-
