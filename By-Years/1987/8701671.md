This research is concerned with improving the performance of asynchronous
algorithms. These algorithms involve a number of independent activities which
generally access common data. Activities must synchronize with one another to
insure that data is kept consistent. Unfortunately, synchronization impairs
performance. The overall goal of the research is to develop techniques for
reducing synchronization requirements. Much of the research will be concerned
with concurrency control in database systems and will focus on optimistic
algorithms. Such algorithms are based on the assumption that synchronization is
rarely needed. They allow activities to execute in an asynchronous fashion and
rely on rollback if situations are detected in which activities should have
synchronized. Thus, rollback is the major cost and one goal of the proposed
research is to develop techniques for reducing the probability of its occurence.
These include the use of semantic information about activities, the use of
special techniques for handling heavily accessed regions of the data (hotspots),
and the use of information that can be gathered about an activity when it is
formulated as a Prolog program. The application of optimistic algorithms to
replicated databases is another area of interest. Such databases have been
proposed to improved the availability of data in failure situations and can also
serve to enhance performance. Finally, research will be done on strategies for
performing non-atomic updates on certain shared data structures. The goal is to
guarantee that readers, which execute asynchronously, always function correctly.
