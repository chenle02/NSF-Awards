This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of Washington supports
the development of a fiber optic back scatter instrument, FOBS-2, which will be
used for research in near-bottom sediment transport. The instrument will provide
closely spaced, accurate measurements of suspended sediment concentration near
the bottom in high energy, near-shore environments, providing a significant
improvement over existing capabilities. The present award will support system
design, fabrication of two instruments, and testing in both laboratory and field
settings. The instrument design will be made available to other researchers, and
University of Washington will also build instruments for other research
groups.&lt;br/&gt;
