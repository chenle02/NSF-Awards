This action is in response to the NSF Announcement of Program Initiative No.
91-55: "The 'Class A' Prediction Phase of the VELACS (Verification of
Liquefaction Analysis by Centrifuge Studies) Project". VELACS is an NSF-funded
coordinated study of the effect of simulated earthquake loading on a variety of
model geotechnical structures, such as earth dams and embankments, in order to
investigate the mechanisms of liquefaction-induced failure, and to acquire data
for the verification of the various analysis procedures for the liquefaction
problem. The experiments are run on the geotechnical centrifuges at the
California Institute of Technology, University of California at Davis,
University of Colorado at Boulder, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Princeton
University and Cambridge University, England. The "Class A" prediction phase of
the VELACS project involves making analytical/computational predictions before
the experiments are performed; then the experiments are run, and the measured
results compared with the predictions. "Class A" predictions are analogous to
"single-blind" studies in medical research. A workshop, scheduled to be held at
the University of California, Davis, in September, 1993, will compare the
predictions to the experimental results, and conclusions will be drawn regarding
the effectiveness of the analytical/computational methods used. Sixteen research
groups from around the world (nine in the U.S.; one in Canada; three in Japan;
and three in the U.K.) are participating in this prediction exercise. This study
at Dames & Moore in Los Angeles is examining the effectiveness of a practice-
oriented method of nonlinear dynamic analysis.
