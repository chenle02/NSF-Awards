The major purpose of this research is to examine the implications of learning
for rational-expectations equilibria in markets. The setting for much of this
work, experimental markets, makes it possible to clearly distinguish between the
theory of the market and people's behavior in that environment. A series of
experiments will be run to discriminate among different models of learning. The
experiments will be set up to investigate Bayesian learning, regression
learning, and learning with heuristic learning rules. The experimental market in
which the data are generated is a sealed-bid market with suppliers who determine
output and simulated demanders. This research is important because learning
theories are central to many current issues in economic theory. in addition,
this research will provide a deeper understanding about the formation of
rational expectations.
