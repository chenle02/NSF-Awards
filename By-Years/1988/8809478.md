The goal of this project is to derive effective approaches for integration of
compiler, microarchitecture and circuit design techniques to achieve high
performance. At the compiler level, the focus is to combine register
allocation/assignment and code scheduling algorithms to exploit architecture
parallelism. At the microarchitecture level, the objective is to investigate how
various forms of parallelism (such as pipelining and multiple instructions per
cycle) can be used by the compiler to improve performance. At circuit level, the
intent is to apply novel memory and logic design techniques to efficiently
support the parallelism in the microarchitecture. The principal investigator is
a junior faculty who has done good research as a Ph.D. student. This research
project has good ideas and it is likely that new results will be obtained in an
important research area. Funding is highly recommended.
