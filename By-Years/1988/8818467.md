This proposal requests funding for a workshop which has the aim of providing
future directions for the field of lasers in medicine. The workshop will focus
on three elements: 1) review the current status of lasers in the field of
medicine, 2) identify the primary fundamental engineering and science problems
confronting the field which inhibit further growth and 3) provide direction for
this emerging technology. This workshop will communicate the proper attitude
necessary for successful orientation of researchers in this interdisciplinary
field, namely, provide reflection and direction.
