This Engineering Research Equipment grant will partially fund the purchase of a
tensile testing system that can be used for small samples, including tissues and
synthetic replacements for biological tissues. The system that is presently
available is intended to be used with large samples. The device that will be
purchased will benefit the research of a number of investigators working in the
biomaterials field. The projects that will make use of the equipment include: 1)
the enhancement of boundary lubrication for artificial cartilage; 2) effect of
joint inflammation treatment on cartilage mechanics; 3) use of fibers and
fabrics to increase the fatigue strength of elastomeric materials; and 4) viable
composite grafts for the repair of articular focal defects.
