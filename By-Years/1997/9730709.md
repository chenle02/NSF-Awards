ABSTRACT A new approach and instrumentation for CO2 research will be developed.
The proposed project will attempt to capture up to 70 tons of CO2 per day
currently being emitted naturally into the Los Angeles Department of Public
Works Mono Tunnel aqueduct which nms under the Inyo National forest. This CO2 is
currently being vented to the atmosphere. The proposed work will lay the ground
work for a truly long term CO2 experiment in mature, native pine forest in
California. The proposed research will develop the necessary instrumentation and
approaches to utilize a natural non-commercial source to provide the CO2
necessary for an extensive, replicated FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment on a
natural forest. The proposed activities will develop the procedure and
instrumentation necessary to collect and deliver the gas in a highly controlled
manner using a FACE system within a native pine forest in the Inyo National
Forest. Benefits of this research include expansion of FACE into a native forest
setting, provision for a truly long term FACE experiment and establishment of
links with other elevated CO2 experiments. It will contribute to a comprehensive
assessment of CO2 effects on the ecosystems of the Western region of the United
States.
