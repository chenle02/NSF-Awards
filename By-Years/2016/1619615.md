The goal of this research is to explore how plasma, a gas made up of
electrically charged particles such as electrons and ions, behaves when it is
subjected to a particular electrical condition called a 'multipole field'. When
a cloud of plasma is placed within a structure of several long, parallel metal
rods with rapidly changing voltage applied to them, some of the plasma particles
may be trapped at the center of the structure. This effect provides a laboratory
test bed for conducting many new basic plasma physics experiments. The
experiments will be performed along with computer simulations of the same
phenomena to gain combined insight into the underlying physics of the collective
interactions of the trapped particles. This project will take place in an
environment that is accessible to undergraduate university students. The results
and descriptions of the research will also be incorporated into outreach for
physics in the greater Anchorage community. In particular, the research will
create a centerpiece demonstration of plasma science on-site at the University
of Alaska - Anchorage to provide formative encounters for K-12 students, and
positive engagement with the community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is a computational and experimental study of the behavior of low-
temperature, quasi-neutral plasma in a three-dimensional, time-varying electric
multipole field. Theoretical work done previously on this topic raised questions
that point to the need for such simulations and experiments. Computer
simulations will study the effect of the plasma species' mass difference on the
plasma response, e.g. the multipole field's ability to focus the light species
to the center of the multipole structure while the space charge is neutralized
by the heavy species. The results of computer modeling will inform an initial
experimental design and study of the same effects. A resonant multipole
structure will be constructed and installed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and
experimental measurements of the plasma in the multipole will be made for
comparison to the computational results. The laboratory setup will serve as a
versatile testbed for ongoing studies in basic plasma physics, including: plasma
effects on ponderomotive gyroresonance; formation and dependences of the radio
frequency plasma sheath with variation of the plasma and external field
characteristics; the effect of neutralizing space charge on plasma density; and
radiation pressure effects on the plasma boundary.
