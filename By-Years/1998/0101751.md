This project is combining traditional surveying techniques with training in
high-technology spatial data acquisition and manipulation in the Geomatics
Technology Program. The program provides training in industry-standard
applications including GIS, GPS, land information systems, remote sensing and
traditional surveying. In this project, the scope and resources in the program
are being expanded. The project's five major goals include improving teacher and
faculty knowledge in geographic information technologies; developing a local
mapping and surveying workforce; enhancing the technical experience for
students; improving laboratories; and promoting careers in mapping, surveying,
and geographic information technologies.

Activities include developing cooperative education and internships, providing
more hand-on experiences for students with industry standard equipment, job
shadowing for college faculty, summer workshops for high school teachers and
college instructors, a fast-track program for industry professionals, and a
short video to market Geomatics Technology to high school and non-traditional
students.
