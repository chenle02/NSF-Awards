This award supports cooperative research in nuclear fusion reaction studies to
be carried on by Robert Vandenbosch of the University of Washington and three
researchers at the TANDAR (TANDem ARgentino) reactor physics department of the
Comision de Energia Atomica (CNEA), Argentina's nuclear energy commission: Jorge
Testoni, Salvador Gil and Alberto Pacheco. They will measure the spin
distribution of the compound nucleus, Halfnium 170, near the barrier (one-
dimensional barrier model). This will give a description of heavy ion reactions
in low energy fusion. The laboratory at the University of Washington has the
equipment for making the gamma-ray multiplicity measurements of the spins of the
fused nucleii and the TANDAR Laboratory can determine the absolute cross-
sections. This is efficient use of both laboratories so this is a particularly
well balanced collaboration. The U.S. researcher is a recognized leader in
nuclear studies and the complementary expertise of the U.S. and Argentine groups
will lead to mutual benefits for both.
