This award uses funds to develop a multiproxy record of the paleohydrology and
paleolimnology of Flathead Lake, Montana utilizing the discharge record into the
lake from winter snowpack. This record will be used to determine the natural
variability of extreme hydrologic events in the region and correlated to the
position of the Alleutian Low, jet stream, and several climatic
indices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to obtain long cores
from the lake and proxy indicators of discharge (grain size) and hydroclimate
(diatoms and ostracodes) will be developed in the laboratory. Proxy indicators
will be calibrated using existing short cores covering historic intervals before
being applied to the longer down-core sequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this proposed research center on providing important
information on the nature of abrupt climate change as well as the frequency,
duration and magnitude of major hydrologic events in the region. These in turn
are directly applicable to management of water resources and prediction of how
anthropogenic changes will effect hydrology of the region. &lt;br/&gt;
