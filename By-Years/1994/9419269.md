Although much work has been recently done in China, the knowledge of the Early
and Middle Paleozoic configurations of the cratonic blocks and terranes that
constitute present-day Northwestern China is still inadequate. This project will
study newly recognized Cambrian through Devonian strata in Tarim and Nantianshan
terrane to obtain paleomagnetic poles for these time intervals to better define
the apparent polar wander path for the Tarim and Nantianshan terranes. Results
will help unravel the complex tectonic histories of China and Gondwana.
