Animals affect plant community structure and dynamics directly (consumption)
and indirectly (physical disturbance). It is clear that in addition, the spatial
pattern of impacts also significantly influences the structure of plant
communities. This collaborative research project will test a series of
hypotheses concerning the spatial patterns of herbivore influence using a system
of animal-generated disturbances (plains pocket gophers in herbaceous plant
communities) that occur in spatially predictable patterns (uniformly spaced
burrows and aggregated mounds on the surface). The impact of the spatial pattern
of disturbance on resource distribution and plant community structure will be
investigated. Furthermore, these patterns will be analyzed at several scales
(from microscale neighborhood effects to field-wide patterns). Comparisons also
will be made between two sites that differ significantly in soil
characteristics, allowing analysis of the amplitude of herbivore-generated
effects in relation to soil fertility. This work will contribute significantly
to understanding the role of animals in plant community structure by determining
the patterns of animal activities and the mechanisms by which they are
translated into pattern in the environment, in plant growth and recruitment, and
in vegetation across spatial scales ranging from several cm2 to hundreds of m2.
