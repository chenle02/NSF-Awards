The goal of the proposed work is to redress a need in the educational technology
and cognition community for a broad, institutionalized, sustainable research
network in support of technology enhanced education. Consequently, the PI is
organizing an invitational conference to run in parallel with a similar
conference funde by the DGF. The two workshops will begin the process of teaming
researchers cross nationally and setting up a collaborative research agenda for
technology supported education.&lt;br/&gt;
