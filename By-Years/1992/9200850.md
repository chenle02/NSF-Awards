The 1992 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be
held March 18-21, 1992 in College Station, Texas. The Symposium is organized
around the theme of "Graphics and Visualization." It is sponsored by the
Interface Foundation of North America and hosted by the Statistics Department of
Texas A&M University. Professors James Blinn and Edward Tufte will give the
keynote address and plenary session, respectively. These sessions should lead to
discussion of how the new graphics tools can be used in the study of data and
statistical methods. Sessions are being organized in the areas of Geographic
Information Systems and Climate Research so that experts in these areas can
interact with computer scientists and statisticians. There will also be sessions
in a number of statistical methodology areas as well as in very recent
developments in numerical methods, including the Gibbs sampler and wavelets. The
1992 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be held
March 18-21, 1992 in College Station, Texas. The Symposium is organized around
the theme of "Graphics and Visualization."
