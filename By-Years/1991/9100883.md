In a cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at Sacramento
Peak and the University of Texas at El Paso, junior and senior electrical
engineering and computer engineering students spend the summer working on design
projects at UTEP and at the Observatory. At present, Observatory personnel do
not have the time or resources to retrofit or redesign existing equipment that,
although marginal, functions at an acceptable level. This opens the door for
many student design projects aimed at optimizing existing equipment. These
projects include the design of a serial handbox interface for telescope control,
the development of a noise insensitive fiber optic link for CCD camera data, and
the design of calibrated timing source for synchronizing instruments used for
solar observations.
