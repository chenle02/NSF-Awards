This award is in support of the collection of 100-200m depth cores from the
Antarctic Peninsula and analysis of the cores to obtain a high resolution
climate history over the last two thousand or more years in the sub-antarctic
latitude belt. The principal scientific goals are to add to a global synthesis
of paleoclimate variations and to assess the relationship between paleoclimate
records from interior Antarctica and climate changes at lower latitudes. The
program is a cooperative effort between British Antarctic Survey, Ohio State
University and the University of Washington. University of Washington
participation is aimed at supporting the coring program through ice dynamics
measurements and modelling to aid in site selection and interpretation of the
ice stratigraphy.
