ABSTRACT 0344004 Potts, Colin Georgia Tech Research Corp

Software is nothing but rules, some of which correspond directly to codes of
conduct or policies that govern human action (e.g. administrative rules,
restrictions, rights and responsibilities). Designing the software for any
complex system unavoidably involves the design and regulation of the human
conduct that the system engages. Typically, however, the software code that
formalizes such codes of conduct is not highlighted or treated specially in the
design process. Such rules lose transparency and cannot be called into question
or changed easily. As a result, computer-based systems often regiment human
behavior unnecessarily, reducing decision-making discretion and flexibility.
Before we can hope to improve design practice so that these shortcomings are
addressed by reliable design principles, it is necessary to to understand better
how policies become formalized in the first place, what organizational
principles in software architecture can be exploited to uncover and modularize
policy, and what are the effects of such policy embedding on the flexibility and
autonomy of human organizations. These are fundamentally scientific questions
whose object of study are the design of the artificial normative systems that we
call software-intensive systems. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to
conduct such a scientific investigation with the aim of informing design
practice as a future, not immediate goal.
