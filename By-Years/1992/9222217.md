In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Clouthier will continue to study the electronic spectroscopy of highly
reactive intermediates in supersonic expansions. His experimental work will be
supplemented by ab initio calculations of spectroscopic parameters. Systems
chosen for examination include carbenes and their germanium analogs (e.g., GeF2
or HGeCl) as well as HCOCN and PO2. In the past Clouthier has been instrumental
in developing pyrolysis jet and pulsed discharge jet sources and using them to
produce and analyze spectra of such transient species. %%% It is important to
establish sensitive methods for detecting and characterizing reactive species in
order to optimize industrial processes. The most useful analytical methods for
studying reactive molecules in industrial systems are those that can be applied
in situ. The spectroscopic tools applied in this project, laser-induced
fluorescence in particular, are very sensitive methods for detecting the
transient chemical species which participate in such processes as combustion or
chemical vapor deposition, which is used in the manufacture of semiconductors.
