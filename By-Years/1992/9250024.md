New Mexico will foster systemic change which improves mathematics and science
education in New Mexico's K - 8 public schools. The systemic change will be
based on the Re:learning model of school- based reform and will incorporate new
content, pedagogy and assessment in mathematics and science. The project will:
1. establish a state-level Council of stakeholders to provide guidance and
oversight for systemic change activities; 2. establish regional technical
assistance centers whose staffs will work directly with K-8 schools in
implementing systemic change; 3. initiate staff development programs in
approximately 90 elementary and middle schools in each year of the program, with
each school participating in a two-year program of summer and academic year
staff development activities guided by the Re:Learning model of school-based
change; 4. assist in the development/dissemination of state standards,
assessment systems, teacher licensure requirements, and staff development
policies which are aligned with the standards being prepared by the NCTM, NSTA,
and AAAS; 5. support post-secondary curriculum reforms and community
organizations initiatives which are consistent with (4) above; 6. encourage the
engagement of resources and programs which support the other objectives of the
systemic initiative; 7. create the conditions needed to reduce the performance
gaps typically associated with gender and ethnicity in math and science
performance; and 8. evaluate annual progress in meeting these goals. ***
