9352182 Cleveland It is increasingly clear that interdisciplinary approaches are
required in the natural and social sciences to characterize and solve global
environmental problems. Accordingly, this project is helping implement a new
undergraduate interdisciplinary program in environmental studies. The project is
aimed specifically at improving the instruction of quantitative systems
modeling, geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, and computer
networking to undergraduates in the social sciences. An environmental modeling
course teaches students a systems-oriented approach to the analysis of
environmental problems. GIS courses provide students with the skills and
technologies for spatial analysis. Environmental networking teaches students how
to use electronic communication networks. All courses also encourage independent
student research projects and collaboration with faculty. ***
