Theoretical and computer simulation studies of effective interactions and
thermodynamic phase behavior in macromolecular materials will be undertaken.
Three classes of system will be investigated: charge-stabilized colloidal
suspensions, polyelectrolyte solutions, and colloid-polymer mixtures. The main
objectives are to characterize effective interactions between macromolecules in
solution and to input these interactions into statistical mechanical theories
and computer simulations to predict thermodynamic behavior. The project will
benefit the new Computational Physics program at North Dakota State University.
