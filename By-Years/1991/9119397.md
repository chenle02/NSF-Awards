Stromelysins are a family of secreted metalloproteinases that degrade various
components of the extracellular matrix. Recent evidence suggests that the
secretion of stromelysins from nerve cells may play a role in axonal growth. To
address this issue, the neuronal-like clonal cell line, PC12, will be used in a
novel in vitro assay to study the effect of experimentally manipulated
stromelysin levels on neurite invasiveness of basal lamina. The possible release
of stromelysin from PC12 growth cones will also be studied using
immunocytochemistry and in situ substrate degradation. In addition, possible
tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression of stromelysin mRNA
will be studied in the embryonic rat. These studies promise to enhance our
understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the growth of axons.
