This project is funded as a Phase I award under the 1989 Small Business
Innovation Research Program solicitation. The objective of this project is to
(a) examine conditions under which task and dominance cues impact the attainment
of status in groups, (b) examine interventions to overcome the interaction
inequality faced by women and minorities, and (c) examine special conditions
faced by women who attempt to increase their status in task groups.
