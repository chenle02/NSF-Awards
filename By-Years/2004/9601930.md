9601930 Lerner-Lam This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $500,000 as one-half support of the costs of acquiring a
very large mass storage system for earth and environmental research at the
Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. Specifically, the equipment will include
roughly 10.5 terabytes (TB) of mass storage, of which, 500 GB will be
concentrated in high speed file servers and a serial storage architecture (SSA)
disk and the remaining 10 TB of storage will be accommodated by digital tape
through a "juke box" system. This mass storage system will serve both the IBM
scalable parallel supercomputer (SP2) at Lamont and a network of 140 high
performance workstations for this group's data intensive research including,
reflection and refraction seismology, numerical modeling of the geophysical
fluid dynamics of the Earth's mantle, climate dynamics and exploration and near-
surface geophysics. ***
