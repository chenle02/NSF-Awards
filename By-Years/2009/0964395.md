Modern data centers host operations as varied as flight planning, drug
discovery, and Internet search running on thousands of machines. These services
are often limited by the speed of the underlying network to coordinate parallel
data access. In current data centers, network I/O remains a primary bottleneck
and a significant fraction of capital expenditure ($10B/year). Compounding the
problem are operational issues caused by interference between services, down
times due to failures, and violations of performance
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a hardware/software
architecture with the following capabilities: i) non-blocking bandwidth to
hundreds of thousands of hosts; ii) ``slicing'' across services with minimum
bandwidth guarantees; iii) detecting fine-grained performance violations; iv)
tolerating a range of failure scenarios; v) supporting end host virtualization
and migration. Our goal is to enable modular deployment and management of
networking infrastructure to keep pace with the burgeoning computation and
storage explosion in data centers. This work will result in a prototype fully
functional virtualizable data center network fabric to support higher-level
services.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include: i) outreach to under-represented
minorities through the UCSD COSMOS program; ii) a public release of the data
center communication workloads, protocols, and algorithms we develop; iii)
working with our industrial partners and advisory board to address key
performance and reliability issues in a critical portion of the national
computation infrastructure. A significant outcome will be students trained in
data center networking and cloud computing.
