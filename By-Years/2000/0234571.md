The research places dependability analysis in a formal, software engineering
process. This process is integrated with the analysis phase, when analysts and
domain experts are interacting to formalize models of the artifact, environment
and requirements of the system. The research focuses on building accurate,
useful, robust models of the environment. The general approach is to look to
existing modeling methodologies that center on exploring the environment. Those
that show promise, e.g., the strand space methodology used in security models,
will be retooled and integrated into the HDCP/MDS testbed.

The research also focuses on the environmental assumptions that are made during
modeling as a basis for dependability of the deployed system. The research
explores the link between assumptions made at analysis time, i.e., the
assumptions made about the environment for the system to function correctly, and
the actual environment behavior seen at run time (or testing/simulation time).

The evaluation of the research will be conducted on a series of projects taken
from the HDCP/MDS testbed. Each project will be selected to highlight a separate
modeling issue of the environment.
