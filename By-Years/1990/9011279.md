An autonomous Administrative Domain (AD) is a set of resources such as host
computers, networks, and gateways, that is governed by a single administrative
authority. Interconnections across ADs comes about through interconnection of
private networks and by dividing an internet that has grown too large to manage.
Common approaches to network interconnection create a fully connected internet
out of the constituent networks. Network access control mechanisms have been
designed for use in inter-AD gateways to control access to end-systems in
interconnected networks. When networks are used for transit purposes as well as
for access to end-systems, however, these network access control mechanisms are
not adequate. In this project critical aspects of the design, specification, and
prototype implementation of a first Inter-Domain Policy Routing protocol suite
will be developed. Initial experimentation will carried out in the University of
Southern California computer science laboratory and will subsequently be tested
over actual, cross-country, multi-administrative domain facilities. Thus, by
incorporating policy-related contraints on inter-AD communication into route
computation, this research provides for essential maintenance and improvement of
the research Internet and the research infrastructure it provides to scientists
and engineers.***//
