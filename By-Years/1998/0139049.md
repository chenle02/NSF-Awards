This award provides funding to the Polytechnic University of New York for the
support of a three-year, REU Site in Information Systems for Undergraduates,
under the direction of Dr. Frank A. Cassara. This eleven-week summer program
will involve twelve students annually in an intensive research experience on
various projects in the area of information systems and electrophysics. Each
student will be closely mentored by an individual faculty mentor who will plan
work and review progress throughout the program. The students will benefit not
only from extensive interactions with participating faculty, but also with
graduate students. Participants will have informative tours of the institution's
research laboratories and there will be two or three seminar presentations to
the group by leaders from industry, universities or government agencies. The
program will conclude with a research review during which each student will make
a formal presentation and respond to questions. A formal final written report of
professional quality will be required of all participants.
