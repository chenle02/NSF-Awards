The investigator and her students will contribute to mathematical modeling
efforts for desert ecosystems, which may be vulnerable to desertification under
climate change. These models address the underlying mechanisms behind the
spatial patterns of vegetation biomass that occur when certain semi-arid
ecosystems are stressed by decreased precipitation. Interfacing self-organizing
spatial effects for vegetation with the enormous variability of precipitation
that define drylands suggests new directions for fundamental pattern formation
research. The research will also contribute a mathematical framework for testing
the robustness of the ecological proposals that the spatial patterns may serve
as early warning signs of tipping points associated with climate change.

The research will be developed within a framework of deterministic and
stochastic mathematical ecological models, with its objectives enhanced by the
availability of rich satellite data that can be used to test model predictions.
The first objective is to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, a class of
pattern-forming reaction-diffusion vegetation models to determine the robust
transitions between distinct vegetation pattern states that may occur as the
model system approaches its trivial desert state. This analysis will be based in
bifurcation theory. The second objective is to develop and analyze vegetation
models with temporally variable precipitation inputs, and spatially variable
drainage networks. This will lead to the development of stochastic models with
non-Gaussian noise. Model reduction methods will be used to further determine
the consistency between model frameworks. Satellite image data of dry-land
ecosystems will inform and verify the modeling effort. The project also has an
education component with the goal of training undergraduate and graduate
students in interdisciplinary applied mathematics research.
