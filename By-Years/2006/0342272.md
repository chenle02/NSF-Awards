The objective of this SGER project is to conduct a feasibility study on
innovative design and control methods for variable valve actuators needed for
high performance camless engine operations. The fully flexible camless valve
actuator and control can enable more fuel efficient and less polluting vehicles.
The project will encompass two aspects: a novel actuator and sensor design for
satisfying fully flexible camless engine valve motion requirement, and control
of the actuator for generating precise valve lift profile as a function of the
engine crank angle. The actuator, sensor, and control design will deal with
mixed electromagnetic, hydraulic, and electromechanical systems of similar time
scales. The results can be applied to a broad range of applications, where the
requirements for actuator/sensor size, stroke, dynamic motion, and the master-
slave type electronic cam synchronization control are as challenging as those of
the camless engine application addressed in this project.
