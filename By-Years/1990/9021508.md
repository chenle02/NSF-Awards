The principal investigator will study partial differential equations with
random noise terms. Such equations often arise when physical systems are
influenced by noise. This work will consider qualitative properties of solutions
in the nonlinear case. There are several goals of this project. The first would
involve the carrying over of the coupling technique from the field of infinite
particle systems to stochastic partial differential equations. Another goal is
the development of Ito's formula for the heat equations with a noise term. Also,
propagation of singularities would be studied for random hyperbolic equations.
