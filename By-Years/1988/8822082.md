The Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP II) is intended to yield an ice core
drilled to bedrock (approximately 3100 m) from a site close to Summit in central
Greenland. The resultant record will be the longest ice core record yet
retrieved from the Northern Hemisphere extending back through the last
interglacial and into the proper glacial period (approximately 200,000 years).
As planned, this record will include measurements of: stable isotopes in ice,
gases and isotopes of gases, cosmogenic isotopes, major anions and cations,
trace metals, organic compounds, and other trace constituents, particulates,
physical and mechanical properties of the ice core, bore hole studies and
atmospheric studies. The purpose and justification for a GISP II science program
has been clearly stated in a series of documents and priority statements issued
by the National Science Foundation, the Polar Research Board of the National
Academy of Sciences, several ad hoc committees and the scientific community.
This award is for the administration of the science plan and for the
establishment of the management structure on behalf of the paleoclimatology
research community. The GISP II scientific management office will reside at the
University of New Hampshire under the supervision of Dr. Paul Mayewski.
