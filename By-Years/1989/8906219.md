This project provides resources to procure equipment to support research in
multivariable control systems, distributed parameter systems, and robotics. The
equipment comprises a control computer, actuator hardware, sensors, and a
vibration isolation table. The first research topic focuses on the algebraic
geometry design of multivariable control systems with structural and robustness
constraints. The equipment would allow for the demonstration of the control
design laws obtained from the algebraic geometry approach. The second research
topic addresses the development of a passivity based approach to the stability
analysis and controller design for distributed parameter systems. The equipment
is used for the experimental validation of the design tools determined in this
study. The equipment is also used for the third research topic to test control
concepts for flexible robotic systems.
