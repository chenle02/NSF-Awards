The PIs are organizing the 4th Biennial Women-in-Theory Workshop. This workshop
is to take place in New York City in May 2014 immediately before the 46th ACM
Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2014), in coordination with New York
University and Princeton University. The intended audience of the workshop is
graduate students in the field of theoretical computer science (TCS). Motivated
by the low overall number of female faculty members, researchers, and students
in TCS world wide, the workshop has two goals. The first is to deliver an
invigorating educational program to the student participants by inviting leading
female researchers to present tutorials of their research topics. The second is
to provide an outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from
different institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a
sense of kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this
area by having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers
present. The format of this workshop consists of more than ten technical
tutorials, one non-technical talk, a student rump session, and a panel
discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first three Women-in-Theory workshops were
greeted with great enthusiasm both from the participants and from the TCS
research community at large. Response has been strong for this year's workshop
from female students at universities across the United States. Since the first
workshop in 2008, the PIs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback and
many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as
testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping
women become more successful in TCS.
