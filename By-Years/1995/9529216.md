Changing political and economic climates in the U.S. over the past decade have
resulted in increasing partnerships between universities and industries.
Decision makers in government, business and universities are eager to learn how
to shape and encourage successful allliances. An earlier study by these
investigators examined three types of conflicts that might affect their
progress: conflict of interest, conflict of commitment, and conflict over
internal equity. In this second phase, the investigators will explore a number
of ambiguities with respect to such issues as modifications to traditional
teaching loads and reduced interaction with students, allocation of credit and
intellectual property, and oversight of faculty-industry interactions, that
surfaced in the initial project. The research consists of personal and telephone
interviews with university administrators and science and engineering faculty at
institutions with industry funds. Its goal is to establish a clear understanding
of the ways that ambiguities and related issues are being resolved. It will
identify and analyse administrators' and faculty's insights and responses with
regard to such issues as allocation of time, publications restrictions, and
incentives in order to understand how they are being resolved to foster
successful university-industry relationships. Success here refers to the extent
to which the various participants resolve or minimize potential conflicts. The
study will utilize participants' perspectives to determine the implications for
the colleges and universities and for federal policy toward these institutions,
by focusing on specific ways successful partnerships are being nurtured and
providing insight into the possible implications of organizational
transformations that may be occurring to accommodate these relationships.
