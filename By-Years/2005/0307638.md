AST 0307638&lt;br/&gt;Harrington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop
a linked series of 3D hydrodynamic and chemical models for the impact, plume
blowout, and plume flight/splash phases of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) events.
These models will advect tracer particles, whose temperature (T) and pressure
(p) histories will drive chemical and grain models. Chemical and grain results
will be re-inserted into the splash model to calculate realistic light curves
and impact-site images. Several investigations will be carried out with the
models, which will run on a small cluster supercomputer. The model is required
for full interpretation of the puzzling SL9 data, and will yield basic
information about Jupiter's atmosphere and comet composition. The models will
test theories for the expanding rings seen by the Hubble Space Telescope.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has a very broad impact. It is the first
observationally-constrained 3D radiative-hydrodynamic chemical model of all
phases of a cometary impact. The models and model grids will be archived with
the Planetary Data System so that they will be quickly available for use in
planning observations of the next impact, be it 10 or 500 years from now. The
models will make&lt;br/&gt;predictions for the Cassini mission. Public interest
in impacts is high, so results will appear in both the scientific literature and
in popular science magazines.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
