This is a collaborative experiment between NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,
Louisiana State University, University of Washington, University of Alabama in
Huntsville and University of Tokyo, Japan. The experiment involves the long
duration balloon borne flight (approximately 1 to 2 weeks) of blocks of
sensitive photographic emulsion from McMurdo, Antarctica. The interaction of
extremely high energy (1-1000 TeV) cosmic rays with the emulsion chambers allows
the investigators to study the chemical composition and energy spectra of the
cosmic rays, and also allows study of nuclear interactions at these very high
energies. This is part of an ongoing series of such experiments, but the first
from Antarctica, of the Japanese-American Cooperative Emulsion Experiment
(JACEE). The flight is also intended as a test for a similar experiment that is
scheduled to fly on Space Station Freedom as part of Astromag.
