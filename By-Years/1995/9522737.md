9522737 Brei This Research Planning Grant is to evaluate the concept of C-block
piezoelectric actuator design. C-block actuators are curved composite beams with
at least two layers of piezoelectric materials which have the potential for
generating larger forces and orders to magnitude more deflection than equivalent
polymeric stacks. This project will design, build and test a C-block actuator
for both its static and dynamic performance. Such actuators have applications in
the aerospace, automotive, health and rehabilitation, and manufacturing fields.
