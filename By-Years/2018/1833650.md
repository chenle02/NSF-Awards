&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid expansion of the global commodity
chemicals industry presents a significant opportunity to promote sustainability.
Resource-efficient technologies are urgently needed to save energy, conserve raw
materials, and minimize harm to the environment and human health. This grant
will provide partial support for US-based graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers and early career scientists from diverse backgrounds to attend the
2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Green Chemistry to be held from July 28
to August 3, 2018, at the Grand Hotel Rey Don Jaime, in Castelldefels, near
Barcelona, Spain. This GRC aims to promote interactions between academia,
industry and government from various countries on frontier topics in green
chemistry/engineering, environment and sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
theme of the 2018 Green Chemistry GRC is "Addressing the Challenges at the
Energy-Materials-Food-Water Nexus through Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering".
Consistent with this theme, the GRC will feature nine sessions encompassing
chemocatalytic, biocatalytic and electrocatalytic approaches for sustainable
conversion of emerging feedstocks to chemicals and fuels. The GRC will also
feature a session on the use of quantitative metrics to guide the development of
sustainable chemical processes and products. Emphasis will be placed on
addressing grand challenges that will benefit the society at large. The young
conference participants will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and
presentations by leading experts, by exchanging the latest advances on frontier
research subjects relating to energy, environment and sustainability, and by
debating controversial points with their peers. Graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers will have an opportunity to participate in the Gordon
Research Seminars that precede the GRC and provide young researchers valuable
career-building and networking opportunities. The GRC will also provide an
excellent opportunity for interaction and cooperation among academic and
industrial scientists, a key for successful implementation of sustainable
technologies in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
