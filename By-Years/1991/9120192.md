The main effort in this project will be the evaluation and interpretation of
the thermodynamics of various processes of biochemical interest. in most cases
the primary method of investigation will be isothermal titration calorimetry.
other observational techniques will be employed as appropriate, including
differential scanning microcalorimetry, fluorescence emission and CED and UV
spectrometry. A large fraction of the research will be carried out in
collaboration with individuals in other laboratories. The phenomena to be
studied will include the following: (1) The binding of glycopeptides to
concanavalin A; (2) The interaction of modified S-Peptides with S-protein to
form modified ribonuclease S; (3) The binding of substrate analogs and
inhibitors to wild type and mutant forms of ribonuclease T1, staphylococcal
nuclease, and T4 lysozyme; (4) The interaction between mutated forms of
Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor and subtilisin and other proteases; (5) The
binding of modified corepressors to E. coli tryptophan aporepressor; (6) The
effect of glycosylation on the thermal stability of proteins such as
staphylococcal nuclease and takamylase; and the binding of cyclosporin by
cyclophyllin.
