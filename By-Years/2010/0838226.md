Over the past three years the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter
Astronomy (CARMA) was formed from the merger of two telescope arrays supported
by the Division of Astronomical Science's University Radio Observatories (URO)
Program, these being Caltech?s Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array of
six 10.4-meter-diameter telescopes, and the Berkeley Illinois Maryland
Association (BIMA) array of nine 6.1-meter-diameter telescopes. With
commissioning at the new site now complete, CARMA will achieve resolutions as
high as 0.2 arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous
combination of telescope diameters, will provide excellent imaging over a wide
range of angular scales. When new receivers are installed in 2009, CARMA's
sensitivity in the 1 mm band will be an order of magnitude greater than that of
the previous arrays. The new science enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of
astronomical topics, including star formation and molecular clouds, studies of
external galaxies, and the investigation of solar system objects. CARMA is a
pathfinder for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and a pipeline for
training experts in the field of millimeter interferometry to take full
advantage of ALMA's capabilities for US astronomy.
