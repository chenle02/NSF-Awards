This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the
development of a catalytically active filtration device for the reduction of
particulates and carbon monoxide in reformate or syngas. It is generally
recognized that significant improvements in the performance of water gas shift
catalysts would greatly reduce the cost of producing hydrogen from hydrocarbon
feedstocks. A novel water gas shift catalytic system, with the additional
capability to remove particulates that may be generated during reforming of
solid and liquid fuels, will be synthesized, characterized and demonstrated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will be particularly well-suited
to reducing the cost of hydrogen production via coal gasification, biomass
gasification, diesel reforming and gasoline reforming, but can also be applied
to natural gas steam reforming process improvements. Successful application of
the proposed technology will lower the cost of producing hydrogen, thereby
reducing fuel, fertilizer and refined metal costs. Simplified production of
hydrogen will also facilitate the commercial use of fuel cells, which will
reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. &lt;br/&gt;
