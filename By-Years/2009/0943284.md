Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In response to the
predicted shortfall in the public sector workforce, federal agencies have
developed innovative strategies to encourage public service. Service corps
programs, which provide educational scholarships in exchange for a specified
service period, are an increasingly popular strategy - as highlighted by the
reauthorization and expansion of The Serve America Act.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Although seemingly effective as a mechanism to address short term
workforce needs, the long-term impact of service corps programs is not as clear.
Given their cost, however, it is critical to gain sound insight on the potential
of these programs to address both short- and long-term workforce needs. Thus,
this research project seeks to add to the understanding of the value of service
corps programs in addressing long-term workforce needs through an examination of
the turnover intentions of participants in the National Science Foundation
Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. SFS is an inter-
agency service corps program that recruits future members of the public sector
cyber security workforce. Since 2001, more than $75 million has been distributed
as scholarship support for more than 800 future members of the federal cyber
corps. Given the importance of a strong public sector cyber corps and the cost
of this recruitment and socialization tool, it is critical to gain additional
insight about program impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project
investigates the turnover intentions among future members of the federal cyber
corps while they are still engaged in their programs and service periods.
Through surveys of current SFS participants, the research project examines how
individual, job-related and organizational factors influence their ex-ante
intention to stay.
