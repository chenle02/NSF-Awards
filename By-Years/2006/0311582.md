Chemistry (12) An inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer is being
purchased to develop and revise research-based projects in the undergraduate
quantitative analysis laboratory course. Current laboratory projects focus on
acid mine drainage as a way to investigate geochemical transformations of metal
sulfide minerals and the release of metals into aqueous phases. In the initial
parts of the course students become familiar with various tools in quantitative
analysis, after which the equipment serves an integral part of extended,
inquiry-based laboratory projects that are largely designed by the students
themselves, but based upon research literature.
