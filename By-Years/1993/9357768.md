The research concerns the role of sensing and mechanical design in motor control
in both robots and humans. The main focus is the determination of the mechanical
control strategies that humans use in manipulation tasks and the creation of
robotic controllers with comparable abilities. The project involves three parts:
experimental measurement of human impedances in manipulation tasks, construction
of simplified models of the human control, system, and evaluation of robotic
task execution with human impedance characteristics. This work will enable an
increased understanding of human motor control, a tool for human machine
interface design, and better robotic manipulation.
