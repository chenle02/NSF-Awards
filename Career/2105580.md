This project concerns complex analysis, which combines complex numbers with the
theory of calculus. Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications.
In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air
past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance:
signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image
processing and quantum computation). Complex analysis of a single variable is a
classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional
variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will
further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables.
This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a
research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at
Louisiana State University (LSU). This program will prepare participants for a
career in STEM, solidify their knowledge of basic mathematics, and give them an
opportunity to learn about data science.

In the research part of this project, the PI will study bounded domains in
complex Euclidean space and relate intrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the
geometry of the Kaehler-Einstein metric) to extrinsic geometric conditions (e.g.
the CR-geometry of the boundary). Many classical results in the subject consider
bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth,
and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with
non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by
assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of
conditions on the boundary. Using this approach, the PI will be able to study
classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard
analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is
motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space
techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems,
but also many new and interesting examples.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
