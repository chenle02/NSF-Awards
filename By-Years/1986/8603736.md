Photon correlation spectroscopy is a dynamic light scattering technique which
measures diffusive motion of particles. It has been applied quite successfully
to particulate suspensions in liquids. The application of PCS to aerosol
systems, however, is still in its infancy primarily because the particles being
measured are following much faster and farther than particles in liquids. The
principal investigators propose to develop further and apply PCS to size and
shape characterization of aerosols, and to use these abilities to study the
fundamental process of coagulation.
