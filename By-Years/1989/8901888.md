This award in the Joint NSF/DARPA Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition is for an interdisciplinary study of computer vision in navigational
reasoning. Computational and psychological approaches to spatial cognition will
be combined to model expert map interpretation and perception of large-scale
environments. The investigators will also develop representations and algorithms
for navigational problem solving, with special attention to the role of vision
in map-based navigation. Much of the work will be integrated with research
projects by industrial collaborators.
