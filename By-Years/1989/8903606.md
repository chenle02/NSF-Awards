Recent advances in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry have made clear
the importance of reliable photochemical and kinetic information regarding
critical processes involving ozone and its photodissociation products, O(1D2)
and O2(X3E-g). This proposal addresses specific questions concerning the
efficiency with which uvphotolysis of O3 leads to the production of these
reactive species and their subsequent fate during collisions with ambient
molecules including H2O, HCL, and O3, itself. Special emphasis is placed on the
development of reliable spectroscopic tools for the ultratrace detection of the
energetic products of reaction and photodissociation; the information obtained
from the proposed studies will provide entirely novel information concerning the
OH(A - X) and O2(B - X) transitions. Together these experiments will yield new
information concerning the chemical mechanisms of ozone production and
depletion, and extend our ability to detect chemically labile species in the
atmosphere.//
