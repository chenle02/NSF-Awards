With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Christa L.
Colyer and Rebecca W. Alexander will acquire a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF)
mass spectrometer (MS). The instrument will be used to support research in the
following areas: 1) affinity-based capillary electrophoresis studies to
facilitate bioprobe design and microbe detection; 2) dissecting inter-domain
communication in methionyl-tRNA synthetase; 3) excited state energy transfer
amongst natural products; 4) structures and redox chemistry in sulfinic acid
reduction; 5) modeling biological networks in arabidopsis through integration of
genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data; and, 6) cysteine sulfenic acids in
catalysis and regulation.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample
and determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in
the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Mass
spectrometry is one of the most widely used analytical tools by chemists and
biochemists. The acquisition will provide training for undergraduate and
graduate students in this technique using modern instrumentation through
research programs in the department and in the undergraduate chemistry
laboratories.
