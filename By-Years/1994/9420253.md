A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge will be purchased for use in
multidisciplinary research in the Biochemistry and Chemistry Departments at
Louisiana State University. The ultracentrifuge will be used to characterize
peptides, rodlike synthetic polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. Molecular
weights, aggregation states, and mutual friction coefficients of these molecules
will be determined. This information will be used in studies of the mechanism of
action of lytic peptides, transport in semidilute solutions, protein structure
and stability, and DNA dynamics.
