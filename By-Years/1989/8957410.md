This research focuses on characterizing diverse iterative design optimization
processes qualitatively by means of a simple graphical construction. This
construction, sometimes referred to as the "basins of attraction," is a
graphical summary of how the design optimization process proceeds from many
different starting points, or initial designs. Results of this research may
provide a global view of iterative design processes--a window through which a
wide range of behavior may be observed qualitatively.
