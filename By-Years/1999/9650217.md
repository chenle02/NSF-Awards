This department is obtaining instrumentation suitable to determine high-field
lH and 13C Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectra in an
undergraduate environment, which includes classroom work and undergraduate
research. The 200-MHz instrument has excellent sensitivity and resolution
capabilities at a reasonable cost. The software used is similar to that of other
sophisticated instruments, so that students going elsewhere after graduation
will be able to adjust to the operation of FT-NMR equipment at a new location.
Spectra are to be obtained directly by students, the new equipment being
amenable to such a policy. Each student-user experiences proving the structure
of unknowns using lH and 13C FT-NMR, verifying the structure of a product of
reaction, measuring the percentage of components in an equilibrium or a mixture,
deriving structural information from both lH and 13C FT-NMR, analyzing patterns
of coupling through decoupling techniques, measuring relaxation times, noting
effects in variable-temperature spectra, and analyzing other problems. Students
also see how FT-NMR spectra can be used in tandem with other analytical methods,
such as gas and liquid chromatography, and with other spectroscopic methods,
such as infrared ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, to
solve structural and analytical problems. Through direct participation in
operating the FT-NMR spectrometer and interpreting results, students gain hands-
on experience with a method of structural analysis that has become crucial to
the progress and development of chemical knowledge. This is important for
students who are new to chemistry and also for those who are engaged in
undergraduate research projects.
