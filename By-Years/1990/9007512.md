In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Gerard Parkin of Columbia University will investigate the
exploratory synthetic and mechanistic aspects of monomeric hydride and alkyl
derivatives of main group metal compounds. These compounds may have application
as reagents for selective organic reactions and as precursors for the formation
of ceramic materials. Main group metals (with emphasis on magnesium, aluminum,
zinc and lithium) will be complexed with bulky tris-pyrazolylborate ligands to
assure their monomeric nature and the hydride, alkyl, silyl, methylidene (=CHR),
phosphinidene (=PR), oxo (=O) and nitrido derivatives will be synthesized and
their chemical reactivity systematically investigated. These investigations will
include mechanistic studies and the search for new materials, catalysts and
ceramic precursors.
