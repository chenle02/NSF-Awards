9553585 Lidsky The teaching of science, mathematics, and technology education is
changing to more hands-on, laboratory rich experiential learning as teachers and
schools explore new ways to teach. Computers and sophisticated instrumentation
in schools are increasing as are efforts in cooperative learning, team teaching,
project-based learning and student research. Boundaries between disciplines are
blurring. However, little has been done to define the physical facilities
necessary to support and sustain improved teaching and learning. The demands
placed on facilities by educational reform are studied to provide facility
development criteria and guidelines for programming, planning, and designing
prototype spaces for learning in the sciences, mathematics and technology
education. The study defines a process for planning that can be used to verify
needs and implement change. The project is guided by an Advisory Committee to
provide the vision and case studies of educational reform. A Consultant Group of
teachers and others assist in data gathering and interpretation. Both groups
review the final documents. The main audience for the products of this project
are teachers involved in facility development or renovation; but it is also
useful to parents, board members, administrators, and government officials.
