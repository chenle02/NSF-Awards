Studies will focus on quantum information processing in the simple system of one
or two trapped atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity, generating sets of
quantum entanglements (in atom-photon, atom-photon, and photon-photon entangled
pairs). Advances in optical atom trapping and cavity QED technologies will be
needed. Alternative strategies for storing and manipulating quantum information
will be explored.
