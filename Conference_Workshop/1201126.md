On September 15-16, 2012, Wake Forest University (Winston-Salem, NC) is planning
to hold the first of three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings being supported
by funding for this proposal. This will be organized by Jeremy Rouse and John
Webb. A second conference is planned for December 1-2 at the University of South
Carolina (Columbia, SC), and a third conference is planned for the Spring of
2013 at High Point University (High Point, NC). Further information for these
meetings will be linked to the conference pages
http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and
http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/ as the organization of these meetings
progresses. An important goal of these meetings is to provide the community in
the southeast region with knowledge of the current trends and developments in
research topics in number theory. Prominent researchers in number theory from
outside the region are brought to the southeast to help achieve this goal. The
primary research topics for these meetings include analytic number theory,
arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. The frequency and
regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working
relationships between participants.

There are two main conferences held annually in the southeast that bring
together those working on research in number theory. The Palmetto Number Theory
Series is a series of number theory meetings managed jointly by Clemson
University and the University of South Carolina, the two flagship public
research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The SouthEast
Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional meeting that has been in effect
since the late 1980's. These meetings inspire collaboration and broaden the
scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number
theory. One objective of these meetings is to involve number theorists at all
career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost. Speakers include
graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. The meetings have, in
particular, provided an important service to students and young researchers in
this region working in number theory, strengthening their knowledge of this
research area and allowing them to disseminate their work while at the same time
obtaining insightful input from other participants. These participants come from
Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a
master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. The
organizers will also continue to attract a demographically diverse participant
base, including women and other underrepresented groups.
