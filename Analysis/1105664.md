The objective of the project is to increase the US participation in the Workshop
on Geometric Group Theory held at the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical
Research, with a particular emphasis on graduate students, junior researchers
and minorities underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The workshop will
focus on the interactions between geometric group theory and non-commutative
geometry, in particular, on approximation properties including amenability, the
Haagerup property, property A (exactness of groups), their connections to
ordinary group cohomology and bounded cohomology and applications to the Baum-
Connes and Novikov conjectures.

The workshop, to be held in Bristol, UK, will serve as an excellent
international platform for exchanging ideas. It will feature open problem
sessions, ``ask the expert" question-and-answer sessions aimed at junior
researchers and will provide a perfect opportunity for young mathematicians to
establish connections and new collaborations which will benefit them in the
future. Europe and the United States have leading researchers working in
geometric and analytic group theory and there is an ongoing need for sharing
knowledge in this active area of mathematical research.

This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program.
