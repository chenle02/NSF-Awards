Data compression is a central problem in engineering, both in a practical and
conceptual sense. On the practical side, modern telecommunications would be
impossible without sophisticated data compression algorithms, and improved
compression schemes will lead to improved connectivity. On the conceptual side,
since compressing a source amounts to learning its structure, data compression
serves as a concrete problem with a well-defined objective that is connected to
profound questions in AI. For compression of multimedia sources in particular,
there has been relatively little interplay between the theoretical and
experimental communities. This is arguably attributable to a lack of realism in
the mathematical models used in theoretical studies and by a marked
disconnection between the two communities. The GOALI project will develop new
models of multimedia sources, the characterization and analysis of which will
likely give rise to new theory.

This project seeks to address both the mathematical realism in multimedia data
models and the experimental validation of actual compression algorithms. The
technical goal of the project is to develop improved mathematical models for
multimedia sources by drawing on recent advances on the experimental side of the
field, namely compression via deep neural networks (DNNs). This will be achieved
via a collaborative project drawing together two PIs with expertise spanning
theoretical and experimental approaches, helping to draw these two sides
together. The project will also lead to new characterizations of the expressive
power of neural networks for simulating random processes and new results
connecting the problems of compression and generative modeling.
