Computational geometry has developed very rapidly in the last few years because
of its applications in areas such as computer graphics, robotics, VLSI, CAD,
solid modeling and many others. The goal of this project is to study fundamental
geometric problems that are motivated by applied areas and to explore new areas
with special emphasis on higher-dimensional problems and on problems involving
curved objects. Since both of these areas have not received enough attention,
even very basic problems are far from being understood. In particular, problems
in the following areas will be investigated: o Ray shooting and hidden surface
removal; o Intersection problems; o Arrangements of curves and surfaces; o
Random sampling; o Dynamic problems; and o Shortest paths and related problems.
It is expected that some of the algorithms developed during this research will
be reasonably simple. Some of these algorithms will be implemented in order to
study their performance in practice.
