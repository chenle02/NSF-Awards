The thrust of this project is on foundational and applied research problems in
Nonlinear Circuits and Systems. In particular, the research is concentrated in
two broad areas. Under the heading, "Nonlinear Modeling and Simulation,"
applications of Volterra series representations in model validation, adaptive
filtering, and in characterizing microwave devices and communications channels
are investigated. Canonical Piecewise-linear analysis and higher order circuit
elements are employed in order to reduce the computational effort in computer-
aided circuit analysis, and to model accurately frequency-dependent effects in
high speed integrated circuits. Under the heading, "Nonlinear Dynamical
Systems," research is concentrated on the development of global properties of
these systems. Analytical tools, software, and instrumentation with the
objective of making the investigation of nonlinear systems accessible to the
wider electrical engineering community are being developed. Through studies of
bifurcation phenomena, it is hoped to identify non-functional modes and failure
boundaries in synchronization and phase-locking systems.
