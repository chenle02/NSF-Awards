This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop custom software
and/or devices for persons with disabilities. The design experience will be
integrated into three courses which will allow a full-year of participation by
the students. The students will work with institutions providing care or
training for the targeted populations and will provide written reports on the
projects completed each year. This type of undertaking is important since not
only will it provide meaningful projects for engineering students to complete as
part of their education, but it will also benefit a population where
customization is usually required to increase the usefulness of the devices
and/or software.
