The purpose of this travel grant is to allow Dr. Harvey Nichols of the
University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research to attend an
international symposium on boreal forests in Arkhangel'sk, U.S.S.R. The meeting,
sponsored by the U.S.S.R. State Committee on Forests, is part of a larger
project on detection of biosphere response to global change that has been
organized under the auspices of the International Institute of Applied Systems
Analysis. During his visit, which will include site visits to boreal forest
sites along the Barents Sea, Dr. Nichols will also evaluate opportunities for
sustained U.S.-Soviet cooperative research on long-term monitoring of ecological
change at high latitudes.
