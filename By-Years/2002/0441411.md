This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a prototype
porous silicon biosensor that will be useful for rapidly distinguishing the
molecular fingerprint of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. Remediation of
biothreat agents is dependent on the use of versatile, low cost, widely
dispersible biosensors that can assess or monitor threat levels in a given
environment. The proposed device will address these needs because it will be
manufactured from low cost materials (i.e. silicon wafers), with nano-structured
pores that can be utilized as both the capture material and reporter moiety.

The commercial application of this project will be in bio-defense and in
clinical diagnostics for detection of pathogenic organisms.
