Infrastructure: MIDSHIP: Managing Image Data for Scalable High Performance This
award is for the acquisition of a cluster of shared-memory processors (SMPs) to
support the MIDSHIP project of research into enabling technologies for large-
scale mining of image data sets. The equipment will help researchers at the
University of Wisconsin to perform research: (1) on the application side:
medical image mining using mathematical programming techniques, machine learning
techniques applied to image understanding, view synthesis and visual
exploration, and querying by image content; and (2) on the systems
infrastructure side: parallel hardware and software systems, performance tools
for profiling parallel systems performance and analyzing workload requirements,
image storage and compression, and parallel image database management
technology. It will also support a wide variety of research projects in such
diverse fields as Biological Science, Geology, Materials Science, Medicine, and
Space Science.
