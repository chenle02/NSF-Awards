This project supports the development of a set of resources for using Java in
the introductory programming course in computer science. The resources
include&lt;br/&gt;- a definition of a subset of the Java standard APIs
appropriate for the introductory course&lt;br/&gt;- a public Web site containing
a manual for this subset, and&lt;br/&gt;- a set of APIs appropriate for the
introductory course&lt;br/&gt;There will also be a survey and evaluation of
noncommercial resources for teaching Java.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
support and enable improved pedagogy in the introductory programming course in
Java by solving a number of problems encountered by instructors in using Java in
its current state. This will lead to a larger and more diverse group of students
completing the introductory course and being able to go on to further study in
computer science.
