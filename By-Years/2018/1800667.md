At the scale of atomic physics, the classical laws of physics pioneered by
Newton must be adjusted to the laws of quantum mechanics discovered by
Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Dirac and others. This process is called quantization.
Within quantum mechanics, as within classical mechanics, the laws describing the
mechanical systems usually display a high degree of symmetry. This is a
reflection of the nineteenth century discovery that symmetries correspond to the
conserved quantities like energy and momentum. The symmetry related to the law
of conservation of momentum expresses itself in the fact that the laws of
physics are presumed to be the same everywhere in the universe. In this project
the principal investigator will use noncommutative geometry tools such as
equivariant index theory to study several interesting problems about
quantization involving various symmetries.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will pursue three research projects in geometry quantization and
equivariant index theory: (1) applying index theory to geometric quantization of
various generalization of symplectic manifolds such as Hamiltonian loop group
spaces and log sympelctic manifolds (2) geometrically realizing an irreducible
representation of a reductive Lie group as an equivariant analytic index on
corresponding coadjoint orbit, and studying its restriction to its maximal
compact subgroup (3) generalizing equivariant index theory to noncompact
manifolds or groups, based on the KK-theory developed by
Kasparov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
