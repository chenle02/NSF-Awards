Persistent, stable and shallow domes of cold air dammed to the west by the
eastern slopes of the southern Appalachian mountains are a common mesoscale
feature in the late fall and winter. Because of the neighboring, much warmer
Atlantic waters to the east, this cold air damming is a major factor in
distinguishing forecasts of rain from those of the more dangerous frozen
precipitation forms (snow, sleet, freezing drizzle and rain). When it is present
and persistent it also favors the rapid genesis and intensification of coastal
winter storms. Unfortunately, inadequate resolution of the observational,
analysis and forecast systems, as well as a lack of theoretical understanding,
have caused poor forecasts of these events. Similar phenomena also occur along
Colorado's Front Range, affecting the distribution of heavy snow in the Denver-
Fort Collins urban corridor, and have been documented on other mountain slopes
around the world. Xu's goal is to improve our understanding of cold air damming
and to develop quantitative criteria for the diagnosis and short term
forecasting of its consequences. He is an outstanding younger investigator and
is recognized as one of the leading group of theoretical hydrodynamicists
considering concrete weather forecasting problems.
