This project is expanding the learning experience for students in the
undergraduate laboratories for chemical engineering and environmental
engineering. More than 100 students a year are benefiting from this improvement.
Students are designing and conducting more realistic engineering experiments on
more complex systems. These experiments are similar to situations encountered in
industrial, government, and commercial work environments. This project is also
expanding the opportunities for students to have interactive Internet access in
the laboratory stations. Two methods are being employed. The first method is to
expand the number of experimental stations that have computerized data
acquisition and control equipment in these laboratories. Thiq goal is being
accomplished with six new personal computers and associated hardware and
software for measurement, data acquisition and control, analysis, reporting, and
presentation of results. The second method is to expand Internet access to the
laboratories with the development of software and networking for the monitoring
and control of equipment. These improvements are adding systems for students to
experience hands-on experiments with engineering equipment. They are also adding
systems and capability for remote interaction with the laboratory equipment.
This measure is allowing for cooperative laboratory experimentation among other
schools. *
