This award is supported by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the
Division of Chemistry. Professor Joel Thornton of the University of Washington
and his group investigate what happens to reactive organic carbon species in the
Earth's atmosphere. The highly reactive organic peroxy radicals are common
species produced when carbon-based (organic) compounds degrade in the
environment. Their detection and quantification is difficult because of their
reactivity. Often only a total of organic peroxy radicals are measured, or only
early decomposition products are identified. This project involves novel
laboratory studies of the reactivity of these species which provides more
detailed information than previously possible. An accurate understanding of the
fundamental pathways of environmental degradation is crucial to determining what
happens to pollutants as they naturally cycle through the Earth's environment.
Improved experimental data are necessary for understanding how fuel combustion
impacts the atmosphere, aquatic ecosystems, and soil composition. The project
provides educational and training opportunities for graduate students,
undergraduates in chemistry and atmospheric sciences, and a postdoctoral
research fellow. To inform the public of the results of this research, a
computer animation is being produced in collaboration with a documentary
filmmaker. This film shows how organic peroxy radicals produced in forests
contribute to atmospheric particle formation and growth. This research is
important to society as it promotes public health and understanding of weather
and storms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses fast flow tube reactors
coupled to high resolution time of flight and orbitrap mass spectrometers. These
techniques allow researchers to identify and simultaneously track nearly all
individual organic peroxy radicals and their cross-reaction products. Reaction
tracking of a suite of relevant starting compounds, purchased commercially or
synthesized by collaborators, is done as a function of reaction time. These
experiments provide quantitative insights into the rates and products of gas-
phase organic carbon degradation under typical environmental conditions.
Isotopic labeling and competitive reactant experiments allow for tests of
hypothesized reaction mechanisms and independent rate
quantification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
