This award will support a marine geological and geophysical study of the
geological history of the far northwestern Pacific. Field work will include the
collection of seismic reflection, gravity and magnetic data from the area near
the confluence of the Aleutian and Kamchatka Trenches and the northern end of
the Emperor Seamount chain. The main objectives of the research project are to:
1) describe the early history of the Emperor hot- spot trail and the
lithospheric response to volcanism; 2) reconstruct the plate tectonic history of
this part of the Pacific; and 3) to determine the distribution of Mesozoic
sediments in the region. Understanding the evolution and sediment distribution
will be critical in identifying candidate sites for ocean drilling.
Additionally, scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will examine
cored sediments to determine the paleoceanographic history of the area. The
principal investigator is highly qualified to undertake this study. Field work
will be done on a 35 day cruise of the R.V. Washington operated by Scripps
Institution.
