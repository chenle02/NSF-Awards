9309701 Tonguz The growth of the size of lightwave networks presents major
challenges because of the limitations of fiber optics technology. Optical
devices (such as access couplers), modulation and detection format employed, and
access methods used are all important factors in this network growth process.
The main objective of this proposal is to find solutions to this problem taking
into account all these factors. In particular, the relationship between scalable
and modular networks and the main network design parameters (such as amount of
fiber required, average propagation delay, fault tolerance to multiple node
failures, maximum bit rate, maintainability, type and number of access couplers
required, access delay, maximum throughtput, and required buffer size) will be
examined and quantified. Thus, the network growth problem can be handled in a
concrete way in different enviroments and applications. *** v s t VM &lt; A@ MER
