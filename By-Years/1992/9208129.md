Photosynthetic reaction centers in plants are the key to photosynthesis and
hence life on Earth. The specific projects involve a variety of measurements on
the quinone constituents of the reaction center. These include a) in vitro
analyses, b) binding free energies of systematically varied quinonoid probe
molecules and c) binding free energies of quinones in binding site structure
varied through selected mutation. These data will, aided by computational
methods, be used to construct a binding free energy map of the QA sites of the
reaction center of Rb. sphaeroides and Rp. viridis. Building on this knowledge,
we will test novel electron transfer events by making use of tethered diquinone
molecules in which one quinone is in the QA or the QB site and the other
occupies positions down the binding domain normally occupied by the native
isoprene chain. %%% This work is also important for the following reasons:
Quinone binding sites in proteins of respiration and photosynthesis are the
targets of many herbicides and antibiotics. Quinones represent the structural
foundation of a large class of chemical that includes certain vitamins,
hormones, redox cofactors and drugs. Knowing how they bind and function in this
system is yielding information that is of general application to the design of
such molecules of value to the agricultural and medical fields. The
opportunities they offer in addressing outstanding questions regarding how
electrons transfer through proteins has similar importance. Control of how these
common chemicals interact with natural tissue and what controls their redox
activity again has impact on understanding the mechanisms of biological
energetics, the side reactions of many drugs, and also forms the basis of
developing guidelines for the design and ultimate synthesis of redox proteins.
