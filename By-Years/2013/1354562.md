Mitchell Singer&lt;br/&gt;DNA replication a checkpoint in regulating development
in Myxococcus xanthus&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number:
1354562&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how
individual cells interact with their environment and how that environment shapes
and regulates cell growth and differentiation is fundamental to all life, from
single celled organisms such as bacteria, to complex multicellular organisms
such as humans. This project addresses this basic question, with respect to
Myxococcus xanthus, a simple developmental bacterial system. M. xanthus cells
grow in social groups called biofilms, in which the growing cells pool their
secreted digestive enzymes to breakdown complex large molecules from the
environment. When nutrients become limiting, M. xanthus responds by activating a
developmental program that results in the construction of a multicellular
structure called a fruiting body. Within this structure, a subpopulation of
cells forms environmentally resistant myxospores. This project specifically
focuses on determining the molecular mechanisms that promote the formation of
myxospores, while other cells either undergo self-destruction or form a
different type of cell called a peripheral rod cell. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project tests the hypothesis that the fate of a cell (spore, rod, or death) is
determined by how far along it is in the cell division cycle when it encounters
the signal to begin fruiting body formation. Experiments are designed to test
this hypothesis using molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches. The
project is expected to advance our understanding of bacterial development,
molecular signaling, and starvation physiology. M. xanthus is a representative
of a family of pharmacologically important bacteria, whose production of
antibiotic, anti-tumor and anti-fungal compounds is tied to multicellular
development. This project will continue to serve as laboratory training to
graduate, undergraduate and high school students, who will continue with long-
term careers in science. Finally this project provides community outreach to a
title 1 local elementary school.
