Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award is to fund acquisition of a low vacuum scanning
electron microscope (SEM), critical point drier, and sputter coater for
research, student research training, and teaching on the campus of Valdosta
State University. VSU does not have an SEM on campus and the nearest SEM
available for use is 2 hours travel time away. There is a critical mass of
faculty on campus who are experienced in SEM techniques and who will pursue
research projects using scanning electron microscopy. The plan to acquire the
JEOL 6460LV SEM requested will improve greatly the microscopy resources
available for research and teaching, adding a significant technological
improvement to facilities in the area of microscopy. The requested microscope
will be housed in a microscopy facility that is maintained by the Biology
Department and is accessible to other units in the College of Arts and Sciences.
VSU is a primarily undergraduate university, and undergraduate students will be
involved in all aspects of the research outlined in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;
