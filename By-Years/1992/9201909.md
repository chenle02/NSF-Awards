A series of turbulence measurements in a stratified estuary, the Hudson River
will be conducted over several tidal cycles in order to better understand mixing
processes under various shear regimes and test various eddy diffusivity models.
The long-term goal of the study is to improve sub-grid scale parameterization of
mixing processes for use in estuarine models.
