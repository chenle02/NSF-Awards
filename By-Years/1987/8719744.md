This project is in the general area of inorganic chemistry and in the specific
area of organometallic chemistry of transition metals. The project is concerned
with the tendency of transition metal complexes to act as bases, i.e. to accept
protons from other molecules in solution. Such proton transfer reactions are
often involved in reactions in which these complexes function either as
homogeneous catalysts or as intermediates in the synthesis of complicated
organic molecules. Consequently, systematic measurements of their basicities are
essential both to understanding reaction mechanisms and to optimizing reaction
conditions for using these complexes in organic synthesis. The basicities of a
broad range of transition metal complexes will be determined by measuring their
heats of protonation. The electronic and steric effects of ligands on complex
basicity will be determined by examining values of heat of protonation for a
series of complexes with various P-donor and other ligands. In order to
understand how metal complex basicities influence other types of complex
reactivity, rates of a variety of oxidative-addition reactions will be
determined and correlated with heats of protonation. The resulting linear free
energy correlations are expected to be useful guides to understanding a broad
range of complex reactivity. In related studies heats of protonation will be
determined for reactions in which a series of di- and polynuclear metal-metal
bonded complexes are converted to H-bridged products. The latter experiments
will quantitate the effects of ligands and metals on the basicities of metal-
metal bonds.
