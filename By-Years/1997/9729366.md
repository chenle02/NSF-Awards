This proposal will provide funds for an integrated rapid mixing system that
will allow stopped flow, continuous flow, freeze quench and chemical quench
experiments to be carried out. In the stopped or continuous flow modes reactions
can be studied by absorption, fluorescence or Raman scattering and circular
dichroism. In the chemical and freeze quench modes reactive intermediates can be
trapped and then characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear
magnetic resonance, or other spectroscopies. Projects will be conducted by six
major users from the Departments of Biochemistry and Physiology and Biophysics.
The instrumentation will also be available to several additional users and will
be part of a NIH supported Training Program in Molecular Biophysics. In general,
the instrumentation will be applied to the study of protein and ribozyme
folding, several enzyme substrate interactions, ligand binding in hemoglobins,
protein-DNA interactions and protein translocation.
