This project will result in the development of an undergraduate biochemistry
laboratory course that emphasizes modern techniques and instrumentation. The
laboratory course will complement the ongoing biochemistry lecture course, and
will enhance substantially the biochemistry education of students at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington. This project will provide a suite of
instruments (including an automatic recording titration system, a liquid
chromatography system, a densitometer, a preparative ultracentrifuge, and an
electrophoresis unit) to be used primarily in the new biochemistry laboratory
course and also in physical and analytical chemistry courses. Students will gain
experience with buffer and other reagent preparation, protein assays, protein
purification, protein and DNA electrophoresis, enzyme kinetics, tryptic peptide
digestion, membrane vesicle construction, DNA isolation, and radioisotope
labelling. The experimental work will illustrate important concepts in
biochemistry, and will help students attain proficiency in widely used
biochemical techniques.
