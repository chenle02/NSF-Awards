This award supports graduate student travel to the 12th Workshop on the Physics
of Dusty Plasmas to be held in Boulder, Colorado in May 2009. The objectives of
this workshop are to review recent developments, to define outstanding issues
and challenges, and to foster collaborations among the relevant disciplines. The
interaction between dust and plasmas in laboratory, industrial, atmospheric,
solar system, and astrophysical settings have yielded a new and rich
phenomenology with potential applications.
