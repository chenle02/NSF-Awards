We propose to explore the construction of a high resolution scanning probe
microscope capable of gathering inelastic electron tunneling spectra (IETS) from
biological samples with nm resolution. This would be the first high-resolution
instrument for mapping the distribution of organic molecules. It will be based
on an atomic force microscope operated at helium temperatures. IETS of a thin-
film sample will be gathered using a conductive coating on the tip. Achieving
this goal requires major advances in AFM technology, microtome technology and
sample mounting methods. Here, We request a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
in order to carry out a feasibility study with a much simpler system, an AFM
equipped for IETS and operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
