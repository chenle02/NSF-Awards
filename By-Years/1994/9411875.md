This is a project designed to develop a new class of loglinear and logit models
for examining structural effects in social science research. Work on the
development of these models will include efforts to examine the robustness of
the models and their ability to deal with a range of empirical phenomena. The
project will culminate in the the development of user-friendly computer software
to make the methods developed available to other researchers. Loglinear and
logistic models have been widely used in recent years by sociologists and others
to study phenomena which cannot be represented accurately by continuous
variables. Existing versions of these models suffer from a number of assumptions
and restrictions that limit their utility in social science research. By
developing a new and broader range of such models and preparing computer
software to make the newly developed models available to other researchers, this
project will make an important contribution to sociological research on a wide
range of topics.
