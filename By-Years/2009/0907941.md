This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will utilize an
integrated modeling approach to improve our understanding of Polar Mesosphere
summer echoes (PMSE) from the cold summer Mesopause region, at altitudes between
about 80-95 km at high polar latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interest in
improving the modeling effort for PMSE has stemmed from recent spectral
observations of PMSE, which have been made by the NSF funded Poker Flat
Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR). The physical characterization of high
frequency PMSE is still poorly understood, and more work is required to develop
turbulence scattering theories, to help explain the radar observations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key modeling work relates to dust charging, and how
significant it needs to be, as well as the role of turbulence scattering in PMSE
formation and evolution. It is also possible that other processes are
controlling PMSE, including dusty plasma wave instabilities, which represents a
novel approach having received little attention to date from the modeling
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is involving young
undergraduate students, who will participate in the data analysis as well as
receive a valuable learning experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this EAGER proposal relates to the exploration of new ideas on dust
charging in the Mesopause, and novel, potentially transformative ideas involving
dusty plasma instabilities to explain higher frequency PMSE. The required
modeling effort is complex and multi-faceted, and thus carries high risk, but
also with a high return, in terms of improved scientific understanding of PMSE,
which have been considered an important new marker for atmospheric change.
