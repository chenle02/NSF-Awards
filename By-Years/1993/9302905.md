This grant is for the partial support of a symposium on dynamic failure
mechanics of modern materials to be held during November 18-20, 1993 at the
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. The symposium will allow the
presentation of state-of-the- art research findings in the area of dynamic
failure mechanics of modern materials to the most outstanding and active workers
in that emerging field from academe, government laboratories and industry. This
field differs in scope from other branches of failure mechanics by placing a
heavy emphasis on micromechanics and material characterization, and the
interaction between macro and micro mechanical aspects of dynamic failure. A
critical assessment will also be made of the existing high speed recording
methods and the accuracy of their predictions.
