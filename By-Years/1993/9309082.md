9309082 Fried The purpose of this research is to study the effects of transition
kinetics, spatially localized interactions between phases, and bulk energy and
stress in determining the morphology of mircostructures resulting from
mechanically induced phase transitions in martensitic alloys. This research will
be conducted within the framework of a continuum theory and will involve both
mathematical analysis and scientific computation.
