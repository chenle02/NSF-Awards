With support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B Program of
the Chemistry Division, Professor Daniel Ess of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Brigham Young University is developing new foundational theories
about how the motion of atoms within molecules determines the mechanisms and
selectivity during complex organometallic reactions. The goal of this research
is to combine quantum mechanical methods for energy and forces, classical
mechanical equations of motion, and sophisticated treatment of solvent to
discover new reaction pathways and mechanisms for organometallic reactions. This
research could significantly alter the fundamental understanding,
interpretation, and design of organometallic reactions, one of the most
important classes of chemical reactions. This project combines computational
chemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and computer science, and is
a diverse training ground to prepare undergraduate and graduate students for the
scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses quasiclassical
direct density functional theory, molecular dynamics trajectories to discover
new fundamental principles of mechanisms and selectivity for organometallic
reactions, which are one of the most important reaction classes in chemistry.
This work focuses on organometallic reactions with close electronic spin states
and possible spin crossover during trajectories. Additionally, this work focuses
on developing and applying sophisticated protocols for modeling explicit solvent
during organometallic reaction trajectories. Organometallic reactions that are
being examined include radical cyclization reactions, bond activation reactions,
and metal oxo reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
