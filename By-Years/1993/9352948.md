9352948 Cohen The University of Utah will conduct a 5-week, commuter, Young
Scholars project in computer science for 40 students entering grades 11 and 12.
Participants will study computer graphics/ modeling and expert systems.
Nationally known research scientists will interact with students in both
classroom and laboratory settings. Participants will learn to use high
performance engineering work stations and will develop expert system tools and
graphical models. They will also study two and three dimensional techniques,
LISP and rule based programming. They will then develop an expert system to
control an automatic robot vehicle. Field trips to robotics and computer aided
manufacturing research labs as well as to local computer companies will allow
participants to see how these concepts are used in the workplace. Follow up
activities include individual research investigations, presentations at high
schools and additional visits to the university's Center for Computer Graphics
and Scientific Visualization. ***
