Extraction of structures in volumetric images is an important early task in
visualization. Following structure extraction, the structures can be rendered
for final display for scientists or clinicians. Dataset registration is also
important for monitoring change and assessing intervention strategies. This
project will focus on visualization of tomographic data, although the methods
developed are likely to be useful for related problems in other volumetric data
domains. The project will empirically test the PI's methods on other (non
medical) volumetric datasets to examine the general utility of the methods. In
traditional medical applications, tomographic data has not been thoroughly
exploited. A key part of this research is support of more effective utilization
of volumetric data. In particular, for medical application, the visualization
stages addressed in this proposal must be accomplished in near real-time to
support diagnosis, treatment planning, intervention guidance, and treatment
assessment.
