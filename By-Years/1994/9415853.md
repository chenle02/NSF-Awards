This study continues the analysis of data obtained using the two-frequency,
narrowband sodium temperature lidar at Colorado State University. The lidar has
been operating for three years and 147 nights of observations have been made.
The data will be used to study heating mechanisms, tidal effects, effects of
solar cycle and volcanic eruption, and annual and semi-annual temperature
variations in the mesopause. The study will help modelers fine-tune their model
parameters and understand the physics behind the unique climatology in the
mesopause region which impacts global change. The proposed effort also includes
the continuation of regular observations to establish the long-term trends in
atmospheric temperatures and to investigate tidal and gravity wave
perturbations. These data will help to test model predictions of the
anthropogenic effects on global warming and contribute to our understanding of
the balance between dynamical and radiative forces in the middle atmosphere.
