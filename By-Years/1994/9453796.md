9453796 Bash The University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory is
requesting $581,736 over three years to produce and distribute a Spanish
language version of Star Date, a daily radio program that covers astronomy,
space exploration, and other space-related topics. The purpose of the new
program is to increase scientific literacy among the Spanish-speaking segment of
the American population, inspire a greater interest in astronomy and space
science, and encourage younger listeners to enter space or other science-related
fields. Collateral ancillary material related to astronomy will also be
developed and distributed.
