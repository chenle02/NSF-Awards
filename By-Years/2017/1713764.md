Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at
velocities near the speed of light. The origin of cosmic rays and their
acceleration mechanisms are unknown, but they likely originate in extreme
astrophysical phenomena both within and beyond our galaxy. The Pierre Auger
Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an
instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers. Built in Malargue,
Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was
designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in
the Universe. This award supports scientists at the University of Chicago in
their work with Auger. The group will work on enhancements to the telescope
systems as well as the scientific analysis of the data. The group is also
working on projects to cross-calibrate and integrate data from Auger with data
from another cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array, in Utah. This award
will support the University of Chicago group's involvement in the "Array of
Things" project, an urban sensing program that will engage students and the
general public in cosmic ray science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
support hardware and data analyses efforts. Hardware efforts include extending
the duty cycle of the Auger Florescence Detectors to substantially increase the
rate of high energy event data. The group will conduct scientific analyses of
the Auger data focused on studying the cosmic ray energy spectrum and
anisotropy. The group will expand the scientific collaboration between Auger and
Telescope Array through cross-calibration of the energy scales and through joint
full sky anisotropy analyses.
