This research project will address several outstanding questions concerning the
weather and climate dynamics of the monsoon regions of the world - Asia, Africa
and South America. One is a better understanding of the dynamics of tropical
rainfall variability, with the aim of establishing a firm basis for increased
prediction. Of particular interest is the variability on bi-weekly (12-16 days)
and intraseasonal (30-50 days) time scales. The PI will examine how the bi-
weekly variability develops in the upper atmosphere over Northern Asia and
influences monsoon rainfall. These basic dynamical studies will be extend to the
other monsoon regions of South America, Indonesia/North Australia, West Africa
and North America. The funded research project will examine interaction between
the large-scale Asian monsoon circulation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
These two phenomena are clearly related but the manner of their interaction has
not been coherently established. The project will use a blend of data analysis,
theoretical fluid dynamics and models of the coupled ocean-atmosphere
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This improved understanding will be applied to
improving precipitation forecasts for these regions, which are faced with
rapidly increasing population and increasing need for water and attendant
stresses on the food supply. The research findings will be disseminated to
scientific societies as well as the general public. This funded project will
support PI and his research team to work with the World Bank and apply their
monsoon research to forecast products that are being used in South Asia to help
build more resilient societies and foster sustaionability. In collaboration with
Climate Forecast Applications Network, the PI will apply this research to
improved prediction products for South Asia and South America.
