Fifteen undergraduate students are involved in engineering research, in an
eleven week program. This effort builds upon a successful ongoing university
program. The topics of research are in electrical and computer engineering. The
participants are encouraged to continue and expand their prospects during the
following year where they are seniors. Those from other New York City area
schools can make arrangements to work in the grantees' laboratories part time.
