The research addresses the problem of immobilizing a three- dimensional object
through a few contacts with simple modular components, with applications in
manufacturing fixture design and robotic grasping. The proposed approach is
based on the kinematic notion of second-order immobility introduced by Rimon and
Burdick. From a practical point of view, the planned research is motivated by
its applications in small-batch manufacturing, rapid prototyping, and on-demand
manufacturing . The scientific objectives are (1) to develop efficient
algorithms for automatically enumerating all of the fixture/gripper
configurations and the corresponding workpiece positions and orientations for
which a truely three-dimensional workpiece will be completely immobilized; (2)
to develop grasp and fixture planning strategies capable of handling positioning
uncertainty during grasping and fixture loading operations; and (3) more
generally, to develop general analytical tools for holding and manipulating
complex three-dimensional shapes with devices having a mixture of discrete and
continuous degrees of freedom. The process achieved in this project will be
assessed by conducting experiments with actual fixtures and the prototype of a
novel automatically reconfigurable gripper.
