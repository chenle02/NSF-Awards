The deep ocean flow field in the Lau Basin will be directly sampled with floats
that are programmed to drift at the depth of the hydrothermal plumes and
periodically return to the surface in order to fix their positions and to
transmit their data back to shore using a network of satellistes. The float
trajectories will be made publically available in near real time.
