9614519 Salmon Planning of the development of technology is critical for
companies in high-cost, high-technology industries such as integrated circuit
and electronic system manufacturing. In response to this need, two industry-wide
efforts have been initiated; one under the auspices of the Semiconductor
Industrial Association (SIA) and the other auspices of National Electronics
Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI). The goal of the SIA technology roadmapping
exercise is to plan research and development tasks required for the VLSI wafer
fabrication industry. The goal of the NEMI roadmapping exercise is to plan
research and development tasks for the electronics industry as a whole. ***
