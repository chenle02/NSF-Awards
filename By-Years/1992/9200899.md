This award supports research in matrix theory. The principal investigator will
work on matrix completion problems; qualitative matrix theory; and problems in
matrix and operator theory. A matrix is a rectangular array with possible
entries from a wide variety of rings. This is a field which originated in the
nineteenth century as a part of algebra. It is currently very active in view of
its many applications and connections with other parts of mathematics and other
scientific and technical disciplines.
