Telecommuting, distance learning, and virtual gatherings have significantly
increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor Quality of Experience (QoE) of
underlying networked software, such as video conferencing tools, degrades the
usability of remote presence applications and thus impairs the effectiveness of
distance communication and learning. However, current network performance
measurement capabilities cannot systematically capture subjective aspects of
QoE, hindering scientific study of this issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this project is to develop and evaluate a fundamentally new approach to Internet
performance measurement by conducting subjective assessments to measure the QoE
of video streaming and conferencing applications in the wild and correlate these
QoE measurements with Internet performance. Specifically, this research will 1)
develop a unified assessment platform to crowdsource novel experiments for
measuring the QoE of video streaming and video conferencing; 2) leverage
gamification techniques to incentivize subject participation and improve overall
efficiency of the experimental effort; and 3) combine analyses of QoE assessment
data with external network topology and performance measurements to diagnose QoE
degradations induced by congestion events on interconnections and last-mile
access links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance the field's
capabilities to diagnose performance degradation of essential tools for remote
learning and telecommuting in the United States. In the process, this project
will mentor a diverse set of undergraduate/high school students, who will learn
about real-world Internet measurement through participating in platform
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
