9417365 Puentedura Bennington College requests support from NSF for connection
of its campus network to the New England wide area network, NEARnet. NEARnet
will provide operations management and information services and it will give the
University a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. Bennington College
is a national site in Apple Computer's New Media Center Program and as such it
is a natural companion in bringing a full range of current technologies to bear
on liberal education. The college's pedagogy is traditionally hands-on in all
subjects; access to the Internet will greatly extend the direct reach of
Bennington's faculty and students.
