In this project, the PI's will participate in an international expedition
(called HYDRO-BLACK) to measure the chemistry, biology, and hydrography of the
Black Sea in a period of about 2-weeks in early September, 1991, to give a
nearly synoptic description of the circulation. Six ships will be involved, 3
from the Soviet Union, 2 from Turkey, and 1 from Bulgaria, with scientists from
Romania and the USA participating. The data set obtained will be unprecedented
in both quality and synopticity, and will allow the PI's to describe the general
two-gyre circulation thought to be present, determine momentum balances, address
the question of wind or buoyancy driving, and investigate the role of shallow
margins in determining the total chemical balance and modulating the exchange
processes and anoxia within the deeper waters.
