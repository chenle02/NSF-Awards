*** 9732626 Merritt The University of Chicago Department of Physics will
continue to administer an REU site project, targeted especially for women and
minorities. The overriding objective of this project has been and continues to
be to encourage members of under-represented minority groups and women to pursue
careers in physics. Applications are solicited nationally from undergraduate
programs in physics and engineering with particular emphasis on historically
black colleges and traditional women's colleges and local Chicago area and
Midwestern colleges and universities. The core of the program for each student
participant is a research project under supervision of an individual faculty
member. Each student is given specific, well defined research task that can be
completed within the ten-week duration of the program. The research groups in
which projects are conducted are experimental for the most part, but have
included quite a few theoretical projects. Typical projects are distributed
among the areas of high energy physics, cosmic ray and space physics, astronomy
and astrophysics, general relativity, condensed matter physics, optics and solar
energy, and electron and ion microscopy. ***
