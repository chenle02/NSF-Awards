This grant provides funding for the development of a novel processing approach
for the scalable and versatile fabrication of polymer nanofibers. Specifically,
the approach is based on an unusual combination of conventional polymer
processing, namely co-extrusion, and multi-layering with transverse cutting. The
major aims of this proposal are (1) to provide fundamental understanding of this
novel process; (2) to assess the flexibility of the polymer systems amenable to
nanofiber fabrication; and (3) to examine targeted biomedical applications which
build upon orientation and cross-sectional variations. It is our goal to push
the processing envelope to obtain small diameter nanofibers (for example, 75-200
nm) with variations in cross-sectional area to ultimately probe surface area and
porosity limits. We will also integrate a fiber drawing unit with accurate
temperature control immediately after the extrusion system as an in-situ takeoff
and orienting unit, which will largely increase production efficiency and add
significant strength to the fibers due to chain
orientation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
will provide a deeper understanding of this novel process and a detailed
assessment of the scope of polymer systems that are amenable to fiber
fabrication via this unique process. Also, it is expected that the results of
this research will reveal the potentially broad impact of the technology, with a
specific focus on applications in the area of human health, including nanofiber
scaffolding for regenerative medicine and drug delivery. The proposed work will
be an important contribution to the area of polymer processing and can lay the
foundation for an entirely new polymer nanofiber manufacturing process.
Moreover, the work can lead to the development of important applications of
polymer nanofibers that are impractical using conventional nanofiber processing
methods.
