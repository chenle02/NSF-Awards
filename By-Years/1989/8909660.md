The objective of this research is to develop models and algorithms for an
integrative approach to manufacturing. A guiding principle of this approach is
that the design of the product and the production process are done concurrently,
rather than sequentially as in traditional approaches. A major breakthrough in
combinatorial optimization has been the polyhedral combinatoric approach. In
this project, the principal investigator proposes to apply this new approach to
manufacturing. Many problems in product/production planning (e.g. facility
layout, product classification, etc.) can be modeled as combinatorial
optimization problems. Researcher's will investigate the polyhedral structure of
these problems, develop and evaluate cutting-plane methods that exploit this
structure. Model variations and adaptations of the cutting plane algorithms will
also be studied. This research will lead to a flexible and effective solution
methodology for a wide range of manufacturing design problems. The models and
algorithms developed here may be used as part of the control system for an
automated factory or as an intelligence module of a decision support system for
manufacturing design. The characterization of the polyhedral structure of these
problems may also yield insights on the design process, thus guiding the
construction of an effective modeling framework for the integrative approach to
manufacturing design.
