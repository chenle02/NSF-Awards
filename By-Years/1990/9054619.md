The survey of mathematics and science opportunity (SMSO) is to: 1) develop a
better methodology for measuring science and mathematics opportunity to learn in
elementary and secondary schools; 2) develop a prototypical curriculum framework
for the analysis of mathematics and science materials; 3) develop a measure of
teacher knowledge; and 4) conduct an exploratory study of ways to measure
instructional practices. The work will be done in three phases: The first phase
is the development of a mathematics and science content framework. This work
will lead to the development of prototyical framework that will be used in the
curriculum analysis for TIMSS. A second phase is the development of coding
manuals which describe the methodological procedures of how the framework would
be applied to the curricular materials. The third phase is to conduct research
and development that would produce survey instruments for TIMSS focusing on
opportunity to learn (OTL), teacher knowledge, and other schooling variables,
especially classroom processes (instructional practices).//
