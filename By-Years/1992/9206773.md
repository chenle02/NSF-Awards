This study will measure surface uplift rates of the Finisterre Mountains of
northern Papua New Guinea, one of the fastest uplifting areas in the world. No
other study to date has succeeded in measuring uplift rates because the young
sedimentary rocks that retain the record are usually rapidly eroded away. The
Finisterre Mountains may be unique in preserving a very young (Miocene through
Pleistocene) limestone cap. The uplift rate is a crucial quantity to measure in
order to separate uplift versus erosion effects on mountain topography, which in
turn will clarify the processes of lithospheric dynamics and mountain building.
The results will have implications for a wide variety of tectonic problems in
mountain belts.
