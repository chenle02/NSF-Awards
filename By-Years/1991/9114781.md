Experimental and analytical studies will be made of the response of
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubricants to the very high shear rates and pressures
which are encountered in EHD lubrication, using comparable, very short time
scales. New techniques have been developed to measure the dynamic
compressibility and the response to dynamic shearing, by extending the torsional
Kolsky bar and pressure-shear plate impact techniques. These techniques will be
combined with analytical analyses to reevaluate the concept of limiting shear
stress in liquid lubricants and to investigate the possibility that shear flow
localization in the EHD lubricant may play an important role in EHD lubrication.
