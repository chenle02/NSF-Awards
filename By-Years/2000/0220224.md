This small grant for exploratory research supports a geochemistry summer program
for underrepresented minority students to be based at Colby College. The goal is
to expose two high school juniors to the excitement of geoscience research while
building their formal mathematics, chemistry, and earth science skills. The
program is unique from past programs in that the students and their high school
teacher are all participants in the program. Students will be selected from the
High School for Engineering Professions program or the College preparatory
Magnet program at Scotlandville Magnet High School in Baton Rouge, LA. The
students will be part of ongoing research at Colby investigating the
geochemistry of the Belgrade lakes watershed. The summer program will be the
launching point for the students senior-year advanced science courses. This
experimental program may serve as a model for other partnerships between under
resourced high schools and four-year colleges and universities.
