Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Benedict College seeks to build on
previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American
students in STEM disciplines. The objectives and strategies of the Center for
Engineering and Science are consistent with Benedict College's goal of
increasing the number of well-prepared STEM graduates who enter in the workforce
as engineers, teachers, or pursue STEM graduate education and research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to: 1) increase
retention of STEM freshmen students; 2) increase the five-year graduation rate
of STEM majors; and 3) increase the number of engineering and science majors who
gain admission and matriculate to graduate school. The project strategies
supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and
evaluated for effectiveness. This evaluation will help to decide which
activities will be sustained by Benedict College and will be disseminated as
best practices for peer institutions.
