A three-week long summer graduate program on "Algebraic Geometry for
Applications" will take place in Georgia Institute of Technology from June 18 to
July 6, 2012. The program will focus on Polynomial Optimization and Real
Algebraic Geometry, Computer Algebra and Numerical Algebraic Geometry, Tropical
Geometry, and their applications. Institute for Mathematics and Applications
(IMA) provides funding for IMA participating institutions. The supplemental NSF
funding will be used to cover students from non-participating institutions.

Techniques and algorithmic methods from algebraic geometry have been making an
impact on applied mathematics and engineering in recent years. With large
computations now possible due to the growing power of modern computers and vast
availability of computational resources, the applied mathematics community is
opening up to the machinery of algebra. This summer program is aimed at
preparing the next generation of mathematicians in the area of applied algebraic
geometry.
