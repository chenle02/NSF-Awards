One of the most controversial questions in sexual selection is what causes the
evolution of female preference for certain male characteristics. Although these
traits often seem arbitrary, it is usually assumed that the evolution of male
traits can be explained by female preference for greater and greater development
of those characters. However, it is not clear what benefits females obtain from
choosing males with these traits. The two competing hypotheses are (1) that
selective females produce male offspring that are also attractive to females or
(2) that selective females obtain mates that contribute superior resources or
superior genetic qualities to their offspring. The Trinidad guppy presents a
unique opportunity to determine the natural selection payoffs that selective
females obtain, because this species lives in areas with high and low levels of
predation. This should produce variation in natural selection payoffs that will
cause differences in female preference for exaggerated male characters important
in determining predation risk. This will be the first study to use variation in
natural selection, laboratory selection experiments, and breeding designs to
determine how female preference and male traits coevolve by the process of
sexual selection.
