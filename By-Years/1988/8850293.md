The Seaborg Summer Science Academy is a two-week, residential intensive program
of instruction in science and mathematics for high school students with
demonstrated high ability or potential. It is designed to serve 40 participants
who are entering the 11th or 12th grades, with a few highly qualified 10th
graders also possibly included. The target audience consists primarily of
students from isolated rural areas in Michigan's vast Upper Peninsula. The Upper
Peninsula's Native American community will be a particular target for
recruitment. The Academy participants will take a core course in Problem Solving
in Mathematics and Science. In this course, they will develop and refine skills
in handling challenging problems while working together in teams. Students will
also select two science elective courses and two in mathematics. The Academy
will be held July 17-30, 1988. This will be the second year for the Academy, and
the sixth summer that the problem solving course has been offered.
