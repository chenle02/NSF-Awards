The principal investigators will study the molecular mechanisms of sorption
reactions of selected cations at solid-water interfaces. They will attempt to
understand the characteristics of sorption complexes and the factors which
determine those characteristics. The resulting information will be essential for
understanding aqueous sorption processes in general, and for developing
meaningful predictive models that can accurately describe the transport of metal
species, including toxic and radioactive elements, in groundwater systems.
