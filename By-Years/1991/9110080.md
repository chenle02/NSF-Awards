This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Guerinot's proposed research
on iron uptake in the model higher plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, using
biochemical, genetic, and molecular genetic approaches. Dr. Guerinot has long-
standing interest in iron metabolism, and has until now focussed on iron uptake
and metabolism in the Bradyrhizobium/soybean symbiosis, with particular emphasis
on iron uptake and iron-stress physiology in the bacterial partner. She would
like to expand her research to investigations of iron uptake and metabolism in
the plant partner. To facilitate these studies, she has proposed to work on
Arabidopsis as a model system, with the intention of ultimately transferring
knowledge gained through these studies to studies of the soybean. It is
anticipated that this new line of research will significantly enhance Dr.
Guerinot's career.
