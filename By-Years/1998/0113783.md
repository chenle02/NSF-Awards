&lt;br/&gt;We are developing and implementing an undergraduate Computer Security
track at the Department of Computer and Information Sciences of Towson
University. We are developing this track in close collaboration with our
consultants and evaluators from industry and academia and are disseminating the
results at conferences and at a forum for representatives from industry,
government and academia, organized at the conclusion of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven courses are the key components of this
track: Computer Ethics, Introduction to Computer Security, Introduction to
Cryptography, Network Security, Database Security, Operating Systems Security
and Security Seminar. The first two courses exist. The network security course
and a portion of the Operating Systems Security course are being adapted from
courses at the University of Idaho, which was designated as one of the Centers
of Excellence in Information Assurance. The principal investigators are
developing the remaining courses. Students graduating in this track have a
strong background in the foundations of computer security and their applications
and are better prepared to join the 21st century workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
