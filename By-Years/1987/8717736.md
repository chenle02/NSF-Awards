Here it will be investigated how two dietary substances alter the function of
insulin, a hormone which regulates the utilization of glucose by body cells. One
is fructose, a sweetner and the other is vanadium, a trace element. Using a
culture system, the sites of action and effectg on glucose metabolisms by
fructose and vanadium alone as well as how each affects the activity of the
other will be studied.
