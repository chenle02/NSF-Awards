North Carolina State University is deploying a next generation extensible
network architecture in support of faculty, staff and students across multiple
disciplines, enabled by an NSF CC-NIE networking infrastructure enhancement
grant. This architecture introduces new equipment and processes at strategic
points in the campus network, and provides a versatile infrastructure in support
of e-Science, computing-in-X, and networking research. It also leverages agile
techniques like Software Defined Networking (SDN) to meet current and future
needs of the campus community, while minimizing capex and
opex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new architecture eliminates bottlenecks,
significantly increasing access layer bandwidth in a few strategic locations, to
support big data and advanced analytics. This provides immediate benefit to
researchers across diverse disciplines who are generating, processing and
sharing more data than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages
SDN techniques not only in support of networking research, but also for the
construction of a dynamic "Virtualized Science DMZ" to provide enhanced network
connectivity to the campus research community. This provides an optimized,
easily adopted path for researchers to exchange data on- and off-campus.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project starts North Carolina State University on a
roadmap that allows the institution to extend these agile and high-bandwidth
services progressively to a larger variety of campus researchers as data
transfer needs grow and evolve. In the future, by extending SDN capabilities in
partnership with the North Carolina Research and Education Network, the
institution will provide SDN capable bandwidth available to other regional
universities and the Internet2 Advanced Layer 2 Research Network, ultimately
improving the ability to conduct leading edge research.
