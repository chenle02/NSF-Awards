This project seeks to clarify some of the pathways by which lipid metabolism
regulates eukaryotic cell activities at the membrane level. The experiments will
involve the unicellular organisms Dunaliella salina and Tetrahymena pyriformis,
which have been utilized extensively as model systems for plant and animal
cells, respectively. The studies will emphasize three interrelated areas: 1)
regulatory mechanisms by which the "fluidity" of each functionally different
membrane of a cell is maintained at a near optimal level, 2) formation and
dissemination of different classes of proteins containing covalently-bound fatty
acids, and 3) the control and consequences of polyphosphoinositide turnover
during the transduction of extracellular signals by D. salina. Based upon
preliminary findings, it seems very likely that all these three research areas
are directly or indirectly related in the control of cellular function. By
employing radioisotope labeling experiments and detailed analysis of membrane
lipids and proteins by chromatography and electrophoresis, the biochemical
pathways involved will be characterized and their regulation studied by first
perturbing membrane fluidity experimentally and then observing how the control
processes restore normal function. %%%% Individual key reactions of lipid
metabolism are being studied in model plant systems. These reactions are also
being studied not as isolated events but as how they serve the cell to provide
the physical environment needed for normal cell functioning. Many reactions
crucial to life take place in cellular membranes, not free in solution. This
work focuses on in vivo metabolism in order to gain a realistic picture of cell
metabolism in the normal state.
