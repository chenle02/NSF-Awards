Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will concentrate on
computing the higher-order effects of the strong nuclear force on processes
which occur at existing particle accelerators, or will occur at future ones of
higher energy. Knowledge of these effects is very important to our further
testing of the so-called Standard Model of the elementary particles, and to our
efforts to explore physics beyond that described in this Model.
