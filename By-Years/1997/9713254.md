Proposal Number: ECS-9713254 Principal Investigator: Henry Kapteyn Title:
Ultrafast laser produced microstructured plasmas for soft X-ray lasers In this
resrach, investigations into the generation of soft x-ray radiation form a laser
solid interaction will be investigated. An ultrafast laser pulse of intensity of
1016-1018 watts/cm2 is focused onto a solid, creating a highly nonequilibrium
plasma. The rapidly heated, rapidly cooled plasma formed from the laser-plasma
interaction with the solid emits sub-picosecond x-rays. The material itself can
be patterned or "microstructured" for the efficient absorption of the incident
laser light and the emission of the x-ray radiation. The heating and cooling of
the solid plasma can be tailored by the properties of the material(s) involved
and by the microstructure e.g., high destiny grooves etc.. Key to the success of
this work is the high intensity, short pulse laser for the initial heating.
Compact soft x-ray lasers will have many applications in biology and materials
science.
