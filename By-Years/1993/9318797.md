This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program (IID) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah in the purchase of an upgrade
of its existing 500 MHZ NMR. This equipment upgrade will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: Conformational Properties of
Phorphorus-Containing Six-Membered Rings Molecular Structure from Automated
Interpretation of INADEQUATE Spectra Segmental Motion in Peptides and Proteins
Mechanistic Studies of Enzymes in the Isoprene Biosynthetic Pathway Structural
Studies of Peptide Neurotoxins from Fish-Hunting Cone Snails Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist
for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
unknown substances, charcterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access
to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas
such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
