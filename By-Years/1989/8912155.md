Support for Ground-based instruments is an important goal of the Magnetospheric
Physics Program. This project is for the continuing operation of the Alaska-
Canada meridian chain of magnetometers and riometers. These instruments are an
essential tool for the investigation of high-latitude geomagnetic phenomena and
as a remote sensing facility for the University of Alaska and the space physics
community. The chain closely follows a magnetic meridian, spanning the auroral
oval reaching into the polar cap. The data from the meridian chain has been
widely used by the space physics community and has been an important diagnostic
for a number of satellite operations and rocket launches from the Poker Flat
Rocket Range. *** //
