In this project, the PI will continue analysis and complete the publication of
data from eight oceanographic cruises carried out by the PI in collaboration
with the Peoples' Republic of China on a Chinese vessel from 1986 through 1990.
Several aspects of the upper and deep ocean circulation in the Western Pacific
will be addressed, including bifurcation of the North Equatorial Current,
Indonesian inflow, subsurface currents near Papua New Guinea, and Intermediate
Water circulation.
