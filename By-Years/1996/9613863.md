The PI plans to use TOPEX/POSEIDON data to analyze the spatial structure and
temporal evolution of the ionosphere. In particular, he is interested in TEC
manifestations of the response of the middle and low latitude ionosphere to
geomagnetic storms and in TEC wave signatures. This data analysis procedure will
also prepare TEC data for utilization in other objectives of the space weather
program. The data provide an excellent database for model validation purposes,
especially important over large ocean areas where ionosonde, GPS TEC, or other
ground-based data are not available. TEC measurements from the TOPEX/POSEIDON
mission are an ideal data set for the validation of the new understanding of
ionospheric storm effect distributions.
