This project will provide new geochronological data on several terrane
components in the northern Philippines using U-Pb isotopic studies. Each terrane
is bounded by major fault zones and contains a distinct assemblage of rock type
and structures. The geochronology will provide an "absolute time" framework upon
which kinematic, paleomagnetic and stratigraphic data can be interpreted. Areas
selected for detailed study include the Angat and Zambales ophiolites and
selected plutons from the Central Cordillera and S. Sierra Madres of Luzon
Island. The results will provide much needed reliable time markers for other
workers in the region, and will help formulate better models for the tectonic
evolution of the northern Philippines.
