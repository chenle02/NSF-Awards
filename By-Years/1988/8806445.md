This research is directed at several problems in combinatorics and group
theory. The principal investigator will consider the fundamentals of the sphere
packing problem, applications of low dimensional lattices, and the Monster
simple group. The sphere packing work has already led to a patent on quantizing
a certain type of code but the long term merit is in leading to connections
between the Monster simple group and the Monster. The project is concerned with
problems in combinatorics and group theory. In particular, the principal
investigator will concentrate on a particularly remarkable group which is called
the Monster. The outcome of this investigation is likely to impact other areas
of mathematics and physics.
