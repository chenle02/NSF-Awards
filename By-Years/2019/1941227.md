The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project will deploy a nanotechnology-based
device to deliver fresh water, employing renewable energy and directed toward
applications in sectors such as individual use, small-scale household,
municipality, or industrial use. The initial application will be developed for
small municipalities and individuals in high-mineral-content aquifer-supplied
regions, with subsequent translation to include brine management for
desalination plants and fresh water recovery for saltwater disposal companies.
Our community will include teachers from the highly diverse and majority
disadvantaged Houston Independent School District (86% minority enrollment) in a
Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program and an undergraduate student from
Houston Community College, a school with a majority Hispanic and African-
American student body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses the
critical need for compact, innovative technologies that create safe drinking
water from water over a range of salinities, which do not require large-scale
infrastructure, but can be deployed even in remote, needy areas. Our objective
is to design and build a compact prototype system to achieve the benchmark goal
of 1 gal/min clean water production. The core technology combines small-scale
optical elements, an optimized thermal oscillator-driven energy recovery, and
the use of efficient light-absorbing nanoparticles that generate heat and
locally vaporize water. This project will combine advanced theoretical models
and numerical multiphysics techniques, already tested quantitatively against
experimental pilot studies, to guide the fabrication of optimized desalination
units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
