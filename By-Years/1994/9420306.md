This is an accomplishment-based renewal based on previous work in probabilistic
reasoning and qualitative probabilities within computational implementations.
Some important problems are to be addressed in the acquisition and processing of
causal information. These include (1) learning of causal structures from
empirical data using combinations of observations and manipulations and (2)
planning under uncertainty by using qualitative approximations of probabilities
and utilities. The approaches to be pursued are indirect experimentation,
syntactic derivations , and feedback mechanisms. The short term results are
expected to be improved reasoning methods in applications such as medical
diagnosis, sensor fusion, and automated management and control of manufacturing
processes.
