Resolution of the causes and extent of faunal turnover in the past has been
complicated by the absence of fossil beds that document such changes over fine
time scales. This proposed work will examine temporal change in taxonomic
diversification of tetrapods in Late Triassic and Early Jurassic strata of the
Newark Supergroup of eastern North America at 20,000-year intervals. By
examining three temporally equivalent sets of beds whose fossils occupied
different habitats, the principal investigator will document diversification at
relatively fine levels and test whether declines of potentially competing non-
dinosaurian clades were required for expansion of dinosaur groups. The entire
study is intended to provide a basis for global comparisons.
