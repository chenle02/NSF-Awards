The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the efforts of
Professor Thomas J. Meyer of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for
the investigation of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and concerted
electron-proton transfer (EPT) in two areas. The first project focuses on the
role of PCET and EPT in electrochemical reactions and electrocatalysis. The
group's results document a significant role for PCET and EPT in electrode
reactions with potentially important implications for electrocatalysis by
solution and surface-bound catalysts. The second research area focuses on
excited state, light-driven EPT reactions that produce highly reactive
intermediates for carrying out solar fuel and green chemical reactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proton coupled electron transfer reactions, reactions in
which both electrons and protons are transferred, are of considerable interest
in both chemistry and biology. These reactions are at the core of biological
systems and artificial photosynthesis and are utilized in both water oxidation
and carbon dioxide reduction. This research examines the mechanistic details of
these reactions and may lead to the development of alternative energy systems.
Graduate and postdoctoral students participate in the supervision of
undergraduate research, in demonstrations and presentations at UNC and at local
schools, in a summer programs developed to broaden participation.
