The primary objective of this research is to understand and interpret the
anatomical changes that took place in the human back during the transition to
bipedalism among our ancestors. This is a biological problem of considerble
interest to anthropologists and the results will be directly relevant to
reconstructing locomotor behavior and the transformation to bipedality in the
fossil record. The first step in solving this problem will be to conduct a
thorough description of the musculoskeletal anatomy of the back of apes and an
analysis of its function in locomotion. The proposed study will combine (1)
osteometric comparision of the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the back
among humans, apes, and other selected primates; (2) comparative dissections of
the muscles of this region in the same species; and, (3) cineradiographic
analysis of the movements of the vertebral column in several species, so that
functional hypotheses can be verified more objectively. Anthropologists
currently disagree on both the posture and locomotion that likely characterized
our prebipedal ancestor and on the identification of fully modern bipedality in
the fossil record. The results of this study will contribute to our knowledge of
locomotor analysis and function in the living apes, and identify anatomical
correlates to upright posture in several types of primates. Moreover, it should
prove valuable to future understanding of the origin of human bipedalism.
