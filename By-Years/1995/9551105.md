The university is creating a modern parallel computing laboratory and a course
on computational science. The course introduces undergraduates to the use of a
high-speed parallel computer for solving computationally intensive scientific
problems and introduces computer science students to scientific applications of
computing. This new system enables the university to introduce parallel
computing into several other courses in the computer science curriculum, e.g.,
graphics, algorithms, programming languages, and operating systems. The project
director is developing teaching materials, which will be disseminated to other
colleges and universities. The laboratory consists of a 12-node distributed
memory parallel computer with a workstation as a host machine. Each node
includes a powerful compute processor and is combined with a T805 transputer as
a communications processor. The computer is accessible from the university's
network of workstations, for simultaneous use.
