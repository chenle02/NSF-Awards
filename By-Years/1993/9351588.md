Hammond 9351588 The project will purchase a high field Fourier transform nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer (FT NMR) to improve lower and upper division
chemistry and biochemistry laboratory courses. It will also be used in advanced
electives such as Polymer Synthesis and Organic Preparations. The FT NMR
spectrometer will introduce to undergraduates the first and most sophisticated
example of current technology computer-driven chemical instrumentation at an
early stage in their academic careers. Students will receive a practical
introduction to structure determination by NMR spectroscopy during the sophomore
organic chemistry laboratory course, then continue with applications in
inorganic and P-chem. It will also allow students to determine structures of
complex molecules using multi- pulse sequence and 2D-NMR techniques. ***
