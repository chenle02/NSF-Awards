This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical and
computational chemistry involves the laboratories of Jiali Gao at the State
University of New York and Martin Field at the French National Center for
Scientific Research Laboratory for Molecular Dynamics in Grenoble, France. The
award will provide travel support and living expenses for Dr. Gao's graduate
student. The objective of the research is to implement and test two alternative
methods for the treatment of quantum mechanical/ molecular mechanical boundary
divisions. The project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of Dr. Gao
in statistical mechanical simulations and Dr. Field's in quantum chemistry. It
will advance fundamental understanding of computational methods for the study of
chemical reactions in solutions and in enzymes.
