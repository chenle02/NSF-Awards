A primary goal of the Information Security Institute (ISI) is to produce
graduates with comprehensive information technology foundations in conjunction
with a robust understanding of the international, political, legal, and
managerial ramifications of the range of issues needed to assume leadership
positions in government and industry relevant to the pervasive and critical
roles played by Information Security & Assurance (IS&A) in society. The
health/medical federal information infrastructure represents a critical
application domain for the IS&A technologies. The Information Security Institute
in conjunction with the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins
University can address this need via the Masters of Science in Security
Informatics (MSSI) program by providing a graduate educational experience
comprised of relevant courses integrated with research/development projects that
serve as preparation for guidance of public health policy and practices. The
graduation of MSSI students well qualified to assume leadership roles in the
federal public health sectors has significant short-term impact, and from a
broader perspective would represent the availability of a proven, successful
model for other health-related educational institutions to adopt in order to
similarly address this critical infrastructure need. Within Johns Hopkins
University, the success of the program justifies considerable expansion,
including enhancement of the support of the participation of underrepresented
groups, development of part-time and on-line venues, and cultivation of
innovative educational government/industry partnerships.
