This research seeks to test a two-part hypothesis about the creation of
electoral laws and their effects on a nation's political party system: electoral
procedures that improve the level of representativeness of a party system will
only be implemented only when doing so improves the political position of the
politicians involved in making the laws. Using data on electoral reforms and the
politicians who supported or opposed them, this study will discover whether
politicians whose political survival is threatened will prefer rules that
broaden participation in an effort to amass as much support as possible. On the
other hand, secure politicians will favor the electoral rules that brought them
into power while opposing laws that allow new parties and participants. The
research targets Latin America where party systems with varying degrees of
representativeness were replaced first by military regimes that have recently
given way to democratically elected governments.
