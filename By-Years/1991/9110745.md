This proposal will support both new and continuing investigations into
structural properties of complete sets, randomness in computation, and internal
structure such as a self-reducibility of feasible sets. The purposes are: to
continue successful work on the Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture with
particular emphasis on characterizing complexity theoretic assumptions for the
isomorphism conjecture to hold or fail; to continue recent investigations into
random oracles that have yielded an interesting new proof technique and hold
promise of stronger results; and to examine the structural complexity
consequences of checkability, coherence, random self-reducibility, and other
recently introduced concepts related to self-reducibility.//
