This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research
(SCOR) in order to assist qualified ocean scientists from developing countries
attend various planning workshops and international scientific meetings that are
sanctioned by SCOR and of interest to the National Science Foundation. This
ongoing project has become the corner stone of SCOR's efforts to provide
assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia
and Eastern Europe. All recipients of funds are informed that this assistance is
made possible through a grant to SCOR from the US National Science Foundation.
The NSF funds are used to broaden international involvement in these activities
in the preliminary phases; once the value of an individual's participation is
demonstrated, he or she will be invited to join the relevant group and will then
be supported from the basic SCOR budget. Project objectives include: broadening
traditional participation in ocean-related international scientific meetings to
include more scientists from developing countries; enhancing the exchange of
detailed regional knowledge or expertise in planning for large-scale
oceanographic experiments; and providing greater opportunities leading to the
involvement of developing countries in international collaborative programs,
such as JGOFS and GLOBEC.
