This award supports student participation in the 2009 Integrated Photonics and
Nanophotonics Research and Applications (IPNRA) Topical Meeting. This is the
fifth OSA sponsored IPNRA Topical Meeting. Integrated photonics and
nanophotonics are the topics of the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OSA has organized the meeting to be in the form of
contributed papers, presentations by invited speakers, and publications. OSA has
invited speakers from the worldwide scientific community (Europe, Japan, and
USA) to present major new developments. The selection of accepted papers meets
rigorous standards. The meeting will feature innovative science and engineering
results and explore areas of applications. A conference program and technical
digest will be published with research details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting promotes student education by
creating an opportunity for networking, one-to-one research discussions, and
exposure to recent major developments. Student participation at the IPNRA
Topical Meeting will help to maintain and foster a pool of trained engineers and
scientists in integrated photonics and nanophotonics.
