Constraint solving is an integral part of program verification, in
&lt;br/&gt;general and abstract interpretation in particular. This proposal
explores&lt;br/&gt;some fundamental issues in integer feasibility checking and
certification for &lt;br/&gt;a specialized class of constraints called Unit Two
Variable Per Inequality &lt;br/&gt;(UTVPI) constraints. This approach is based
on fundamentally new insights into &lt;br/&gt;the problem of integer feasibility
checking, and will provide actual certificates &lt;br/&gt;of infeasibility. The
ability to provide positive and negative certificates &lt;br/&gt;will impact
program verification, and enhance the reliability of
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a proof system called FMR
(Fourier-Motzkin with Rounding), which &lt;br/&gt;is a sound and complete system
for establishing the lattice point infeasibility of &lt;br/&gt;a UTVPI system.
This work will isolate the smallest-sized proof of infeasibility &lt;br/&gt;in
the FMR proof system with an appropriately defined notion of size, and will
explore &lt;br/&gt;the problem of certification by trying to identify the form
of certificates and &lt;br/&gt;optimize the size of such certificates.
