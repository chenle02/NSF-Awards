The focus of this research will involve the use of cation-stabilizing (C-S)
auxiliaries to enhance the yield, stereo- and regioselectivity of polyene
cyclization processes. The role of the auxiliaries will be explored by placing
them at varied positions on the substrate, by developing new C-S functional
groups, by studying the effect of using two or more C-S functions and by
applying the concept to the synthesis of hitherto difficult to obtain
polycyclics of biological importance. A second focus will involve the use of
chiral acetals to induce asymmetric synthesis. %%% With this Accomplishment
Based Renewal, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
William S. Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford university.
Professor Johnson will focus his work on developing reactions that mimic, and
even rival in efficiency, enzymatic ring-forming processes which form polycyclic
carbon compounds of biological importance.
