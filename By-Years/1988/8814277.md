This award will enable Dr. Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and Dr. Joseph S. Francisco of Wayne State University to
collaborate with Dr. A.W. Knight of Griffith University (Brisbane, Australia) on
developing new research approaches to the study of light-induced chemical
transformations in thin films and at surfaces. Expertise of the Australian
collaborator in pulsed molecular beam techniques will complement surface and
ultra-high-vacuum experiments under way in the U.S. The U.S. collaborators will
also benefit from the Australians' experience in analysis and interpretation of
the high-resolution spectroscopy of large polyatomic molecules. Finally,
students involved in the project will enhance their knowledge and appreciation
of the goals and problems associated with industrial research and development in
both countries.
