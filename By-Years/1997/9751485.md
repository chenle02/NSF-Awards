This project is addressing major changes in student demographics, levels of
preparedness for college, and innovations in pedagogy made possible through
computers and telecommunications. The department is creating a combined
classroom/computer-based laboratory for psychology. Curricula in three courses
(Physiological Psychology, Research Methods, and Statistics) are being revised
to fully integrate computer-based learning and the Internet. These courses are
being will be taught in the classroom/laboratory. In addition, students in
Introduction to Psychology are being given an opportunity to use computers to
review and reinforce concepts learned in class and from their textbook.
Innovative CD ROMs, computerized study guides, simulation software, and the
Internet are being made available to help students succeed and continue in their
study of psychology. *
