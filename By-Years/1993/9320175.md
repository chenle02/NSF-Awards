9320175 Dalgarno Theoretical procedures will be used to interpret molecular
spectroscopic data in terms of a potential matrix which can then also be
employed to make reliable predictions of low energy atomic collision processes.
Collisions of oxygen and nitrogen atoms will be investigated. The role of
energetic atoms produced by dissociative recombination in the atmosphere will be
explored and the rate coefficients of reactions involving hot atoms will be
studied. Calculations will be carried out of the quenching of vibrationally
excited molecular oxygen. Calculations will be carried out of the Rayleigh and
Raman scattering of molecular oxygen in the region of the discrete Schumann-
Runge bands. ***
