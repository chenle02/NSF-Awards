The occurrence of mutations and their ability to provide an organism with a
competitive advantage is central to evolution. Mutations that provide an
advantage are relatively rare. The frequency and magnitude of positive, neutral
and negative mutational effects is important for the dynamics and outcome of
evolutionary processes; however, this distribution of mutational effects has not
been comprehensively determined due to experimental limitations. This lack of
knowledge has been a major hurdle for the study of how genes and proteins
evolve. In this work, engineered bacteria that function analogous to an
electrical circuit called a band-pass filter, together with the extensive use of
the latest DNA sequencing technology, will be used to determine the distribution
of mutational effects for all possible single nucleotide substitutions in a
single gene that plays an important role in the evolution of antibiotic
resistance. This knowledge will be exploited to address fundamental questions in
evolution and practical issues in the application of evolution to biotechnology.
Graduate students involved in this research will train undergraduates and high
school students through their participation in this project.
