Japan STA Program: Kinematics and Calibrations of Parallel-Link Manipulators
This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Charles Wampler of
General Motors Research Laboratories to conduct collaborative research with Dr.
Tatsuo Arai for 6 months at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Tsukuba,
Japan. They will utilize the forward kinematic control algorithms Wampler has
developed to test a prototype parallel-link manipulator robot Dr. Arai designed
and built. The Stewart platform, a parallel-link manipulator, has mainly been
used for aircraft simulators and similar applications since the mid 1980's. Dr.
Arai has designed and built a prototype Stewart- platform manipulator for use in
underground excavation. Excavation requires the manipulator to exert large
forces, and in order to optimize the manipulator's ability to exert such forces,
a seventh serial-link leg was added to the center of Arai's manipulator,
effectively reducing the size of workspace. Dr. Wampler proposes to develop a
way to eliminate the seventh leg by adding extra joints and instrumentation to
the original six legs, to calibrate the robot with six legs, then to test their
theoretical work on Dr. Arai's robot. Dr. Arai's expertise in robotics,
particularly the parallel-link manipulator, complements Dr. Wampler's experience
in kinematics of manipulators and numerical solution of polynomial systems. This
collaborative research will provide Wampler with first-hand knowledge of
leading-edge Japanese research in robotics.
