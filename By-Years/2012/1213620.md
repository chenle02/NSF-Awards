With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professor Bruce Palfey of the University of Michigan to study the
reaction mechanism of the flavin dependent thymidylate synthase. All life
requires thymidylate in order to synthesize DNA. The "classic" thymidylate
synthase, studied in high detail for half a century, transfers carbon from
methylenetetrahydrofolate to deoxyuridine monophosphate through a series of
covalent intermediates. It does this without a prosthetic group. In contrast,
flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase, discovered just a decade ago,
accomplishes the same net transfer of carbon, but somehow the flavin prosthetic
group is critical to the process. The reactions that reduce and oxidize the
flavin prosthetic group and transfer carbon from methylenetetrahydrofolate will
be examined by several spectroscopic and kinetic methods, in the hope of
identifying intermediates and understanding how the protein controls the
reactions. The novel possibility will be explored that flavin-dependent
thymidylate synthase activates deoxyuridine monophosphate by polarization
instead of attack by an enzymic nucleophile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader
Impacts of this project include insight on the mechanistic and evolutionary
malleability of chemical routes critical to life. The flavin-dependent
thymidylate synthase reaction is just one example of the widespread reactions
that methylate the pyrimidines of nucleic acids or their precursors. For the
students involved, this project is expected to provide multi-disciplinary
training, including molecular biology, protein biochemistry, spectroscopy,
kinetics and organic synthesis. The investigator plans to recruit
underprivileged high school students into the laboratory via participation in
the American Chemical Society's Project SEED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is being co-funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster
in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the BIO Directorate.
