9416144 Wenger This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The study involves an intensive and
comparative analysis of patterns of destruction, casualties, formal
organizational and volunteer search and rescue activities, and the provision of
emergency medical services during the earthquake. This interdisciplinary
project, involving the disciplines of engineering and sociology, will use a
variety of data gathering techniques, including field observation, intensive
interviewing, and analysis of documents. ***
