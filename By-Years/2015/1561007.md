This award will provide support for a substantial number of students and young
postdoctoral scientists to attend the 38th International Conference in High
Energy Physics in Chicago, Illinois, August 3-8, 2016. This conference is held
bi-annually and is the largest of this kind for the particle physics community,
with an expected attendance of at least 1,000 persons. Topics covered will be
wide, including intensity, high energy and cosmic frontiers. Attendance by
graduate students to participate, either as members of the audience or as
speakers, is the particular role for NSF funds. Priority for this support will
be given to students from under privileged communities.
