Diverse manifestations of violent activity in the nuclei of galaxies are
believed to result from the interactions of matter with a supermassive black
hole. However, the details of these interactions and their observational
signatures are not well understood. This award will support theoretical research
studying three important classes of phenomena in active galactic nuclei (AGNs):
the formation of relativistic jets, the production of X-ray spectra, and
interactions involving ultrarelativistic particles. The investigations described
in this proposal will address the questions: Why do some AGNs produce powerful
jets while others do not? What can X-ray observations tell us about the
temperatures, densities, and spatial organization of matter close to the black
hole? What roles (if any) do ultrarelativistic particles play in shaping the
energy output of an AGN, and how does this energy affect the environment of the
AGN? The long-term goals of this research are: 1) to determine whether the
interactions of matter with a supermassive black hole really are responsible for
AGN phenomena; 2) to understand in detail how these interactions take place: and
3) to learn what effects nuclear activity can have on the appearance and
evolution of the host galaxy.
