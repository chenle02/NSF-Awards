The purpose of this study is to devise general methods for making ordinary data
structures persistent. Ordinary data structures are ephemeral in that any change
to them destroys the old version, leaving only the new, modified version.
Persistent data structures remember their past versions allowing both access and
update operations to any version. Some general methods are known that can
transform linked data structures into efficient persistent data structures. This
study aims to devise new methods for making data structures persistent, in
particular certain linked structures with arbitrary in degree for which no such
methods are known. Persistent data structures are useful in numerous areas,
including computational geometry, the implementation of very high level
languages, and text editing.
