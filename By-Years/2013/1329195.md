This project will focus on identifying fundamental attributes of economic
decision making, a set of measurements that the researchers call "econographics.
The project also will focus on measuring econographics in countries throughout
the world and within the U.S. over time, and as well as examining how these
attributes relate to popular attitudes and participation in governmental
processes. The researchers will conduct an incentivized survey that will measure
econographics across thirteen countries, and over three times within the U.S.
The countries selected to survey include many different types of governmental
and economic environments, including parliamentary democracies with high
redistribution, federal systems with a large informal economies, transitional
democracies, developing democracies and authoritarian states. These states also
have a variety of economic systems. Through their measurement of econographics
across a broad spectrum of countries, the researchers will test hypotheses
related to the processes through which these fundamental attributes correspond
with the political environment and with economic performance. The three survey
waves within the U.S. will straddle a national election to examine how major
national events, which are known to change popular attitudes, affect
econographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new metrics to
assess fundamentals of economic culture and decision making, and it will
facilitate new modes of research to link behavioral economics with other social
and behavioral science fields. The project will provide new insights related to
the conduct of large-scale, cross-country, incentivized surveys, thereby
facilitating future research based on empirical tests on representative samples
of the population rather than on subjects in a social science laboratory. The
project will provide valuable education and training opportunities for post-
doctoral researchers and graduate students, and project results will provide
valuable information and insights to assist policy makers and others in
determining the most effective ways to attain socially desirable goals. This
project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social
Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.
