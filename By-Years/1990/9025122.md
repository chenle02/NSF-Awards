The goal of this research effort is to model complex diffusional processes with
simple, but rigorous equations. These equations have already been derived for
single phase systems in terms of the square root diffusivity. Experimental
studies are made using diffusion couples containing small concentration
differences in order to satisfy a constant diffusivity assumption. A computer
program is being developed to predict concentration profiles in diffusion
couples that contain up to eight alloying elements. This research is important
to high temperature processing techniques such as pack cementation, oxidation
and annealing. Diffusion causes property degradation in high temperature
materials systems such as coated turbine blades and metal-matrix composites.
This research should provide valuable predictive capabilities for these and
similar processes.
