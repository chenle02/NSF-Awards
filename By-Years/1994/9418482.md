9418482 Fan This research is to study the Vrancea seismic zone, located in the
eastern part of the Carpathian arc, which is well known for intermediate-depth
seismicity associated with subduction, or continental collision. New data
accumulated in the last decade will allow the investigation of the source-time
history of more than 25 medium-sized earthquakes and the development of a
detailed velocity structure for the region above the seismic zone. The work will
be done in collaboration with Dr. Oncescu of the Romanian Center for Earth
Physics and Seismology; the Romanians operate a digital regional network
equipped with short-period seismometers. The origin and tectonic history of this
seismic zone is the subject of considerable controversy, and it is uncertain
whether it is due to continent-continent collision, or the remanents of oceanic
subduction. This study will provide new information on the geometry and the
stress regime within the downgoing slab. Numerous strong earthquakes have
occurred in the Vrancea zone and have caused fatalities and extensive damaging.
These studies should provide a better understanding of seismic hazard in this
type of tectonic environment. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
