This research is concerned primarily with the development of techniques for the
design of computationally efficient digital filters. A concomitant secondary aim
is to develop design techniques that utilize filter structures which are more
attractive to fabrication using very large scale integrated (VLSI) digital
circuit technology. New computationally efficient algorithms and structures for
digital signal processing with a reduced number of arithmetic operations will be
pursued. The investigation of four problem areas are planned to accomplish these
overall objectives. These involve the generalization of a design procedure which
implements a transfer function as a cascade of a filter section with a sparcer
impulse response, a differential coding scheme which permits multiplications
with minimal add and shift operations, and a number of computer-aided
optimization techniques for filter design.
