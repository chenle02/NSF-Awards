This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. Natural
Language learning is a paradigm problem for Artificial Intelligence and
Cognitive Science. The world's languages differ significantly in grammar and
conceptual structure but all are learned easily by children. This research
continues the exploration of language acquisition in the restricted domain of
simple geometric scenes and sequences. The methodology is structured
connectionist modelling with an extended version of back-propagation learning
techniques. One critical task of this research is developing a system capable of
learning individual spatial relation terms from any of a wide range of
languages, as part of a broad inter-disciplinary effort on natural language
acquisition. It includes the learning of grammatical rules and more complex
sentences and adding inferential capabilities to the existing system. //
