The goal of this research is to address basic issues in the development of
robust and efficient computational methods for simulating waves. Problems
governed by wave propagation span much of the physical phenomena we experience
and play a fundamental role both in engineered systems for communication and
imaging as well as naturally-occurring aspects of earth's environment. Specific
examples include: wave phenomena involved with natural disasters such as
earthquakes and tsunamis; environmental irritants such as acoustic pollution
near airports and in cities; electromagnetic phenomena of importance to defense
and civilian applications, such as radar imaging; and applications in medicine
such as the interaction of high-frequency ultrasound and tissue. This project
will develop improved tools for simulating waves and will design associated
general-purpose open-source software with the potential for significant impact
in a range of important application areas.

With the staggering increases in computational power that have been and continue
to be achieved, we expect to simulate more difficult and comprehensive models of
physical phenomena. For wave propagation problems posed in the time domain, this
means problems with many wavelengths within the computational domain involving
interactions with complex geometrical features. To treat such problems
efficiently requires the use of high-order discretization methods to minimize
the effects of dispersion and dissipation. This work will be focused on
fundamental mathematical issues required for the further development of robust,
high-order wave solvers. These include: i. Development and analysis of energy-
stable high-order/high-resolution discretization methods on hybrid structured-
unstructured grids. Specifically we will investigate coupling high-order upwind
discontinuous Galerkin methods on unstructured grids near complex boundaries and
material interfaces with more efficient structured grid methods such as novel
spectral element methods based on Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation (also known as
jet schemes) or upwind difference methods constructed from piecewise polynomial
or band-limited interpolation functions. Both first-order and second-order
hyperbolic systems will be considered. ii. Development, analysis, and
implementation of hp-adaptive strategies for these methods. iii. Coupling with
an open-source radiation boundary condition library (expected release late 2014)
containing various implementations of complete radiation boundary conditions
(CRBC). These allow a priori determination of the boundary condition parameters
to guarantee any desired accuracy for isotropic, homogeneous models in the far
field. iv. Leveraging the fact that CRBCs are stable for any Friedrichs system,
extend their applicability to more complex physical models including anisotropy.
