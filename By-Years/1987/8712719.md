Ten undergraduate students do research for 13 weeks with 18 faculty members in
chemical engineering and materials science. The program is an addition to an
existing honors program with a new provision for off-campus undergraduate
students from the state and region. The opportunities for undergraduate research
projects are extremely varied and of high quality. The areas of research include
microelectronics, polymers, metallurgy, electrochemistry, rheology, catalysis,
ceramics, and bioengineering. 8712810 CASS Ten undergraduate students are
engaged in a 10-week period of research at the university. The program parallels
an existing university program--Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF).
The new project provides for more participation by students from other
institutions. The students come from local and national areas; selections
consider minorities and women. A broad spectrum of research opportunities exist.
