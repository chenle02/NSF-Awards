This award provides funding to purchase a Fisons Plasma 54 mass spectrometer
(MS) which will offer rapid analysis and high precision for a variety of isotope
ratio studies. The PI's are particularly interested in using the MS for large
numbers of U/Th and Sr/Ca ratio determinations in coral reef samples and of
anthropogenic Pb in urban environments. The Fisons MS is capable of greatly
increasing the speed of analysis, while maintaining the high precision of
thermal ionization mass spectrometry which is normally used to analyze such
samples. In addition, the ICP source's higher ionization temperature greatly
increases the ionization of the more refractory elements, thereby allowing the
analysis of many elements that were not susceptible to this type of analysis
before. Analysis of these samples will contribute to our understanding of
paleoclimates, global change, and environmental contaminants.
