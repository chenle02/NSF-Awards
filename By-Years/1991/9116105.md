Fort Valley State College and the University of Oklahoma are jointly requesting
a three year grant of $300,000 in support of student scholarships for
participants in the FVSC-OU-Petroleum Industry Consortium's 3+2 Dual Degree
Program. As previously mentioned, our goal is to recruit and retain 10
academically qualified minority students per year into the program. They
estimate that $5,000 per student per academic year is required to competitively
recruit and retain mathematically and scientifically talented minority students
to this program. In-state tuition as FVSC and OU is approximately $1,600 per
academic year at both institutions. The remaining $3,400 per academic year would
minimally cover room, board, books and supplies, and incidental living expenses.
The University of Oklahoma's College of Geosciences will guarantee direct,
additional scholarship support or waivers of the difference between in-state and
out-of-state tuition for students formally participating in the program while at
OU.
