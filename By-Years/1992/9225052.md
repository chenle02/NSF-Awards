This project will bring ten students to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for
a two month period in the summer of 1993 to work in the Computer Science
Department in the area of human- computer interaction. The opportunity to
complete the project will be available during the academic year. Components of
the project are introductory readings and lectures to motivate the students in
the area, a seminar to familiarize them with the background for their research,
an interface prototyping project, a research project in which small groups of
participants work together to choose a research question and instrument an
experiment to study it, and an optional academic year follow-up. The project
will also include an ethics component that will address three areas; what
constitutes ethical personal behavior in research, social responsibility in
scientific research, and ethical standards for the treatment of human subjects.
