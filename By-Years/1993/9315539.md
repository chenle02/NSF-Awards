9315539 Evans The goal of this project is to combine insights in the new field
of Interfacial Engineering with the advances in instructional technology and
cognitive learning theory to create a broadly relevant curriculum. Based on
existing research in interfacial science and engineering, 8 multimedia computer-
based instructional modules will be developed in two years. The effectiveness
and utility of these modules in multi-disciplinary curricula will be similarly
evaluated at the University of Minnesota, and at Case Western Reserve, Clarkson,
Purdue, Rice, Stanford, UCLA, University of Virginia, and University of
Washington. After test, evaluation and refinement, the individual modules in CD-
ROM will be introduced nationwide through the conferences and Symposia on higher
education.
