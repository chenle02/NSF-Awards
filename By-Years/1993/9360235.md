9360235 Vithayathil Adjustable speed 3 phase AC motor drives are now preferred
over DC motor systems, for many industrial drives and battery powered cars. This
is because, static inverters, with adjustable frequency and voltage, are
reliable and economical. Induction motors provide brushless operation. But they
have slip and a relatively low lagging power factor. Synchronous motors have
better power factor and no slip. They are also better for vector control, for
good dynamic performance. But brushless, exciterless synchronous motors have
permanent magnet rotors and so lack easy adjustability of flux and power factor.
We propose to do the feasibility research on an AC motor drive, for which the
principal investigator has obtained a US Patent. The machine is synchronous, but
brushless and does not need exciter or permanent magnets. The stator creates an
auxiliary rotating field, besides the main field. The auxiliary field rotates at
a different rpm and serves to induce AC currents in the rotor circuit. This AC
is rectified by means of rotor mounted diodes, to provide DC excitation, for
synchronous running with respect to the main field. The field is adjustable from
the stator side. The program covers the fabrication of both the motor and the
matching inverter. ***
