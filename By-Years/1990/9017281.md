Proposal centers on the role of fluctuations in electronic and structural
order. Initiatives include a) energetics, interactions and dynamics of the
quasi-crystalline state, structure and transport in metallic fluids, and
electronic fluctuation and effective interactions, b) dense classical one-
component plasmas, the classical inverse problem, and the quantum statistical
mechanics of two component charged systems, c) condensed matter and collective
quantum fields, and d) geometric phase and thermal gauge fields. The notion of
fluctuation based on-retarded electron attraction will also be explored with
respect to superconducting order.
