0136836/Han&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are: to determine the
variability of the tropical Indian Ocean forced by intraseasonal atmospheric
forcing; to understand the dynamics and thermodynamics of such variability; and
to examine the impact of atmospheric intraseasonal forcing on oceanic seasonal
variability and the Indian Ocean Zonal Mode. &lt;br/&gt;The primary motivation
is the presence of large intraseasonal fluctuations in currents, mixed layer
depth and upper ocean temperature in the Indian Ocean. It is hoped that a better
understanding of the processes involved will be useful for unraveling some of
the questions about how regional climate is
determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical simulations will be made with the
ocean component of the National Center for Atmospheric Rresearch's climate
system model. From a diagnostic study of the comparison of the response of the
Indian Ocean to quasi-realistic forcing with and without intraseasonal
variability, the nature of the response, and the processes responsible for it,
will be determined. Numerical solutions will also be compared to data from the
JASMINE and WOCE field experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
