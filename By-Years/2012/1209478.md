This action funds Michael Adan Caballero of Colorado State University to conduct
a research project, entitled "Determining the origin of secreted fatty acids in
a biofuel cyanobacterium," during the summer of 2012 at The University of Tokyo
in Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Naoki Sato.

The cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been engineered to overproduce
and export fatty acids, potentially revolutionizing the economics of algal
biofuels. This research uses carbon-labeling to determine the source of these
fatty acids, hypothesized to originate from either the fatty acid synthase or
membrane lipids. It is part of the global effort of developing sustainable
bioenergy.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
