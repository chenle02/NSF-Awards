The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in the fall of 1982
under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported 2-4 regional meetings per year of
1-2 days' duration since then. These meetings are held at various locations and
cover a broad spectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on
complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure
and applied model theory, proof theory, recursion theory/computability theory,
set theory, subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman
and S. Simpson, and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the
expenses of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate students.

Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the vitality of the field
of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing the participation
of younger researchers and members of traditionally underrepresented groups,
especially women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which all
interested persons are invited to contribute and in which there are lectures on
current topics of research.
