Numerous researchers have sought to reformulate in game-theoretic terms the
explicit rationalism of the Realist view of balance of power politics in
international affairs. However, they fail to consider two important features of
the balance of power politics: first, the games which nations play are
sequential, and second, the outcomes of initial plays can affect profoundly the
strategic character of subsequent games. This research will offer a model of
balance of power politics which corresponds to the Realist view of international
affairs - - specifically, of nation states which bargain to secure advantage in
the overall distribution of some fixed supply of resources. This bargaining may,
of course, lead to the eventual elimination of countries, but systems in which
the investigators predict, on the basis of a version of the bargaining set
appropriate to this scenario, that no country will be eliminated are termed
"system-stable." In this game theoretic modeling exercise the investigator seeks
to include war costs into the model and to establish the necessary and
sufficient conditions for an international system to be system stable. The
research also seeks a generalization of the analysis in which assumptions about
costs are more general. Finally, the investigator will complete the acquisition
of data relating to coalitions and conflicts during the Warring States period of
China, and the development of appropriate indirect measures of resource
capabilities for an analysis of the coalitional structures observed over time.
