ABSTRACT OCE-9618729 / OCE-9701681 Chemical oceanographers and marine
microbiologists have known for some time now that trace metals in seawater
affect ocean phytoplankton and bacteria differently depending upon the
concentrations actual chemical forms, or species, in which the trace metal is
present. Similarly, it is also known that such organisms are capable of
secreting complexating agents that change trace metal speciation, making them
more or less assimilable and more or less toxic. It is known that the very low
concentrations at which trace metals are present in surface waters of the
central ocean gyres may limit biological production, as has been demonstrated
recently for iron. In this project, investigators from the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will
study these phenomena as a two-way street: water column trace metals affecting
oceanic microbial communities and oceanic microbial communities affecting the
water column trace metal chemistry. The studies will involve field (Sargasso
Sea) and laboratory studies with two species of cyanobacteria and their
biogeochemical relationship with cobalt, iron, and copper in the water column.
The primary emphasis will be on cobalt because of its importance as a
micronutrient and because so little is know about its chemical speciation in the
oceanic environment.
