9512594 Stubbs Silicon technology has revolutionized astronomy by giving us near
perfect CCD light detectors that have very high quantum efficiency and linearity
compared to the old standard: photographic plates. However, individual CCD
detectors are very small compared to photographic plates and cover only a small
amount of sky so that most of the light gathered by the telescope mirror is
wasted. This program will develop a powerful wide-field CCD camera system for
the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5 meter telescope that will be as large as
any yet built (67 million pixels), and will have state-of- the-art read-outs and
data processing capability. This versatile instrument will make possible a wide
range of astrophysical observing programs, particularly those that attack
pressing open questions in observational cosmology such as: How fast is the
universe expanding?; Will this expansion continue forever?; what is the nature
and distribution of the dark matter that is the gravitationally dominant
component of the universe?; and What is the role of particle physics in the
birth and evolution of the universe? ***
