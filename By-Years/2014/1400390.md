This research project is in the field of algebraic geometry with some
connections to string theory and noncommutative geometry. Algebraic geometry is
a branch of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial
equations and related mathematical structures. In classical algebraic geometry
one associates with such geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) a space
of functions that is a commutative ring. In this research project, more
sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as
A-infinity algebras and derived categories of sheaves, will be studied.

The research project will focus on the following topics: 1) A-infinity
structures associated with curves and their relation to the moduli spaces of
curves, 2) Semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived categories of equivariant
sheaves for finite group actions, 3) Cohomological field theories associated
with quasihomogeneous polynomials, 4) Sheaves on NC-thickenings and a
characterization of Jacobians. The first project is about some A-infinity
algebras associated with curves with marked points. The research will study
normal forms of these A-infinity algebras up to homotopy and to relate them to
the moduli spaces of curves. In the second project a construction of a canonical
semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived category of equivariant coherent
sheaves for some actions of finite reflection groups is outlined and will be
studied. The third project is concerned with applications of categories of
matrix factorizations with computation in the cohomological field theories
attached to quasihomogeneous polynomials with isolated singularities. The fourth
project focuses on which coherent sheaves on an abelian variety can be extended
to a noncommutative thickening, which is a quantization of the Poisson envelope
of the sheaf of regular functions. This may lead to a new characterization of
Jacobians of curves.
