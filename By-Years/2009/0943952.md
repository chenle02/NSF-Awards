The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network, first commenced in 1978,
is the most extensive meteorological observing system on the Antarctic
continent, approaching its 30th year at many of its key sites. Its prime focus
as a long term observational record is vital to the measurement of the near
surface climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS units measure air-
temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of
3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be
taken. Observational data from the AWS are collected via the DCS Argos system
aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available
globally, in near real time via the GTS (Global Telecommunications System), to
operational and synoptic weather forecasters. The surface observations from the
AWS network also are often used to check on satellite and remote sensing
observations, and the simulations of Global Climate Models (GCMs). Research
instances of its use in this project include continued development of the
climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere and surface wind studies of the Ross Ice
Shelf.

The AWS observations benefit the broader earth system science community,
supporting research activities ranging from paleoclimate studies to penguin
phenology.
