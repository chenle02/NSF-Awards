9351831 Olowin A non-science major Introductory Astronomy Laboratory is being
equipped for on-going laboratory experience for undergraduate students. An
ensemble of telescopes and accessories enhance and extend the direct experience
undergraduates have with the sky. Students have the opportunity to observe and
measure celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, stars, bright clusters,
nebulae and galaxies directly as well as photograph, measure, and analyze
starlight for its composition, intensity, and time variations. Six new 8"
telescopes, each equipped with a filar micrometer, a simple spectroscope, and a
photometer, are used to augment observational work in the laboratory to a
greater degree than was previously possible. Two large-aperture Dobsonian
instruments complement the smaller aperture suite to allow students to observe
deep-sky objects in a hands-on, cost- effective manner. The new telescopes not
only greatly enhance existing and planned curricular offerings at Saint Mary's
College, but also serve as a community resource for primary and secondary school
training as well as a vehicle for public viewing nights and programs offered
through local community centers. ***
