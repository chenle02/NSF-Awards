ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joshua U. Otaigbe &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Iowa
State University &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0122925&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to enable the principal
investigator (PI) to explore the feasibility of reactive extrusion based on the
fast anionic ring-opening polymerization of cyclic amides in a matrix of a
commercial polymer such as polypropylene (PP), to yield a nanostructured
PP/polyamide 6 blend with unique properties. "Nanostructured" is used because
the dispersion of one polymer phase in the other is below 100 nanometers. The
research is to demonstrate proof of concept of generating these structures in
reactive extrusion using ring-opening polymerization of cyclic amides. The
potential versatility of the nanostructures polymer blends will make them useful
in applications such as optics, drug delivery, tissue engineering and permeable
membranes for separation phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blending of polymers is
one method used to obtain new polymeric materials. Over 30% of commercial
polymers used worldwide are polymer bends or alloys. An example is acrylonitrile
copolymer and polybudatiene grafted styrene-acrylontitrile copolymer. The
evolution of morphology during melt blending of a polymer blend is poorly
understood and the ability to predict this morphological evolution is a goal of
this project.&lt;br/&gt;
