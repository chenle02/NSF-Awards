9630957 Bahr Production of healthy eggs or oocytes is a crucial process for the
regeneration of the species. The oocyte and its surrounding ovarian cells in the
ovary constitute the reproductive unit called the follicle. Female organisms
invest enormous energy to maintain the growth and development of the follicles.
It is logical to assume that a follicle without an oocyte will be eliminated by
the body since the follicle loses the potential to provide a healthy oocyte
which will develop into an individual after fertilization. However, there is no
scientific evidence to support this assumption. Dr. Bahr have proposed a series
of experiments to investigate the role of the oocyte on the growth and
development of follicle using the chicken as the animal model. In the chicken,
the oocyte and cells associated with it is called the germinal disc region
(GDR). The first question asked is: will the chicken follicle keep growing or
will it die after the GDR is destroyed? If the follicle dies, what is the
mechanism underlying it. The second question is: if the chicken follicle dies
after GDR destruction, is the replacement of the GDR able to rescue the
follicle? Because of the limitations of living animal experiments, Dr. Bahr will
conduct this experiment in a tissue culture system mimicking the physiological
condition. The last question is: what does the GDR produce that can maintain the
growth of the follicle? She will characterize the factor(s) produced by the GDR.
The proposed experiments will provide valuable information regarding the role of
the oocyte in follicular development and therefore the reproductive success of
individual. Because of the similarities in function between the avian germinal
disc and the oocyte of other species, it is anticipated that these studies will
extend understanding of the control of follicular development in variety of
species.
