The project is enhancing the course content in undergraduate organic chemistry
laboratories by the addition of an NMR to the Organic Chemistry laboratory.
Implementation of this project involved the purchase of a Varian EM 360L 60 MHz
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (NMR). Students are having direct hands-
on experience using this instrument and are acquiring skill in interpreting NMR
spectra. After completing an experiment designed to introduce the techniques of
NMR, students continue to use NMR in subsequent experiments to verify the
structures of the products of synthetic reactions. Students are also using NMR
to analyze product ratios in an experiment where a mixture of products is
obtained. In addition, extensive use of NMR is being made during a unit on
organic qualitative analysis. The addition of NMR to the Organic Chemistry
laboratory course is giving students an understanding of this very important
analytical technique which is now an essential feature of modern organic
chemistry. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
