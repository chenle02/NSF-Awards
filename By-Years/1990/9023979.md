The focus of this research system level design tools, and it is being conducted
within the ADAM project at USC. Tools include a partitioner, a simulator-
verifier, a multi-processor synthesizer, software for making hardware-software
tradeoffs, memory hierarchy design tools, bus selection software, and a system-
wide scheduler. The first research task is to make available to the CAD design
community recently developed system level tools. To do this, user interfaces are
being constructed, and the tools integrated into a CAD framework. Second is to
explore new research topics: a high level synthesis tool to configure neural
chips from specified behavior, use of artificial intelligence techniques to meet
conflicting design goals and constraints, and a study of the mechanical-
electrical interface. Third, formal models of the system design process are
being explored. This grant is made under the Faculty Awards for Women Scientists
and Engineers Program.
