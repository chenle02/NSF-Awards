The focus of this research if the time-resolved infrared (TRIR) studies of
organic reactive intermediates. TRIR spectroscopy will be used to examine the
structure and reactivity of biradicals, carbenes, nitrenium ions and the excited
states of ketones and enones. The experimental approach, coupled with
computational methods, will enhance basic understanding and will address
specific unresolved issues in reactive intermediate chemistry. With this Faculty
Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. John P.
Toscano of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. Professor
Toscano will focus his research efforts on the time-resolved infrared studies of
organic reactive intermediates. The structural information gained from the
research will be used to clearly define, interpret and understand the reactivity
of a variety of important photo-generated species. The educational activities
are focused on outreach at the K-12 level, undergraduate research and on forming
research connections with faculty at undergraduate teaching institutions.
