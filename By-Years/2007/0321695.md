This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue
developing a method for incorporating Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) into
nylon to act as reinforcement. Their incorporation will be achieved by wrapping
the SWNTs with a functionalized polymer that interacts with the SWNTs
mechanically, but is not chemically bound to them. The polymer will be
chemically bound to the nylon and in this way will act as a load transferring
conduit between the nylon matrix and nanotubes in the final composite. How well
the polymer transfers the extraordinary strength and durability of the carbon
nanotubes to the nylon composite will depend on how well this new interface,
between the SWNT and the nylon matrix, functions. For nylon fibers, the degree
to which it is possible to align the SWNTs along the major axis of the fiber
filaments will play a role in the fiber's thermal and electrical conductivity as
well as strength. The primary focus of this work is to optimize the SWNT/nylon
matrix interaction in order to obtain the best load transfer properties. Methods
to align the SWNTs along the long axis of the nylon filaments in order to
maximize fiber strength will also be investigated.

Commercially, this high strength nylon composite will have significant
applications in the aerospace industry for use in fabricating lightweight,
retrievable, satellite launch vehicles, reusable space craft etc. The military
will also be interested in this technology because of the combination of
exceptionally high strength, lightweight and stealth capability. The successful
development of this technology will result in new lightweight thermoplastic
composites that have extraordinarily high flexural, tensile and impact strengths
and can be easily molded into any shape desired. This new technology will
eventually be applicable to many other materials. Additionally, since these
composites are thermoplastics and not a thermosets, they will be more easily
recycled.
