In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
program of the Chemistry Division and co-funded by the Office of International
Science and Engineering, Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at
Boulder will develop approaches to two-dimensional Fourier transform femtosecond
spectroscopy with pulses approaching octave (factor of 2) frequency spans in the
optical and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The project
includes an international collaboration to use pulsed laser sources developed in
the laboratory of Jens Biegert at ICFO (Spain). Femtosecond spectroscopy will be
used to study the electronic and vibrational dynamics at conical intersections
in two classes of molecules: phthalocyanines, where the temperature dependence
of dynamics at conical intersections can test theoretical predictions about the
role of vibrational wavepacket width; and carotenoids, which play diverse and
not yet mechanistically understood roles in protecting many biological systems
from excess sunlight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that the approaches to
two-dimensional spectroscopy developed in this project will become useful for
determining how electronic motions both drive and are driven by atomic
rearrangements in chemical reactions. Graduate students and a postdoctoral
researcher participating in the project will be trained in scientific research,
gain valuable experience in international collaboration, and present project
results at national meetings of scientific professional societies and
international interdisciplinary conferences.
