9508229 TALWANI This research is to test the existence of a recently proposed
400-km-long, north northeast-trending fault system, which is postulated to
extend through the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas and Virginia, by acquiring
four 8- to 10-km-long high-resolution seismic reflection profiles across its
trend in South Carolina. The objective of the profiling is to seek evidence of
possible offsets in a basalt flow (about 600-800 m depth) Jurassic in age and in
overlying sedimentary layers across its trend. A team from the University of
Kansas will acquire and process the data. The proposed fault system is a
candidate for the causal fault of the 1886 Charleston, S.C., earthquake. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
