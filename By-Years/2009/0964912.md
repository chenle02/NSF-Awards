The goal of the Strengthening Undergraduate Curriculum and Community to Engage
Science Students (SUCCESS) Program is to increase the recruitment, retention,
and graduation rates of financially needy but academically talented students
majoring in Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Biology with Chemistry Minor. The
program provides two cohorts of 8-12 students with yearly scholarships for four
years of study each as well as an academic, professional, and social program
targeted specifically for the scholars. Specifically, the SUCCESS Program has
three objectives: 1) increase persistence and graduation rates of the targeted
majors; 2) improve the readiness of graduates to successfully enter either the
workforce or continue their studies in graduate school; and 3) increase the
number of educated workforce in areas of technical need, with a particular
emphasis on increasing the number of underrepresented groups.
