The research objective of this award is to develop understanding (analytical
results, numerical algorithms) of the extent information on individual
customers/servers can contribute to better system performance. Standard queuing
models are based on averages - that is, personalized information is lacking from
classical protocols which are oblivious to when exactly will the next arrival
happen, or who is the least patient among the customers waiting to be served, or
who is the fastest server among those available to serve. However, in many
applications, the system operator might have or might acquire information on
individual customers/servers. The focus of this project is on a practically
relevant case of partial information, where knowledge about individual
realizations is noisy. The main paradigm is thus the tradeoff between
information availability and performance. The research approach is based on an
asymptotic framework that allows one to analyze tradeoffs in many-server
systems.

If successful, the results of this research provide an opportunity to improve
efficiency of various service systems from telephone call centers to complex
outpatient clinics. Indeed, existing IT systems can be used to obtain
information about individual customers/servers, and incorporate that information
into decision-making. While the "personalized" medicine paradigm aims to tailor
medical decisions to the individual patient, the results of this research will
aid in tailoring operational decisions to specific patients by use of patient-
specific information. This will lead to better patient satisfaction, more
efficient utilization of resources, and lower cost of medical care. Graduate and
undergraduate students will benefit from this award through lectures and
involvement in research.
