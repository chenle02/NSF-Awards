EAR-0444183&lt;br/&gt;Smyth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray detector technology for
material structure studies has improved dramatically in the past decade. This is
a project to upgrade the existing single-crystal X-ray diffraction system with a
two-dimensional detector (CCD) and an X-ray guide device, and to adapt a second
P4 diffractometer to the existing 18KW rotating anode source. The upgrades
include a Bruker 62 mm square SMART-APEX CCD X-ray detector, an X-ray guide and
fine focus anodes to increase X-ray flux at the sample, and adaptation of a
second P4 diffractometer, recently acquired as a gift, to the rotating-anode
source. The proposed upgrades will allow us to extend the pressure limits for
equation of state measurements by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and reduce
the sample size limit and data collection times for structure determinations of
experimentally produced samples. The CCD detector will also permit high pressure
powder diffraction studies to complement our equation of state studies at
synchrotron facilities. Upgrading this facility will facilitate the training of
research students in mineral crystallography as well as high pressure laboratory
methods and powder diffraction in support of on-going projects at national
research facilities such as synchrotrons at APS, ALS, and NLS and neutron
diffraction facilities at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The
upgrade will also benefit other small-molecule crystallographic research efforts
in the Rocky Mountain Region.&lt;br/&gt;
