This collaborative project between a statistician and a biophysical chemist
will refine and extend analyses of spectroscopic data. Spectroscopy is the
measurement of the absorption or emission of particles from a specimen. The
fluorescence spectra of proteins are highly sensitive to many different
elements, and are frequently severely overlapping. The novel feature of the
spectroscopic data is its high signal-to- noise ratio. The new statistical
techniques will make use of the special features of the data and address the
analysis to specific questions of interest. In standard factor analysis, the
expectation of the response variable is assumed to be a linear function of
unknown parameters. The nature of the spectroscopic data make it necessary to
use non-linear functions of the parameters.
