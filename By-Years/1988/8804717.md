The Llano Uplift of central Texas records middle Proterozoic tectonism and
metamorphism that has not been overprinted by subsequent events, unlike other
Grenville-aged provinces in Canada and the Appalachians. This project will
concentrate on U-Pb geochronometry integrated with field, petrographic, and
analytical data constraining the timing of sequential deformational, meta-
morphic and intrusive events will test several current hypotheses of the
tectonic setting of the Precambrian margin of North America. Results of this
study of the Llano Uplift are expected to be applicable to understanding the
evolution of the Grenville orogen along the entire margin.
