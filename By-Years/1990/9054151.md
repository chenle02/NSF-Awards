A three-week workshop is being offered for individuals who teach introductory
astronomy courses but whose professional training is in another field. The 20
participants are being exposed to (1) observing with astronomical telescopes;
(2) devices, including portable equipment, that can be used to stimulate student
interest in the cosmos; (3) a variety of additional activities that illustrate
the methods of astronomy and that can be used to enhance undergraduate teaching
programs. Participants reside on Tufts' residential campus in Medford,
Massachusetts, and have access to the facilities of the Witin Observatory of
Wellesley College, some 20 miles distant, for observing sessions. A large
portion of the remainder of the time is being devoted to involving participants
in the types of "laboratory" exercises they might use with their students. Other
activities will include a field trip to a nearby radio observatory; discussion
of classroom techniques; and discussions of current research in relevant fields.
