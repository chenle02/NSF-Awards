"Deep-Tow Surveys of Atlantic Diapirs and Carbonate Escarpments: Geomorpholgy,
Geochemical Processes and Geological Consequences" Earlier work by Paull and
others along the West Florida Escarpment discovered cold water brine seeps that
(1) support chemosynthesis in isolated biologic communities; and (2) contribute
to erosion at the base of the carbonate platform. Evidence is mounting that the
spectacular discharge of hot vent waters along spreading ridges may be
volumetrically dwarfed by discharge along continental margins. In this proposal
the PI plans to use Deep-Tow to extend investigations of suspected brine seeps
to the eastern side of Florida. Two regions will be surveyed: a diapir on the
continental rise off Georgia, and the base of the Blake-Bahama Escarpment. The
diapir breaches the seafloor, and will be examined (1) to establish the
chemistry of pore fluids and sediments brought to the seafloor, and (2) to
determine the effects of this discharge on local erosion and biology. The nature
of erosion will be examined along the precipitous Blake-Bahama Escarpment, and
the possible contributions of tectonic, bottom current, and chemical destruction
will be evaluated.
