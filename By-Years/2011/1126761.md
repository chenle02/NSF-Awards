There are a growing number of hydrologic models with fully 2D and 3D
formulations that seek to combine surface and subsurface flow. These complex
models fall into two broad categories: integrated and coupled, with about ten of
these models available. Additionally, many of these models are coupled to land-
surface energy balances, biogeochemical and ecological process models and to
atmospheric models. While there is an increasing need and application for large
scale, complex models of environmental function for hydrologic prediction and
environmental understanding, no formal verification and/or benchmarking of these
models has been performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will gather many
of the authors of these coupled, integrated environmental models for a first-of-
a-kind model intercomparison. The workshop will perform a suite of benchmarking
problems with each model and will run a series of idealized problems that
emphasize and identify various model components and interactions. The
benchmarking problems can then be used in subsequent future benchmarking
intercomparison exercises and will be provided freely to anyone in the
hydrologic community. This intercomparison will be published in a peer reviewed
journal.
