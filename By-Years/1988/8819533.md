The Antarctic winter season is a critical period in the life-histories of much
of the pelagic community, and the relation of the pelagic biota to the winter
ice edge is unexplored. The composition, abundance, and vertical and horizontal
structure of the micronekton and zooplankton communities in the vicinity of a
marginal ice zone was examined during the austral winter, 1988, using midwater
trawling techniques and vertical net tows. Sampling was conducted in the upper
1000m of the water column in the open water, marginal ice zone, and pack-ice
dominated communities. In addition, the feeding patterns of all major species
were studied through direct analysis of diet, metabolism of all species through
direct analysis of oxygen consumption rate, and their proximate and elemental
composition. The resultant data gives a complete spectrum of response to the
winter season and the winter ice edge, from the physiology and chemical make-up
of the individuals to the vertical and horizontal structure of the zooplankton
and micronekton communities. This award will allow for the complete analysis of
all data sets.
