Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405707&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Erwin Lutwak, Deane Yang, Gaoyong Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project continues a long term program to develop extensions&lt;br/&gt;and duals
of the Brunn-Minkowski theory, which lies at the very&lt;br/&gt;core of convex
geometric analysis. This includes ongoing&lt;br/&gt;investigations of the
partial differential equations that arise&lt;br/&gt;in these extensions.
Generalizations of affine functionals&lt;br/&gt;associated with convex bodies
are another central focus of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed work. A large part of the
project concerns establishing&lt;br/&gt;sharp affine isoperimetric isoperimetric
inequalities and related&lt;br/&gt;analytic inequalities. The investigators will
also continue their&lt;br/&gt;efforts to understand better the connections
between affine&lt;br/&gt;convex geometric analysis and information
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has potential for broader impact in
many areas of&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, because it deals with when and
how can&lt;br/&gt;one reconstruct or approximate a geometric object from a
limited&lt;br/&gt;number of geometric measurements. This is the central
question&lt;br/&gt;in many practical endeavors ranging from computer vision
to&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging. Some of the questions being studied by
the&lt;br/&gt;investigators are sufficiently concrete that they can
be&lt;br/&gt;explained to and investigated by graduate, undergraduate,
and&lt;br/&gt;even high school students.&lt;br/&gt;
