This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the development of a
research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In
particular the mathematician(s) and the GEO scientist research will focus their
attention on the statistical and scientific analysis of records arising from ice
cores taken from the Greenland ice sheet. The two-phase interdisciplinary
research will begin with the development of scientifically and statistically
valid exploratory and confirmatory statistical techniques for assessing the
record of the paleoclimate as recorded in the Greenland ice sheet. The second
phase will address the development of mathematical models relating the
environmental signals deposited in polar ice sheets to important paleoclimate
factors. This project presents significant mathematical and statistical
challenges to provide geoscientists with tools to be applied to the task of
understanding the approximately 200,000 years od Earth's climatic history.
