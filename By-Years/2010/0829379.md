This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal, explores the
possibility of utilizing the innate properties of nano-sized particles to
process a material via manipulation of internal nanoparticles using an external
force (e.g. an applied field). In particular, two hypotheses are postulated: 1)
the plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles excited by exposure to visible
light can be used as a source of localized heat (local changes of up to 100 C)
for processing purposes and 2) that an AC electric field can be used to induce
nanoparticle electromigration such that composite electrical properties are
improved (e.g. an increase in conductivity or decrease in critical volume
fraction).

A fundamental understanding of the effects of phasmon-mediated heating and
electromigration of dispersed nanoparticulates could be used to post-process a
sample by locally heating each nanoparticle and then applying an AC electric
field to induce minute changes in the nanoparticle positions such that the net
composite conductivity is increased. Such effects could ultimately be used for
tasks such as bonding of nanofibers, activating actuator motion in temperature-
sensitive shape memory polymers, and other functionalities.
