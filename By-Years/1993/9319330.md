9319330 Bradshaw Support is provided for two international workshops that will
develop work plans for defining the causes and effects of global scale
environmental change. The workshops are to he held under the auspices of the
Inter-American Institute for Global Change (IAI). IAI scientists have determined
that studying temperate terrestrial ecosystems is a high priority because of
their ecological, economic, and sociological importance. Environmental research
is needed to define similarities and differences between North and South America
temperate terrestrial ecosystems with regard to global change patterns and
processes. An existing IAI working group known as America's Interhemisphere Geo-
biosphere Organization (AMIGO) will conduct an initial workshop to develop a
work plan for studying these ecosystems, and a second workshop will focus on
implementation of the workplan. This project is being run in cooperation with
NOAA's Global Change Research Program. ***
