Abstract EEC-9612305 Thomas The power industry must undertake a managed
redesign of the nations' power system so that is can adopt to rapid changes in
the power requirements and economic conditions. This planning grant is studying
the feasibility of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Power
Systems Engineering to address the research needed to create the tools and
models to aid in the technical design of a future high-performance electric
power systems. The Center is envisioned to be a multi university consortium
headquartered in Cornell University and involving the University of California
at Berkeley, the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Madison,
and Howard University. The proposed research agenda addresses: 1) Real-Time
Control: The Role of Data Calibration; 2) Pserc Flagship Project: Simulation
Tools for Analysis of Alternative paradigms for the new Electric Business; and
3) Power Web: Ann Internet Platform Simulating Competitive Bidding for Unit
Commitment and Schedule.
