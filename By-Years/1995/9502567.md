9502567 Strganac This is a career award for young engineering investigators. A
program of research and associated education is undertaken which examines the
dynamic interaction of fluids, structures, and control systems are insufficient
because these systems inherently contain structural and flow-induced
nonlinearities. The nonlinearities result from unsteady flow sources, large
strain-displacement conditions, and partial loss of structural or control
integrity, and, as a consequence, these systems exhibit nonlinear dynamic
response characteristics such as limit cycle oscillations, internal resonances,
and chaotic motions. This project consists of both theoretical and experimental
elements. Research objectives include the development of an analytical model for
the nonlinear fluid-structure-control system, the development of adaptive
control models for the fluid-structure- control system with time-varying
distributed parameters, and the supporting investigation through several
experiments developed to substantiate and improve the theoretical models. Two
analytical models will be used as a basis for the theoretical research: a
nonlinear aeroelastic system constrained to finite modes of motion, and is a
structural system exposed to fluid flow and distributed damage of the control
system. Experiments will be carried out to investigate the active control with
distributed actuators and the adaptive control of time-varying control systems.
Innovative methods to measure and identify system characteristics and stability
behavior will also be explored. ***
