9322164 Gegenheimer This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry
at The University of Kansas to support a Summer Research Experience for
Undergraduates in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a program for 10 weeks in
the summer of 1994. Recognizing the pivotal role of independent laboratory
research in students' decisions to make a commitment to research careers in the
biological sciences, this opportunity will be provided to students from colleges
with limited research opportunities, and to members of groups traditionally
underrepresented in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology. The
program focuses on several overlapping areas of biochemistry and molecular
biology, principally protein structure and function, enzyme mechanisms, and
protein engineering; proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure; the structure,
function, and regulation of membrane proteins--receptors, ion channels and ion
transporters--and of their genes; and molecular developmental biology. To
maximize the unique opportunities offered at The University of Kansas, students
will be involved in several collaborative projects combining classical protein
structure analysis, genetic engineering and physical biochemical approaches.
Early hands-on experience with these powerful techniques in a carefully
controlled environment awakens students' excitement. This experience will
provide the students with an inside view of these areas of biochemistry and
molecular biology that may previously have seemed inaccessible to them. ***
