This program addresses the relationship between the vertical eddy diffusion
coefficient and environmental conditions by developing a profiling CTD system
for rapid sampling aboard R/P FLIP. An existing CTD will be modified to enable
high resolution profiles to be made to measure small scale overturns. These will
be related to the eddy diffusion coefficient to determine the latter's
dependence on depth, and Brunt-Vaisala frequency. A major deployment from FLIP
is planned in the second year. It should result in thousands of profiles for
analysis of mixing processes.
