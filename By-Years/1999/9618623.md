AST-9618623 Chemistry of the Galactic Bulge. Dr. McWilliam will analyze spectra
of 100 K giant stars in the bulge of the Galaxy in order to address the
following questions: What is the average Fe/H ratio of giant stars in the
Galactic bulge? Is this ratio similar to the solar neighborhood indicating no
radial abundance gradient in the Galaxy's disk or is it higher than the solar
neighborhood, suggestive of a gradient? Is the formation timescale of the bulge
less than 1 billion years or is it closer to 4-5 billion years? Which type of
supernova was the dominant contributor to the chemical enrichment of the bulge?
