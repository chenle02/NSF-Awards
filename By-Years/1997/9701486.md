9701486 Zhang Researchers at RPI will extend electro-optic sampling techniques
to free space applications for the first time. This technique allows
characterization of freely propagating electromagnetic waves using a transverse
electro-optic sensor. These sensors are suitable for real-time, video rate, 2-D,
subpicosecond far-infrared imaging applications, such as realtime THz imaging of
moving or in vivo objects. ***
