The brightness and colors of stars are fundamental data in studying the
structure, size and age of the Universe, and in testing theories of stellar
structure and evolution. But such measurements can be degraded by large
systematic errors; current state-of-the- art techniques are less accurate than
often sopposed, leaving basic astrophysical conclusions open to question. A
fundamental barrier to further progress is that existing photometric systems
violate a basic requirement of information theory, the sampling theorem. This
award will support the development of a correctly sampled photometric system,
and demostrate that it produces results of greatly improved accuracy, not only
reaching the accuracy that was expected of undersampled systems in the past, and
needed for general astrophysical work, but even surpassing this and making new
investigations possible. Because correctly-sampled photometry can be reduced to
a standard system without loss of accuracy, regardless of detector type, such
data taken with all detectors will transform to a common system without
systematic errors. This technique may let ground-based observers match the Space
Telescope filter systems to arbitrary accuracy, which cannot be done with
conventional methods.
