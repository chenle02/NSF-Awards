The thyroid gland produces several hormones which, like all hormones, are
released into the blood in which they are carried to their sites of action in
other parts of the body. The rate of secretion of these hormones is regulated
primarily by another hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. In
addition, it has very recently been recognized that thyroid nerves may also play
some role in regulating several aspects of thyroid hormones. Recent preliminary
studies in the PIs' laboratory and elsewhere indicate that these neuropeptides
have dramatic effects on thyroid blood flow and thyroid hormone secretion. The
present experiments are designed to determine the physiological significance and
the endogenous neuropeptides occurring in the thyroid nerves. One part of this
project consists of experiments in which the effectiveness of endogenous pools
of neuropeptides play a physiological role in regulating normal thyroid
function. In the second part of this project, changes in thyroid blood flow
and/or thyroid hormone secretion will be induced followed by the determination
of whether there are associated changes in the size or the rate of turnover of
the endogenous neuropeptide pools. Such changes would also support the notion
that these peptides are important in the normal regulation of thyroid function.
The neuropeptides studied in this project are known to occur in many normal
tissues and numerous tumors, but very little is yet known of their functional
importance.
