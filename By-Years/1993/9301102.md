9301102 Vitek This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will support
the collaboration of Vaclav Vitek of the University of Pennsylvania and Ana
Maria Monti and Roberto Pasianot of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA)
in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The project aims to conduct atomistic studies of
grain boundaries and interphases and interaction of these interfaces with point
defects. The researchers will carry out calculations for model hcp, bcc, and
hcp/bcc systems using empirical many-body potentials of the EAM type. The
construction of these potentials is an integral part of the proposed research.
The principal goal is to analyze differences between grain and interphase
boundaries, particularly with respect to the atomic transport in these
interfaces. The interphases studied will be chosen so that they emulate as
closely as possible the interphases in Zr/Zr-Nb systems which have been
extensively studied at CNEA. The Argentine group will conduct the computer
simulations and develop or select of the interatomic potentials. The U.S. side
will provide the computer codes for the atomistic modelling of grain boundaries
and the graphical programs necessary to interpret atomistic calculations. Both
sides will benefit from collaboration on the interpretation and analysis of
data, encompassing the construction of interatomic potentials and their testing
and the computer modeling of interfaces. ***
