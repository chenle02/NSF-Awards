9411564 Martinez There is great interest by neuroscientists, and a tremendous
practical benefit, to understanding how the brain stores information. Previous
research has suggested that memory formation involves protein synthesis and new
patterns of neural gene expression. In this research a model of learning, long-
term potentiation, will be examined in order to probe the genes which may be
switched on, or switched off, when new memories are laid down in the brain. Dr.
Martinez and his colleagues will identify changes in gene expression induced in
a region of the brain called the hippocampus, using the technique of cDNA
subtractive hybridization. These genes will then be cloned so that they can be
analyzed in detail through gene sequencing. The identification of these memory-
related genes should increase our understanding of the cellular and genetic
factors which influence information storage in the nervous system. These studies
should have important implications for problems of learning, and of dealing with
aging-related changes in the brain. ***
