Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBET-1438956&lt;br/&gt;Volker
Sick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop will be held at the University of
Michigan campus (May 19-20, 2014) with experts from around the country and the
world to address the research needs for turbulent combustion that would combine
the state-of-the-art modeling and diagnostic tools so that all models and
submodels can be directly validated by mesaurable qualtities and thus avoid any
ad-hoc and empirical guess work which can often be contradictory to fundamental
physics. The results of the workshop will be written by participants and
published and disseminated.
