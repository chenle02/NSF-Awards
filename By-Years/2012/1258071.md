Programmed cell death (PCD) is found in all eukaryotes and plays critical roles
in important processes such as tissue/organ morphogenesis, elimination of
unwanted/damaged cells, pathogen defense, and stress responses. Metacaspases
belong to a family of specialized cysteine proteases that are found to be highly
conserved regulators of this important process in plants, fungi and protozoa but
their mode of regulation and downstream targets remain obscure in most cases.
This project will carry out genetic and molecular studies aimed at elucidating
the mechanisms by which the activation and desensitization of metacaspases may
be controlled. Furthermore, the investigators will deploy a novel technology to
define the intracellular targets for three different metacaspases in order to
uncover the potential pathways that are regulated by these proteases. In
addition to the direct contributions toward our understanding of PCD regulation
in higher plants, this project will shed light on the mechanisms of how the
conserved metacaspases could be regulated. These advances can facilitate future
design of novel strategies to activate cell death in pathogenic protozoa strains
and fungi, as well as to suppress cell death in crop plants during stresses for
improved productivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results generated from this project
will be communicated to the public via peer-reviewed journals, and the resources
produced, such as new mutant lines and DNA constructs, will be freely shared
with other investigators upon request. From the pedagogical perspective, this
project will provide diversified, interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral
researchers and students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. It will
expose team members to a diverse array of disciplines, including genetics,
genomics, molecular cloning, biochemistry and cell biology. This broad-based
training will provide a rich environment that is conducive to creative
approaches for solving complex problems in biology and for leveraging innovative
technologies for novel solutions.
