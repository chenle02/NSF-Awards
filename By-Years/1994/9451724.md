9451724 Burkhardt Thermal analysis experiments are being incorporated into all
levels of the offered curriculum including general chemistry. The greatest
impact is in the polymer chemistry laboratory which is currently being
redesigned; however, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and undergraduate
research are also benefitting from the new equipment.
