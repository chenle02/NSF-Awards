9306190 Bilham The northward movement of India is responsible both for the Great
height of the Himalayan peaks and for the recurrence of devastating earthquakes
in Asia from northern India to Mongolia. Yet the collision rate and the
distribution of slip among tectonic units in Asia remains to be measured
directly. The PI has established a network of control points in India, Nepal and
China whose remeasurement and analysis will provide velocity estimates of the
large scale processes of north-south convergence and east- west extension. These
numbers will constrain the kinematics of the Tibetan Plateau, and the rate of
strain development responsible for great earthquakes in the Himalaya. In 1993/4
he plans to measure a small geodetic network across the Altyn Tagh fault, the
largest on-land strike slop fault outside California, which will further
constrain deformation rates in Tibet and the Kun Lun Mountains. Elsewhere, by
operating GPS receivers in Nepal and inviting colleagues in India and China to
operate receivers simultaneously on key tectonic units in their countries he is
able to undertake cost effective measurements of large scale Asian tectonics.
