The goal of this project is to develop an "electron gun" to generate hydrogen
directly from sunlight. The physical system consists of a semiconductor coated
by a thin (less than or equal to 50 angstrom) metal layer (e.g., platinum) which
allows most of the light to penetrate through it to the semiconductor. In the
semiconductor, light quanta are absorbed and hole-electron pairs generated. The
electrons will then accelerate through the metal coating out to the surrounding
water and interact to create hydrogen.
