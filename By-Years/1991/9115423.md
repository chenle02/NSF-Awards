A critical factor in data storage technology is coding. Modulation codes are
used to convert the data to a waveform suitable for the storage medium while
error control codes are used to ensure reliability. Most coding schemes are
based on using two independently designed codes, one for error control and the
other for modulation. Although the two codes may each be optimal with regard to
its design goal, the combined code may be far from optimal as an overall code.
The aim of this project is to study combined coding techniques that achieve the
required error control and modulation properties by viewing the two properties
as inseparable. The goal is to develop new codes that are more efficient than
the overall codes currently used and to explore the ultimate limits on
performance which can be obtained by combined coding techniques.
