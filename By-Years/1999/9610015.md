The aim of this research is to devise new methods for automating reasoning via
understanding and exploiting computationally tractable classes of reasoning
tasks. Fundamental to the approach is the hypothesis that intelligent behavior
is accomplished through utilization of idealized models of the task's
environment. To explain how people perform so well on tasks that are
theoretically intractable, we must assume that approximation methods based on
idealized tractable models cover a significant portion of intelligent activity,
and hence such methods should serve as the basis for automated reasoning
systems. A language that has been found useful for modeling and solving
compuationally intensive tasks in artificial intelligence is constraint
networks, and use of these networks. By using idealized tractable models,
constraint networks, and other techniques found useful in this area, it is hoped
that real- life problemq can be solved automatically in reasonable time as well
as humans solve them.
