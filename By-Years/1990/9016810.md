This grant supports Dr. Elitzur's research on projects which share the common
theme of application of radiative transfer techniques for line analysis in
various astronomical environments. The topics include studies of star forming
regions; the envelopes of late-type stars; and photoionized regions, such as the
accretion disks of cataclysmic variable stars. The structure of and physical
conditions in these various astronomical objects will be studieed from their
line emission in the ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio spectral regions.
Dr. Elitzur applies radiative transfer techniques to four specific topics. (1)
The polarization of line radiation provides important information on the
properties of the source where it was generated. A solid theoretical framework
is needed to interpret the observational data. (2) Two of the more prominant
properties of star forming regions are strong maser emission from hydroxyl and
water vapor and powerful outflows of material. The theoretical implications of
both issues are addressed by Dr. Elitzur. (3) In the area of late-type stars a
long range goal of Dr. Elitzur's research is the construction of a coherent
picture for the outer envelopes, where a multitude of interesting effects are
observed. (4) The study of accretion disks has steadily gained importance in the
last few years with the mounting evidence that disks are a common occurrence in
astronomical systems of all scale sizes.
