This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology
student from the University of Arizona. The project will study the cultural
models local people use in dealing with the "troubles" in Northern Ireland
between Catholics and Protestants. Using the methods of ethnography (in-depth
interviews about life histories, participant observation) as well as a small
survey of households, the student will investigate significant processes
underlying ongoing interpretations of conflict among rural Protestants who live
in the border area of County Armagh. The project will add to scholarship on
interpretive aspects of group conflict and the "sectarian divide" between
Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. This research is important
because the roots of such enduring conflict are invariably cultural, reproduced
in the daily household experiences of people as they grow up and live their
lives. Increased understanding of the specific content and forms of conflict
reproduction can help planners and officials design programs to ameliorate the
causes and reduce the strength of the mechanisms that maintain the conflict.
