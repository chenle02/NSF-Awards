A broad range of chemical process engineering problems including systematic
process design, retrofit design, batch scheduling, production planning, facility
layout, and plant startup may be naturally modeled as mixed integer nonlinear
programs (MINLP). Although a large number of models have been published for a
variety of specific situations, practical application of MINLP methods has been
limited because conventional solution techniques are effective only on models of
limited size. An important goal of this long term research program is the
development of highly parallel algorithms for solving MINLP. In particular, this
research seeks to be able to use hundreds of powerful processors to
substantially extend the range of tractability for MINLP. The dramatic increase
in solution capability is critical in incorporating multiple objectives,
realistic physics, flexibility, and robustness into engineering design and
operation models. Three important issues that must be addressed in the course of
developing effective parallel MINLP algorithms are: (1) the systematic
exploitation of problem structure (2) the partitioning of the workload among
processors and (3) the utilization of concurrently available information to
improve algorithm performance. Central to understanding these issues is the
development of special purpose parallel algorithm performance. Central to
understanding these issues is the development of special purpose parallel
algorithms for highly structured integer programs. Research will proceed along
two complementary paths: (1) development of general purpose parallel MINLP
algorithms (2) development of special purpose parallel algorithms for highly
structured integer programs. The underlying goal of both paths is to learn how
to effectively use massive amounts of parallelism while at the same time
exploiting problem specific features.
