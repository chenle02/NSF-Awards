The most abundant metazoans in the open sea are often the earliest developmental
stages of copepods, their nauplii. Nauplii remain under-studied due to the
limitations of conventional techniques and an historical emphasis on studying
the larger mesozooplankton. However, there is increasing recognition that
nauplii play important roles in food web dynamics, and considerable evidence
that nauplii may be important trophic intermediaries between microbial and
classical food webs due to their high abundance, high weight-specific ingestion
rates, and ability to feed on relatively small particles. This team of
investigators is developing a novel molecular approach to studying diverse
populations of nauplii in mixed field samples based on quantitative Polymerase
Chain Reaction (qPCR). They propose to complete development and validation of
this qPCR-based technique for enumeration of nauplii, and evaluate its utility
in the field. The specific objectives of this research are to identify and
reduce technical and biological sources of error in the methodology, determine
the accuracy of the method across a range of environmental conditions, and
complete one paired field experiment that compares the grazing impact of
naupliar and protozoan micro-grazers in a model subtropical coastal ecosystem.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project will include training of
graduate and undergraduate students, inclusion of research results in graduate
and undergraduate courses at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and public
outreach through the web and in public venues. These PIs have a strong track
record of engaging under-represented students in research, and particular
emphasis will be placed on recruiting and training students from under-
represented backgrounds.
