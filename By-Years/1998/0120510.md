ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop: Computational Approaches to Theoretical
Morphology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Douglas Erwin and David M.
Raup&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0120510&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased computer graphics
capability and new software tools has facilitated the development of new
approaches to Theoretical Morphology, the analysis of potential morphologies of
groups of organisms independent of the morphologies which are known from today
or from the fossil record. This workshop will bring together computer
scientists, paleontologists and biologists to develop new theoretical
morphological models. The focus of the workshop will be to further develop a
mathematical model and associated computer simulation of the multi-plate sea
urchin skeleton. The wealth of paleontological, evolutionary and developmental
information about sea urchins makes this an excellent choice for such a model.
Moreover, sea urchin growth involves multiple plates in a close-packing
configuration, which is also true of a number of other groups. At this workshop
we will further develop this sea urchin morphometric model, consider several,
alternative, previously developed models, and consider initial tests of the
model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
