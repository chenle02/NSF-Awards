Professor Gerald Meyer and Dr. Nancy Ryan Gray, on behalf of the Gordon
Conference, are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of
Chemistry to organize a first time Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows in Photochemistry: Solar Photochemistry and
Catalysis. The seminar will be convened for two days in July 2011 immediately
preceding the Gordon Conference on the same subject in Stone Hill College,
Boston, MA. The seminar will give the participating young scientists a chance to
exchange talks and posters, and to be seamlessly integrated into the full Gordon
Conference meeting. Junior scientists entering the important area of solar
photochemistry and catalysis will have an opportunity to present and discuss
their research results with peers and leading experts in the field. The
participation of a diverse group of young scientists in such an activity will
contribute to the development of the future U.S. workforce in this important
area of research that is relevant to energy sustainability.
