The focus of this research is to develop methodology for the preparation of
biologically relevant C-saccharides and C-glycoside analogs of carbohydrate
contining natural products. One approach uses a ring closing metathesis (RCM))
strategy for the preparation of C-1 glycals, which are, in turn, readily
functionalized and transformed into 2-deoxy C-glycosides of 2-gluco-C-
glycosides. A second approach uses an iterative tethering-olefin metathesis
strategy for the preparation of C-oligosaccharides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research activities of Dr. Maarten H. Postema of the Department of Chemistry
at Wayne State University. Professor Postema will focus his work on developing
methodology for the preparation of stable and unique saccharide mimics.
Carbohydrates are an important class of organic structures. When joined at the
cell surface to form oligosaccharides, they play an important role in cellular
recognition, metastasis and adhesion. The stable C-saccharides and C-glycosides
generated by the methodology of this project have implications for the
pharmaceutical industry. The project also presents an attractive venue for the
training of graduates students.
