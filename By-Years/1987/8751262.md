Since its inception in 1982, Project SERAPHIM has achieved great success in its
three main functions: collector and disseminator of microcomputer-related
instructional materials in chemistry; the conduct of workshops to train teachers
to use computers effectively in classrooms and laboratories; and the development
of innovative chemistry software. The project has developed collaborative
efforts with other local and national projects and receives more than $150,000
annually from local school systems which use its materials or teacher
development activities. The project now plans to enhance its dissemination
efforts by preparing "Best of SERAPHIM" learning packets and by developing an
electronic journal that will allow phasing out of its distribution function. New
research and development efforts will include effective, instructive
computerized experiments, a simple and inexpensive voltage interface, instrument
simulators, and programmer's tools for new and existing microcomputers. Although
the existence of microcomputers in precollege classrooms has grown significantly
during the past few years, the creation of effective software has not kept pace.
SERAPHIM is filling a great need in chemistry education through the development
and evaluation of chemistry software. SERAPHIM's teacher development efforts
have resulted in a network of chemistry faculty from both the precollege level
and institutions of higher education, a collaboration which is enhancing
learning in both areas. The project's efforts have demonstrated that the the
microcomputer can be quite effectively used to aid students in learning
chemistry as well as being a motivating factor. The store of quality chemistry
software has benefitted enormously because of the work of SERAPHIM.
