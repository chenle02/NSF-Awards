9706273 Craig The proposed research is on a class of partial differential
equations which are unified by their character as wave equations and by the fact
that they can each be written in the form of a Hamiltonian system. Important
examples of this class are the linear and nonlinear Schroedinger equations, the
nonlinear wave and Klein-Gordon equations, the Korteweg deVries equation, and
the Euler equations governing free surface problems in fluid dynamics. The first
project of the investigator is to consider issues of existence and regularity of
the initial value problem for these equations, and it will continue a study of
KAM tori and other constructions of the principal features of the infinite
dimensional phase space in which these equations are posed. The second project
is an analysis of dispersive linear equations, principally the Schroedinger
equation, addressing details of the local and microlocal regularity of the
fundamental solution and its relationship to the global behavior of
bicharacteristics of the principal symbol. The third research project includes a
special focus on the mathematical analysis of free surface problems of fluid
dynamics. The nonlinear differential equations studied in this project occur in
mathematical physics and engineering in a remarkable variety of settings, from
cosmology to fluid dynamics of the ocean to nonlinear optics. Work in this field
addresses some of the basic characteristics of solutions of these equations,
which is a contribution to our knowledge of the physical world, and which can
contribute in nontrivial ways to developments in advanced technology. This
project also specifically pursues the purely mathematical goal of developing the
beautiful analogy between the theory of classical mechanics of last century and
the modern theory of partial differential equations.
