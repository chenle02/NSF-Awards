The study of symmetry is of fundamental scientific importance. In particular,
many physical theories of the universe and of elementary particles are described
by collections of symmetries called Lie groups. Understanding the spaces on
which these symmetries may act provides important insights into such physical
theories. This project will study surprising connections between number theory,
quantum groups, and mathematical physics that provide a new way of understanding
such spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the investigator and his
students and collaborators will explore matrix coefficients of representations
of p-adic groups and their arithmetic covers, known as metaplectic groups.
Matrix coefficients allow one to extract numerical invariants from
representations. They play a key role in both the construction of automorphic
L-functions and the proofs of their analytic properties, and also in the
determination of scattering amplitudes in string theory. The project will
develop new relations between matrix coefficients, quantum groups, and
statistical mechanics, and new methods to study matrix coefficients using Hecke
algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
