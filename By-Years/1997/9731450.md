Baron, Edward AST-9731450 In a collaborative effort, Dr. Baron of the Univesity
of Oklahoma and Dr. Hauschildt of the University of Georgia will continue their
work of modeling the transport of radiation through a variety of astrophysical
plasmas, with particular attention to supernovae. Their work focuses on applying
the results of their modeling to supernovae and comparing theoretical
predictions with observed data, as well as making continued improvements to
their radiative transport code. Among the goals of their analysis are improving
understanding of the connection between specific classes of supernovae and
stellar evolution models of the progenitor star, and studying the effects of
stellar parameters, such as the metallicity of the progenitor, on the observed
spectrum and light curve and the use of all types of supernovae as distance
indicators.
