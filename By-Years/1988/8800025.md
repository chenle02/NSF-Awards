The formation of deep water masses is a significant high latitude oceanic
process that ventilates the deep waters of the global ocean. It is a process
that is active in the northern marginal seas and in the Arctic Ocean itself.
This project will investigate the rate of ventilation of the Arctic Ocean by
constraining a numerical model of its circulation with observed chemical tracer
data. The tracer data may be used to calibrate and verify the theoretical
description of the circulation that is provided by numerical models, and can
help to define specific processes that are related to the maintenance of the
vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean. One major unresolved question is the
maintenance of the nutrient maximum at the halocline level, which has been
ascribed to the advection of Pacific water through the Bering Strait, and to
nutrient regeneration on the Arctic continental shelves. A second question is
the extent to which Arctic Ocean ventilation is affected by brine formation on
the shelves and its subsequent cascading into deep water at the shelf break. The
particular advantage of chemical tracers in this context is that tracers provide
information and limits on time scales, and so constrain the results (and
increase the level of realism) of models that were designed to reproduce
physical and dynamical processes.
