The topological properties of an algebraic variety (the set of solutions of
some polynomial equations) will be studied in two ways, using structures which
are special to them. First, there are notions of size and distance on the smooth
part of an algebraic variety, inherited from its imbedding in space. Using this,
one defines square-summable functions and, more generally, differential forms on
the smooth part of the variety. The first problem to be studied is to what
extent the periods of these functions or forms are determined by the topological
properties of the variety, in particular, by a topological invariant called "the
intersection homology group." The second problem is to find ways to relate
quantitative measures of the intersection of cycles on the variety with its
local topological properties. These geometrical investigations will not be
confined to the non-singular case, rendering them more difficult, yet more
suitable of application to spaces which arise in theoretical physics and in
other analytic theories.
