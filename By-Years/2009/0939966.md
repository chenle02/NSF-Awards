Automatic summarization of spoken documents (e.g., everyday meetings, broadcast
news, lectures, political speeches) provides an efficient way for information
access in these data sources. Different summarization approaches have been
developed and evaluated for speech data in different domains, such as meetings,
broadcast news, and lectures. However, compared to text summarization, speech
summarization is not as mature. There are no benchmark tests, the evaluation
metrics are not clear, and there are not many annotated data sets available.
Because of the recent increasing interest in speech summarization in the
community, there is a need to gather researchers in the field to discuss various
issues in this task and future research directions. This workshop brings
together researchers dedicated to speech summarization in various aspects, helps
build a research community for this task, and fosters discussions about open
problems, future directions, data collection and sharing, algorithms and
results. The topics discussed include the definition of speech summarization,
data collection and annotation, data sharing, evaluation metrics, possible
shared tasks, domain effect, summarization approaches, similarity and
differences between text and speech summarization, and modality beyond speech in
human communication. The discussions from this meeting will be disseminated
using a dedicated website. This meeting will greatly help move forward the
research in speech summarization. Students participating in this meeting will
benefit from the discussions and be able to use them in their future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
