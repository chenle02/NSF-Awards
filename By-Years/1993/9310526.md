9310526 WALDFOGEL This project will examine the objectives of the bail system
and possible bias in bail by analyzing bail treatment, the likelihood of flight
and danger, and bondsmen's rates in Connecticut in the late 1980's and 1990's.
It has been difficult to determine whether or not there is race discrimination
in the bail system for the reason that bail may be correlated with race because
race may be correlated with some legitimate bail determinant. Research cannot
conclusively determine whether discrimination is occurring unless the researcher
can account for all factors that should affect bail. The project avoids this
problem by directly examining measures of flight (and rearrest) risk, the
outcome(s) that bail seeks to control. The investigators will then compare the
determinants of both flight and rearrest risk. The project will also use data on
bondsmen's rates to perform a market-based evaluation of the bail system. The
project requires data collection, data manipulation and data analysis. The data
will be collected from the Connecticut Judicial Department, the Connecticut Bail
Commission and the Connecticut State Police. All of these data will require
significant computer programming to become machine readable. The three data sets
must also be assembled into a single, coherent data base that will be suitable
for the purposes of the study. Extensive statistical analysis will then be
required to answer the research questions. ***
