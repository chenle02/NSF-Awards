Dr. Ogle is examining the history of a ubiquitous household technology,
plumbing, as a way to document the larger relationship between social and
cultural values and the process of technological change. Americans use more
plumbing and use it more often than virtually any other people in the world.
Clearly, the history of plumbing deserves study because of the role it plays in
our lives and what it illustrates about American culture. Further, the history
of this ubiquitous technology has never before been extensively studied. Dr.
Ogle has found that what was originally seen as a mere convenience became,
through the work of "sanitarians," a necessity. Originally plumbing was not sold
as a technology for hygiene and sanitation but as a "labor saving device."
Because it was a convenience, there was no legal or social pressure to place
running water and water fixtures in every home. Only when Americans began to
fear germs did they treat plumbing as an essential part of household hygiene.
This reaction led first to a rejection of the old plumbing technology which,
sanitarians argued, carried germs through the household because the water was
unsafe and because gases from the household sewer systems were likely to back up
into the house (or explode|). The old technology was replaced by new plumbing
technologies; new health regulations were established to insure the safety of
the systems; and "safe" new municipal water and sewer systems were constructed
to provide a new level of hygiene in the household. Dr. Ogle is examining books
and magazines, patents and newspapers in order to elaborate how changing
cultural values affect technology. She is also examining diaries and household
account books, architectural drawings and municipal documents such as water and
health department reports, sewer permits, and plumbing inspection reports to
provide further documentation of these changes. With all these sources in hand,
she will be able to provide a clear explanation of how and why plumbing
technology was shaped in the United States to take the form it has assumed
today.
