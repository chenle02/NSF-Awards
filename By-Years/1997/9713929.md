In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Jackson will use crossed molecular beams to measure electron
energy distributions from delayed ionization of fullerene metastable states as
well as to study scattering between fullerenes and metastable atoms. Insight
will be gathered on delayed ionization processes in clusters, large molecules,
and systems of restricted size as well as on the formation of endohedral
fullerenes, an important problem in physical as well as organic chemistry.
Fullerenes comprise a class of chemical carbon compounds in which the locations
of the carbon atoms define a nearly spherically shaped geodesic surface. The
1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the discoverers of this new form of
elemental carbon. The generic term `fullerene` now commonly refers both to
atomic clusters of carbon atoms located at the corners of pentagons and hexagons
forming a closed surface as well as to tubular structures, irrespective of the
actual numbers of composing atoms. Fullerenes are found to be unusually stable
and, even though originally thought to be rare in nature, can actually be easily
made. Due to the potential of technological applications, fullerenes are the
subject of intense investigations of their physical, chemical, and material
properties. Their chemical reactivities are not well understood and the purpose
of this fundamental research project is to contribute to the knowledge base of
these systems and thereby help in their eventual exploitation for technological
applications.
