This proposal is for a two day conference/workshop at the National Science
Foundation, Washington,D.C. June 5-6, 1989. The twelve primary participants are
women active in geotechnical engineering, and with the exception of a few women
not attending, represent the total female Ph.D. population in geotechnical
engineering in the U.S. The goals of this workshop are to: Examine the state of
inequality in women representation in civil engineering in general and
geotechnical in paticular, and its relationship with the general issue of women
in science and engineering. Analyze the underlying factors responsible for the
low degree of representation and high distribution of women at undergraduate and
graduate levels in geotechnical engineering, respectively. Analyze what women
are doing and what women can do to reverse this state of affairs. Bring out the
unique perspective of professional women engineers successfully engaged in a
wide variety of graduate teaching and research. Propose working models for
federal agencies as well as academic institutions to solve the problem at hand.
A report of the conference proceedings will be produced.
