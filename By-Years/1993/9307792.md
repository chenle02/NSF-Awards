This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division involves the development of both new and improved
mathematical and computational methods for calculating and predicting quantum
dynamical processes of importance such as gas phase chemical reactions,
intermolecular energy transfer, photodissociation, and surface processes
including adsorption and diffusion. Specific theoretical tools being developed
include extensions of the discrete variable representation and quantum
generalized Langevin equation approaches. %%% Chemical reactions both in the gas
phase and on surfaces are being successfully described by the use of
increasingly sophisticated mathematical models. Several such models are being
developed in this theoretical study, thus aiding our understanding and control
of a number of processes such as combustion, catalysis, and the formation of
molecules and materials.
