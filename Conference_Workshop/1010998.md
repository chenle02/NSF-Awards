This award supports travel for junior researchers and plenary speakers
participating in the "Seventh International Conference on Differential Equations
and Dynamical Systems," held 15-18 December 2010 at the University of South
Florida. The meeting focuses on recent developments in ordinary differential
equations, nonlinear evolution equations, dynamical systems, and applications.
The conference features plenary talks from leaders in these fields, as well as
contributed presentations by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and
junior faculty.

The conference will foster collaborations between junior and senior researchers,
providing recent PhD recipients with opportunities to present their work and to
make contacts with researchers from other institutions. The proceedings of the
conference will be published as a supplemental volume of the Journal of
Nonlinear Systems and Applications. The conference encourages and supports
participation by graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and
minorities.
