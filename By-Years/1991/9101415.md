This project deals with homotopy theory and its applications to several related
areas. Friedlander works on the homotopy type of certain algebraic varieties,
and also studies the representation theory of mod-p Lie algebras and the
cohomology of groups of Lie type. Additionally, he plans to continue his study
of algebraic K-theory. Mahowald works on intrinsic questions in stable and
unstable homotopy theory. His main emphasis is on periodic structures in the
homotopy groups of spheres. Priddy studies relations between modular
representation theory and the stable homotopy type of finite and infinite
groups. The cohomology of groups and stable splittings of classifying spaces are
central to his work. In short, all three investigators are working with highly
sophisticated algebraic tools for studying geometric structures. On the one
hand, they improve our understanding of the tools. On the other hand, they apply
the tools to answer geometric questions about spaces.
