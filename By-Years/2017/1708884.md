The International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) is the
premier annual conference to present and discuss new developments and original
research results in all areas of symbolic mathematical computation. In July
2018, ISSAC will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center in July 2018. This travel
award can defray travel and registration costs for selected US-based students
and post-docs to participate, and for 3 eminent researchers to present
educational tutorials. Selection criteria can be found via http://www.issac-
symposium.org/ several months before the event. The aim is to support junior
researchers, especially researchers who are members of under-represented groups,
to present their innovative ideas and research results and to interact with
their peers, senior colleagues, and researchers from institutions inside and
outside of the U.S.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
