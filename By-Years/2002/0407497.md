&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative effort is between Hunter College CUNY and Rutgers
University under the auspices of the existing Industry/University Cooperative
Research Centers program at Rutgers. The research at Hunter College will provide
NMR spectroscopic support to the materials research efforts at Rutgers,
primarily those involving evaluation of new high capacity amorphous Li ion
cathode materials. A comprehensive program of multinuclear solid state NMR will
be conducted in collaboration with the Rutgers groups; materials synthesis and
characterization performed at Rutgers, and NMR performed at Hunter. One CUNY
doctoral student will be supported to work at both
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
