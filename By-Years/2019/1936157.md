This grant supports travel costs for key speakers, moderators and scientific
committee members to participate in the Stanford Symposium to Accelerate
Progress in AI in Healthcare, taking place September 18-19, 2019. These
participants are research leaders on applications of artificial intelligence
(AI) in healthcare, who will provide fresh thinking across a range of topic
areas addressing AI in healthcare from leaders in science and industry. Each
presentation will be followed by a facilitated panel discussion among
researchers from diverse research environments and disciplines. Compared to AI
research in industries such as transportation, retail and defense, AI research
targeting gains in healthcare quality and efficiency is currently
underdeveloped. The symposium's goal is to accelerate near term scientific
progress in forms of AI that improve clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and
treatment activity in order to improve the performance of US healthcare. This
activity is expected to facilitate progress toward a computer-assisted, rapid
learning healthcare system that can potentially eliminate the gap between
current and optimal efficiency and quality of care. In addition, the symposium
will catalyze new collaborations between researchers, industry leaders and
influencers and thereby accelerate real world testing and
scaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
