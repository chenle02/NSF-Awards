9527192 Taylor The Nanomanupulator (nM) project will investigate the most
powerful and efficient systems, methods and algorithm for applying the high-
performance graphics supercomputer, Pixel-Flow, to the real-time control of
scientific instrumentation. The nM system provides an intuitive interface to
scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), allowing scientists from a variety if
disciplines to examine and manipulate nanometer-scale structures. The nM
displays a high quality rendering of the surface being scanned as the data
arrives in real time. using force-feedback controls, the scientists can feel the
surface representation to enhance understanding of surface properties and can
modify the surface directly. Important proof-of-concept studies have shown that
the nM greatly increases productivity by acting as a translator between
controlled. This project will study issues which will made the nM a more
powerful and accessible tool for the scientific community.
