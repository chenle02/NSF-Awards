A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is organized as part of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Programming
Languages (SIGPLAN) Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL),
which is the flagship conference in the field of programming language theory and
one of the premier conferences in all of computer science. The conference is
held in London, U.K., in 2024. This award supports students to attend the
mentoring workshop in addition to the POPL conference and aims to broaden
participation by students from underrepresented groups, giving priority to US
citizens and permanent residents. The impact of the award relates to broadening
participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in all aspects of programming
languages and systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
