This proposal is divided into three parts. The first one deals with a linkage
problem closely related to the search for ideals having Cohen--Macaulay blowup
algebras. The second one analyzes the comparison between the Cohen-Macaulayness
of the Rees algebra and the one of its associated graded ring. The methods used
to understand this relationship involve a deep study of the necessity of
conditions on the reduction number, which in turn are equivalent to explicit
formulas for the core of an ideal. Whenever such conditions are satisfied, the
PI would like to describe a set of defining equations of the Rees ring. The last
part of the proposal attempts to find numerical conditions that imply lower
bounds on the depth of its associated graded ring.

This is a project in commutstive algebra that is motivated by algebraic
geometry. In general, by studying systems of equations and their structure one
can learn more about geometry. This topic is also suitable for introducing
undergraduates to mainstream research.
