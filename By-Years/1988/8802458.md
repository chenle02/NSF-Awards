This award supports research concerning young stellar objects and especially
their circumstellar disks. What are the disks' masses, shapes, rotation curves,
and particle sizes? The research includes infrared speckle imaging of regions of
ongoing star and planet formation, imaging at millimeter wavelengths,
continuation of infrared spectroscopic observations of molecular and atomic
hydrogen lines, and some theoretical interpretation. Young stars form out of
shrinking clouds of gas and dust. Much gas and dust remains behind, possibly
forming a planetary system. Beckwith has developed the techniques for state-of-
the-art accurate mapping of the gas and dust disks surrounding young stars. He
has already mapped the disk surrounding the star HL Tauri which may resemble our
solar system at the time of its formation. He will use even more refined
techniques to observe the circumstellar materials of other stars in both
infrared and radio wavelengths.
