This project introduces biochemical engineering unit operations into the
Lafayette College curriculum. Three groups of students are affected. All
chemical engineering students learn to operate a computer controlled bioreactor
in their dynamic design course. Those chemical engineering majors interested in
biochemical engineering as a career can perform sequential experiments on all
unit operations common in the biotechnology industry, from growing cells in the
bioreactor, to measuring product formation and enzyme kinetics, to separation
and purification of the final product. Liberal Arts students are introduced to
the intriguing combination of biology and technology by performing simple
experiments in an interdisciplinary course. One of the goals of the project for
chemical engineering students--a substantial number of whom go on to careers in
medicine, biomedical engineering, and the pharmaceutical industry--is for them
to have the opportunity for hands-on experience with equipment and techniques
they are sure to encounter in their professional endeavors.
