Level sets represent a moving interface surface implicitly, which naturally
accommodates singularities and topology changes, but at the expense of a
wasteful volumetric Eulerian representation that provides no control over the
topology of the level set. Our project will develop new methods for tracking
interfaces using a more efficient Lagrangian surface mesh. Through careful
prediction of instabilities and topology changes, we will address the numerical,
geometric, and topological difficulties that have plagued previous Lagrangian
approaches to interface propagation. The result will be faster and more compact
simulations of the motion of interface surfaces, as well as the ability to
detect and control changes in their topology.

Moving boundary or interface surfaces are an integral part of a wide variety of
physical phenomena, such as solidification, extrusion, multiphase flow, and
fluid-solid interaction. Numerical simulations of such phenomena require
reliable and efficient methods for propagating and tracking such moving
surfaces. The focus of our project is to develop new methods that provide
greater control over surface propagation while also attaining greater
computational efficiency than existing methods. One specific application we will
consider is the simulation of combustion in solid propellant rocket motors,
which is the primary focus of UIUC's Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets
(CSAR). This work will result in more efficient and more accurate virtual
prototyping of rocket motor designs, leading to safer and more efficient solid
rocket boosters, such as those powering the U.S. Space Shuttle.
