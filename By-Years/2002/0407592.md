The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is a relic left over from the
early universe and it has its origin in the "big bang" in which the universe
that we live in was created. The variations in brightness on the sky of the CMBR
carry the imprint of the distribution of matter about 300,000 years after
creation and the linear polarization of the CMBR can provide information from
even earlier times, just a fraction of a second after creation. This award
provides support for the on-going analysis of CMBR data obtained by an Antarctic
long-duration balloon flight in 1998-99, for the development of modifications
for the earlier payload to measure polarization and for another Antarctic
flight. The research team doing this work is probably the leading group in the
world for the field.
