The project will provide an opportunity for entering 12th grade high school
students to learn principles involved in environmental biology and chemistry
research. They will design and carry out a research project involving the
chemistry and biology of the Gibbon River, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.
The research will have two components: gathering samples and data in the field,
i.e. the Gibbon River, and analyzing the samples and data in the laboratory. The
research will (1) provide useful data for the Research Office of Yellowstone
National Park; (2) allow the students to assess and develop their potential
skills as scientists; (3) encourage and stimulate their consideration of science
as a career and (4) increase their awareness of the academic preparation
necessary for such careers.
