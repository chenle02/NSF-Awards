This NSF award provides support for U.S. based participants of the conference
?Chromatic Homotopy Theory and Friends", to be held at the Mittag-Leffler
Institute, Djursholm, Sweden, during June 7-10, 2022. The meeting aims to bring
together leading researchers, postdocs, and graduate students working in the
field, with a focus on recruitment, retention and mentoring of women
researchers, who form an under-represented group in mathematics. The event would
provide an entry point to research in chromatic homotopy theory and opportunity
to start collaboration. The activities are designed to attract early career
researchers to the field and facilitate mentoring relationships with the goal of
improved retention and continued success.

Chromatic homotopy theory is a cornerstone in modern algebraic topology. It is a
conceptual and computational framework for identifying and explaining large
scale periodic patterns in stable homotopy groups. Beyond its original focus,
chromatic homotopy theory has grown into an organizational principle with
applications in areas such as algebraic geometry and modular representation
theory. It provides a direct yet mysterious relationship between stable homotopy
theory and number theory through modular and automorphic forms. This workshop
will consist of an introductory series of lectures on chromatic homotopy, and
additional invited and contributed lectures on adjacent areas, such as
equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. Details are available at
http://www.mittag-leffler.se/konferens/ewm-ems-summer school-chromatic-homotopy-
theory-and-friends.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
