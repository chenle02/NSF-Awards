The USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST) is a leading forum
for innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and
practitioners from both industry and academia to reveal and discuss leading
topics germane to file and storage systems. This award provides funding to
assist approximately 20 U.S.-based graduate students to attend the 13th USENIX
FAST Conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in leading conferences is
an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing
opportunities to interact with more senior researchers and attain exposure to
leading-edge work. This award will fund participation of those students who
would otherwise be unable to attend FAST, with a particular emphasis upon
supporting women and other underrepresented minorities in the field.
