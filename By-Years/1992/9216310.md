This research is concerned with the representation theory of quantum groups and
its relation with the modular representation theory of an algebraic group. The
principal investigator will study the compatibility of the Jantzen filtrations
for Weyl modules and quantum Weyl modules; the structure of Weyl modules with
highest weights in the non-generic position; and the structure of cohomology
modules related to induction functors for both the algebraic group and the
quantum groups, and the relations between them. A group is an algebraic
structure with an operation defined on it. A group is called an algebraic group
if its elements satisfy a polynomial identity. Algebraic groups are important
for several different areas of mathematics, as well as physics.
