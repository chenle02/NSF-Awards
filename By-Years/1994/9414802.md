9414802 McCarthy The award is for research aimed at a new technique for in-line
measurement of the shear viscosity over a wide range of shear rates. Nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging will be used to determine either the velocity profile
or the velocity spectrum of a fluid flowing through a tube. The velocity profile
is combined with an auxiliary measurement, such as pressure drop, to calculate
the viscosity as a function of shear rate. The velocity profile technique will
be used to determine the shear viscosity of a wide range of materials. The
researchers will also work with an equipment manufacturer to develop a prototype
instrument based on the velocity spectrum method. The instrument developed will
have an advantage over commercially available equipment which either make
measurements over a single shear rate, require considerable time to make
measurements at multiple shear rates, and/or cannot generally handle filled
systems. The work to be performed here is important for process control and
product analysis of materials like thermoplastics, both filled and unfilled,
dense slurries and foodstuffs.
