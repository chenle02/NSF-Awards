The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science
(SACNAS) will hold a third conference in the series of "Teaching culturally
relevant science" at San Jose State University. The previous conferences have
been in Pasadena (1986) and in El Paso (1987). The aim of the conferences is to
provide 150 High School science teachers with workshops on classroom techniques
and resource materials aimed at increasing the interest of Hispanics and Native
American students in the sciences. There will be eight workshops and each will
be presented twice to give the participants the opportunity to participate in
two of their choice. The workshops are: 1. Teaching to a diverse student
population: Meeting tomorrow's needs. 2. Development of an observational
science. 3. Science and art: The science and creativity in the Diego Rivera
murals. 4. Botany and Meso-American design. 5. Feeding the world: Productivity
of food plants. 6. Mayan mathematics in the classroom. 7. Healing herbs: The
bridge between biology and chemistry 8. Early high technology in Silicon Valley.
An amount equivalent to 59.7% of the NSF award is being contributed by SACNAS as
cost sharing. The NSF cost per participant for the project is $51.30.
