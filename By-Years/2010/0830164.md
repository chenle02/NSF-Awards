Intellectual Merit: This proposal explores the possibility of high-performance
metamaterials, with engineered dispersion, that are of high interest in wireless
communications ? both at microwave frequencies and at optical wavelengths. The
objectives are (1) to discover a new paradigm for metamaterial development using
array of dielectric resonators, and (2) to engineer metamaterials dispersion
diagrams and their device characteristics utilizing a comprehensive spherical
modal analysis. It could result in an entirely new class of metamaterials using
electric and magnetic dipole modes developed by arrays of spheres. A new class
of all-dielectric metamaterials can enable micro and nano-scale devices that
operate at microwave and terahertz frequencies.

Broader Impact: A wide range of education initiatives will be fully integrated
with the proposed research. The goals are to (1) foster integrative research
thinking, (2) encourage interdisciplinary education, (3) involve minorities and
underrepresented groups in research, (4) target ambitious and research minded
high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and (5) engage the young
engineers and top-level industries to maintain U.S. economic preeminence.
