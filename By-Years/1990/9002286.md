This is a proposal to study shock wave and other discontinuous solutions of the
equations that govern the flow of compressible fluids. For example, there are
still many unanswered questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms
play in the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time stability
of such waves. The principal investigators will use analytic and asymptotic
tools to answer these questions and related ones. In addition to the usual
equations of fluid dynamics the principal investigators will study systems of
equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases, and the theory
of shallow water waves. Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain
problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected. For example,
the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very small and yet it affects the
large-scale behavior of objects that move through the gas. The principal
investigators will study how such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the
formation and propagation of shock waves in gases. A shock wave is something
like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at high speeds.
