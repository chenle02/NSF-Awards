This project will study unique continuation for subelliptic operators, Wiener's
criterion and Harnack inequalities, and symmetry of boundary value problems.
Unique continuation for subelliptic operators will be studied through a blend of
geometric and variational techniques that allow more cases than the usual
Carleman method. In the studies of symmetries the PI will continue his attempts
in the solution to Schiffer's conjecture and Pompeiu's problem. The questions to
be considered in this project are motivated by basic problems in geometry and
mathematical physics. Their answers will contribute to a firmer understanding of
fundamental scientific issues.
