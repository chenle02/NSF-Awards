The long term goal of this project is to elucidate how the activation of cAMP-
dependent protein kinase following peptide hormone binding brings about a
response in the cell. Specifically, the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in
steroidogenesis and cell proliferation in Y-1, an adrenal tumor cell line, and
bovine adrenal cortical cells will be studied. In this study, a specific and
direct cytochemical, fluorescent, light microscopic probe and an immunogold
electron microscopic procedure for localizing the subcellular sites of free
catalytic and regulatory subunits will be correlated to biochemical assays of
steroid secretion and cell proliferation. The results of this research will
contribute to basic knowledge of the physiological role of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase in triggering steroid hormone production and cell proliferation
by adrenal cortical cells.
