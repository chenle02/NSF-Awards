The National Research Council will convene a committee to oversee a one-day
workshop that will identify issues surrounding the release to the public domain
of genomic data for bioterrorism threat agents. This workshop will be designed
to complement related NRC activities, including the January 9, 2003 workshop on
"Dual Use" Information in the Life Sciences, the January 23-24, 2003 workshop on
Biotechnology and Bioterrorism: Anticipating Future Threats and Countermeasures,
and the ongoing study on Improving Research Standards and Practices to Prevent
the Misuse of Biotechnology Research. The committee will be appointed in
accordance with standard NRC procedures designed to ensure that the membership
has appropriate expertise and lacks inappropriate bias. The appointment of the
committee will follow the solicitation of suggested members from sponsors, NRC
board members and other experts in the field of bioterrorism. The committee will
then design an agenda and identify and invite speakers for the one-day workshop.
The agenda will be designed to facilitate interaction and discussion on the
following questions. &lt;br/&gt; --What are the categories of genomic data that
present the greatest concern?&lt;br/&gt; --What are the pros and cons of
unlimited versus restricted access to such data, including threats posed to the
scientific community or to national security? &lt;br/&gt;--What are some options
for making decisions about release to the public domain?&lt;br/&gt;Following the
workshop the committee will author a report based upon the results of the
workshop. The workshop and subsequent report will enhance understanding of the
policy issues surrounding the release to the public domain of information on the
genomic sequence data of bioterrorism threat agents. A diverse community,
including the interagency genomics coordinating committee, will benefit from the
dialogue and later the final report, which can be used to continue the debate
about these issues and move national and international policy forward. The
project will be completed within August 31, 2003.
