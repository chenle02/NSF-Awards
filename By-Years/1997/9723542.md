IBN: 9723542 PI: ATEMA Smell and taste are senses that detect chemicals in the
environment, but they do not work in isolation. In the aquatic environment with
high viscosity compared to air, chemical "plumes" are carried in currents and
can have complex spatial and temporal structure over long distances. Animals in
the water are subject to hydrodynamic stimulation by water currents as well, and
it is largely unknown how the tactile stimulation from a swift current may
affect the chemosensory input, compared to the same chemosensory signal in
gently drifting water. This project uses a multidisciplinary approach
incorporating hydrodynamics, ultrastructural anatomy and electrophysiology on a
crustacean as a model invertebrate chemosensory system. Morphological types of
sensory cells in the appendages such as the antenna will be identified, and
tested for physiological sensitivity to combinations of chemosensory signals and
mechanosensory stimuli. Results will help determine how peripheral integration
of multimodal signals might occur, will be important beyond chemosensory science
to sensory neuroscience in general, and will have potential applications for
technological development of robotic sensory devices.
