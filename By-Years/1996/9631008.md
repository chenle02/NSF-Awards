9631008 Ram The zebra mussel is a bivalve that was recently introduced
accidentally into North America. It has been considered a biological pest and
has drastic environmental impacts on water and power utilities and also an
enormous negative impact on biodiversity, particularly with respect to native
bivalves. However, because of its prolific reproductive capabilities (which are
part of the reason it is a problem), the zebra mussel has also proven to be a
highly suitable organism for studying the regulation of reproductive behavior.
Many of the basic mechanisms regulating maturation of eggs prior to
fertilization in bivalves are similar to those in our own bodies, yet these
mechanisms are only now beginning to be understood at the molecular level. This
project will investigate the mechanisms by which the neurochemical serotonin (a
chemical also found in human nervous systems) regulates reproductive behavior
and oocyte maturation. The specific aims of the project will be to determine the
structure(s) of serotonin receptors in zebra mussels and to begin characterizing
their coupling to cellular mechanisms through G-proteins. Zebra mussel serotonin
receptors will be cloned and sequenced; their responses to serotonin and related
drugs will be characterized; and their location will be determined. Binding and
responses of cloned receptors to serotonin will be compared to effects of
serotonin and related compounds on reproductive behavior of the mussels. This
project will have significance for understanding reproductive mechanisms, for
understanding serotonin mechanisms in general, and, in the long run, it may also
have an impact on investigations of new ways to control zebra mussels.
