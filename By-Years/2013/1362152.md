With this renewal award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program
A (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Michael D. Morse of
the University of Utah in a project that will use lasers to probe the structural
and bonding properties of small metal and boron containing molecules in the gas
phase. These investigations will provide data that will be used as benchmarks
for results obtained by modern computational techniques. This project will
increase fundamental knowledge of the nature of the chemical bonds in a series
of interesting and important molecules. Students participating in this research
will receive training in instrument development, vacuum technology, electronics
and computational techniques. The principal investigator will conduct a series
of workshops for high school teachers of advanced placement
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use laser spectroscopy to
develop a fundamental understanding of the electronic structure and chemical
bonding in small molecules. Systems to be studied include: (1) the molecules BNB
and BC2, triatomic molecules for which high-level theory yields conflicting
results; (2) boron clusters,which have been shown to have interesting electronic
structure, which influences the molecular structure; (3) diatomic metal and
silicon containing species, to determine the bond lengths and electronic
symmetries of these species; and (4) a range of 3d, 4d, 5d, and 4f metal
molecules with a cryo-cooled ion trap, in order to build up an accurate (&lt;0.3
kJ/mol) database of bond dissociation energies for metal-metal bonds. Extensive
collaborations with computational and theoretical specialists are planned.
