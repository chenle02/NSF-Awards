Title: Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at SPLASH 2015
(PLMW@SPLASH)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop
(PLMW) at SPLASH will take place on October 27 2015, as part of the ACM SIGPLAN
Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications (SPLASH), held in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. This grant will support approximately 15 students
to attend the PLMW event plus the SPLASH conference. While there is other
funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting
papers at SPLASH, this proposal is intended specifically to target undergraduate
and Masters students, with a view to increasing the numbers of such students in
programming languages research. The selection process further ensures a diverse
pool of applicants, paying attention to underrepresented groups, and
prioritizing US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and
importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide
opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the
programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers
and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.
