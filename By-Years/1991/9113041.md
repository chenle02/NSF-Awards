This work investigates the effects of discourse context on explanations in
tutorial settings. When human tutors engage in dialogue, they freely exploit all
aspects of the mutually known context, including the previous discourse.
Utterances that do not draw on previous discourse seem awkward, unnatural, or
even incoherent. Previous discourse must be taken into account in order to
relate new information effectively to recently conveyed material and to avoid
repeating old material that would distract the student from what is new.
Strategies for using the discourse history in generating utterances are of great
importance toresearch in natural language generation for tutorial applications.
The goal of this work is to produce a computational model of how tutors exploit
the discourse history in instructional settings, and to implement this model in
an intelligent tutoring system that maintains a dialogue history and uses it in
planning its explanations.
