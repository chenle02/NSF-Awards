This project has provided students with experience in classical and modern
techniques of infrared spectroscopy through frequent and varied use of a modern
FT-IR spectrophotometer. The department purchased a Perking Elmer 1650 FT-IR
with a disk drive, plotter, diffuse reflectance and variable angle specular
reflectance accessories and a Sadtler IR library. Students in general chemistry
encounter the FT-IR in a demonstration setting. The instrument receives frequent
use in organic chemistry where the students are introduced to instrument
operation and spectral comparison. Several experiments require the capabilities
of the FT-IR, rather than a conventional, instrument. Students in a polymer
chemistry laboratory course take advantage of the reflectance accessories. Use
in analytical chemistry emphasizes small sample size capability, diffuse
reflectance and Fourier Transform theory. Physical chemistry uses the FT-IR to
obtain some of the spectra needed to interpret rotational-vibrational spectra of
HCl. Biochemistry uses the instrument as an aid in isolation and identification
of small biomolecules. Undergraduate research utilizes the instrument when it is
available and appropriate to the project. This project allows students
significantly more experience with infrared spectroscopy because analysis time
is much less and the capabilities are much greater. Students gain experience in
modern infrared spectroscopy techniques such as diffuse and specular
reflectance, micro analysis and computer based libraries. The use of a Fourier
transform instrument enhances understanding of this powerful tool. The
institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
