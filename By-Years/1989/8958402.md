This action is for support of a Presidential Young Investigator award. The
research addresses soil-structure interaction under conditions of earthquake and
general dynamic loading. Examples include the interaction between a building or
bridge foundation (footings or piles) and the soil on which it rests, or the
interaction between a tunnel, pipeline, power or communication cable, and the
ground through which it runs. This interaction may result in damage to the
structure. The analysis of this phenomenon for the case of small ground motions
is a difficult problem: for the large ground displacements that occur near the
surface fault of a large earthquake, the problem becomes much more difficult.
The goal of this project is to develop a firm understanding of the subject
through a coordinated research program involving (1) an investigation of the
corresponding fundamental problems in the context of the theory of elasticity
and plasticity, (2) numerical modeling using elasto-plastic constitutive
theories by finite element and boundary integral equation methods, and (3)
experiments to understand the underlying physical phenomena.
