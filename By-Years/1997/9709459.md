9707459 Arzbecher This research focuses on the development of an implantable
drug delivery device for the treatment of atrial fibrillation by working with a
postdoctoral fellow. The project will capitalize on the demonstrated leadership
of the principal investigator in the field of automated, implantable drug
delivery devices, as well as the experience of the postdoctoral fellow in
intracardiac waveform analysis. The research will be conducted in the form of an
academic-industrial collaboration, with the fellow based at Pharma Target, Inc.
(PTI) in Minneapolis and working with the PI at the Illinois Institute of
Technology. ***
