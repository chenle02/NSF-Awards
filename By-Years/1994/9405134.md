This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, is concerned with studies of compounds that contain metal-
metal multiple bonds. Objectives include 1) the synthesis of new complexes that
contain M-M multiple bonds, 2) further studies of the underlying factors
governing reactivity of M-M multiply bonded compounds, 3) exploration of
applications of M-M multiply bonded compounds in catalytic reactions and in
stoichiometric organic transformations, and 4) incorporation of M-M multiply
bonded compounds in macromolecular phases such as one-dimensional polymers and
liquid crystalline materials. The latter may be of interest for molecular design
of materials having potentially interesting electrical, magnetic and optical
properties. Whereas the existence of multiple bonds in carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen compounds has been recognized for many decades, recognition of the
existence of metal-metal multiple bonds is of much more recent origin.
Consequently the fundamental chemistry of compounds that contain metal-metal
multiple bonds is poorly developed. The primary objective of this project is to
expand our knowledge of the structural and reactivity properties of compounds
that contain metal-metal bonds, particularly with respect to possible
applications in the catalysis of organic reactions and in the preparation of new
polymers and liquid crystalline materials. The latter may prove to be useful in
the development of new materials having novel electrical, magnetic or optical
properties.
