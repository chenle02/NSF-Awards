DMS 9625396 Butler This research is concerned with the application of
saddlepoint methods in four areas: (a) First they are used to construct
intractable likelihoods in dynamic stochastic systems models so as to allow for
statistical inference. This leads to the computation of performance
characteristics for these systems with applications in production management and
systems reliability. (b) Secondly, saddlepoint methods are used to approximate
special functions arising in Statistics and applied Mathematics including Bessel
and hypergeometric functions of scalar and matrix argument. The matrix argument
functions cannot always be accurately approximated and, when they can, the
computational times needed are often prohibitive. By contrast , the saddlepoint
approximations are highly accurate and can always be computed in a couple
seconds. (c) Saddlepoint approximations are developed for the multivariate
cumulative distribution functions arising in sampling theory. (d) Saddlepoint
theory related to the generalized inverse Gaussian distributions is also
investigated. Concepts and models for stochastic systems and networks are now
found in all areas of science. Examples include various models for computer
system networks, ecosystems, production management methods in manufacturing, and
reliability testing. The first part of this project develops methods that will
allow for statistical inference with such models so as to assess various
performance characteristics related to such systems. These evaluations in turn
allow for the description and prediction of outcomes for the system as well as
for system construction and design. Ultimately these model-based descriptions
and predictions pertain to the real phenomena that underly the models. The
second major part of this proposal concerns the approximation of important
special functions that arise in the use of statistical methods and applied
mathematics. Special functions were created by mathematicians because they
repeatedly arise in the solution of a wide range of important scientific
problems. The special functions addressed here are called Bessel and
hypergeometric functions and are perhaps the most important, widely encompassing
and general of the special functions in Mathematics. These functions
historically have played a central role in the physical and mathematical
sciences and are extremely difficult to compute. The proposal suggests highly
accurate approximations to these functions that can be computed in a fraction of
the time that is currently needed for their approximation.
