related to clouds. Despite this, in current generation climate models, cloud-
related processes typically interact with each other only through grid box means
and not directly with each other on the small scales. For instance, it would be
desirable to let the full variability in small-scale cloud structure directly
drive precipitation processes and let precipitation in turn directly alter the
small-scale cloud structure. The lack of such an interface leads to degraded
simulations of a variety of cloud related processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
address this need, the project will develop a physics coupler based on the
assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The assumed PDF method
produces grid box averages of precipitation rates by upscaling local process
rates. In the past, the averaging over the small-scale variability has been
performed by either of two methods: (1) analytic integration, or (2) Latin
hypercube sampling, which is a type of Monte-Carlo integration. Both methods
suffer drawbacks. The investigator will develop a new approach to reduce noise
while permitting the use of sophisticated precipitation schemes. The technique
will be implemented in a climate model and used to simulate clouds, and may
lead, in future work, to a generalized physics coupler that will improve many
facets of climate simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work
include partnership with an undergraduate institution in real-world software
engineering, broad training of graduate students and teaching, and disseminating
research in the community and benefiting society. Although the research is
intended to have immediate application to precipitation processes in climate
models, the techniques may be applied in the future to other model types, such
as numerical weather prediction models, and other physical phenomena, such as
atmospheric chemistry.
