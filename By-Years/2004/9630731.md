A school for young experimental and theoretical elementary particle physicists
will be held June 4-12, 1997 in Fontana, Wisconsin. This school will focus on
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fairly well-conformed theory of the strong
nuclear force. QCD describes the behavior of numerous elementary particles which
are employed to study a variety of questions concerning the constituents of
matter and the fundamental forces. Thus, it is very important for elementary
particle physicists to gain a working knowledge of QCD. The school will seek to
provide that knowledge.
