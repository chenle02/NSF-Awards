CTS - 9631202 William Koros U of Texas Austin ABSTRACT The GOALI project deals
with characterization of hollow fiber membranes prior to downstream processing.
The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using aqueous based dyes to
evaluate the surface porosity of polymeric fibers. Dye uptake measurements will
be correlated with O2/N2 permeation data to determine if the technique can be
used during processing to predict final fiber properties. A graduate student
will be supported to perform the research in an industrial location. Potential
applications of the technique include industrial fiber production, separations
and characterization of porous surfaces in general.
