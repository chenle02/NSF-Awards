St. Edward's University is collaborating with Austin Community College to
recruit and prepare 18 math and science majors to teach in middle and secondary
high need schools (grades 4-12) in the Austin Independent School District.
Recruitment is targeted to high performing underrepresented and first generation
math and science students enrolled at Austin Community College and St. Edward's
University. Through cross-disciplinary instruction and mentoring from math,
science, and education faculty from St. Edward's University and Austin Community
College, blended with cohort-based professional development from the Charles A.
Dana Center at the University of Texas at Austin, Noyce Scholars participating
in the program receive advanced training in strategies for success in teaching
mathematics and science in diverse, high need middle and secondary schools in
the Austin Independent School District during their coursework, field
experiences, summer science leadership academy, and new teacher induction
period. Early field experiences for freshmen and sophomores include
participation in a summer science and teaching camp focusing on environmental
education. Noyce Scholars participate in a week long Science Teacher Leadership
Academy prior to the induction period. A mentoring and induction program is
offered through the first three years of teaching.
