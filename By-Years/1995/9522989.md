952989 Zhang This project will develop methods to design, build and test a
positioning stage with resolution of 5 nanometers, repeatability of 20 nanometer
over a 300 mm range of travel, while moving at speed of up to 50 mm/s. The
drives are linear piezomotors, eliminating ball screws and their associated
backlash problems. This drive and a flexure design increase the stiffness of a
positioning stage. The research approach will cover the dynamic modeling,
control system design, and error budgeting to predict the design targets. In
cooperation with an industrial partner, they will build and test a high
precision, X-Y-Z-theta stage. The impact of this research will be in the
precision manufacturing industries, where the analysis tools will be used to
take advantage of the precision and high stiffness of this type of stage,
allowing fast, accurate positioning. Semiconductor lithography equipment, and
other precision mechanical position systems, require both the design methods and
this technology to be able to manufacture higher density semiconductors
economically.
