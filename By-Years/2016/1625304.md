This proposal is directed at purchasing a confocal microscope to be used by
several teams of interdisciplinary scientists for research and education at
Western University of Health Sciences (WesternU), and to be shared with various
neighboring Institutions (Cal State Fullerton University, Cal Poly Pomona, and
the Claremont Colleges). Specifically, this project will not only gradually
replace the current and outdated confocal microscope but will add the following
research capabilities: live imaging with less phototoxicity, spectral imaging,
faster imaging, allowing for accurate FRET analysis, and high-resolution 3D
imaging. The requested equipment will be located in a Core Facility dedicated to
imaging technologies, and will be accessible to qualified researchers and
students. This instrument will also be used to train postdoctoral fellows,
graduate students and undergraduate students from the neighboring Institutions
in imaging techniques. Finally, it will also be used in a partnering program
with a neighboring High School, Garey High School, directed at enhancing their
STEM programs. Overall, the project is significant in that it will provide
state-of-the-art research capability to both WesternU and to the region. It will
also provide valuable research training and experience for student users as
well, and facilitate collaborative research between WesternU and neighboring
institutions.

The microscope will be used by at least 10 primary research teams of WesternU,
and will be used for several research projects: Analysis of protein-protein
interactions by several investigators investigating signaling pathways involved
in regulation of protein synthesis, receptor trafficking, and synaptic function
and plasticity; Analysis of calcium imaging in various neuronal populations in
response to a variety of extracellular signals; 3D reconstruction of neuronal
dendrites under different physiological or pathological conditions; Analysis of
neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.
