This SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) project pertains to chemical
defense in zooplankton communities and its role in food web dynamics. It
involves a collaboration between Dr. Jim McClintock (a Marine Invertebrate
Chemical Ecologist), Dr. Bill Baker (a Natural Products Chemist) and Dr. Debbie
Steinberg (a Biological Oceanographer). The specific research will focus on
identifying chemicals responsible for deterrence in a defined subset of
holoplankton. The project will examine aspects of chemical defense in 2 3 common
oceanic holoplankton species that occur near Bermuda. It will employ
ecologically relevant predators (fish and shrimp) in standard feeding bioassays
to determine whether chemical extracts isolated from holoplanktonic organisms
serve as feeding deterrents. This information will be critical to the
development of a comprehensive understanding of the roles of bioactive compounds
in the ecology of holoplanktonic communities.
