Deicing is an important problem for operating aircraft fleets and space shuttle
under cold environments. Deicing from power lines, flood gates in dams and
bridge piers are important for avoiding power outrages and floods; deicing from
airfields, roads, and vehicles is important in both civilian and defense
sectors. The aim of this proposal is to understand the physical mechanisms that
govern the adhesion of ice to structural surfaces, and subsequently, to tailor
the microstructure of the interfacial region which will result in the lowest
possible interface strength. The microstructure will be modified by using new
type of hydrophobic coatings of varying internal structures and thickness, by
using surface contaminants, by changing the roughness of the substrate surface
which besides affecting the interface strength through modification of the ice
layer grain-size, can also lead to entrapment of flaws at the ice/structure
interface. The effect of time and temperature on the above strength will also be
studied. The ice/structure interface strength will be measured by adapting a
recently developed laser spallation experiment. The proposed research is
multidisciplinary in nature as it involves use of novel experimentation (laser,
optics, materials science, wave mechanics), surface science concepts and
development of new type of hydrophobic coatings based on SAMS (Self Assembled
Monolayer System) technology developed in the fields of chemistry and polymeric
sciences.
