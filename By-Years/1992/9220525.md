The objective of the proposed research is to develop explants of the dorsal
axial tissues of the Xenopus laevis gastrula as an experimental system in which
the biochemical mechanisms responsible for convergence and extension of these
tissues can be linked to molecular and cellular events. The project involves
combining skills and methodologies in bioengineering, biomechanics, cell and
developmental biology. We have developed a miniaturized force- measuring device
the "Histowiggler", that allows us to measure the mechanical properties of
embryonic tissues and the forces they generate in standard engineering measures
useful for mechanical analysis and mathematical modelling. We will use this
device to measure the mechanical properties of explants of dorsal axial tissues
and the forces they generate during normal convergence and extension and after
experimental treatments known to affect gastrulation in whole embryos. Normal
and experimentally altered cell behavior will be recorded by analyzing shapes
and arrangements of fluorescein dextran-labeled cells indirectly with histology
and directly with low-light fluorescence microscopy and video image processing
and recording. Cytoskeletal structure under normal and experimental conditions
will be evaluated with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. The results
are expected to contribute to our understanding of how cytoskeletal structures
and cell behaviors generate the mechanical properties and forces driving
convergence and extension of the axial mesoderm. This system will be a step in
the direction of developing routine methods of analyzing the biomechanical
function of molecules and cell behaviors.
