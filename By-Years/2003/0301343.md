MODELING THE THERMO-MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF SHAPE MEMORY
POLYMERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt; Shape memory polymers are
novel materials that can be easily formed into complex shapes, retaining memory
of their original shape even after undergoing large deformations. These new
materials are finding increasing use in a number of cutting edge applications
ranging from actuators, MEMS devices, biomedical devices to space technology. In
spite of their technological significance and in marked contrast to the
situation in shape memory alloys, there is a dearth of constitutive models that
are able to predict the thermomechanical behavior of shape memory polymers
undergoing complex thermal and mechanical loadings. The availability of models
that will aid in predicting their behavior under a wide range of conditions and
are essential for designing applications using these polymers. The aim of the
research proposed here is to formulate a properly invariant three-dimensional
constitutive theory within a thermodynamic setting that is capable of predicting
the thermal and mechanical behavior of crystallizable shape memory polymers
under a variety of conditions. The models developed will then be implemented
into a finite element program to study the response of shape memory polymers in
realistic geometries and conditions. The models and the computational algorithms
that are developed will help in understanding the behavior of shape memory
polymers and hasten the use such materials in novel technological
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
