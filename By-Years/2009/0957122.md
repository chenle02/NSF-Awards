Professor Daniel A. Buttry of Arizona State University is supported by the
Division of Chemistry to study the effect of size and surface stress on the
electrochemical properties and phase transformations of metal and metal oxide
nanoparticles; in particular, Ag oxidation to AgCl, Pd reduction to PdHx and
layered LixMnO2 conversion to spinel LixMn2O4. Methods will be developed for the
facile synthesis and size fractionation of Ag, Pd and MnO2 nanoparticles with
controlled sizes in the range of 1.5 - 10 nm. The particles will be capped with
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to facilitate their dissolution at high
concentration in aqueous supporting electrolytes, thus enabling the study of
their electrochemical behavior in thin layer-by-layer films and as individually
dissolved nanoparticles. The particles will be subjected to a battery of
analytical characterization techniques to determine their sizes and composition.
Surface stress will be determined from lattice contraction measurements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of nanoscale materials has become widespread in
electrochemical energy storage and conversion; however, the basic understanding
needed to advance new technologies in this area is lacking. This research will
develop a set of experimental systems that can provide a basic thermodynamic
understanding of nanoscale size effects in electrochemistry, especially in
processes involving phase transformations. Students will be trained in
techniques that are relevant to energy storage and conversion, and secondary
science teachers will be exposed to a summer research experience.
