In this project, the PI will study the response of the upper ocean to strong
wind-forcing in the presence of mesoscale fronts and eddies in the ocean. A
three-dimensional model will be implemented to test the hypothesis that the
mechanism of radiation of internal-inertial waves out of the surface frontal
zone has a larger impact on the variability of surface inertial currents than
does modified Ekman transport. Data from a recent experiment called the Frontal
Air-Sea INteraction EXperiment (FASINEX) will be used to verify the model
results.
