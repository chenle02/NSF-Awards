This proposal seeks to analyze the initiation and organization of lateral root
meristems in radish (Raphanus sativus) where large numbers of meristems can be
induced to develop synchronously and rapidly. By analysing patterns of protein
profiles generated by in vitro translation we will determine times at which to
produce cDNA libraries from which to isolate probes for genes that are expressed
uniquely or preferentially in a staqe-specific manner in the organizing
meristems. These probes will then be used to examine the tissue and cellular
location of gene products, and to examine whether homologous genes are expressed
in other types of meristems, such as the shoot apical meristem, or in meristems
of other species. Our experiments will be aided by the use of primordiomorphs
formed in gamma plantlets or by colchicine treatment. Primordiomorphs are
meristems formed in the absence of cell division, and in them we will be able to
examine the relationship between molecular genetic events and a requirement for
cell divisions at specific stages of meristem initiation and organization.
Apical meristems are initiated in the embryo of vascular plants and function
directly, or indirectly through the formation of other meristems, to produce the
entire post-embryonic organism. The initiation and organization of meristem
function in localized groups of cells at specific sties is a major event in
establishing the patterns of plant development. Little is known of the molecular
genetic events that control the developmental pathway of meristem formation, or
how these events are related to observable chanages in cellular and tissue
structure.
