9404494 Jacobowitz The research involves the geometry and analysis of sytems of
partial differential equations on classes of manifolds inheriting partially
complex structures. This is related to the generalization of the Stein and
Kaehler structures arising in the complex case. The study of such differential
systems has applications to other areas of mathematics and general relativity.
