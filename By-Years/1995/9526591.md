9526591 Rushmer The proposed Research Planning Grant will experimentally
investigate the micropermeability that develops during melting as a function of
the melting rate and the processes by which melt migrates from localized melting
sites at the onset of reaction. Externally-heated, cold seal experiments under
fluid-absent conditions will be run initially at 800C and 850C and 3 to 5 kbar.
The results from these experiments will enhance our fundamental understanding of
the rates and mechanisms controlling melt generation and segregation at the
source, will provide new information which will help in the interpretation of
natural geochemical data, and will enhance our understanding of the potential
geochemical trace element abundances produced during melt segregation and the
process of melt segregation itself.
