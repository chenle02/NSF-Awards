9605131 Henry The Physics Department at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville proposes to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site in modern optics and optical materials. The REU site will build on an
existing undergraduate program in Modern Optics for science and engineering
majors. The program has targeted Historically Black Colleges and Universities in
the region for student recruitment. Student participants will spend ten weeks in
the summer working on research topics that include semiconductor waveguides,
diode lasers, and photorefractive crystals. %%% The program will provide
undergraduate students from the region with a research experience that will
encourage them to pursue further education and training in modern optics, and
eventually provide better trained students in this technologically important
area. ***
