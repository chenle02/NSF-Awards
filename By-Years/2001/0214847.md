This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel, electro-optical sensor capable of capturing single airborne
particles and analyzing their compositions on a time scale of a few minutes. The
sensor concept is based on a previously developed innovative technology for
single-particle electrodynamic capture and Raman spectroscopy. The
electrodynamic trap is capable of capturing and suspending single airborne
particles of sizes 1 to 100 m. Analysis of the trapped particle by Raman
spectroscopy provides a fingerprint of the vibrational structures of the
particle's chemical components, analogous to that obtained by infrared
absorption spectroscopy, but with single-particle sensitivity. This in turn
leads to identification of the particle as bacterial or otherwise, as well as to
preliminary identification of the bacterial species. In this Phase I project, a
compact sensor that can continually screen ambient habitat air and analyze each
trapped particle on a time scale of minutes will be devised.

The commercial application of this project is in defense and health-related
industries.
