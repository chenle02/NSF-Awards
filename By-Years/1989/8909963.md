This research will investigate the influence of the physico- chemistry and
microstructure of clays on their mechanical properties. Previous work indicates
that the impact of depositional environment and post depositional environmental
conditions and stresses may have significant influence on engineering properties
and mechanical behavior of clay systems. Among the parameters and properties
that will be investigated are index properties, stiffness, compressibility,
shear strength and permeability. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray
diffraction techniques will be utilized to assess the effect of mineralogy, and
microstructure on such parameters and behavior. Artificially prepared samples of
clay premixed or permeated with various contaminating compounds will be
subjected to a number of laboratory tests, microstructure and mineralogy
analyses as indicated above. The samples will be prepared both by consolidating
from slurry and sedimenting in a large scale sedimentation tank. The outcome of
the research is anticipated to further the understanding of the complex
interrelationships between micro and macro properties of clay systems and help
researchers and practitioners to better predict long-term behavior of such
systems under threat of rapidly changing environmental conditions.
