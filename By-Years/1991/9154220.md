The Project for Undergraduate Computer Science Faculty Enhancement and Materials
Development in the Central Texas Region has several objectives: participants
learn about new computing curricula guidelines, experience technical seminars
presented by experts, and take part in demonstrations on recent advances
relevant to undergraduate curricula; each participant contributes to the
development of instructional materials for classroom and laboratory use; and the
activities of the project foster an active professional relationship among
participating schools. A workshop during the summer includes hands-on
demonstrations, presentations, discussions, and seminars, with ample time for
materials development. These materials shared with non-participating faculty
members at the home institutions through dissemination workshops and piloted at
each institution throughout the academic year. Monthly meetings and an
evaluation session allow participants to compare experiences of usage and
improve materials as necessary, as well as encourage sustained interaction. The
pedagogical package is to be delivered to the undergraduate computer science
education community via technical journals or in published form.
