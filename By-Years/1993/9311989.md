This is intended to be the second year of a previous two-year continuing grant
(PI: Robert Palmer, Institution: Clemson University); the grant has been
transferred to the University of Nebraska. The objective of this work is the use
of the MU radar (49.5 MHz) in Kyoto, Japan, configured as an interferometer, to
investigate those processes which appear to cause a "tilting" of refractive
index structures. Such tilted layers produce differences in the measured
vertical velocity using Doppler techniques. By using the MU radar as both a
Doppler device and an interferometer, these thin scattering layers can be
observed simultaneously, thus producing independent measurements of the entire
field of motion.
