Behavior of Solutions to Time-dependent and Inhomogeneous Ginzburg-Landau Models

Abstract of Proposed Research Peter J Sternberg

This project is to conduct a rigorous investigation of some equations that have
been proposed as models for superconductors. In particular, we shall study
certain solutions of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations with applied
currents and investigate the stability of certain steady states, the possible
formation of "non-topological" vortices and the co-existence of normal and
supercurrents.

Superconductivity is an important topic whose mathematical modeling is poorly
developed. Under this proposal, and in collaboration with some colleagues and
students, we aim to further develop the mathematical analysis of some of the
accepted equations and explain the observed phenomena.
