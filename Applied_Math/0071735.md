Abstract

0071735 Golubitsky

This project will investigate the theory and applications of equivariant
dynamical systems. In particular, using the symmetries of differential equations
and models, we will study patterns that occur both in space and in time. We will
explore locomotor central pattern generators for bipeds and quadrupeds, a
classification of bursting types, hypermeander of spiral waves, and magnetic
dynamos. We will also study a combination of Euclidean symmetry and chaotic
dynamics that leads to a deterministic mechanism for stochastic Brownian motion,
and Ginzburg-Landau theory for spatially-extended systems.

Patterns appear in physical, chemical, and biological systems in both space and
time and are striking and reproducible. Often these patterns result from
symmetries, and our research will study pattern formation by further developing
the theory and application of symmetric dynamical systems. Applications that
will be investigated range from the study of muscle rhythms in animal gaits and
intermittency in magnetic dynamos to the complicated ways in which bursting
signals are produced and spiral waves move.
