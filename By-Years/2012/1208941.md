This award will support research in emergent structures in a variety of many-
body systems, including complex networks and soft matter. Response to shear
deformation will be used to prove the existence and nature of such emergent
structures, within simplified models. The main technique used will be variants
of equilibrium statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystalline solids
and other emergent structures are composed of components but exhibit their
useful features, such as mechanical strength, only when the number of components
is very large. For this reason, although such structures are widely modelled in
the sciences there is as yet insufficient understanding of the complicated role
played by the vast number of components. This award will support a
new&lt;br/&gt;approach to obtain effective mathematical control of the
components in modelling these technologically important structures.
