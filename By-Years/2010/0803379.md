This research concerns the spectral and transport properties on one-and many-
particle quantum Hamiltonians with random potentials. The goal is to understand
the behavior of the correlation functions for these models in the localized and
transport regimes. The first-order correlation function, the density of states,
has been extensively studied. One part of the project is to prove its smoothness
and a lower bound on the density. Of special interest is the second-order
correlation function called the current-current correlation measure. One
component of the project is to prove the existence of a density for this measure
and to study its properties. This is important as the diagonal values of the
density give the conductivity. Other second- and higher-order correlation
functions arise in the study of eigenvalue statistics for random Schrodinger
operators. These correlation functions and related ones for certain random
matrix models will also be explored. The integer quantum Hall effect is closely
related to these ideas and the project involves a study of quantum Hall systems
using nonequilibrium stationary states.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The propagation of
electrons in solids has long been an important focus of condensed matter
physics. Quantum mechanics has been successful in providing an understanding of
metals, semiconductors, and insulators. The nature of finite conductivity
remains elusive. It is believed that the natural disorder of crystals, due to
dislocations and defects that are observed in nature, is partially responsible
for the transport properties of crystals. The focus of this research is to
understand the mathematical and physical basis for finite conductivity by
modeling crystals as an ordered array with random impurities. Experimentally
observable quantities, such as the density of states and the conductivity, can
be estimated in these models.
