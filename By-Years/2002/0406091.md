Regression analysis aims at the study of the relationship between input
variables X and out variables Y. Difficulties occur when no parametric model is
known, and yet the number of variables is large. Dimension reduction methods for
overcoming such difficulties have been investigated by many authors. To embrace
many aspects of dimension reduction under one common roof, a new forum called
the Z-mediated approach is proposed. In this setting, in addition to the input
and out variables, a third group of variables Z is introduced, which fills the
role of mediating the change in the relationship between X and Y. Typically the
number of Z variables is much larger than the number of X or Y variables. But
only a small portion of Z variables may have a real influence. New methods will
be constructed to reduce the dimension of X, Y and Z.

A wave of cutting-edge statistical activities have arrived at a time when there
is an explosive demand for processing large data sets in the life sciences, such
as those from microarrays and medical imaging. The motivation of this proposal
comes from a dynamic perspective about complex gene regulation where two
functionally associated genes X and Y may be mediated by a third unknown gene Z.
The challenge is how to identify a short list of candidate gene Z based on
microarray data alone. The methodology developed here can be used for
elucidating the interplay between disease, genes, and metabolic pathways, thus
contributing to drug discovery and benefiting society. The results will be
disseminated not only via standard publication, but also by constructing a
website for public access. Interdisciplinary training of students to work in
bioinformatics is also provided.
