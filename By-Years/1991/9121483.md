This project is to assist The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in the
dissemination of the MAA's career information booklet, Mathematical Scientists
at Work. This projects helps to address the national agenda in mathematics and
sciences education by providing career information about the opportunities in
the mathematical sciences. Mathematics has been characterized as the "invisible
culture of our age" within the general public; however, mathematical concepts
and ideas are the underpinning of the technological environment in which we
live. It has been recognized that students are more likely to study mathematics
when they (together with their peers, parents, teachers, and counselors)
recognize the career opportunities available in the mathematical sciences.
