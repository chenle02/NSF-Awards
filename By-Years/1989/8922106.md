Title: West Virginia EPSCoR Program: Phase II Abstract Narrative: This West
Virginia EPSCoR two-year continuation award is to bring the State of West
Virginia up to active status with the thirteen current EPSCoR States so that all
seventeen States will compete on an equal basis for Advanced Development Grants
in 1991-92. The West Virginia proposal embraces two research components: 1) Cell
Regulatory Biology Group, and 2) Nonlinear Dynamics Research Group. The total
award is for $1,200,000 and presents a non-federal "match" of $4,267,000. The
proposal was merit reviewed; site visited and recommended for funding subject to
modifications which were incorporated in the award submission. The proposal is
recommended for funding.
