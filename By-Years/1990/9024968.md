The Mollusc Collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History
contains more than 400,000 lots and 1,100 types, and is the largest such
collection in the western U. S. These specimens are probably the world's best
representation of the molluscs of the eastern Pacific. Dr. James McLean, Curator
in charge of the collection, has overseen its substantial growth during the past
ten years, and he now proposes to complete computerization and curation of the
Eastern Pacific gastropods in the next two years. Data entry will be completed
for approximately 97,000 lots, and a significant private collection of Alaskan
specimens will be integrated into the collection. Dr. McLean's curatorial
project will have a significant impact on the research community. Access to
specimens in this important collection will be improved substantially, and
incorporating the Alaskan material will improve the collection's coverage of the
Eastern Pacific. Reference collections such as this are critical resources for
research in evolution, ecology, biogeography, global change, and many other
disciplines. The continued growth and maintenance of these collections is
essential for future generations of biological research.
