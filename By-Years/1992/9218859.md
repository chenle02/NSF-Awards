9218859 Guyden Thymic nurse cells (TNCs) are specialized epithelial components
that contain T cells completely enclosed in intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles. Very
little information about their function has been reported because of the lack of
pure TNC populations in quantities necessary for their thorough analyses.
Recently, this laboratory has been able to immortalize TNCs with SV40 virus.
Cells from these TNC lines have been shown to maintain the ability to
internalize thymocytes in vitro. Further, it has been shown that the only cells
bound by an internalized into TNCs are CD4- positive, CD8-positive thymocytes.
These cell lines will be used to study TNC function. The goals of this research
are to determine the molecular components involved in TNC binding and
internalization of thymocytes, and to determine the specific function of TNC
internalization of double positive thymocytes in T cell development. Two
strategies will be employed: (1) TNC- specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) will
be generated in an attempt to identify the receptor/ligand involved in binding
and internalization. (2) Antibody preparations shown to block binding of
thymocytes to TNCs will be used to clone the gene(s) expressing the protein(s)
involved. These studies are designed to determine the function of thymocyte
binding and internalization by TNCs. %%% Thymic nurse cells are specialized
epithelial cells of the thymus in which T-lymphocytes are regularly found
completely enclosed in intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles. This is a very unusual
phenomenon in physiology. Very little information about the function of thymic
nurse cells is known because of the lack of pure TNC populations in quantities
necessary for their thorough analyses. However, they are believed to play an
important role in the development of T- lymphocytes of the immune system. With
prior NSF support, this laboratory has been able to grow pure populations of
thymic nurse cells in culture. The goals of this project a re to study the
interaction of thymic nurse cells with T-lymphocytes at the molecular level. The
results of this research should provide unique new information on how thymic
nurse cells function. ***
