The research to be continued will include continued effort on measuring the
fine structure splitting of triplet helium, as well as Stark and Rydberg
spectroscopy of helium excited states. The second major part of the work
involves further study of the Stark effect in alkalis including experiments and
calculations on radiative decay, electric field calibration, and the use of
laser-slowed beams to enhance measurements on long-lived states. The third area
of proposed work is in laser development, particularly diode lasers and LNA or
YAP for the helium metastable line. The fourth part is continued theory and
experimental work on the effects of spectrally broadened light on atomic
coherence, particularly the Hanle effect. The fifth part is an extension of
previous work in other laboratories of laser deceleration. Slow and cold atoms
will be used as a tool for further research in atomic physics. The last major
component of the research is the study of traps for neutral atoms, including
both magnetic and optical. This award will include the consequential involvement
of one or more promising undergraduates in a leading research group. The
assignment of meaningful tasks to these students, and their participation in an
active research environment will aid greatly in their career development.
