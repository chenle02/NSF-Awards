The principal investigator aims to develop mathematical and computational tools
for data-driven research by using theoretically-sound prediction models and
adaptive numerical methods that capture intrinsic features of complex physical
processes. This research project is intended to provide new guarantees for the
solvability of a class of inverse problems important in mathematics, commercial
industries, and defense operations. The project will involve undergraduate and
graduate students, who will receive training in numerical methods, analysis, and
scientific applications.

The principal investigator will pursue an original strategy for extracting
details from large scale datasets using a new class of efficient methods that
exploit problem-dependent features of processes occurring on multiple scales.
The design of numerical schemes is adaptable to qualitative scientific knowledge
and has the potential to significantly enhance the accessibility and performance
of current inversion methods. The basis of the approach is the selection of a
low-dimensional parameter that describes key microscopic details and the
development of numerical methods that retain an intrinsic knowledge of parameter
values while solving large-scale models, substantially reducing computational
costs. Deliverables of the project will be the new methodology, as well as
scientific applications to large scale inverse problems in sonar imaging, where
the main challenge is to capture the appropriate physics while maintaining
computational time and memory demands acceptable for current computer
architectures.
