This grant supports research using the newly upgraded MP tandem Van de Graaff
accelerator, a variety of experimental equipment, including a unique recoil mass
spectrometer, at the University of Rochester's Nuclear Structure Laboratory.
Experiments will include studies of nuclear shapes by Coulomb excitation, heavy-
ion induced transfer reactions, nuclear isomers on a microsecond time scale, the
spectroscopy of neutron deficient nuclei (particularly the light krypton
isotopes), hyperfine interactions, correlated two photon decay in heavy-ion
reactions, breakup in Li-7 induced reactions, sub-barrier transfer, and heavy-
ion reaction mechanisms. In addition, atomic mass spectrometry will be
investigated in a wide variety of fields, including geology, hydrology,
cosmochemistry, Ca-41 dating of old bones, materials research and nuclear
reaction cross sections. Some of this work involves extensive collaboration with
outside users.
