PINKHAM DMS-9627870 The Department of Mathematics at Columbia University will
purchase Unix workstation equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects in the areas of algebraic geometry and number theory,
including in particular: a project by David Bayer on toric methods for integer
and mixed programming, a project by David Bayer on Galois representations and
Hecke eigenclasses of congruence subgroups, a project of Ramanujachary Kumanduri
on primarity testing and factoring using modular forms and a project of Dan
Lieman on the use of automorphic forms to construct cryptographic systems.
