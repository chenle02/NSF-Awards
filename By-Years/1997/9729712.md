This collaborative project will bring to light an overlooked astronomical
controversy of previously unsuspected importance for the interpretation of the
Copernican revolution. Johannes Regiomontanus was the leading mathematical
astronomer of the fifteenth century; his critical analysis of Ptolemy's
`Almagest` provided an important stimulus for Copernicus's development of his
sun-centered model of the solar system. Regiomontanus's `Defense of Theon
against George of Trebizond` is a very rich but completely unstudied 573-page
attack on Trebizond's presentation of the `Almagest,` the work that Copernicus
would eclipse. This work of Regiomontanus's illuminates the most important known
clue about the emergence of Copernicus's cosmology, for it fleshes out
Regiomontanus's reasoning in proposing the alternative models that Copernicus
would later use. In this collaborative project the PIs will transcribe and
analyze Regiomontanus's lengthy text, present their most important results in
four preliminary articles, and begin the monograph they will write about this
astronomical controversy and its significance in the history of cosmology. The
project will be done in collaboration with Richard Kremer at Dartmouth College,
who is funded separately for this work through grant SBR9720672.
