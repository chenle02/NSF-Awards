The project continues a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
Scholarship program for undergraduate and graduate students majoring in computer
science, engineering technology, and mathematics majors over a four-year. The
project provides scholarships for academically talented, financially needy
students, enabling them to enter the high technology workforce following
completion of a baccalaureate or masters degree. The project accomplishes the
following objectives: increases the number of graduates and the retention of
students in the three disciplines, provides enhanced educational opportunities,
improves student support services, and strengthens partnerships between the
CSEMS departments and high technology industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, the program maintains a group 30 students each year to receive a
$3000 scholarship. These students are recruited from MTSU and from surrounding
community colleges via announcements, informational brochures, the MTSU CSEMS
web page, and personal contact with the mentors. The students are selected based
on their major field of study, their financial need, their academic standing in
the university and in their department, and letters of recommendation from their
major professors. In addition to receiving the scholarship funds, participating
students are assigned a faculty mentor in their department with whom they meet
at least twice per semester to insure they remain on track for graduation, to
determine any additional needs they may have, and to provide assistance in
career placement.&lt;br/&gt;
