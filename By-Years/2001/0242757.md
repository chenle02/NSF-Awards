&lt;br/&gt; Level of Detail Selection Using a Perceptual Error
Metric&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will investigate the use of visual
difference metrics in&lt;br/&gt;level of detail calculations. The research will
make it possible to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate the visual detectability of changes to an
object&lt;br/&gt;representation in addition to the geometric difference that
such&lt;br/&gt;modifications make to the object's surface definition. Factors
that&lt;br/&gt;will be taken into account using a single visual metric
include&lt;br/&gt;eyepoint position and surface texture. The context in which
the&lt;br/&gt;object is placed, including the effect of lighting, will also
be&lt;br/&gt;evaluated. The research will explore the impact that each
dimension&lt;br/&gt;has on the final level of detail and will derive an
efficient visual&lt;br/&gt;difference metric that can be used in conjunction
with existing&lt;br/&gt;geometric measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
