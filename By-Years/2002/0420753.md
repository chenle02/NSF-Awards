Florida Tech is constructing a new Physical Sciences building, which will become
the new home of the Physics &amp; Space Sciences and Chemistry departments in
January 2005. The handicapped-accessible facility will include an observing deck
on the roof equipped with 15 piers for 20cm instructional telescopes and an
observatory dome to house a research-grade optical telescope. MRI funds will be
used to acquire a 61cm automated Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope, which
will be Internet-accessible as well as conventionally operated.
