Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a
modern hardware laboratory that supports a tightly coupled introductory course
in power electronics and a senior design project emphasis in this area. It is
adapting a highly successful pedagogical approach and model laboratory developed
at a leading program in this field at the University of Minnesota. The approach
uses a building-block model to uniformly analyze all commonly used converter
topologies, thereby allowing coverage of even advanced topics in the
introductory course. The PI is modifying the model program by adding a special
emphasis on the design aspects of power electronics, an introduction to digital
control, and new experiments on the emerging field of power management. The
evaluation effort is using student surveys, visits by local employers, and
employer surveys to assess the effect of the approach on improving student
learning, on attracting students to the field, and in providing skilled
graduates in this field. Dissemination is being accomplished through
participation in a widely attended, national workshop program on power
electronics educations and through the seminar program of a power systems
consortium with 13 university and 40 industry members.&lt;br/&gt;
