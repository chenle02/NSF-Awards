The focus of this program at the university of Southern Mississippi is to
introduce young scholars to practicing scientists in research laboratory
settings. Ten high school students will be brought together during the summer
for an intensive, structured program which will combine scientific field,
laboratory, and classroom experience. These young scholars will have an
opportunity to nurture potential research skills, while working in laboratories
with research mentors, as well as gain valuable knowledge in classes in computer
usage, research methodology, and scientific writing skills. In addition there
will be an opportunity to participate in field experiences and interact with
scientists during evening seminars.
