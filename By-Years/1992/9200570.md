Site grant support is requested for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program. The program gives undergraduates majoring in physics and closely
related disciplines experience in the various geoscience research fields, with
an emphasis on high- latitude studies. Many of the interns are the best students
from small liberal arts colleges, and this program is likely their only
opportunity for in-depth exposure to geophysics research before they make
decisions regarding graduate school. In this program, interns are assigned to
work with individual principal investigators on assigned projects. In addition,
there is an organized series of weekly lectures and field trips to expose
interns to other fields beyond the scope of their own project. Clerical support
is also requested to continue a running survey of the impact of previous REU
programs on educational and career choices of former interns, dating back to
1987.
