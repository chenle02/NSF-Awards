Research will be conducted on a number of current topics of interest in
condensed matter physics. Studies of holes in the two-dimensional quantum
antiferromagnet will be continued, with attention to the general question of
their relevance to the electronic structure of copper-oxygen planes in high
temperature superconductors. Possible spiral states will be investigated. The
unusual vorticity stain correlations found in earlier numerical computations
will be explored.
