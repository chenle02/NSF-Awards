Brevard Teaching and Research Laboratories is seeking assistance in the
acquisition of a Perstorp Flow Solution III dual channel autoanalyzer to perform
automated nutrient analyses. There are currently several research projects
underway which would be greatly enhanced by the acquisition of this instrument.
These projects focus upon the evaluation of water quality conditions within the
Indian River Lagoon ecosystem, an estuary located on the east coast of Florida.
At present, Brevard Labs must rely upon tedious, obsolete, manual techniques to
perform nutrient analyses, greatly limiting the scope and success of these
research activities. Brevard Labs operates as a joint-use facility, and all
instrumentation is available to the entire regional research community through
an open-door policy. As a direct support organization of Brevard Community
College, research training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as
visiting scientists, is one of the principal missions of Brevard Labs. As
autoanalyers such as that proposed herein are considered standard to performing
many research activities, the training made possible with this instrument
acquisition will have wide-spread applicability.
