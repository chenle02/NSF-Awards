This action is to support the activities of the Technical Committee on
Centrifuge Testing of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and
Foundation Engineering (ISSMFE). Geotechnical centrifuges are used for
experiments on earth structures. This international committee was formed in
1981, its purpose being: 1) to promote cooperation and the exchange of
information on centrifuge testing and instrumentation; 2) to encourage the
exploration of the potential of centrifuge testing in disaster reduction
studies, in particular as a contribution to the International Decade of Natural
Disaster Reduction (IDNDR); and 3) to organize an international conference
approximately every 5 years. The next conference is being held at the University
of Colorado in Boulder, June 13-14, 1991. This action is to provide partial
support for the "International Conference: Centrifuge 1991" in Boulder,
Colorado, June 13-14, 1991; as well as the activities of the committee in
organizing this conference, and in planning the next series of regional and
international conferences on centrifuge modeling.
