The investigator and his colleagues study the problem of extracting features of
images and their properties via scales and local scales using the classical
theory of function spaces and partial differential equations. They use the
knowledge of scales and local scales in images to obtain an efficient method for
image decompositions and multiscale representations, which are image dependent.
Finally, they extend the theory of scales and local scales to higher dimensional
data (graphs and manifolds), and to find efficient computational methods and
algorithms to solve these problems.

Reducing a complex data to simpler representations that can be more easily
analyzed is an important task in mathematics and information science. The study
of scales and local scales provides a tool for doing this task. In particular,
it provides a tool for organizing and clustering the internal multiscale
structures of the data. Applications include medical imaging, hyperspectral
imaging, satellite imaging, material science, terrain data analysis, and
dimension reduction in higher dimensional data.
