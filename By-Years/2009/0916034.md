This workshop proposal requests funds to partially support a meeting to bring
together researchers who have developed formal methods and applied them to
industrial use, in order to discuss the current state of applicability of formal
methods. The meeting takes place at the cusp of two related conference VMCAI and
POPL, the first being a conference about verification and the second being a
conference about programming languages. It is highly desirable to get
representatives of the group together for this meeting. If such a consensus is
reached, an Organizing Committee will be formed and plan a follow-up workshop
that will allow for in-depth examination of the issues raised.
