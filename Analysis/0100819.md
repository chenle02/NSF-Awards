The first part of the proposed work concerns Monge-Ampere equations, including
extensions of classical results of Jorgens, Calabi and Pogorelov which state
that entire solutions to such equations are quadratic polynomials. Dirichlet
problem for Monge-Ampere equations in exterior domains of Euclidean space will
also be investigated. Related problems concerning the affine Bernstein problem
will be studied. The second part of the proposed work concerns best Sobolev
inequality on Riemannian manifolds and the Yamabe problem on manifolds with
boundary. This includes efforts in establishing a new form of best Sobolev
inequalities on Riemannian manifolds as well as existence and compactness
results concerning the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary. Sharp
pointwise estimates to blow up solutions play important roles in such studies.

The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it
is to create qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This
may include answers to questions about existence, uniqueness, smoothness, and
growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
