9532010 KNOX In 1996 Scripps Institute of Oceanography will operate research
vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and ROBERT GORDON SPROUL in support of NSF-
sponsored oceanographic research. MELVILLE will mainly support Marine Geology
and Geophysical cruises in the south Pacific, requiring SEA BEAM 2000. Mid-year
the vessel will work stand-down for two months. MELVILLE will end the year in
off the coast of Chile. A mid-life refit is planned for R/V NEW HORIZON in early
1996. The vessel will reenter service in May and will support a variety
biological and physical oceanography off the west coast of the US and Mexico.
R/V ROBERT GORDON SPROUL will do short cruises off the coast of California and
one cruise in the Columbia River estuary. The SIO vessels are part of a fleet
utilized by the National Science Foundation in support of oceanographic
research. Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from the ship's crew members. Increasingly research projects
require equipment which must be permanently installed on the vessel, thus
requiring specialized ships. The ships do not operate the same as general
cargo/fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of
vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
universities and research institutes around the country.
