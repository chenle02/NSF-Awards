This project addresses basic research in the optimal design of structures. The
research experimentally investigates practical methods of tailoring structures
to have optimal dynamic properties. This is a four-phase study comprising
passive structural properties; understanding the fluid structure interaction
phenomena; incorporating active sensors and actuators into the structure; and
using distributed processors in the structural fabric.
