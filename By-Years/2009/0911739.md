This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Dean M. Roddick at the University of Wyoming
to carry out fundamental studies on the coordination properties and catalytic
activity of new classes of fluorinated transition metal compounds. Exceptionally
active olefin oligomerization platinum catalysts have been identified. Expansion
of this chemistry to related platinum, palladium, and nickel systems provides a
new approach to the efficient synthesis of olefin-derived products. The
chemistry of novel acceptor pincer complexes of platinum, iridium, and ruthenium
provides a foundation for the development of new, more active alkane
dehydrogenation and hydrogen transfer catalysts.

New catalysts and approaches to the conversion of simple olefins to complex
products (polymers, plastics, etc.) impact a large cross section of chemical
industry. The development of efficient approaches to selective hydrocarbon
chemistry remains a primary modern challenge, and has critical ramifications in
the creation of major chemical feedstocks in a post-fossil fuel world economy.
