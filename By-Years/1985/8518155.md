The studies of the safety of structures must incorporate concepts covering three
subareas. A perfect part, where St. Venant's principle is invalid; and errors in
design and construction, which occur in both parts. This project is concerned
with the identification of such errors in the field and their inclusion, in a
blind fashion, into laboratory tests of imperfect parts. A group of experts are
used to offer opinions concerning the capacity of the parts after simulated
seismic loading, which has not been extended to destruction. The experts are
asked to suggest remedial measures as well as verbal opinions of the structural
competence. Continuing loading to failure will provide a measure of success of
such opinions. Where possible Bayesian statistics will be used, but where the
axioms of probability theory are not satisfied, reliance is made on fuzzy set
theory.
