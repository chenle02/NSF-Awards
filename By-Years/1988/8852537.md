This project will support the expansion and modernization of an undergraduate
mathematics laboratory for the sophomore differential equations course at the
Georgia Institute of Technology. It is being funded under the Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated goal of improving
"the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop
new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses
in science, mathematics, or engineering." The faculty will introduce both
computational and geometrical components into this course by 1) expanding and
modernizing the existing facility, 2) developing course materials and notes that
will incorporate these new components into the course, and 3) building a
collection of physical models which can be used to convey an understanding of
some of the applications of ordinary differential equations.
