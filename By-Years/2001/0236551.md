The original proposal seeks funding to build an Antarctic Infrared Observatory
(AIRO), a new 2-m diameter infrared telescope to be deployed at the South Pole.
Antarctica provides a uniquely low thermal background for ground-based infrared
astronomy. With only a modest aperture an infrared telescope in Antarctica can
achieve extraordinary sensitivity. AIRO intends to exploit these unique
conditions surveying the infrared sky and performing temporal monitoring
studies. However, AIRO currently lacks a detailed conceptual design for the
telescope and for its proposed first instrument, a 2 color (K + L, and K + M
band) wide-field imaging camera. Developing such a design is critical to AIRO's
success. The design will flow from the scientific requirements that maximize the
scientific return from the low Antarctic thermal backgrounds. During the period
covered by the revised effort, the proposers will (1) establish the detailed
scientific requirements for the telescope and camera, (2) develop a conceptual
optical and mechanical design for the infrared camera, (3) develop a conceptual
optical design for the telescope, and (4) obtain robust cost estimates for the
camera and telescope. This engineering study will increase the safety margin and
mitigate risk in building the entire telescope in Antarctica. Moreover, a more
realistic assessment of the technical and scientific requirements will result in
a more accurate cost estimate.
