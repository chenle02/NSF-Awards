This award to the State University of New York College at Buffalo is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire instrumentation for the measurement of the properties of
aquatic systems. The institution is committed to matching the NSF contribution
for this equipment. The instrumentation will be used to enhance the
undergraduate geology and environmental studies curriculum at two colleges and
will provide students with the opportunity to acquire and process field data for
aquatic systems.
