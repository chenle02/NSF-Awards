BLAST 2013, 2014, 2015 The 2013-2015 BLAST conferences will be the fifth through
eighth in a series of yearly meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics,
with the BLAST 2013 meeting being held during August 5 to 9 at Chapman
University in Orange, California. The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean
algebra, lattice theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-
theoretic topology.New Mexico State University will host the 2014 meeting and
the University of North Texas will host the 2015 meeting.

Each year this grant will support the participation of 15-20 graduate students
and recent Ph.D.'s and 12 speakers. Participation by women and minorities will
be actively sought and encouraged. The conference series provides an environment
for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in
several related areas of the foundations of mathematics and provides them with a
venue to showcase their own work.
