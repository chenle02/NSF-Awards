This project aims to improve simulations in ocean general circulation models
and, ultimately, coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models by better
representing high-latitude processes associated with oceanic convection and sea
ice in the Southern Ocean. There are three major objectives: (a) to enhance the
resolution of the sea-ice component model in an ocean general circulation model,
(b) to improve boundary layer coupling with the overlying atmosphere, and (c) to
investigate the impact of a new plume convection scheme on variability. Key
elements in the formation of Antarctic shelf waters leading to Antarctic Bottom
Water (leads and polynyas) are particularly
highlighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on previous work by
examining additional processes and using more sophisticated model physics. The
project will contribute towards the education of two Ph.D. students and promote
collaboration between the Texas A&amp;M Research Foundation and other research
institutions. The results are expected to lead to an improved understanding of
the global ocean and would have some impact on future climate change
predictions, and will be published in refereed scientific journals and presented
at appropriate conferences.
