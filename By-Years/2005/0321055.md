This MRI award is for instrumentation is to further advance a collaborative
effort between Loras College and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in
research on atomic photoionization at the Advanced Light Source. The research
involves crossing an atomic beam with the low-energy x-rays from beam line 10 at
the ALS to singly ionize argon atoms. Excitation of the ion requires an
interaction between electrons, since the energy of the ionizing photon must be
partitioned between the ejected photoelectron and the residual excited
electrons. Angular momentum partitioning during this electron-electron
interaction is studied by analyzing the polarization as well as the wavelength
of the subsequent fluorescent decay of the residual excited ion. The low-energy
grating provided through this award will increase the spectral capabilities of
the beam line. At the same time, it will offer additional opportunities for
undergraduate students at Loras College to participate in research in the rich
environment of a national laboratory. The instrumentation will also become part
of the infrastructure open to all researchers proposing experiments on the beam
line.
