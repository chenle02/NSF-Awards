9302923 Feferman Modern programming languages manipulate potentially infinite
objects (streams, arbitrary precision reals, etc.). Examples include: Haskell,
ML, and other functional languages, Ada (for example tasks and processes), and
C++ (objects being essentially higher-order entities). Real-time applications
have specifications that involve both analog/continuous and discrete entities
and relations between these domains. To develop formal methods for functional
programming languages for such applications, and to enforce modular construction
of specifications and programs for programming-in-the-large, one needs more
general (non-algebraic) notions of abstract data types (ADTs) than have been
treated in most of the literature. Several questions must then be addressed,
including the following: How can the notion of ADT be enriched (generalized
ADTs) to encompass such objects? What does it mean to compute with these
objects? It is important to have an understanding beyond just manipulation of
finite representations. What is a suitable formal notation for enriching logical
theories by declaring such ADTs? This research would focus on the following
three closely related topics: computation over generalized ADTs, systems for
definition of generalized ADTs, and substantial verification examples worked out
within the generalized ADT setting. The project will continue work within the
framework of variable type (VT) theories. ***
