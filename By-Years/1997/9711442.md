Theoretical and numerical investigation of momentum, heat and mass transport
processes in low Reynolds number two-phase flow with particles in the Stokes
range will be undertaken. The shear-induced particle and fluid diffusivities in
a non-uniform shear flow will be modeled and numerically simulated. The method
to determine the volumetric particle flux due to a gradient of shear rate will
be established. Kinetic theory of suspension mechanics will be applied in
conjunction with numerical methods to calculate drift velocity of particles due
to concentration and shear rate gradients. A statistical theory of macroscopic
phenomena in low-conducting suspensions subject to strong electric fields will
be further developed. The effects of conductivity and interparticle interactions
in electrorheological fluids and in dielectrophoresis will be modeled and
introduced in the simulations. This project is relevant to the suspension
rheology and flow properties of electrorheological fluids.
