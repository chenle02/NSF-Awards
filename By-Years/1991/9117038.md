This no-cost award will support the participation of Professor Gerald Peterson,
Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Massachusetts, in a
U.S.-Japan cooperative research project with Professor Tadaaki Tamae, Tohoku
University, Sendai, Japan. This project, which also involves other participants
from the University of Massachusetts and from Shizuoka University in Japan, will
study the bonding of the neutron to the proton by sending a steady beam of high-
energy electrons onto a container of deuterium cooled to such a low temperature
that the deuterium gas will turn to a liquid. This is a no-cost proposal for
NSF. It is required because the Japanese counterpart proposal to the Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) requests funding for the Japanese
investigators.
