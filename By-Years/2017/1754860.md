This conference award will provide partial support to the 2018 Microtechnologies
for Medicine and Biology (MMB) Meeting in Monterey, California, on March 26-28,
2018. This meeting will provide an outstanding opportunity for networking
between young investigators, including trainees, and leaders in the field of
microtechnologies. The themes of the conference include: mechanobiology and
biophysics; diagnostic and detection technologies; microphysiological models of
living systems; bioassay development; and 3D printing and biomanufacturing. The
structure of the conference, including a single room format and 90-second
"flash" presentations by poster presenters to introduce their research, will
provide a multidisciplinary perspective to all meeting attendees and update
everyone on the latest developments within the field. The conference attendees
include stakeholders from the clinical and biomedical industry arenas, which
allows for significant exchange of ideas in the furtherance of scientific
advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide financial support for
four young investigators and four trainees to attend the international meeting.
Awardees will be selected based on a submitted, 2-page abstract and preference
will be given to individuals from groups that are underrepresented in their
science and engineering fields. Over 50 percent of attendees have historically
been trainees. Substantial opportunities are provided for networking, including
between young investigators/trainees and leaders in the field. In addition,
partial travel support will be provided to two female keynote speakers. These
individuals will be available for networking with and mentoring of the young
investigators and trainees attending the meeting.
