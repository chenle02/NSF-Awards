9314071 Pegna This proposal work will apply the emerging technology of Laser-
induced Chemical Vapor Deposition (LCVD) to the fabrication of 3-D
micromechanical devices. The proposed work will involve modification of the
planar LCVD process to fabricate 3-D objects at micro-dimensions. The method
will 1)pattern material into arbitrary shapes including internal features, 2)be
used to fabricate an entire 3-D structure, 3)rapidly adapt to new products
through the use of CAD tools, and 4)be applicable to a wide variety of
materials. ***
