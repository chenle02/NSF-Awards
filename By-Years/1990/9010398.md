The discovery of a new substance, found in the blood serum of many vertebrates,
including humans, has been purified and preliminary biochemical evidence
indicates that the factor is a special type of albumin. The factor activates a
very general intracellular messenger system which is involved in many vital
processes. Studies show that this serum factor inhibits the multiplication of
cancer cells and also causes the retraction of nerve cell processes. The
substance is not present in normal cerebrospinal fluid, but it is present in
cerebrospinal fluid of patients following neurotrauma. This factor may play a
role in injury and repair of the nervous system. The main goal of this project
is to determine the amino acid sequence and structure of the active site of the
serum factor using enzymatic and chemical fragmentation of the factor combined
with methods of protein purification and structural analysis. Blood serum and
albumin are widely used in medicine and in tissue culture. Gaining more
knowledge about this factor will have important implications for both basic and
medical sciences.
