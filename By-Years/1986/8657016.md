Dr. Ken Feldman is a new awardee under the Presidential Young Investigators
Program, with interests in synthetic organic chemistry. Dr. Feldman's experience
was enriched with a stay in industry before joining the staff at the
Pennsylvania State University. The emphasis of the research is on the
development of novel bond-forming processes useful for the synthesis of complex
natural products. The research involves two projects, both of which are designed
to effect a multicomponent condensation of a finite and predetermined number of
small "monomer" units. By this methodology, one can efficiently construct a
complex organic structure from simple precursors. Both projects utilize reaction
sequences which include initiation, propagation, and termination stages. By
precisely controlling the timing of these three events, one can control the
length of the propagation portion of the sequence and hence control the overall
number of "monomer" units which are incorporated in the product molecule.
Ultimately, these "oligomeric" segments will be useful in the synthesis of
natural products which themselves have small segments of repeating molecular
units, such as the polyacetate-derived polyene antibiotics.
