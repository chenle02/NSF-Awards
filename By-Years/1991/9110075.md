With the fast deployment of fiber optics as a transmission medium, a speed
mismatch problem has been created between transmission and switching. In recent
years, the speed of transmission facilities has been improved by several orders
of magnitude. In comparison, the progress made in switching seems to be
relatively slow. To meet the challenges posed by the increasing transmission
speed, laboratories around the world are working on new photonic and fast
electronic switching devices. These recent developments will heavily influence
the future direction of switching research. But it is universally recognized
that advances in switching devices are not enough; new architectures are needed.
The component-by-component approach simply cannot make the best use of the new
technology. The purpose of this research is to explore novel architectures and
design paradigms for constructing high-speed switching systems which can harness
the recent advances in the switching technology. Specifically, a new class of
switching networks has been identified which possess the following
characteristics: self-routing, fault-tolerance, easy path hunt, easy fault-
diagnosis and low crosstalk for the directionalcouplers implementation. They are
very promising for high speed switching. The research is expected to lead to
development of new multicast-multirate electronic and photonic switching
architectures and performance models based on this new class of networks.
