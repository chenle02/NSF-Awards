There is renewed interest in the importance of fluids in a variety of crustal
processes such as granite genesis, metamorphism and heat and mass transport.
This project will study relationships between granite magmatism, metamorphism
and fluid flow using the very young Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Massif in the Pakistan
Himalaya. This area records rapid uplift and denudation that appears near coevil
with both granite formation and possible topographically driven fluid flaw. This
hypothesis will be tested by an integrated petrologic, stable-isotopic,
geochronologic and structural study of the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh area. Data
obtained using these techniques are expected to provide constraints on the role
of surface-driven fluids in the petrogenesis of granites and metamorphic rocks
in the NW Himalaya and in compressional mountain belts in general.
