9457519 Kim This project is aimed at designing, evaluating, and implementing a
high-speed multimedia network based on the ATM technology and other
alternatives. Critical research issues include modular high-performance switch
architecture, user-access and congestion control of multimedia traffic, and
performance evaluation of a resulting network architecture with multiple-hop
tandem nodes. The proposed multicast ATM switch differs significantly from
currently existing switches in terms of switch performance and hardware
complexity. The main characteristics of the switch architecture include: shared-
memory queue, distributed control, multicast capability, and low hardware cost.
Research will include implementing and extensively testing multiple 16x16
switches using real user data and evaluating performance of a multiple-hop ATM
network using a recursive queueing model and simulation tools. Research will
also include the investigation of the impact of heterogeneous and unbalanced
multimedia traffic on the performance of multiple-hop ATM networks. The
principal investigator (PI) will use a network testbed consisting of the
proposed switches to evaluate various traffic control algorithms using real
network traffic. Success results from these experiments will improve analytical
techniques using queueing models and validate the accuracy of traffic and
network models.
