Computers, ancillary equipment and software are provided to establish a
behavioral science computer laboratory for courses in political science,
psychology, and sociology in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences.
The laboratory provides social science majors, nonscience majors, and future
secondary school teachers with hands on experience in the use of microcomputers
and exposure to the scientific and technical aspects of the social sciences. Ten
microcomputers and associated hardware, disc drives monitors, and four printers,
are provided. Software includes a statistical package, data sets covering a wide
range of topics in domestic and foreign affairs, and experiments designed for
interactive student use. Students apply behavioral science concepts and
methodologies to real data sets, become familiar with contemporary statistical
packages, manipulate variables in relation to classic experiments, and design
their own research projects. The award will be matched by an equal amount from
the grantee.
