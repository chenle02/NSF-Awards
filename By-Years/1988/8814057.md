In this one year planning grant, mathematicians, mathematics educators,
engineers and scientists of the University of New Hampshire with high school
teachers and Technical Education Research Center will develop and refine
mathematical, educational and technological perspectives for a three semester
calculus curriculum. The project will first conduct a baseline assessment of
first semester calculus students at UNH and high schools, to determine their
algebra and trigonometry skills, as well as their understanding of essential
precalculus concepts. Implementation of the reorganized and streamlined
curriculum requires a clear perception of the students' knowledge base and
misconceptions, as well as the students active participation in their own
learning. The curriculum will start with the concept of approximation, whose
idealization will lead to derivatives, integrals and continuity. Biweekly
seminars to develop prototype materials, outline modules and core units will be
held during the academic year. Some components will be tested in high schools
during the spring semester, and at UNH in the summer of 1989. UNH is providing
almost 55% of the project's costs.
