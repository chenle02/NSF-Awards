This project develops perturbation techniques for deriving bounds on the
relative error of singular values and eigenvalues, as well as bounds on the
error angles of singular vectors and eigenvectors in terms of a relative gap.
Deflation and convergence criteria based on these bounds have the potential to
lead to highly accurate and efficient QR-type and Jacobi algorithms for
computing eigenvalue, singular value and URV decompositions. In the context of
the singular value decomposition of a matrix B, a class of perturbations is
investigated which represents all possible that do not change the rank of B. In
particular, it includes componentwise relative perturbations of bidiagonal and
biacyclic matrices, and perturbations that annihilate an offdiagonal block in a
block triangular matrix. So far, many existing relative perturbations bounds
have been derived for singular values and vectors of bidiagonal matrices from
general results for this class of perturbations. Also, new perturbation results
have been proved for singular values and vectors of biacyclic, triangular and
shifted triangular matrices. These results are extended to the generalized
eigenvalue problem, and to the eigenvalue problems for structured and non-
Hermitian matrices.
