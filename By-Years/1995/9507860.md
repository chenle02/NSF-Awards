This award provides support for the 1995 ACEDB Conference and Workshop. ACEDB
is a database which focuses on the biology of the intensively studied nematode
worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The workshop will facilitate communication between
database developers and users leading to continued rapid evolution of software
and techniques for managing the increasingly large volume of information on this
widely used model species. The 1995 workshop will be the fourth in a series of
workshops on ACEDB dating back to 1992.
