9528313 Cummings The proposed research project will analyze an existing and
unique international database, the Carnegie Survey of the Professoriate, to
compare the status of women faculty in science and engineering within 14
countries (the United States, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden,
Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Israel, and Australia).
This international database is currently underutilized. A few individual country
analyses have been conducted, but no comparisons across countries have been
made. The proposed analysis of characteristics of institutions and national
factors which influence women in pursuing careers in science and engineering
faculty is of significant interest to NSF and science policymakers.
