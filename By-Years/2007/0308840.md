DMS-0308840&lt;br/&gt;Tibor Beke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CARGO incubation
award made under solicitation
&lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;The
main motivation of this project is computational cartography.
The&lt;br/&gt;underlying mathematical observation is that symbolic map layers
are&lt;br/&gt;isotopy invariants. Transcribing the topological information that
resides&lt;br/&gt;in a map amounts, in practice, to specifying an isotopy class
of nested,&lt;br/&gt;labelled planar graphs. The deliverable of this project is
a portable&lt;br/&gt;specification language for doing that. While the case of
two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;planar configurations is essentially solved, its
extension to surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;higher genus is of interest even as
fundamental research. Its importance&lt;br/&gt;is also highlighted by its
connection to the description of solid bodies,&lt;br/&gt;such as those
encountered in computer-aided design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present-day
Geographic Information Systems tend to treat maps as&lt;br/&gt;superimposed
layers of graphic images. But a map also contains&lt;br/&gt;information that is
topological, meaning, metric-independent. Examples of&lt;br/&gt;this are road or
other infrastructure networks, where one is only&lt;br/&gt;interested in the
connectivity between certain nodes, and rough&lt;br/&gt;qualitative features of
the lines connecting them. The storage, indexing&lt;br/&gt;and transmission of
this symbolic topological information may be both more&lt;br/&gt;important and
easier than that of the entire graphical image. The authors&lt;br/&gt;outline an
algorithm for schematic rendering, and a method of attacking&lt;br/&gt;the map
isomorphism problem, where by map one may mean both actual images&lt;br/&gt;and
maps encoded by their proposed scheme. Both of those ideas,
however,&lt;br/&gt;are in need of experimental verification.&lt;br/&gt;
