This proposal describes the design and testing of a new class of amperometric
glucose sensors in which electrical communication between the flavin redox
centers of glucose oxidase and an electrode is achieved via a network of donor-
acceptor relays chemically bound to a poly(ethylene oxide), or PEO, backbone.
These polymeric relay systems combine several important features found in
previous polymeric electron transfer relay systems: a) a flexible polymer
backbone; b) the relays are attached to flexible side chains; c) PEO effectively
complexes simple cationic species, such as potassium and sodium ions, which can
give the polymer itself some cationic character and increase the interaction
between the polymer and the negatively charged glucose oxidase molecules. The
proposed research plan for Phase I concerns the development of this class of
sensor through the following approach: a) synthesis and electrochemical
characterization of several mediator (ferrocene) containing PEO materials; b)
study of the interaction between flavin redox centers of glucose oxidase and the
PEO-bound electron transfer relay system through investigation of these new
flexible polymers in enzyme electrode configurations; c) covalent attachment of
glucose oxidase to ferrocene-modified PEO in order to further increase the
interaction between the enzyme and the mediators, to minimize competitive
reoxidation of reduced glucose oxidase by dissolved oxygen, and to improve the
long-term stability of the sensor.
