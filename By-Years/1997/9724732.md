9724732 Byrne This is a 12-month award proposed by Drs. Timothy Byrne and Jean
Crespi, the University of Connecticut and Professor Louis S. Y. Teng, National
Taiwan University. Dr. Byrne requests funds for 11 U.S. scientists and two
graduate students to travel to attend the bilateral meeting on the Taiwan ARC-
Continent Collision in Chungil, Taiwan between November 4 and 9, 1997. The
purpose of this workshop is to better understand the boundary between the
uplifted and exhumed pre-Tertiary metamorphic basement and the apparently down-
dropped and sediment-filled Longitudinal Valley. The Taiwan ARC-area is a unique
site for studying crust deformation. This workshop is a timely opportunity for
U.S. and Taiwan scientists to compare data and past research results prior to a
new study, which will be carried out by Dr. Byrne on the tectonic exhumation in
an ARC continent collision site in Taiwan. This project also addresses an
important focus area: a unique site in an important geophysical area with little
or no data. This project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science
Council and the NSF.
