Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2012 Biomineralization
GRC/GRS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Biomineralization is an
important area of research at the interface of biology,&lt;br/&gt;geochemistry,
materials science, and medicine. The topic is significant for human health
(covering, for example, aspects of bone and tooth diseases) as well as for
engineering science by providing models for bioinspired engineering. The
conference has been designed to maximize interactions that can serve to
enlighten participants from diverse backgrounds and foster new,
interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The
conference brings together a broad spectrum of scientists with interests in
biomineralization, who work at the interfaces of biology, geochemistry,
materials science, osteochondral physiology, and regenerative medicine. The
conjoined Gordon Research Seminar will enable 50 students and young career
researchers to present their work and hold fruitful discussions immediately
prior to the GRC. Support for participant attendance will be provided with
appropriate attention to the NSF priority of broadening participation.
