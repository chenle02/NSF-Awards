This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Texas A&M University. His Ph.D.
research was in the area of plant developmental biology with strong protein
chemistry backround. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research
in the laboratory of Dr. Scott Emer at University of California at San Diego.
The proposed research entitled "Arabidopsis homologs for yeast genes encoding a
protein complex for vacuolar protein sorting" will broaden the training of the
Fellow into molecular genetics and cell biology.
