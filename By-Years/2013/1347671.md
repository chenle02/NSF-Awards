This Widening Implementation &amp; Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms
(WIDER) award is providing the College of Natural Sciences at California State
University San Bernardino (CSUSB) with a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) that
is identifying, studying, and piloting evidence-based teaching practices in this
University's areas of greatest need. In light of rapidly increasing enrollments
and declining budgets, CSUSB seeks to develop and implement new teaching methods
that improve student learning, and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decision
to create a FLC is based on evidence that FLCs are a more effective form of
faculty professional development than other approaches. The FLC is focusing on
improving teaching in large classes, employing online instructional methods,
promoting engaged learning activities, using co-curricular activities, working
with diverse populations, implementing appropriate assessment techniques, and
evaluating teaching. Eight specific gateway courses with large enrollments and
particularly high failure rates are the initial focus of the project.
Thereafter, the FLC is collecting data to identify the extent to which faculty
in the college use evidence-based teaching practices. The FLC is studying best
practices in strategic planning and organizational change in order to develop a
model for how evidence-based teaching practices can be adopted throughout the
college and university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
spread the most promising practices throughout CSUSB, thus improving student
achievement. CSUSB is a Hispanic Serving Institution; the College of Natural
Sciences has a 50% Hispanic population, 22% other minority groups population,
and 61% female population. The results of this project hold promise to benefit
STEM programs throughout the state and the Nation, especially as CSUSB
disseminates information about evidence-based teaching practices in STEM
disciplines and shares lessons learned about facilitating change in teaching
practices.
