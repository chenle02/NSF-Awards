Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9802479 Principal Investigator: Gang Tian

The project addresses some fundamental problems from symplectic geometry and
Kaehler geometry. The first part concerns the existence of Kaehler-Einstein
metrics with positive scalar curvature. These metrics provide solutions of the
Einstein equation on Riemannian manifolds. In the second part, the principal
investigator (PI) intends to further study new invariants, often refered as GW-
invariants, of general symplectic manifolds and find more applications to
Hamiltonian systems, symplectic topology and geometry. This part also contains
very basic problem of understanding structure of GW-invariants and its possible
relation to particular integrable systems. The PI also suggests to study some
related nonlinear PDE problems which arise from physics and geometry.

Problems in this project were motivated by our desire of probing mathematics of
basic physical laws under suitable conditions. For example, GW-invariants were
inspired by a sigma model theory coupled with gravity in mathematical physics,
and they extend classical enumerative geometry which involves counting curves
through a number of points or intersections of curves. The resolutions of these
problems will provide new mathematical insights of Einstein equation in general
relativity, quantum field theory, mirror symmetry phenomenon in string theory.
Our study will also deepen our understanding properties of symplectic manifolds,
algebraic manifolds and Calabi-Yau spaces.
