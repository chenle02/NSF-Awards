DMS-0231521 Ira Wayne Lewis

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics of Texas Tech University will host
the Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference 2003. This conference will
feature over 20 invited speakers and will have special sessions in each of the
areas of Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General Topology, Geometric Group
Theory, Geometric Topology and Topological Algebras, as well as providing
opportunities for contributed talks. This conference will build on a heritage of
such conferences held each year since 1967.

This conference will provide a forum for an international group of up to 200
researchers to present and discuss the latest research results and open
questions. Topics covered will range over a broad spectrum but all have a common
link to the core of topology. Among topics to be discussed by invited speakers
are virtual knot theory, fixed points and periodicity, bottlenecks in dendroids,
indecomposable Banach spaces and applications of topology. The invited speakers
have been nominated by a steering committee of leading researchers in the areas.
Graduate student participation will also be strongly encouraged and supported.
