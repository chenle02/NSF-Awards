A range of disasters -- including flood, hurricane, typhons, violent storms,
earthquakes, collapsed infrastructure, and pandemic -- pose the greatest threat
to the poor and most vulnerable in society as they are more likely to live in
homes that are more vulnerable to the impact of these disasters. Reliance on
‘hard’ engineering and infrastructure solutions alone cannot solve this problem.
This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in
Engineering (BRITE) project aims to integrate findings from past research with
findings from a series of multi-level stakeholder engagement activities into a
framework that integrates the roles of human, social and natural capital in
reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. The aim is to identify viable
pathways for improved resilience for particularly vulnerable, low-income housing
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities are designed to
address resilience to multiple disaster events and types, and to focus
characteristics of subgroups within the target population: low-income housing
residents. Through a multi-level, stakeholder case study approach that draws
lessons from the experiences of vulnerable populations, sources and determinants
of resilience will be examined. A sensitivity analysis will be performed to
identify plausibility indicators for what is and what is not likely to support
the resilience of low-income housing to specific sets of
shocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
