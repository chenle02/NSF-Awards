This is a career advancement award to apply theoretical methods from the study
of interconnection networks to the study of all-optical broadcast networks. The
goal of the research is to develop new scheduling algorithms to improve the
performance of broadcast networks that use wavelength division multiplexing. The
scheduling algorithms will take into account an arbitrary set of system
parameters that change with technology. The research will provide insight into
the user of multiple wavelengths and tunable devices in optical networks.
