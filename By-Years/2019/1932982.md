This proposal in the education and workforce strand proposes a workshop to
develop research-practice partnerships (RPPs) among teachers, administrators and
researchers already engaged in the CSforAll programs. The workshops would bring
together teams who would apply to participate in the workshop. Each team would
bring data that would then be used internally by that team. Topics of the
workshop would address data relevance, sharing and meaning. The overarching
theme would be to find ways to address equity issues in the CS4All community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
