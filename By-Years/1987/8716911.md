The purpose of this research proposal is to conduct an extensive theoretical
study of load balancing for distributed systems. The goal of load balancing is
to utilize the computation resource in a distributed system efficiently.
Typically this is done by transferring jobs that are submitted at a heavily
loaded node for remote execution to a more highly doubled node. The overall
purpose is to help transform the "art" of load balancing into a more precise and
scientific endeavor and to increase the understanding of the general resource-
sharing problem. Distributed systems of computing are being increasingly
impartial, and therefore efficient methods for balancing the work among the
processor need to be developed. Numerous heuristic approaches to this problem
exist, and more continue to be developed. The work in this proposal is an
attempt to establish a theoretical basis for load balancing. All of the
investigators in this research project have published in the general area; they
are highly competent to conduct the research. The research project is being
sponsored primarily by the Naval Research Laboratory under the direction of Dr.
Phillip Hwang.
