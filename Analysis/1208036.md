This mathematics research project in the area of complex dynamics in higher
dimension has three components. The first component investigates the properties
of birational mappings in dimension 2 and higher. Bedford and his collaborators
will use tools from complex analysis and algebraic geometry to analyze
fundamental properties of these mappings. In particular, they will investigate
how to determine the dynamical degrees in all dimensions. The second component
of this project investigates the existence of automorphisms of positive entropy
in complex surfaces and 3-folds. The third component is focused on the complex
Henon family of dynamical systems, which has served as an important model
family. These dynamical systems are represented by quite simple polynomials, but
they exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors. They have been important because
many observed phenomena can actually be proved mathematically.

This mathematics research project is related to the field of study of chaos
theory, which has applications to several disciplines, including physics,
engineering, economics and biology. An important phenomenon in chaos theory is
the so-called butterfly effect, which illustrates the unstable dependence on
initial conditions for a given dynamical system. The Henon functions studied in
this project have been a fertile testing ground for transformations that have
simple formulas but which exhibit the butterfly effect. The study of birational
maps has applications to the field of Lattice Statistical Mechanics (LSM) which
considers materials that have a lattice structure like crystals. LSM provides a
formula for determining the energy and temperature of such a material in terms
of the various interaction energies between the atoms in the lattice. This
formula is very difficult to compute, but in many cases there are fundamental
symmetries which lead to substantial simplifications. These symmetries are given
by birational maps such as those studied in this project, and the amount of
simplification is given by the degree complexity.
