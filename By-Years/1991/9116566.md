The proposed research is intended to exploit opportunities recognized in the
development of the LIGA process for fabrication of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). Direction is provided by potential commercial technology
transfer, including improved MEMS for sensors and the creation of new classes of
devices. A significant portion of the proposed research is in magnetics
technology for MEMS. Design methods and constraints will be analyzed via
electroplated magnetic structures. A cell designed linear magnetic actuator will
be the primary test vehicle. The emphasis will involve output force per unit
chip area considerations, speed and positional accuracy, as well as control
electronics. Rotating magnetic motors will be constructed with compatible gear
boxes. New microsensors such as magnetic proximity sensors will also be
investigated.
