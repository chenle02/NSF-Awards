9506612 Johnson The proposed work will develop new thermal and mechanical
melting models to explain the mantle dynamics that occur during continental
extension, and tie these to new observations on the chemical, isotopic, and
temporal evolution of extension related lavas (ERL) in the Death Valley volcanic
field and adjacent areas. Recent work has cast doubt on simple, previously
proposed models of crust-mantle evolution during large-scale extension of the
crust. Preliminary isotope data, including Hf isotope analyses, provide
important constraints on the depths of ancient and modern melting, metasomatism,
and depletion events, and these data will be used to constrain thermal-
mechanical models. The large and highly extended volcanic field at Death Valley
provides an exceptional opportunity to constrain and evaluate extensional
thermal/melting models of the mantle.
