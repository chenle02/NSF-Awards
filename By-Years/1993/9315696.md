Program checking is a new approach to software fault-tolerance. For a program
that computes a function, a checker tests whether the program's output is
correct for a specific input. Even when the program makes mistakes, the checker
uses the program itself to perform the test by applying the program to several
inputs related to the original one. The checker provides a probabilistic
guarantee of correctness on a particular input on which the program is executed,
whereas formal program verification establishes correctness on all inputs prior
to execution. In this project, traditional fault-tolerance techniques are
combined with program checking to produce new kinds of program checkers that are
effective for programs of practical size. In particular, program checking is
combined with certification trails and with algorithm-based fault-tolerance, a
technique for concurrent error detection. Further, program checking is applied
to operating system algorithms that ensure the truth of predicates such as
mutual exclusion, deadlock avoidance, and serializability of concurrent
transactions.
