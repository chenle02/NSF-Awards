9309759 Webster When the hemoglobin gene (vgb) from the bacterium, Vitreoscilla,
is present in recombinant E. coli carrying the gene for alpha- amylase from
Bacillus stearothermophilus, the production of this enzyme is stimulated. The
main objective of this project is to obtain basic information about the
mechanism of this stimulation. The role of the product of vgb expression,
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VtHb), will be examined using site-directed mutagenesis
to produce inactive and altered proteins. These inactive and altered proteins
will then be tested for a change in the stimulatory effect. VtHb increases under
hypoxic conditions and presumably functions by facilitating respiration under
these conditions. Other planned experiments include extending the basic findings
to other products besides alpha-amylase, and to other bacterial systems.
