Dr. William M. Jackson of the Department of Chemistry, University of California
at Davis, is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the
Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the
molecular dynamics of the photo-dissociation of ions, photon induced ion-pair
formation, and photon induced Rydberg dissociation in various light halo-alkanes
using velocity ion imaging techniques.

This study will provide significant information on the photochemistry of light
halo-alkane hydrocarbons. As well, several under-represented minority students
will be mentored and trained in an area that is somewhat unique in the country
and that requires both experimental and theoretical efforts.
