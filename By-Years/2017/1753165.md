This CAREER award will support a study of how to enhance performance of laser-
driven particle accelerators by controlling laser properties such as the focal
spot quality. Using techniques that enable the laser light to be manipulated and
coherently controlled, high brightness compact accelerators may become
achievable on a single tabletop, with immediate applications in medical isotope
production and radiography. The research is highly integrated with mentoring,
professional development, and outreach, which are employed to train students
practical skill sets to prepare them for a range of technical careers. The
education plan will utilize culturally relevant frameworks for engaging
underrepresented populations, providing hands-on skill set development, and
empowering the students themselves to increase visibility of accelerator science
as a discipline. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Femtosecond lasers are ideally suited
for use as tabletop particle accelerators since their short pulse duration
enables relativistic intensities to be generated at high repetition rates. With
sufficient intensity, a laser can redistribute electrons within optical cycles,
generating enormous acceleration gradients which can drive advanced
accelerators. Though early analytical models showed promise of GeV ions and
hundreds of GeV electrons, experiments have yet to produce such beams. This
CAREER award will enable experiments shaping the wavefront and modifying the
polarization of femtosecond lasers towards development of practical tabletop
accelerators. Influence of higher order modes for increased charge and decreased
beam divergence will be studied, with machine learning providing insight into
the respective influence of each mode in these highly nonlinear regimes.
Numerical modeling of the interactions will be performed utilizing large data
samples and exactly measured beam properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
