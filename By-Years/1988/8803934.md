This research project addresses the cause of the spatial distribution of strong
ground motion resulting from the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987.
The pattern of damage caused by this earthquake is unusual. The area of most
severe damage is at a distance of eight to nine kilometers from the epicenter.
It occurred as a "semi-ring of damage" since little or no severe damage was
observed to the east of the epicenter. Specifically, this project is examining
an hypothesis that the very localized damage pattern observed may be due to the
effect of the free surface on horizontally polarized shear waves (SV) incident
at the critical angle. Preliminary investigation of this hypothesis is strongly
suggestive that is can explain the observed damage pattern. This information has
the potential to contribute to the understanding and prediction of earthquake
damage, in particular the damage to constructed facilities.
