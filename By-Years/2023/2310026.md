Protons, neutrons, and electrons are the building blocks of all matter with
which we are most familiar. Despite the scientific efforts to comprehend their
nature, there are many things about them that remain to be understood. In 2010,
a measurement of the size of the proton gave a much smaller than expected
result. This measurement disagreed with, but was much more precise than, all the
other proton size measurements to date. Since that time, many other people have
tried to re-measure the proton size using different approaches, but the
discrepancy persists. The research supported by this award aims to resolve this
issue, known as the "Proton Radius Puzzle" by making the first simultaneous
measurement of muon and electron scattering on the proton in the Muon Proton
Scattering Experiment (MUSE). Through this experiment, in addition to gaining
knowledge about protons, the postdoctoral researcher, undergraduate, and
graduate students will gain knowledge and experience of modern detection
techniques, and simulation and reconstruction software, which are employed in
many applications such as industrial or medical imaging. They will also
participate in cultural exchanges with researchers from many countries
worldwide, and develop their communication, organization, and leadership skills.

MUSE will make the world's first measurement of the proton radius via elastic
muon scattering at a precision which can address the 4% proton radius puzzle.
The experiment will be performed at the Paul Scherer Institute in Switzerland.
The simultaneous measurement of elastic e-plus / e-minus and mu-plus/mu-minus
scattering on the proton in the MUSE experiment will allow resolution of the
proton radius puzzle: the 7-sigma discrepancy between the charge radius of the
proton measured in the excitation spectrum of muonic hydrogen and that measured
in the excitation spectrum of the atomic hydrogen. Measuring with both electrons
and muons simultaneously improves the systematic uncertainty, and provides a
test of lepton universality. Measuring both charge states allows for the direct
measurement and determination, and then cancellation, of any two-photon effects
in both muon- and electron-scattering. This project involves participation in
and leadership of data taking and analysis of MUSE through the support of the
PI, a graduate student, undergraduate student, and a postdoc. It will result in
precise, simultaneous elastic muon and electron scattering data.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
