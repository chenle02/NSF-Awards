Studies of sedimentary processes in the deep sea, estuaries, and large lakes
show the presence of lineated sedimentary bedforms (furrows) with cross-flow
dimensions of several to tens of meters in cohesive sediments. These bedforms
have developed as the result of long-term interaction between flow and the
sediment, and the structure of the bedform must contain important information
about the growth of the bedform and the time variability of the currents which
have created it. The project will develop and use a ultra-high-frequency
subbottom profiler for use in studying the upper 1+ m of the sediment surface
from manned submersibles in order to study the structure of sedimentary furrows
(and other intermediate-scale sedimentary features) in Lake Superior and, at a
later date, in the deep sea.
