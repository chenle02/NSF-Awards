Primates are notable for their long, slow life histories and extended lifespans,
a trend exaggerated in humans. The effects of this prolonged lifespan can be
observed across the body, including the brain. While general patterns of brain
aging are conserved among primates, there is clear variation in the pace of
brain aging within and between species. In addition, humans are potentially more
vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases associated with the aging process;
however, it is not clear what molecular mechanisms enable or shape this
variation. This doctoral dissertation project characterizes molecular signatures
of aging in the hippocampus of a non-human primate to identify conserved and
derived features of primate brain aging and advance our understanding of
potential evolved differences in humans that may increase our susceptibility to
age-related brain disease. The project broadens the participation of graduate
and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented group in STEM,
providing training, mentoring, and research experiences in bioinformatics and
genomic analyses. In addition, with life expectancy increasing globally, this
project addresses a specific global health concern by improving our
understanding of the aging process at the molecular level and by contributing a
valuable molecular dataset for future aging-related
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this research is that
gene regulation shapes hippocampal aging by mediating the interaction between a
primateâ€™s environment and biology across its lifespan. Objective 1 characterizes
gene expression in the hippocampus of rhesus macaques across the lifespan using
existing biosamples. These data are then integrated with previously generated
matched DNA methylation data to identify differentially methylated regions that
may regulate the expression of age-associated genes in the hippocampus.
Objective 2 identifies microRNAs expressed in the hippocampus of rhesus macaques
and characterizes their patterns of expression across the lifespan. These data
are then integrated with matched gene expression data from Objective 1 to
identify candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs and networks. To meet these objectives,
matched mRNA and miRNA data are generated and analyzed for hippocampus samples
using RNAseq and small RNAseq respectively. Importantly, this dataset includes
both males and females and a range of ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
