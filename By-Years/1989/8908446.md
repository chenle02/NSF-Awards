Plants and animals evolve against a background of continual climate change, but
until recently this change proceeded at a pace determined by natural forces.
Now, human-induced alterations in land use and in the atmosphere are
accelerating the rate of change. These alterations promise to challenge the
ability of organisms to respond to rapid environmental change. Previous work has
demonstrated that drought stress alters the dynamics of plant-herbivore
interactions. Using these results and those from climate models, a qualitative
model of the effects of climate change on plant-herbivore interactions will be
constructed. Questions about the direct and indirect effects of climate change
on herbivore and plant quality, population size and community structure will be
addressed. The model will generate testable hypotheses and guide the design of
future work by clarifying which parameters need further study. This research
furthers understanding of plant-herbivore interactions by incorporating
knowledge of plant chemistry, herbivore behavior and physiology with existing
methods and data on population dynamics.
