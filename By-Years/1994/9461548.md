A novel printed-circuit antenna is described which has the potential of
drastically reducing the cost of microwave antennas. Use of printed-circuit
dipole antenna arrays is not new, however existing methods require complex and
precise interconnecting transmission lines. The antenna comprises a guided wave
substrate that is coupled, by proximity, to dipole elements. The structure is
relatively thin in cross-section, and readily adaptable to many different
antenna applications. It does not require any protrusions, such as the feed-horn
needed with parabolic dishes. The radiation patterns may be of essentially
arbitrary form. Bandwidth and aperture efficiency of the antenna is essentially
identical to any traveling-wave structure; such as planar waveguide slotted
arrays. These waveguide array antennas, although expensive to manufacture,
represent state-of-the-art electrical performance and are used in many
applications. An example is the F16 aircraft multi-mode radar. The proposed
antenna is electrically analogous, the difference being in the excitation mode.
Experimental results are given which confirm the electrical efficiency and
directionality properties of the antenna.
