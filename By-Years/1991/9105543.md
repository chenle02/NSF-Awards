This project involves the acquisition of a vertical seismic profile integrated
with a high-resolution reflection survey which will provide both wide- and
narrow-angle reflections from the climatic cyclostratigraphy recorded in the
Triassic sediments of the Newark Rift Basin, New Jersey. The small amount of
stratigraphic overlap between the core holes of the Newark Basin Scientific
Drilling Project further justifies the use of high resolution seismic profiling
to effectively tie single formations from one hole to another. The best
manifestation of the cyclostratigraphy occurs within the Lockatong and lower
Passaic formations. Each will be sampled by only a single core hole, the holes
near Titusville and Pennington of Lamont's southern transect in Mercer County,
New Jersey. To trace facies variations amounting to changes in reflectivity and
interval velocity between core holes requires the detailed velocity information
and high resolution subsurface images that can be provided by VSP and high
resolution surface seismic surveys. The velocities and reflectivities recorded
by these surveys should correlate with lake depth index variations can be traced
between core holes using the high resolution surface seismic surveys to evaluate
the continuity of sequences between the core holes as well as changes in
composite Van Houten cycle spacing and lake depth index with proximity to the
eastern shore of the basin. Such controls will provide additional constraints
for interpretation of the core data with respect to basin wide cyclicity.
