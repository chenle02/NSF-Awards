A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular infrastructure at
these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue
challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in
areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and
generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project
aligns directly with that goal.

The necessity of basic laboratory equipment is almost as great a priority as the
necessity of compelling STEM instruction and research. Bay Mills Community
College is increasing its equipment holdings with laboratory equipment commonly
found in STEM instruction. Autoclaves, in particular, are so commonly used in
post-secondary STEM instruction and research that their lack can be considered a
profound disadvantage to students who may pursue higher-division coursework at
another college or university. Additionally, access to such equipment can have a
disproportionately positive impact on the view students have of scientific
inquiry and career options.
