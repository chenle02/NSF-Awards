This project addresses career-life-balance (CLB) barriers that confront tenured
associated professors who have not been promoted. UMBC will develop and
implement a pilot project designed to determine if an intensive post-family
leave two-year acceleration plan embedded within an aggressive career-life
balance institutional integration campaign (which encompasses graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and faculty) will create the necessary conditions to
impact progress toward professor status for an identified cohort of 16 women
associate professors. In addition to the development of a post-family leave
reintegration model, eight seminars and community building workshops will be
held to create a campus culture that is deeply and demonstrably committed to
work-life integration in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
significance and importance: This project will employ an integrative pathway
approach to work-like balance support that will be representative of a
comprehensive CLB initiative of coordinated CLB principles, policies, resources,
and practices. The model will help re-define the view of career so that it
includes, rather than excludes, one's personal life.
