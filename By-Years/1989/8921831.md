This award will support collaborative research in metallurgy between Dr. John
Barnard, University of Alabama and Dr. Peter Goodhew, Department of
Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, University of Liverpoool, U.K. The
project will focus on microstructural characterization by Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) of iron-based binary alloy thin films as a function of
processing conditions and thermal treatment. Dr. Barnard has been involved to
date in substantial work on the topic of thin film growth by sputtering and
characteriza- tion by magnetometry. In this project he will undertake in
Liverpool microstructural and crystallographic characterization of two Fe-based
thin film systems, Fe-N and Fe-Sn as a function of temperature. Dr. Barnard will
work directly with Dr. Goodhew and members of his group in order to master
analytic TEM techniques, which can then be introduced to the University of
Alabama's new TEM facility. Dr. Goodhew has extensive expertise in analytical
and high resolution electronmicroscopy. In addition, Liverpool University has
exceptional microscopy facilities. The results of this research could provide
insights into the nature of the short- range order in the amorphous state, as
well as defining the structural kinetics of crystallization in this system.
