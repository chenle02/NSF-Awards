The principal investigator proposes to work on error analysis problems in the
area of asymptotic approximations. These include exponential asymptotics,
coalescing saddle-points in the method of steepest descent and for solutions of
linear ordinary differential equations, and Airy function expansions. Asymptotic
analysis is used in many branches of mathematics and hence in science. The
questions being investigated may reveal details of scientific phenomena not
apparent to the casual glance.
