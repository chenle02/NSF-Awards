This proposal describes 12 experiments designed to test predictions derived from
a social contingency model of judgment and choice in which key functions of
social cognition include: (a)assessing the relative justifiability of available
response options; (b)generating compelling justifications for one's opinions and
decisions. The 12 experiments (plus exploratory study) test a host of
predictions concerning: (a) the conditions under which people cope with
accountability demands via low-effort impression-management of response
thresholds (e.g., attitude shifting) as opposed to more demanding strategies
that require considerable cognitive effort (effort that can take either self-
critical or self-justifying forms); (b) the power of various types of
accountability demands to amplify or attenuate response tendencies widely
classified as "errors or biases" in the social cognition and decision-theory
literatures; (c) the power of various types of accountability demands to alter
perceptions of what counts as an "error or bias" by activating alternative
"inferential sets" (e.g., conversational norms, intuitive scientist versus
prosecutor). The proposed research places human thought in social context.
People make most decisions within settings in which they feel, in varying ways
and degrees, accountable to others. If our goal is an integrative theory of
judgment and choice, we need to clarify how the psychology of the individual
decision-maker interacts with the social, institutional and political context to
shape thought and action. The current studies help to fill this gap in knowledge
by clarifying when people respond to accountability demands by simply shifting
their views toward the anticipated audience and when they respond to
accountability by becoming either more self-critical and reflective or more
self-justifying and defensive. The research should have important implications
for designing organizations in ways that enhance the quality of individual and
group judgment and decision-making .
