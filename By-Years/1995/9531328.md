9531328 Adams This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
researchers in mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty
advisors. Areas of possible research include knot theory, diophantine
approximation, geodesic nets, and symbolic dynamics. The program will run for
eight weeks. Students each give a presentation of their work during the summer.
At the end of the program, the students will prepare their work for possible
publication.
