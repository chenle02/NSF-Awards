This is a program for further development of the MUSTANG millimeter-wave camera
which has been developed for use on NSF's Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The main
science goal is to obtain deep, high-resolution observations of galaxy clusters
via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE), a decrement in the cosmic microwave
background strength as photons pass through a cluster and scatter off of the
high temperature intra-cluster gas and out of the line of sight. Broader impacts
of the work include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in
instrumentation development. Members of the team are actively involved with
public outreach in the Philadelphia area including star parties, the
Philadelphia science festival and mentoring in low-performing schools.

The upgrade is called MUSTANG-2, and will increase the number of detectors from
32 to 223. The sensitivity of the detectors will be greatly enhanced as well.
Maps of the SZE in galaxy clusters at 90 GHz with the 100-meter Green Bank
Telescope will provide a combination of unprecedented mapping speed, resolution,
and sky coverage which will unlock the full potential of these complex objects.
