Water distribution systems are greatly in need of evaluation, repair,
retrofitting and rehabilitation in order to continue to be serviceable to the
communities. Reliable engineering methods are needed to determine the existing
conditions and to predict the remaining useful life of the systems. In order to
evaluate the distribution systems this project will develop hydraulic analysis
models to determine the design characteristics based on the various pressures
and flow requirements. The mathematical model will enable a decision maker to
select and evaluate various modifications to the existing systems. Parameters to
be evaluated are: pipe sizes, storage facilities, and pumping requirements. With
this data base an engineer will be able to evaluate the best method for
rehabilitation or repair. The researcher is qualified to perform this
investigation. The project is recommended for an award. This is the first year
of a three year award with an increment of $54,953.
