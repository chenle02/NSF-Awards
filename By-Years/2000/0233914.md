Dr. Nadasdy, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison, is
proposing to do social/liguistic research among the Kluane First Nation (KFN)
aboriginal people focusing on their aboriginal land claim negotiations with the
Government of Canada and the Yukon Territorial Government. By combining
anthropological methods of participant observation and interviews with archival
research and in depth social/linguistic analysis of negotiation sessions, the
researcher will be providing new insights into the struggle over cultural forms
and meanings between the KFN and the dominant Euro-American governmental
negotiators. This research is unique in its application of social/linguistic
analysis to the cross-cultural negotiation process inherent in the research
topic.
