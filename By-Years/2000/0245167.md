Abstract

Award: DMS-0245167 Principal Investigator: Peter A. Cholak

The principal investigator plans to study the relationship between definability
and automorphisms in various structures arising in computability theory.
Primarily, but not totally, he will focus on the collection of all computably
enumerable sets. The principal investigator will also consider the collection of
all Pi01 classes and the computably enumerable degrees. A long range goal is to
provide a complete understanding of these structures and their automorphisms and
definable orbits. Some related projects in computable structure theory and
models of second order arithmetic are also planned.

The main focus of these projects is on definability and computability. These
notions are both important in measuring the complexity of an answer to a
mathematical problem. Problems such as "Is there a computer program which can
solve all questions of this type?" One develops an intertwined hierarchy of
definability and computability. Only answers which lay on the lowest level are
computable and even then they are not always feasibly computable given today's
computers. Answers of higher complexity provide useful mathematical information,
allow one to test the limits of mathematical techniques, reveal whether the
wrong techniques are being used, and, in some very rare cases, can be useful for
encoding/decoding information.
