For a large range of applications, from civil infrastructure to national
defense, understanding the failure of materials is critical. Yet, our ability to
predict this failure is limited by both modeling, which is somewhat ad hoc, and
the mathematics available to formulate and analyze models, as well as to justify
numerical methods. These issues are most severe in dynamic problems, such as
impacts, when loading changes quickly. The main goal of this project is the
development of new mathematical methods for dynamic fracture evolution. In
particular, the principal investigator (PI) will extend methods for regular
crack paths to more realistic paths, with kinking and branching. A second goal
is to address fundamental mathematical issues that are necessary for further
progress in completely general settings. Finally, the PI will study phase-field
approximations of fracture, which have become very popular tools in the
engineering community but remain poorly understood.

The ability to accurately predict failure depends on the quality of the
underlying mathematical models of defects as well as on understanding
fundamental properties of solutions. When crack paths are regular, mathematical
methods are available to study these evolutions. However, when they are not, the
only methods so far involve considering the paths to be limits of more regular
paths. The main technical issue here is that strong convergence of the
corresponding elastodynamics is necessary for energy balance, as well as for
other properties of solutions, but this convergence remains open in many
situations. Another fundamental issue is uniqueness of elastodynamic solutions
for a given crack path. The investigator will show uniqueness in certain
settings, and explore general consequences, such as bounds on crack speed. The
final goal of the project is to analyze phase-field models for fracture. While
very popular in the engineering community, a number of properties, including
whether they approximate the correct surface energy, or satisfy a maximal
dissipation condition, remain open questions.
