This project is concerned with studying the structure of lattices. The
principal investigator will do this by making use of a construction due to Alan
Day; by using varieties of lattices; and by determining whether every
distributive algebraic lattice is the congruence lattice of a lattice. The
principal investigator will also study the structure of finitely generated free
lattices. Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure
reflecting, to some extent, the structure of set theory or logic. This very weak
structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical environments. It
also means that problems are easy to state, hard to solve and of a very general
nature. The results of this work will impact many areas of mathematics, computer
science, the social sciences and business management.
