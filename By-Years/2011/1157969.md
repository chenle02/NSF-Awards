has held a number of workshops on the topic of Testing Theoretical Models of
Individual Behavior in Dynamic Social Dilemmas. The group includes scientists
from biology, ecological science, economics, sociology, political science, and

including methodological and conceptual innovations that combine a wide range of
methods include experiments, agent-based simulations, and field observations.
The topics include group heterogeneity and fractionalization, the endogenous
formation of institutions, and network analysis. The workshop participants will
include junior investigators and graduate students; the results will help direct
research into new methods that can be employed to help local governments
understand a wide range of policy dilemmas.
