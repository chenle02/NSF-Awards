Biological Sciences (61) This project aims to improve student understanding of
physiological concepts by providing opportunities for students to record,
manipulate, analyze, and synthesize physiological data in Anatomy and
Physiology, Human Biology, and Neurobiology courses. The computers, software,
and physiology peripherals to be acquired are allowing the inclusion of
experiments in which the students generate and analyze data. Performance is
being assessed by laboratory reports, oral quizzes and lecture exams. Exam and
quiz results from previous classes are available for comparing achievement.
Written lab reports are being used to assess student comprehension, and
analytical and collaborative skills. The effort builds upon and is adapted from
experience gained at a workshop sponsored by the American Physiological Society
on teaching investigative laboratories in physiology.
