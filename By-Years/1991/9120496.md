This action will provide funds for continual research by three faculty, one
research associate and two students. The main activity will be toward the
completion of the new particle detector being built for use at the Stanford
Linear Collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. This group has been
part of a large collaboration to develop and build the detector. The detector
will be used to accumulate a sample of events resulting from the collisions of
polarized electronics and positrons. The analysis of the events is expected to
be a sensitive test of the "standard model" of the elementary particles. Other
activities will include the completion of the analysis of neutrino interactions
in a bubble chamber (Fermilab experiment E632) and exploration of new
experiments perhaps to be performed on a machine to collide electrons and
positrons, being planned for construction in Seville, Spain.
