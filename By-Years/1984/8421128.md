This research concerns the analysis and control of queueing networks. A number
of different topics relating to queueing networks will be investigated,
including analytical approximation results, optimal control, sub-optimal
control, and dalays. Under topics (1) and (3) the aim is to provide analytical
justification for approximation methods used for stochastic networks and to
quantify sub-optimal control policies. The approach used under topics (2) and
(4) is to analyze simplified models to determine optimal control policies and to
investigate the effect of delays. It is expected that this research will have
significant impact on the theory of queueing networks, a subject which has wide
application to communications, computer networks, and manufacturing systems.
