In this project ("Structures and Reactions of New Main-Group Organometallic
Compounds") funded by the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Herman G. Richey in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania State
University will investigate the structures and reactions of new organometallic
species of main-group elements. The study will also involve preparation of new
organometallics and generating a new species of more reactive organomagnesium
compounds. This project will be concerned with the preparation and study of
species formed from organomagnesium compounds by additions of crown ethers or
simple salts, such as alkali metal alkoxides and tetraalkylammonium halides.
These new species, which include coordinated organomagnesium cations, threaded
organomagnesium-crown ethers, and various organomagnesiate anions, are
considerably more reactive than conventional organomagnesium compounds, and with
some substrates afford different products. The scope and mechanisms of their
reactions with ketones and other reactions will be studied. Similar
investigations of organozincate anions formed from organozinc compounds and
salts will also be performed.
