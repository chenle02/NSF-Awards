Algebraic geometry, which studies solutions to systems of polynomial equations,
is a central topic in mathematics with applications to many other disciplines.
Many natural phenomena of interest in physics, biology, and computer science can
be modeled by polynomials, making algebraic geometry a useful tool for the
scientific community at large. This research project aims to study the geometric
properties of the simplest objects in algebraic geometry, known as algebraic
curves. While some curves may have exotic or pathological properties, it is
expected that most curves do not. This goal of this project is to show that
"typical" curves are geometrically well-behaved, using techniques from the
recently developed field of non-Archimedean analytic geometry.

Brill-Noether theory aims to study the geometry of a curve by examining all of
its maps to projective space, or equivalently the existence and behavior of its
linear series. A major change in perspective occurred during the twentieth
century, as the field shifted from studying fixed to general curves -- that is,
general points in the moduli space of curves. A standard approach to the study
of general curves is via degeneration arguments. One considers a family of
smooth curves degenerating to a singular curve, and attempts to deduce geometric
properties of the general fiber using information about the singular fiber.
Recently, it has been observed that this theory fits within a broader framework
of non-Archimedean analytic techniques. This project focuses on outstanding
problems concerning the Brill-Noether theory of general curves, and how new
techniques in non-Archimedean analytic geometry may shed light on these
problems.
