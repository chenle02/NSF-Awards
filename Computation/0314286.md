This project concentrates on developing a thorough theoretical and numerical
analysis and designing algorithms for accurate and efficient matrix computations
with structured matrices. Algorithms for computing the eigenvalues, singular
values and the solution to a linear system are executed on modern computers in
finite precision arithmetic. As a consequence, round-off errors can cause loss
of accuracy in these computations when ill-conditioned problems are solved,
usually leaving the user with the only remedy of running the same algorithm
using wider precision at a much higher computational cost. The goal of this
study is to identify matrix structures and understand matrix properties which
make it possible to design algorithms that will perform matrix computations
accurately in the face of roundoff and will succeed in computing the right
answer even when the traditional structure-ignoring algorithms fail. The matrix
structures that will be studied appear very often in practical applications and
include: Totally positive, tridiagonal, M-matrices, (generalized) Vandermonde,
Cauchy, etc. and combinations thereof.

Most scientific and engineering computations compute in their core the solution
of a linear system, an eigenvalue or a singular value problem. Typical examples
include simulations automobile crash-testing, testing bridge and building
structural designs and behavior under stress (earthquakes, explosions, etc.).
Structure-exploiting accurate and efficient matrix algorithms make running such
applications faster, easier, less reliant on super computers and allow for
computations of more sophisticated designs and simulations than is currently
possible. As a result it may become easier to design safer cars, which cost,
weight and pollute less, and it may allow for an easier and faster design of
bridges, buildings and other structures that are less expensive, faster to build
and are also less susceptible to the forces of nature.
