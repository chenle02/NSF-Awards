9350464 Chan This project is one of NSF Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF)
program projects. This PFF awardee plans to study systematically the grain
boundaries in ceria (CeO2), a fast ionic conductor, and in YBCO (YBa2Cu3O7-x), a
high temperature oxide superconductor. The study will relate the structure and
chemistry of the boundaries with their electrical properties. This PFF awardee
will intends to develop new teaching courses as well as using experiments and
interactive computer graphics to enhance student learning. %%% This is one of
the NSF presidential faculty fellows (PFF) award. The research activities of the
awardee will be concerned with the study of the grain boundaries in oxides. One
fast ion conductor, namely, ceria, and one high temperature oxide
superconductor, namely, YBCO, will be selected for this study. Efforts will be
used to relate the structure and chemistry of the boundaries with their
electrical properties. In teaching, this PFF awardee plans to develop new
courses as well as using experiments and interactive graphics to enhance student
learning. ***
