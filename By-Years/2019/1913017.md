The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh
and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at
Carnegie Mellon University will host Engineering Sustainability 2019: A Climate
for Change (ES19) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from April 7-9, 2019. This
conference will bring together engineers and scientists from academia,
government, industry, and non- profits to share results of cutting-edge research
and practice directed at development of environmentally sustainable buildings
and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenary talks and concurrent oral and
poster sessions will be organized around the following themes: regenerative
built environment, one water in the urban environment, sustainable mobility,
circular economy, engineering sustainability learning and engagement, and
behavioral science for sustainability. There will also be numerous planned
opportunities for informal exchanges and networking. The conference will have
significant participation from students and young faculty members, as these
groups are so important to the next generation of
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
