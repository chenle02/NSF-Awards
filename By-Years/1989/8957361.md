This microbiological research by Dr. Deming will focus on the positive
interactive effects between elevated hydrostatic pressures and extremes in
temperature. The work seeks to understand the limits of life on this planet (and
perhaps elsewhere), both during early Archaean stages and in more contemporary
settings. By focusing on the simplest of microorganisms and on environmental
parameters conventionally viewed as biologically inhibitory, Dr. Deming has
discovered novel types of bacteria operating in environments previously
considered depauperate if not sterile of life, from hadal depths (8300m) in the
Puerto Rico Trench to superheated hydrothermal vents (350 C) in the Pacific to
subzero muds in the Arctic. During the period of this Presidential Young
Investigator award, Dr. Deming will research bacteria from the benthic marine
environment to address several issues: * What is the molecular-genetic basis for
stable metabolic processes at the most extreme conditions to temperature and
pressure? * Do bacteria from extreme marine environments produce extracellular
enzymes of unique physical/chemical properties that alter the environments apart
from living organism? * To what extent is the ecological importance of benthic
bacteria tied to relationships (symbiotic, mutualistic) with other marine
inhabitants? * What is the global significance of carbon cycling by benthic
bacteria, especially in climatically dynamic polar regions and hydrodynamically
variable temperate zones? Sea-going portions of the research plan will involve
in situ measurements of the carbon-cycling activities of natural bacterial
assemblages in benthic samples, using microscopic and radioisotopic tracer
techniques. Laboratory research will include recovery of novel microorganisms
and selected enzymes and nucleic acids, experimental tests for activity and
stability of both the organism and its constituents under extreme temperatures
and pressures, and molecular study of those genes most likely to open new
avenues of both fundamental and applied research.
