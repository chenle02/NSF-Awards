97-04704 Gibson, Garth A Carnegie Mellon University Postdoc: Exposing
Input/Output Parallelism by Relaxing Request Ordering (CES Associateship for
Tara Madhyastha) Input/output is a critical performance limitation for many
parallel scientific applications. One important lesson learned from application
performance analysis is that it is important to expose and utilize all available
input/output concurrency. A traditional sequential file model does not allow
applications to express the parallel nature of their resource demands, or to
exploit the full parallel file system bandwidth. This research proposes new
application-level input/output interfaces to express parallelism that cannot be
automatically detected. Interfaces to access parallel files with partially
ordered or unordered records will be created and evaluated on a variety of
parallel platforms, quantifying the performance improvements achieved at various
levels within the file system. The demonstrated benefits of application supplies
access pattern information; while file system policy control drive attempts to
standardize system and application-level programming interfaces. However, the
division between system and application-level file system functionality is
poorly understood. This research helps to define this boundary for a large and
important class of parallel scientific applications.
