0437398&lt;br/&gt;Hamburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a new model
for coordination between the U.S. Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER),
and the network of sites in over 25 member countries of the International LTER
(ILTER). The PI (Steven Hamburg, of Brown U.) and co-PI (Patrick Bourgeron of
the U. of Colorado/Boulder) are co-chairs of the newly-established International
Committee of the U.S. LTER. The mission of the U.S. International LTER Committee
is to broaden participation by researchers at U.S. LTER sites in international
LTER research activities and promote linkages with related global science
programs. The project marks the first steps in a transition to a new structure
for the governance of the International Long Term Ecological Reseach (ILTER)
network and for U.S. participation in the international network. The award funds
two distinct but related components: 1) administrative and travel support for
U.S. LTER personnel to engage with foreign counterparts in the ILTER network,
and 2) salary and travel for a Coordinator for the International LTER network.
The two-year duration is envisioned as an interim period during which the
International LTER network will consider alternative models of financing and
staffing for the international coordination responsibilities. A more autonomous
International LTER with a broader, more multilateral base of financial support
would be a stronger institution, better able to fulfill the vision of a
worldwide network of long-term sites working together to answer environmental
questions relevant to pressing global policy
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
