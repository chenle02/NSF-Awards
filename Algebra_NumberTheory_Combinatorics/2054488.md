Algebraic combinatorics leverages the power of algebra to analyze discrete
structures. It is a powerful approach to answering combinatorial questions,
often leading to exact and explicit enumerative formulas that are not obtainable
from first principles. Asymptotic algebraic combinatorics deals with discrete
structures whose defining parameters are extremely large, far exceeding the
numerical range of everyday physical experience. In this setting, exact formulas
become unwieldy and unusable; asymptotic algebraic combinatorics leverages
algebraic methods to obtain useful approximations that are typically not
accessible. The algebraic approach to asymptotic combinatorics is especially
pertinent in the age of big data, where discrete structures loom large over the
information landscape, but the tools to handle them are in short supply. This
research project intends employ algebraic techniques to further develop useful
tools in asymptotic combinatorics. The project will involve graduate students in
the research.

This project aims to develop new algebraic methods for the asymptotic analysis
of large structures that appear in probability and mathematical physics. On the
probabilistic side, the PI will build a theory of asymptotic Fourier analysis
for large random matrices using recent analysis of large rank orbital integrals
as a foundation. One of the main goals of this endeavor is to provide a toolbox
that can be uniformly applied to both large random matrices and their quantized
counterparts, random representations of large Lie groups. On the mathematical
physics side, the PI plans to use the algebraic techniques underlying recent
analysis of large rank link integrals to undertake a rigorous study of Yang-
Mills partition functions, first revisiting the two-dimensional case and then
moving to higher dimensions via link integrals. A key goal here is to rigorously
understand combinatorics of asymptotic freedom and gauge-string dualities.
