This dissertation investigates the growth of foreign direct investment in the
post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Foreign direct
investment is conceptualized as a social relation between two parties and thus
subject to the cultural understandings, power struggles, institutional support,
and social ties that govern all social relations. Statistical analyses of
longitudinal, cross-national data will test economic and institutional effects
on foreign investments in eleven post-socialist countries. These will be
supplemented by more qualitative interviews with state officials and investment
experts. Analyses of investor-host country dyads will test how institutional,
political, and cultural relations determine levels of investment for the pair.
Finally, firm level success in attracting foreign investment will be
investigated using contrasting successful and unsuccessful cases from Slovenia.
