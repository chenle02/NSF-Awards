There is data showing that electric and electrochemical ion currents in test
objects can be imaged using a novel magnetic scanning and acoustic detection
approach. This appears to be a new imaging technique which generates information
concerning the electrical nature of the object not presently obtainable with
other imaging approaches. It may be useful in diverse disciplines ranging from
biology and electrochemistry, to electronic circuit testing. It would appear to
be particularly useful in the noninvasive visualization of bioelectric currents
flowing in living organisms. This research will focus on constructing and
testing the charactersitics of a prototype imaging system similar n some
respects to a scanning electron microscope. Instead of a scanning electron beam,
a mechanically scanning 1 kHz magnetic field causes the generation of electrical
Lorentz force vibrations in the object. Acoustic emissions from the sample are
monitored with a piezoelectric detector and their intensity is used to create an
image on a computer display. The research will attempt to use the system to
noninvasively measure bioelectric current flows in small living obects in a new
way which may give greater insight into functional physiologic processes.
