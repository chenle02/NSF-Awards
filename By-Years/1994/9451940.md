9451940 Galloway This project builds on established success in laboratory-based
undergraduate education with an innovative curriculum of training in skeletal
analysis, exploiting faculty strengths in this area and potentially bringing
high proportions of women and minorities into careers in archaeology, biological
anthropology, and related fields. Advanced teaching materials, computer
hardware, and software are being incorporated into new anthropology teaching
laboratories and now offer undergraduates facilities where they can learn highly
transferable techniques, including osteometrics, bioelectrical impedence
technology and multimedia packages to study functional anatomy. The curriculum
development plan also features 1) "enrichment laboratories" offered in tandem
with large lower division lecture courses, 2) intensive exposure to science
research practices, and 3) independent research under faculty supervision.
