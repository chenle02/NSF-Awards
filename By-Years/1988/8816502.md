In this project, the P.I. will measure air-sea fluxes and transfer coefficients
in the area of the warm pool in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, in
collaboration with measurements of turbulent dissipation and microstructure in
the buoyancy-driven ocean mixed layer. Data will be applied to studies of local
heat budgets and overall thermodynamic properties of the air-sea interactions.
The dissipation technique will be adapted for shipboard measurements, in an
effort to substantially improve the capability for measuring fluxes in the
marine boundary layer while at sea.
