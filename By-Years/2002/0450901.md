The Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data Coordination Center (ADCC) is the central
data depository and long-term archive for data collected by projects funded by
the National Science Foundation's ARCSS program. The ADCC is located at the
National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado,
which is a national information and referral center supporting polar and
cryospheric research. The main objective of the ADCC is the broad and unlimited
availability of research data. The primary goal of the ADCC is to collect all
ARCSS related data and to provide for its preservation through long-term, off-
site archiving. ADCC provides presentation of these data for all potential users
(i.e., ARCSS researchers, worldwide scientific community, policy makers,
educators, and the public), as well as easy access to a variety of ARCSS related
data sets, and assists in the synthesis of available data. This will be
accomplished by ensuring the forward and backward compatibility of the data sets
as the Web technologies continues to evolve.
