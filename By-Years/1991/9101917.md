In forming processes such as extrusion, the quality of the product depends in a
complex manner on the parameters governing the process. For example, when
plastics are extruded, severe swelling and shape change occur as the material
emerges from the die. The equations describing such processes are extremely
complex. The research to be carried out is aimed at developing a computational
scheme uniquely suited to solving these equations. This scheme can aid in
identifying parameters which most affect the formed product and perhaps
eventually serve as a tool in process control.
