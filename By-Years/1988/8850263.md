In 1988 12 high school juniors, selected from a nationwide group of applicants,
will conduct independent research projects as apprentices for 8 weeks in the
summer under the direct supervision of members of the Jacksons Laboratory's
scientific staff. This program has been in operation since 1949. Working in
their sponsors' laboratories, the students conduct projects that involve
original research within the scope of their respective sponsors' ongoing
research programs. The student gain experience in all aspects of research
including designing a project, implementing the research plan, interpreting
data, and reporting the research results both orally and in writing. The
students' research participation experience will be supplemented by attending
meetings of their respective laboratory groups and by after- dinner research
presentations and discussions at the student residence by sponsors and student.
