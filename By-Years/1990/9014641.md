With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
Michael T. Crimmins of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Crimmins will develop methodology that uses
photocycloaddition reactions to form four-membered rings. These ring containing
compounds will then be modified into useful synthetic intermediates. The project
will develop the utility of photochemical, intramolecular Ä±2+2! cycloaddition-
cyclobutane fragmentation sequences. The primary emphasis will be placed on the
use of intramolecular photocycloadditions to rapidly increase molecular
complexity while maintaining a high degree of stereochemical control. The
synthesis of several natural products will be used to indicate the versatility
of the approach.
