Dr. John Taylor and postdoctoral associate Dr. Thomas Bruns of the University
of California at Berkeley will employ modern molecular techniques to investigate
the evolutionary relationships among fungi of the order Boletales. They will
study the mitochondrial gene order, construct restriction- endonuclease
digestion-site maps of mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, and
sequence selected ribosomal RNA genes. Preliminary results suggest that a much
better understanding of phylogenetic relationships among these fungi can be
achieved with these methods than has been realized to date by traditional
morphological studies. This work is significant for several reasons. Many of the
species to be studied are important ectomycorrhizal root symbionts of temperate-
forest trees, and others are important wood-rotters. An understanding of the
phylogeny of these fungi will provide insight into their pattern of coevolution
with their plant hosts, and will provide a better understanding of the
relationship between mycorrhizal symbionts and primary saprobes in the order. As
currently defined, the Boletales contains several morphologically diverse groups
of fungi, including false truffles, gilled mushrooms, and resupinate wood-rot
fungi. Therefore, understanding of their phylogeny will provide a framework for
testing theories about morphological trends in the basidiomycete fungi. Finally,
the methods being used should prove applicable to evolutionary investigations in
a wide range of other groups of fungi, and the gene-sequence data generated will
add to a database which can eventually be used to study the evolutionary lines
within the entire Basidiomycetes.
