In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, W. Carl Lineberger will study the structure and dynamics of molecular
ions, both isolated and aggregated with known numbers of solvent molecules, with
emphasis on three-carbon hydrocarbons and transition metal aggregates. Bond
strengths of fundamental hydrocarbon radicals will be obtained, rearrangements
and transition states for transient intermediates will be investigated, and
quantitative information on the electronic structure of small metal clusters
will be obtained. Ultrafast laser technologies will be developed to obtain real-
time dynamic information on reactive processes in ions with partially completed
solvent shells. This research will utilize two ultrafast lasers to initiate and
probe chemical reactions in a microsolvent. One goal of these studies is to
increase the quantitative understanding of the processes driving the simplest
chemical transformations. By studying the chemical transformations of molecules
which are both isolated as well as surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger
will be able to demonstrate the effect that different solvents have on
reactivity as well as on the rates at which these reactions proceed.
