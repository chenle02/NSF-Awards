A grant has been awarded to the University of Alaska under the direction of Dr.
K. Winker to obtain additional specimen cases for the University of Alaska
Museum Bird Collection. Because of Alaska's size and location, it constitutes a
unique faunal region that includes components from both the North American and
Eurasian bird faunas and a Beringian bird fauna. Over the past five years the
University of Alaska Museum Bird Collection has grown by almost 11,000 specimens
which probably places UAM among the top 10 institutions in North America in
terms of bird collection growth. The current specimen holdings now exceed
existing case space. Twenty additional specimen cases will allow this important
collection to be housed and maintained according to collection standards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The installation of these 20 additional cases in the
Collection and concomitant rearrangement of the Bird Collection in the increased
case space thus made available lead naturally to an enhancement of the quality
of care with which the collection can be maintained. Every bird specimen at UAM
provides a unique snapshot--both in time and in space--of the dynamics of a
facet of the bird populations of northwesternmost North America. The manifold
ways in which they prove to be of importance over time include questions only
now being asked, such as the immediate and varied responses of different species
of birds in Alaska to climate change in the Arctic; measurements of stable
isotope ratios in changing food webs; and quantification of heavy-metal
contaminant levels at high latitudes. These specimens, already proving valuable
to science, will without doubt continue to be of great value in the future in
relation to questions not yet posed.&lt;br/&gt;
