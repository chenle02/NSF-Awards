Fault Finder: Improving the Availability of Multiprocessor
Servers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke FaultFinder
Project seeks to provide the first hardware mechanisms for dynamically verifying
the correctness - not just necessary properties - of shared memory
multiprocessor systems. The memory consistency model determines the correctness
of a design. FaultFinder will dynamically detect violations of the specified
memory consistency model, which is the highest level of error detection possible
in hardware. FaultFinder mechanisms will detect hardware errors at the system
level (e.g., violation of consistency), unlike existing schemes that only detect
localized errors (e.g., bit flip on message). Combining FaultFinder error
detection with existing hardware mechanisms for checkpoint/recovery of shared
memory multiprocessor systems enables the system to guarantee correct
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As society has increasingly relied upon computer
systems to provide important infrastructure, computer engineers have not
correspondingly improved the ability to detect faults in these systems. While
recent advances in hardware checkpoint/recovery have improved computer system
availability, a system recovery mechanism can only recover from those errors
that are detected. Currently, computer systems cannot detect whether a memory
system is behaving correctly. The Duke FaultFinder Project seeks to provide the
first hardware mechanisms for comprehensive error detection in computer systems.
Achieving this goal would provide a qualitative benefit to a society that
depends on computer availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
