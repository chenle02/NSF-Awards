&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the University of Maryland-College
Park for the support of a four-year, REU Site in Molecular and Cellular
Bioengineering, under the direction of Dr. Timothy A. Barbari. This ten-week
summer program will involve eleven students annually in an intensive research
program in bioengineering at the molecular and cellular level. Each student work
with full-time faculty, visiting scientists, post-doctoral research associates,
graduate students, and other undergraduate students on research that promises to
lead to important new discoveries and technologies. They will be exposed to
state-of-the-art research, multidisciplinary research laboratories, research
group meetings, and scientists/engineers from local industry and nearby research
institutions (NIH, NIST, USDA, FDA, NRL). In addition, the students will
participate in non-technical seminars on the graduate school process, industrial
field trips to nearby biotechnology companies, technical and presentation skills
training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
