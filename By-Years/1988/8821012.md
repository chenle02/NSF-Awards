This dissertation research project will study agricultural cooperatives in
Ecuador. The project will compare two cooperatives, one in which the planning is
done cooperatively by the farmers and the higher level officials who they deal
with (the "bottom up" approach) , and another in which the higher officials do
not set up two-way information channels with the subject farmers (the "top-
down" approach). The purpose of the research is to assess the strength of these
two approaches to cooperative function in predicting the economic success of the
cooperative in a region where indigenous cooperation is an old practice.
