This project supports the travel of US doctoral student researchers to the
premier international conference on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems
and their participation in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium held in conjunction
with it. The International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent
Systems (AAMAS 2011) will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, May 2-6, 2011. All students
awarded stipends will participate in a Doctoral Mentoring Consortium in which
they will present their research to other student researchers and receive in-
depth feedback from a group of senior researchers. Travel stipends will be
awarded through an application process that requires that students be full-time
students and that they be explicitly listed as an author of an accepted paper.
The AAMAS conference provides these students with a platform to present their
research results and allows them to participate in valuable discussions that
will likely shape the future of this critically important field. The technical
program is complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events.
The wide variety and significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in
both the technical program and the workshop program, provides opportunities for
students to share, exchange and learn from each other.
