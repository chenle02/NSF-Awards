This is a Presidential Young Investigator award. The research it supports will
seek to improve microfabrication technology and its application to the creation
of novel sensors, actuators, and electronic devices. The specific research
involves the use of silicon wafer bonding technology for fusing single crystal
silicon wafers. This includes fundamental studies of bond mechanisms and bond
strength, and the development of characterization tools for studying bond
quality. Research will also include applications to microsensors,
microactuators, microelectronics, and packaging.
