ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9632466 Principle investigator: Wang This project
is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the melt fracture and flow
instability phenomena of linear polyethylene resins. Specifically, experiments
are proposed to unravel the molecular origin of spurt flow behavior and
sharkskin formation. Experiments will be conducted under both controlled piston
speed and constant pressure conditions. Geometry and surface dependent phenomena
will be studied. The unique feature of the investigation is that the subject of
melt flow instability and extrudate fraction involves a highly non-linear
coupling between bulk constitutive properties and hydrodynamic boundary
conditions at melt/wall and melt/melt interfaces. The proposed effort goes
beyond the continuum approach and will attempt to link with micro-molecular
physics. The results of this research will have wide applicability in the
polymer processing industry.
