This project addresses teacher-identified deficiencies in science instruction:
low self-confidence, inadequate knowledge; and poor curriculum materials. The
purposes of the project are two-fold: 1) to provide K-8 teachers with enough
science content training and teaching strategies to implement a locally
developed and comprehensive curriculum; and 2) to offer a coordinated
dissemination/training model to rural districts utilizing local master teachers,
the Pinal County Superintendent's Office, and the Arizona Department of
Education. Participating districts will benefit by complying with Essential
Skills mandates; improving instruction in K-8 Physical, Earth, and Life Science
and Health; and in-depth training in Cooperative Learning, Guided Discovery, and
the Learning Cycle.
