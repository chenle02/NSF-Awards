Professor Morrison will carry out research into several questions in the
classification of isolated terminal quotient singularities in dimension four and
possible extensions of this classification to higher dimensions. Extensive
computer assisted calculations have been and will continue to be used in the
search for these singularities. In collaboration with David Morrison, he will
study the stability of Hilbert points of K3 surfaces and will use the results of
this study to describe compactifications of moduli spaces of such surfaces. With
Dave Bayer, he will implement a universally standard basis algorithm for the
construction of state polytopes of projective varieties and use it to produce
and study such polytopes. A superior algorithm for computing these polytopes has
been found and will be exploited in these researches. On the bases of these
examples, he will attempt to find a geometric refinement of the Hilbert-Mumford
criterion suited to the study of stability of Hilbert points of projective
varieties. In further joint work with Bayer, he will use these examples to
investigate the relationship between the state polytopes of a variety and the
complexity of standard or Grobner basis calculations for the ideal of the
variety.
