9316242 Carr This award provides funding for the acquisition of an inductively-
coupled plasma mass spectrometer system that will be housed and operated in the
Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University. The instrument has the ability to
measure the concentration of most elements dissolved in water or dilute acids
down to very low concentration levels. It will be used primarily in the research
of geochemists at Rutgers who are engaged in research on Central American and
Hawaiian volcanoes, iridium deposition in Greenland ice cores for interpretation
of past climate changes, trace metal scavenging in the oceans, deep sea
spherules, and the composition of meteorites. ***
