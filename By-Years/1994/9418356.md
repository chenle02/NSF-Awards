Bukowinski 9418356 Density functional theory will be used to develop self
consisten ab initio models of the response of deformable ions to crystal
environments. Spherical and non-spherical deformations will be included, as well
as the effects of dynamic polarizability and long-ranged van der Waals
interactions. The model will include, as qpecial cases, current electron-gas
potential theories. A detailed comparative study of existing models, as applied
to mantle minerals composed of SiO2, MgO, CaO, and Al2O3, will be carried out to
inform the development of the above extensions. The fully developed models will
then be used to examine the static and dynamic properties of the same family of
minerals, and to explore, with the help of Monte Carlo and simulated annealing
techniques, mineral structures that may form at intermediate and very high
pressures, and high temperatures. The work will lead to a better understanding
of possible sources of radial discontinuities deep in the lower mantle, and of
thermal, structural and chemical effects on seismic velocities. ****
