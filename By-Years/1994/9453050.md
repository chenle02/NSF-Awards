9453050 Bybee The Ministry of Education in Israel and the National Science
Foundation are supporting a two-part conference of one week each in each
country. Five Isreali and five U. S. science educators exchange information on
the process of science reform in the two countries and the role of technology
education in the school science programs. The project is to initiate a long term
working arrangement to share ideas and resources and development of curricula
for science and technology education. The conference would include visits to
schools, universities and other institutions involved in educational reform. ***
