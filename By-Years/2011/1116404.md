This project targets the theoretical foundations of the next generation of large
scale distributed storage systems, which are currently undergoing explosive
growth because they form a critical component of cloud computing. This growth
has been driven primarily by a system-building approach, and the theory is
underdeveloped and lagging behind.

This project develops the mathematical foundations as well as practical
engineering constructions related to meeting the data-integrity challenges of
next-generation distributed storage systems, and focuses on: (i) Energy-aware
Distributed Storage Network Codes aimed at optimizing system energy tradeoffs
across the dimensions of storage cost, network bandwidth, disk access cost, and
encoding/decoding complexity; (ii) Secure Distributed Storage Capacity with
regard to both active and passive attacks; and (iii) Latency-minimized
Distributed Storage Systems that minimize user-experienced latency through codes
by exploring the complex interplay between coding and queuing delay.
