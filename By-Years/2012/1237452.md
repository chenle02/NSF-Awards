This is a RAPID project to complete the high resolution scanning of a juvenile
orca skeleton for inclusion in the Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project
collection (VZAP), a project that is currently supported by the Arctic Social
Sciences Program. VZAP is a "virtual, interactive, osteological reference
collection for the study of northern vertebrates." As the PI explains, full orca
skeletons are very rare and this is a unique opportunity to add a juvenile
skeleton to the VZAP collection. The reason for the RAPID is that the Sitka
Sound Science Center, the institutions who owns the skeleton, is currently in
the process of rearticulating the orca skeleton to put on display in their
museum. In order to scan the skeleton it must be disarticulated and because the
Center is doing this as a community project they cannot wait before continuing
the articulation project, which will take place March 17th-24th,the week of
March 11th offers the last opportunity to scan these bones.
