This project will aid in the publication and distribution of a journal devoted
to research on space weather and the transition of research results to practical
applications. The journal, Space Weather: The International Journal of Research
and Applications, is published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and is
designed to foster the transfer of space weather research to applications. It
will enhance the communication between researchers, forecasters, and users of
space weather data.
