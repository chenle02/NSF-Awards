This award will support student travel to the 2016 IEEE Cyber Security
Development Conference to be held in Boston in November 2016. The Cyber Security
Development Conference (SecDev) provides a venue for presenting ideas, research
and experience about the development of secure systems. SecDev is distinguished
by its focus on how to "build security in". Its goal is to encourage and
disseminate new ideas for secure system development among both academia and
industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SecDev encourages students to consider "big"
ideas that will lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently)
provocative discussion. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel
expenses for students to attend the conference. The training and development of
students in this way will help to widen the talent pool of professionals and
researchers focused on addressing challenges of developing critical secure
systems and services. The proposed effort particularly encourages students from
under-represented populations and institutions.
