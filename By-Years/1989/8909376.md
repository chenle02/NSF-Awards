Although real business cycle models show some promise in being able to explain
macroeconomic fluctuations, the results from the statistical testing and
estimation of these models have been fairly disappointing. Building on previous
work on simulation estimators, the first part of this project will focus on
estimating these models from a perspective which is more rigorous than existing
techniques. With the use of simulation estimation, it will be possible to shed
light on questions about which aspects of the model might be inconsistent with
real data,and which features of the data are important for which parameter
estimates. The second part of the proposal concerns the integration of a serious
treatment of policy analysis into the real business cycle model. The goal is to
envelop a framework in which various approaches to policy analysis can be
analyzed and evaluated, and to derive conditions under which each approach might
be valid. Ultimately, the empirical implications of the model will be compared
to U.S. post-war data. One of the side benefits of this research will be a set
of computer programs which implement the techniques developed in this project.
