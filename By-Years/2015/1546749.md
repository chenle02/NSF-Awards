Olfaction is an evolutionarily primitive sense critical for survival across the
animal kingdom - finding food, searching for mates, or avoiding predation all
depend on detecting, identifying, and discriminating odors. Although early steps
in olfactory processing are relatively well understood, significant gaps remain
in our understanding of higher-order odor representations and processing during
on-going behavior. Deciphering the operating principles of olfaction requires
the development of innovative and integrative approaches that combine novel
theoretical frameworks, improved mathematical models, and novel behavioral
paradigms across the phylogenetic spectrum, experimental methodologies, and
engineering principles. The objectives of this 5-day workshop, a so-called
"Ideas Lab", is to address this challenge by bringing together researchers from
diverse scientific backgrounds to engender fresh thinking and innovative
approaches that will transform understanding of olfactory processing in
behavioral contexts while spawning new opportunities to elucidate the general
nature of sensory representations in the brain. The participants will work
collaboratively to develop and hone novel ideas about and approaches to
investigate olfactory processing, and then use these ideas and approaches to
develop multidisciplinary research projects that contain genuinely innovative
and potentially transformative investigations on olfactory coding.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers will make a strong effort to invite women,
members of underrepresented groups, and investigators at all academic levels as
workshop participants. Participants will include 10-15 quantitative researchers
and 15-20 neuroscientists. An integral aspect of the workshop is extensive
cross-disciplinary interaction, which will be facilitated by five leading
scientists from key disciplines who have agreed to serve as mentors and will
guide the project development process. Importantly, this workshop is part of a
concerted effort to coordinate and align interagency priorities to accomplish
the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. The workshop is anticipated to result in the
development of highly innovative research proposals that integrate theoretical
and computational approaches with neuroscience toward the goal of elucidating
the nature of olfactory processing and sensory representations in the brain in
general.
