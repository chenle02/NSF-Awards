This award supports an international workshop to be convened in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo in 2013 by Dr. James H. Smith (University of California,
Davis). The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the
United States, Europe, and Africa who are experts on the social consequences of
the extractive mining of mineral resources. The conference will enable
scientists to share their findings to date, to establish international research
collaborations, and to plan for future research. Minerals such as coltan,
cassiterite, and wolframite are of critical importance both for local African
economies and governments and also for modern technologies and global trade. The
workshop will also support graduate education by including American graduate
students.
