This project is introducing 16 undergraduate computer science faculty to
parallel computing. When they have completed the project they will not only be
prepared to develop an undergraduate course on parallel computing, but also to
assess the feasibility of establishing an undergraduate parallel processing
laboratory at their own college and to be aware of the possibilities for
incorporating aspects of parallel computing into other courses. The project
begins with an intensive two-week course in the summer of 1991. The course
includes lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel computing and
instruction on the design and implementation of parallel algorithms. About half
the time during this course will be spent doing hands-on programming. There will
be a parallel development workstation for every participant and four parallel
computers (three with sixteen processors, one with eight processors) for running
and benchmarking the programs. During the Fall, participants will work on larger
projects, with site visits from the instructors and/or visits back to Colgate.
In January 1992 there will be a one-week seminar during which participants will
present their projects and discuss the practical aspects of teaching parallel
programming to undergraduates.
