This award will support Professors Jimmy Diehl and William Rose of Michigan
Technological University in a research collaboration with Guatemalan researchers
Otoniel Matias and Jorge Giron of the Guatemalan National Institute of
Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology & Hydrology (INSIVUMEH). Their goal is to
develop a program of collection and analysis of paleomagnetic and radiocarbon
data for the purpose of providing information on the rate and frequency of
recent volcanism in Guatemala. Volcanoes to be visited and sampled include:
Santa Maria, where Rose and others (1977) have documented a possible excursion
of the geomagnetic field, Fuego and Pacaya. The information provided by this
research will assist local authorities in developing volcanic hazard planning
and provide the geomagnetic community with valuable information concerning the
behavior of the time-averaged paleomagnetic field and its paleosecular variation
at low latitudes. In the process, Guatemalan researchers will be trained in the
fundamentals of paleomagnetism, especially its use as a correlation tool. By
reinforcing the development of a local capability in volcanic hazard assessment
in Guatemala, this award fulfills the objectives of the Science in Developing
Countries Program.
