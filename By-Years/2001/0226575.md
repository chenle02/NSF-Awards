This two-year award for US-Dutch collaboration in social psychology involves
Craig D. Parks of Washington State University and Paul van Lange of the Free
University of Amsterdam in The Netherlands. The objectives are to study the
misperception of cooperative actions. The general purpose is to better
understand how misunderstandings arise, and the impact on future behavior of
having one's actions misinterpreted. The work involves three related jointly
conducted studies on the misattribution processes, ignorance of diagnostic
information, and the misinterpretation of a specific action as causes of
misunderstanding. The studies will look at the long-term impact on interpersonal
relations of misperceived motives, and will include the misconception of selfish
actions.
