Project studies the deep seismicity of the area around eastern Indonesia. Uses
data from the International Seismological Centre. Primary question that remains
unanswered is whether subduction continues below the 670 km discontinuity.
Project goals are to improve the seismic imaging from the earthquake data so as
to determine if activity in fact does occur below the discontinuity. Project is
in cooperation with the Indonesian Agency for Meterology and Geophysics, in
Jakarta.
