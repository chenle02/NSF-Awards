The research topic is Bayesian nonparametric inference. Foundational questions
in coherence and admissibility will be investigated. Nonparametric prediction
and distribution estimation will be studied by constructing new models and
extending existing ones. Asymptotic expansions will be developed leading to
computable approximations to the posterior distributions of interesting
population functionals. Bayesian nonparametric ideas and procedures will be
applied to specific problems in survival analysis, treatment allocation and
comparison, and the analysis of histogram data. In cases that exact Bayesian
nonparametric procedures turn out to be impossible or difficult to derive,
alternative inferential procedures with a quasi-Bayes flavor will be explored.
