9452859 Friel Reflecting on our Work: NSF Teacher Enhancement This 2.5-day
conference convenes 35 experts in TE and school change to review, critique, and
synthesize what has been learned over the past several years of TE projects in
K-6 mathematics. Conferees include PIs, former participants of TE projects, and,
to broaden the perspective, several representatives from elementary science.
Issues addressed by the conference include: how best to effect teacher, school,
and district change; how such change ultimately affects students; the resources
(financial and human) available to effect systemic change; and assessing the
impact of TE programs. A Proceedings of the conference will be published and
will include 5 invited papers identifying major issues, and a set of conference
recommendations to help guide NSF's upcoming massive, national teacher
enhancement efforts.
