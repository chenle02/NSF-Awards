This project concerns the incorporation of a high field, Fourier Transform
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for the improvement of undergraduate
laboratory instruction and research. The instrument is being used heavily in
sophomore organic chemistry for acquiring spectra in conjunction with organic
synthesis and product identification. NMR spectroscopy is also an important
component of the following junior and senior level laboratory courses: physical
chemistry, instrumental analysis, advanced inorganic chemistry, biochemistry,
and organic spectroscopy. Advanced applications such as the inversion- recovery
pulse sequence, variable temperature line-shape analysis, the nuclear Overhauser
effect, and various 2-D spectroscopy techniques have been introduced. The NMR is
also being used in numerous faculty sponsored undergraduate research projects.
The institution has contributed to this project an amount exceeding the NSF
funds by approximately 11%.
