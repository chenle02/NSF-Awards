All mammals share a fundamental energy-related concern: once the initial costs
of obtaining and assimilating food energy have been accomplished, then remaining
surplus energy must be allocated parsimoniously among a variety of competing
physiological and behavioral demands. Obtaining food to meet survival demands is
a core energetic constraint to which most other dimensions of development, such
as growth and especially reproduction, must be subservient. Because of the
disparate demands of reproduction between the two sexes, they can often be
conceptually treated as separate species. It is therefore not surprising that
males and females of certain species have evolved markedly different priorities
for energy allocation. Dr. Glenn Perrigo is making use of the mouse as an
experimental model to investigate differences in energy allocation strategies
between males and females. His work will examine organizational and activational
effects of early gonadal hormones on sex differences. He will also study effects
of maternal stress on the fetal hormone milieu of offspring whose mothers are
subject to rigorous foraging conditions during pregnancy. This work should give
us more information on how gonadal hormones effect differences in energy
allocation in mammals.
