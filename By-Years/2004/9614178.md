9614178 Sparks Komatiite lavas, with extremely high eruption temperature provide
unique information about the Archean mantle. Simple models of the major element
compositions of Archean komatiites indicate melting at very high temperatures
and pressures (potential temperatures greater than 1800C and depths of at least
250 km), but the dynamics of upwelling, melting and melt extraction in these
areas of the mantle are not understood. The PI proposes to integrate a numerical
model of mantle convection and melting with parameterizations of melt
compositions from high pressure melting experiments. These models will be used
to systematically explore the effects of poorly constrained properties of and
conditions in the Archean mantle (temperature, composition, viscosity, melt
migration permeability, lithospheric thickness) on the major and trace element
composition of the melts that are produced. The compositions of ultramafics and
other Archean rocks will be used to constrain the hypotheses and assumptions of
the models. A flexible and efficient model that can determine the dependencies
and interactions between the fluid dynamics and chemistry of mantle melting will
provide both insight into the dynamics of the Archean mantle and guidance in
setting the priorities of future experimental programs.
