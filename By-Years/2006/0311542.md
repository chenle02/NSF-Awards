Designing High Performance and Scalable Communication Subsystems for Next
Generation Clusters with InfiniBand Architecture

Abstract

Cluster computing systems are becoming increasingly popular for providing cost-
effective and affordable computing environments for day-to-day computational
needs for a wide range of applications in various disciplines. The emerging
InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) standard is being positioned as a strong candidate
for high-speed interconnect for next generation clusters. Compared to previous
generation cluster interconnects, IBA provides many novel features such as
multiple transport services, Remote DMA (RDMA) read/write support, atomic
operations, hardware multicast support, and multiple service levels
(priorities). These novel features provide unique challenges and opportunities
to design scalable and high-performance communication subsystems for next
generation clusters. This research will focus along the following two directions
to efficiently support message passing programming paradigm (using the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) standard) on clusters: 1) Low-latency, high-bandwidth,
and scalable point-to-point communication operations; and 2) High-performance
and scalable collective communication operations. Optimal protocols and
algorithms along these two directions will be developed while taking advantages
of the novel features of IBA. The derived solutions will be evaluated through a
set of micro-benchmarks and applications for performance and scalability. Best
solutions will be integrated into an MPI implementation and will be available
for public use. This will enable architects to design next generation high-end
distributed-memory systems with IBA-based clusters. It will also facilitate the
end-users to run their MPI applications on IBA-based clusters to harness best
performance with scalability.
