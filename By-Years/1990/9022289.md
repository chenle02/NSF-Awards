The feasibility of coring deep research wells 12 to 15km. (40,000 to 50,000
ft.) using coiled-tubing drill rigs and slim hole coring tool is being
investigated. A Phase I technical review and analysis was performed of critical
components of a coiled-tubing coring system to determine if it is feasible to
adapt existing coiled-tubing rigs to deep coring applications. The review showed
that a 15km (50,000) sampling system could by developed within five years and a
shallower system for coring, to 6km (20,000 ft.), could be developed today by
retrofitting existing coiled tubing rigs. In Phase II, the construction of a
high-strength tubing string will be investigated. Downhole components required
for both the deep and a shallower coiled-tubing sampling system will be tested
in the laboratory and in shallow field sites down to 0.6 km (2000 ft). The
shallower system has immediate application in mining and petroleum exploration,
shallow scientific sampling, and horizontal drilling.
