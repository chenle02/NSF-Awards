The design and analysis of a cache coherence system for hierarchical bus-based
shared-memory multiprocessors is being carried out. The bus protocol is
compatible with the Futurebus IEEE896 specifications and can be easily utilized
in the next generation of general purpose bus- based shared-memory
multiprocessors. The goals of the design are on low memory access time, low bus
utilization, and cost effective hardware. The stochastic colored Petri net
simulation software developed can be utilized as a powerful simulation technique
in the analysis of many other concurrent computer systems. The concurrent
software developed can alleviate the problems of simulations on a sequential
computer. The principal investigator is a new Ph.D. who already has significant
progress in his research. The research focuses on important and timely topics.
Support is highly recommended.
