There is currently considerable uncertainty in the global budget of carbon
tetrachloride, an anthropogenic compound important by virtue of its acute
toxicity and impact on global climate (leading to commercial production being
restricted by the Montreal Protocol). It is likely that previous source and/or
sink estimates for carbon tetrachloride may be in error or at least highly
uncertain. This study involves a seasonal program of field measurements of
carbon tetrachloride uptake fluxes into soil at a number of climatically diverse
surface sites coupled with parallel laboratory studies characterizing biological
uptake mechanisms. The project involves collaboration between a university and a
federal government laboratory. Results from this study will advance our
understanding of the atmospheric budget of carbon tetrachloride by better
characterizing the influence of soil dynamics on the sink term of atmospheric in
the global carbon tetrachloride budget. Broader impacts of this research include
the societal benefit to science through advances in understanding in a highly
climate- and policy- relevant issue. Contributions to education include research
training and professional development opportunities for a number of students.
