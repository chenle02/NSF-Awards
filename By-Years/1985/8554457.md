This proposal describes two three-week workshops for 30 teachers each to be held
during the summer of 1986. Teachers from Iowa and throughout the upper midwest
who are minimally prepared to teach high school physics, but who are scheduled
to do so, will be selected. The workshops will provide teachers with content
background in physics as well as training in teaching strategies. Resource and
instructional strategies materials created and field tested by the Iowa Physics
Task Force for high school physics teachers will be used. Master teachers from
Iowa will assist in the workshops, aiding participants with subject matter as
well as classroom techniques. A very interesting set of follow-up activities
should insure the implementation of an improved teaching/learning environment in
the physics classes of these teachers. Conference calls on a regular basis will
maintain a close relationship among the participants and the project staff.
Videotaping of physics lessons will be carried out every nine weeks by
participants. These tapes will be critiqued by project staff and returned with
comments and suggestions. On-site visits will be conducted by project staff to
personally observe the classes.
