This project is concerned with research in commutative algebra on local rings
and their singularities. Topics include the Hilbert function and Hilbert
polynomial of an m-primary ideal in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, and birational
extensions and completions of local domains. The work has specific applications
to algebraic geometry, particularly to the problem of resolution of
singularities. Commutative rings are algebraic structures possessing a
commutative addition and a commutative multiplication. These structures occur
throughout mathematics. Common examples include polynomial rings, and rings of
algebraic integers in extension fields of the rationals. This project is
concerned with a variety of questions on the structure of commutative rings.
