*** 9661209 Lenherr This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
carry out research and development on the AIDE assistant for data analysts. The
goal of this Phase I project is determine which research issues must be
addressed before AIDE can become a commercially viable product. Currently,
analysts in government, corporations and universities rely on software that has
changed little in decades. Exploratory data analysis, by which we mean finding
hidden structure in large datasets, is painfully slow, because conventional
statistical packages require users to specify every operation. Moreover,
conventional packages lack the intelligence to interpret the results of
operations. In contrast, our AIDE package can interpret intermediate results, so
when, for example, it discovers clusters in data, it autonomously examines each
for internal structure and then combines these local analyses into a summary of
the entire dataset. AIDE is designed to conduct thousands of statistical
operations under the strategic guidance of analysts. The analyst steers the
exploration of a dataset instead of specifying every operation; AIDE is an
assistant instead of a fancy calculator. Estimates are that three million
statistics packages are installed in the U.S. If even a fraction of those users
switched to AIDE, the commercial impact would be very significant. Potentially
AIDE could revolutionize exploratory data analysis and save countless hours and
dollars. ***
