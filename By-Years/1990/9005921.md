Taxonomic understanding of the broad interrelationships of groups of flowering
plants can both facilitate and constrain comparative study of the morphology,
physiology, and ecology of plants. Where taxa have been well sampled, deep
knowledge of their evolutionary or genealogical relationships leads to fruitful
comparisons of homologous structures or biochemical pathways or life-histories.
When the taxa are not well known, comparisons are often made between spuriously
related forms, and arguments may perpetuate endlessly over whether convergence
or true evolutionary relationship accounts for the similarity in form or
function under study. Dr. Larry Hufford of the University of Minnesota has
organized a large-scale symposium for the Botanical Society of America meetings
in Richmond, Virginia, on the topic of the evolutionary relationships of the
highly advanced dicots of the subclass Asteridae, including the sunflower,
potato, and madder families, among the largest in the world in numbers of
species. Fourteen speakers, including four from Europe, will address in turn
morphological data, from living and fossil plants, and molecular data, from
recent DNA analyses of these plants, to identify areas of agreement and
disagreement in our understanding of the phylogeny of Asteridae and to target
projects necessary to achieve resolution. Plans have already been made for
publication of the meeting's deliberations, so the results will become widely
available to all interested botanists.
