In order to understand meiosis at a mechanistic level we are dissecting a simple
meiotic process which occurs in Drosophila melanogaster. This process, known as
distributive pairing, involves the pairing and segregation of chromosomes in the
absence of exchange. We have characterized two loci which impair this system,
namely the Axs locus, required for chromosome pairing, and nod which is
essential for a chromosome modification event that ensures disjunction. We have
cloned and sequenced much of the nod locus and have executed a chromosome walk
in the Axs region. We now propose to dissect the nod locus by mapping and
sequencing seven nod mutations as well as nod-cognate clone from Drosophila
simulans. In order to ascertain whether the nod+ gene product belongs to a
member of a known family of proteins or represents a novel function, we will
determine the primary amino acid sequence of the nod+ gene product by cDNA
sequencing. We also propose a transcriptional analysis to determine when in
oocyte development the nod locus is expressed. Antibodies produced against the
nod gene product will allow us to determine the cellular localization of the
nod+ protein. We also propose a genetic screen for mutations in loci which
interact with the nod locus. Finally, we propose to clone and sequence the Axs
locus. The analysis of this locus will provide crucial insights into the
physical basis of pairing. These studies will provide basic molecular
information regarding meiotic pairing and segregation. This is a continuation of
support for investigation into the mechanisms of chromosome pairing, a crucial
step in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.
The work to be done under this award carries to the molecular level the genetic
analysis begun with the previous award.
