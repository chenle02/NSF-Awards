The impact, or dynamic pounding, of adjacent buildings has been identified as a
major cause of damage during severe earthquakes. Because of the serious
potential of structural and nonstructural damage by pounding during seismic
events, efficient methods and techniques to mitigate this impact are needed. The
proposed research is aimed at the development of pounding reduction devices
(PRDs) for adjacent buildings located in congested urban centers. Consideration
will be given to the systematic treatment of uncertainties in the knowledge of
the properties and mechanics of existing buildings subject to pounding and in
predicting future earthquake ground motions. These uncertainties will play an
important role in optimizing the mechanical properties of the proposed PRD
components. This research will investigate the economic feasibility of
installing PDRs, developing promising mechanical design concepts, a model
application, and analysis methods. In addition the research focuses on the
development of hardware specifications for the devices and methods of
installation.
