Computers, computer systems and the computational infrastructure provided by the
internet are now essential for many aspects of modern life.  It is well-known
and well-documented that, even as computing power and network bandwidth increase
at a rapid rate, users and applications increase their demand for computation
and their use of networks at roughly the same pace.  Thus, no matter how much
progress is made on the hardware and network ends, efficient algorithms to
manage these resources are essential. These efficient algorithms will lead to
tremendous savings in both time and money and will have a positive environmental
impact. They will also contribute to the decisions that are being made presently
about the next generation of the internet, in particular in the design of
routing protocols and the management of data centers.

It is now well-understood that time and space are not the only resources that
need to be carefully managed.  For the past few decades, there has been a
growing emphasis on other concerns such as accuracy of solution, availability of
information, use of cache, management of disk, etc.  More recently, there has
been a growing understanding that energy and power management are also resources
that should be carefully managed.  In this project, the PI will study several
algorithmic problems that arise in applications such as computer systems and
networks.  For each of these, the PI will focus on algorithms for better
managing the technologies, and that have objectives that go beyond time or
solution quality.  In particular, the project will study energy consumption in
both computers and networks, and we will also consider environments in which
other resources must be managed, such as minimizing the number of changes to a
solution over time. The problem areas studied include power management in
routing, power management in scheduling, extending speed scaling to other
domains, and online problems with a reassignment cost. The PI will design
efficient solutions to important practical problems, and the research will have
broader impact.
