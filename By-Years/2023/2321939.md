This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists,
mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and
graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial
need. Over its six-year duration, this project will award a total of 161
scholarships to 65 talented undergraduate students, with a demonstrated
financial need, who are pursuing degrees in Information Technology. The
objectives of the project include generating stimulating educational
opportunities for students to improve their academic performance, increasing
degree completion, ensuring their technical competence, and preparing them for
rewarding jobs in Information Technology fields.

The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-
income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. A group
of computer scientists, information technology experts, and educational
specialists will be assembled to adapt, implement, and evaluate a set of
evidence-based curricular and co-curricular student support activities. These
activities will be evaluated based on the success, retention, and graduation of
low-income students in STEM fields. This project will advance our understanding
of best practices and lessons that will assist other educators to improve STEM
education. This project is funded by NSFâ€™s Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-
income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn
degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM
workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer,
graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
