Eight undergraduate students from the Southwest Rocky Mountain Region will
participate in a ten-week, comprehensive research experience at the University
of New Mexico during the summer of 1991. In accordance with his/her interests,
each student will do one of the following: 1) participate in the design,
construction and operation of a small-scale permeable barrier for groundwater
aquifer remediation; 2) investigate fracture in rock and concrete using laser
interferometry; 3) conduct nondestructive test methods on small structural
components; 4) join in an exciting development of a new fast-scan Scanning
Electron Microscope; 5) design a Lunar optical telescope using interactive
graphical analysis; 6) assist in an experiment to understand microcracking of
solids using a UNM x-ray device; 7) assist in numerical simulations of granular
soil using a discrete element model involving 2D discs and 3D quartz spheres;
and 8) study idealized failure profiles of soil- structure interactions through
video imaging. Over half of the students will be selected from applicants at
institutions other than UNM, especially those without active research programs.
Women, minority and handicapped applicants particularly will be recruited. The
students will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the
research faculty. Each student can expect to learn to work quite independently
over the course of the summer, will present a final seminar on the research, and
will assist in writing a publication describing the work.
