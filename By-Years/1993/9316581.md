9316581 Holt This research involves the investigation of the kinematics of
deforming continental lithosphere in regions such as Asia, Iran, New Zealand,
and Japan. Plate motions are an important process on the earth since they are
responsible for almost all of the observed surface deformation. While rigid
plate models do an excellent job in matching observations globally, relative
motion models within continental lithosphere are more complex. Yet the relative
motions, or velocity gradient tensor, are fundamental to the understanding of
the dynamics of deformation, especially seismic hazard. Strain rates within
regions with adequate deformation rate data will be modeled using continuous
sets of functions such as splines. The goal is to significantly advance the
understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of several complicated regions of
deforming continental lithosphere. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
