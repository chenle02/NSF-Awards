9421491 Brooks This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to obtain an understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical processes
that control the interchange of substances in alluvial sediments of flowing
water streams with the water as affected by the sediment bed forms such as
ripples and dunes. The basic approach being taken in this research is the
conduct of experiments in recirculating laboratory flumes under very carefully
controlled conditions of flow, water quality, the bed media and the nature of
the substances dissolved or in particulate form being exchanged at the bed-fluid
interface. This is a renewal of research previously conducted under NSF Grant
No. 91-05965. Results of this research may be applied to answering important
questions relating to the pollutional effects that substances in bottom
sediments of water bodies have on the overlying water quality. This knowledge is
likely to be applied in environmental engineering practice to determine
approaches to removal of potential water pollutants and contaminants from
sediments and in determining locations for wastewater treatment plants that
would minimize the undesirable effects on environmental quality of their
effluent discharges and management practices for residual sludges. ***
