The Gordon Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Laser Diagnostics in
Combustion is to be held in Plymouth, New Hampshire, July 15-19, 1991. Invited
speakers from government laboratories, universities, and industry will lead
discussions on the applications of the latest theories and techniques in laser
diagnostics to combustion systems. Topics will include various spectroscopic
techniques (Raman, LIF, CARS), high intensity resonant interactions, turbulence-
combustion interactions, quantitative imaging, diagnostics in supercritical
oxidation and hypersonic combustors, and measuring surface film growth. The
Thermal Systems Program has partially sponsored these biennial gatherings over
the past few years because the structure of the conference lends itself to a
strong interchange of ideas among the combustion laser diagnostics community,
with experienced practitioners and postdoctoral students, academic and
industrial researchers, and foreign and US scientists participating.
