Lithospheric extension is a spatially inhomogeneous process, in many cases
associated with detachment faults of regional dimensions and accompanied by
development and filling of intra- cratonic basins. This project is designed to
test predictions of a general model for lithospheric extension using an
integrated geological and geophysical study of the Canning Basin, north- western
Australia. Utilizing data from an active Australian BMR project, this study will
construct cross sections of the basin from seismic data, undertake subsidence
analysis to estimate tectonic and sediment loading subsidence during both the
syn-rift and post-rift phases of basin development and will use gravity data to
constrain the applicability of the general model. Results are expected to
provide a quantitative test of some currently qualitative ideas about the role
detachments within extending lithosphere and the subsidence mechanisms in intra-
cratnonic basins.
