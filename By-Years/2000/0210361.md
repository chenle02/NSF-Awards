This project was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative NSF 01-157, category NER. Exploratory research will be conducted on
the laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) of nanostructures. Experiments will
be carried out utilizing near filed scanning optical probes (NSOMs) in order to
confine the effects of the laser irradiation to lateral dimensions of only a few
tens of nanometers. The main objective of the research is to accomplish
deposition and writing of nanofeatures at specified locations via NSOM-LCVD
processes. Different deposition/substrate systems will be investigated. This
approach will lead to controlled crystal growth and fabrication of complex
nanostructures in three dimensions. Insight will be gained on the fundamental
mechanisms of the complex thermo-chemo-physical phenomena during the nanoscale
deposition, nucleation and crystal growth processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
production of surface nanofeatures has many important applications in critical
emerging technology fields, including the fabrication of nano-electro-photo-
mechanical integrated circuits. The goal of the research is to develop novel
processes for nanostructuring surfaces with tailor-made texture, optical and
electromechanical properties. These processes will be of ubiquitous use in the
fabrication and heterogeneous integration of functional nanoscale devices.
Several existing programs at UC Berkeley will be leveraged in order to broaden
the impact of the research on education and outreach and utilized to identify,
recruit and attract graduate student researchers from underrepresented groups
and minorities. It is expected that the research will form a major part of a
doctoral dissertation, while undergraduate students will also participate in the
research as laboratory assistants. The research results, procedures and
expertise developed in this project will be communicated to both graduate and
undergraduate students through coursework and seminars (including a freshman
seminar).
