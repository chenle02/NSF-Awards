9314349 LUTHER The concentration of trace metals in anoxic and sulfidic
environments is controlled by the precipitation of metal sulfide phases as well
as the complexation of the metals by sulfide and other sulfur species. Stability
constants of a variety of metals of environmental significance with sulfide,
thiosulfate and polysulfides will be determined. The constants will be obtained
by voltammetric methods using the peaks of the sulfur species and/or the metal.
The research also requires titrations of the complexes with acid and base to
determine the number of protons attached to the sulfur species. This work will
build on initial work in seawater which shows that iron (II) and sulfide form
two complexes which are Fe(SH)+ (log B=5.5) and Fe2(SH)3+ (log B= 11.1). These
constants are orders of magnitude higher than constants evaluated by linear free
energy relationships. In fact, Fe2(SH)3+ was not predicted by this or any
experimental approach which uses sulfide as a titrant. Thus, Fe(II) solubility
at anoxic interfaces and in sulfidic environments can be enhanced over previous
estimates.
