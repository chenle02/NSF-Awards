This project involves the study of photo-induced reactions of molecules adsorbed
on supported metal catalyts. Photochemistry of adsorbates on supported metal
catalysts will be monitored by infrared absorption spectroscopy, mass
spectrometry and UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy. Photodissociation of
chlorinated hydrocarbons adsorbed on Ni/aluminum oxide surfaces will be the
first candidates for study. The wavelength dependence of the photodissociation
process will be investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism involved in the
surface photochemistry and to demonstrate whether a significant red-shift in the
photodissociation threshold of the adsorbed molecule exists, as is found for
single crystal metal surfaces. The extension of photo-induced surface chemistry
from single crystal metal surfaces to supported metal catalysts is an important
step in determining the feasibility of utilizing transition metal photo-assisted
catalysis in chemical synthesis and processing. Of particular interest is the
possible development of decom- position catalysts for halogenated hydrocarbons
and other hazardous wastes. The research planning grant will be used to assemble
the necessary apparatus and perform preliminary experiments on the wavelength
dependence of the photodissociation of methyl chloride adsorbed on Ni/alumina.
%%% Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior independent
Federal research support to develop a competitive research project. This project
involves the photochemistry of molecules adsorbed on supported metal catalysts,
an area of great significance in chemical synthesis and processing, and in
hazardous waste control.
