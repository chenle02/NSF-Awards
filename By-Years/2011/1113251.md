This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
analysis needs for monitoring perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in waste water. Perfluorochemicals (PFCs)
are bio-accumulative, extremely persistent and toxic; and there is a huge effort
surrounding remediation of PFOA and PFOS contaminated areas. Considering the
impacts on environment and public health, it is important to monitor PFOA and
PFOS. Although there are established LC/MS/MS methods to measure them at low
levels, this equipment is expensive and not generally field portable. This
research aims at the development of a field and lab deployable ion-selective
electrode that permits selective and fast measurement of PFOA and PFOS with a
low detection limit at low cost. The project will take advantage of the highly
selective and fouling-resistant fluorous membranes recently licensed from the
University of Minnesota. The broader impacts of this research are significant as
the proposed sensor will provide a fast, easy, sample pretreatment free,
selective and economical detection method for environmental monitoring,
compliance and remediation efforts, which are currently hampered by costly and
time consuming liquid extractions coupled with LC/MS. Additional broader impacts
include expanded application of the sensor to measure the contaminant in blood,
soil and food. Most importantly, these efforts are important and instructive to
direct and monitor remediation and enable in-field research. We view this effort
as an integral part of a wider effort to understand and reduce sources and
pathways by which the persistent substance has become widespread in the
environment.
