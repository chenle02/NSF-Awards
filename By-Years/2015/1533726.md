This award is intended to provide travel support to the essential
representatives of the US scientific community who serve as the US members of
the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) working groups or standing
committees and to the US delegate to IASC to participate in activities
associated with Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US
representatives will participate in the Arctic Science Summit Week and
associated meetings in Toyama, Japan on April 23 - 30, 2015. This award includes
support for: a) PI Hinzman, the US delegate to IASC, to participate on behalf of
the US Arctic science community on the IASC Council; b) travel support for US
representatives to each of the five working groups appointed through the US
National Academies process; and c) travel support for US representatives of the
IASC?s Data Standing Committee. The US representative to the SAON Observations
and Networks Committee should also participate in this meeting with funds
provided through this award. IASC facilitates international science development
through workshop, networks, planning meetings, and early-career science support.
It promotes and facilitates international research activities with an emphasis
on issues that not only cross national boundaries, but also cross disciplines
and even timescales. National support is essential to ensure the US maintains a
leadership role in planning and coordinating these research efforts in the
international sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an important part of the US
contribution to this international effort and the Arctic Section finds the plan
fits well with section goals. Staff recommends an award at the requested amount.
