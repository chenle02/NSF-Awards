This award supports the research of Andrew Granville and covers a broad range
of areas of mathematics, primarily in number theory, with applications to
computer science. The research builds on Granville's understanding of the
distribution of primes. The award also supports his continued work in both
graduate and undergraduate education as well as his exposition. This
Presidential Faculty Fellow award to Andrew Granville is for excellent research
and teaching in number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
