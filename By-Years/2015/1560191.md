This new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will train students
in a computer science approach to data analytics, ranging from machine learning
to data management, and develop research skills from primary research engagement
and supplementary activities. Students will: (1) be exposed to the many
applications of data analytics across computer science, (2) gain expertise via
one specific project, and (3) be equipped with a technical competitive
advantage, knowledge, and motivation to pursue graduate study in a STEM field.
They will be deeply involved in projects that span a wide range of interests and
have social appeal. This REU site will build national economic competitiveness
by training and engaging a new generation of students, with a specific focus on
women and on students from institutions without much access to research in STEM
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big data - the confluence of an ever growing supply
of data generated across all fields and disciplines and increasingly powerful
computational tools to process and mine these data - is widely acknowledged as
one of the biggest opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. This site
will give undergraduates a chance to engage in cutting-edge research in one of
many computer science fields that utilizes data analysis. Each student will work
with a single faculty mentor on a specific project. Students will participate in
an intense, hands-on research experience associated with their own summer
project, but they will enjoy a cohort community of REU students all working
within and learning about data analytics. Students will learn the ways in which
the intelligent use of data can solve difficult problems and improve people's
quality of life. They will complete their time at the site with the skills to
further the use of data analysis applied to the field of their choosing.
