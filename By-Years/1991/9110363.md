The objective of this proposal is to theoretically analyze the effects of
polarization mode dispersion (PMD) on various types of coherent optical
receivers. The research will determine how the bit error rate depends on the
transmitting and local laser spectral widths, the length of the optical
transmission link, and the PMD properties of the fiber. This will be important
for the very long links that are now possible with fiber amplifiers. The
analysis will be performed on all major types of receivers that process
polarization and polarization combined with phase or frequency. This includes:
1) polarization diversity receivers using ASK, FSK and DPSK demodulation, with
and without phase diversity, 2) receivers that use polarization controllers, and
3) receivers that do polarization demodulation. Polarization mode dispersion is
defined as the difference in group delay between the two principal states of
polarization of a fiber. The principal states are used as basis vectors in the
analysis. Stokes parameters are also used.
