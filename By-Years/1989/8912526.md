This project will support the Conference on Operator Algebras to be held
Occtober 10-14, 1989 at Pennsylvania State University. The main themes of the
conference will be on operator theory, mathematical physics, and low dimensional
topology. The conference will be part of a month-long period of research
activity at the university focused on these areas.
