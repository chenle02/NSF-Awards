9317664 Angelides This proposal requests funds to purchase a confocal laser
scanning microscope. The instrument will serve the research needs of a number of
faculty whose research work focuses on the dynamics of living cells, the three-
dimensional arrangement of subcellular structures, and the three- dimensional
reconstruction of cells such as neurons in intact brain slices. Among other
topics, the instrument will be used for studies of the distribution of ion
channels and receptors in brain slices using fluorescent probes and antibodies;
the organization and dynamics of nuclear and mitotic structures; the development
of synapses in the hippocampus; gene transfer processes; the regulation and
function of keratins in the epidermis; localization of overexpressed smooth
muscle caldesmon in cultured cells and localization in fascin, an actin binding
protein; desmin and vimentin during myogenesis; and hormonal regulation of
breast cancer.
