9451520 Lyon Image-sequence processing and image-sequence synthesis are the
enabling technologies for multi-media, HDTV, desk-top video, interactive TV and
computer animation. The objective of this proposal is to provide laboratory
equipment for our developing image-sequence processing and image-sequence
synthesis courses. These courses are closely aligned to the needs of industry
and address recent results as well as topics of current research. This
department believes that a knowledge of image-sequence processing and image-
sequence synthesis technologies provides a competitive edge to students and
industry. The image-sequence processing and image-sequence synthesis topics are
dealt with in several experiments, structured around the material presented in
our developing computer graphics and image processing courses. These experiments
will give vital experience to our students, so that they may have a significant
societal impact by transferring these technologies to industry in this and the
next millennium.
