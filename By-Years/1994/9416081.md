The principal investigator and his colleagues organize a meeting to bring
together research workers at the forefront of activity in the broad area of
scientific computing and differential equations; special emphasis is given to
the solution of ordinary differential equations. The motivation for organizing a
conference with this emphasis is to stimulate the field by fostering links among
researchers in numerical ordinary differential equations and researchers in
important areas of application and researchers expert in the qualitative theory
of differential equations. The injection of these theoretical themes and
application-oriented themes is designed to facilitate significant advances in
computational aspects of ordinary differential equations. Scientific computing
is fundamental throughout science and engineering, underpinning many of the
important breakthroughs in basic research and technological advancement that
have been seen in recent decades, and that will continue to arise in the future.
Differential equations form models of many important real-world phenomena and
scientific computing in this context is thus of paramount importance. This
conference aims to bring together a variety of research workers in the field,
including experts in application areas of scientific and engineering importance
and computational applied mathematicians expert in computer simulations of
differential equation models. The outcome of such a cross-fertilization of ideas
will be beneficial to the advancement of basic science and to the development of
technology.
