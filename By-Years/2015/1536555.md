High-valued engineering assets used in the manufacturing and service sectors are
increasingly being instrumented with hundreds of sensors that are used for
condition monitoring and predicting remaining lifetime, i.e., prognostics. The
underlying idea of prognostics is that sensor data often contain unique fault-
based features that can be utilized for prediction. Today, multiple sensors are
increasingly being used to monitor different aspects of a degradation process in
a single machine, thus, it is important to leverage the combined information
embedded in these sensors. However, most of the existing prognostic models
developed to date focus on single-sensor applications and do not account for any
data quality issues. This award supports fundamental research to provide
prognostic models for multistream sensor signals where data observations may be
sparse and/or missing; an aspect that has consistently challenged the
implementation of prognostics in real-world applications. This research will
enable numerous industries in the manufacturing and service sectors to increase
equipment availability, prevent catastrophic failures, and reduce maintenance
costs. Research findings will also be used to advance engineering education by
incorporating the findings of this work in graduate coursework.

Almost all approaches available for degradation modeling are based on a key
assumption that is rarely satisfied in reality; the quality of sensor data is
high and states are observed on a continuous basis. This project will bridge the
gap between theory and practice in the area of prognostics by relaxing the
simplifying assumptions that have traditionally been the basis for developing
prognostic models. This will be accomplished by incorporating parsimonious
estimation methods and functional data analysis to model degradation signals
with missing and sparse observations. Specifically, functional Principal
Component Analysis will be used to model simultaneous variations of multivariate
signal recorded by different sensors. Principal Components Analysis through
Conditional Expectation will be used to address the challenges arising from the
missing observations. Isotonic regression methods will be used to ensure
monotonicity of the resulting models, which will be key in estimating remaining
lifetime.
