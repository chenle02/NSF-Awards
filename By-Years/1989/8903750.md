The larger, first part of this project will consist of solubility measurements
at elevated temperatures and pressures of complexes of mercury, tellurium,
copper, gold, iron, silver, nickle, cobalt, zinc and lead. The second part
applies previous solubility data to develop an improved understanding of ore
depositing processes. The sequences of formation and morphologies as a function
of degree of supersaturation will be determined at high temperature and pressure
for amorphous FeS, mackinawite, cubic FeS, hexagonal and monoclinic pyrrhotites,
smythite, greigite, marcasite and pyrite. Both a map of the geochemical
conditions producing each form and their kinetics should result. Last, ore
deposition processes will be modeled. This work will expand our understanding of
how ore deposits form and where to look for them.
