9357505 Barrera This research is directed towards the processing of advanced
materials with the Buckminsterfullerene, C60, as a reinforcing species. The
emphasis is to develop an understanding of the fullerene-metal interaction
necessary for producing these materials. The research takes advantage of the
atomic analysis of surface and synchrotron radiation techniques. %%% The
knowledge generated in this program is fundamental to the understanding of the
properties of lightweight metal-matrix composites. This understanding can be
applied to tailoring the properties of these technologically useful materials.
