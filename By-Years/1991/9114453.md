The objective of this study is to reduce the magnitude of erosion due to slurry
particles in turbulent flows in seals and pumps through improved design. The new
designs will be developed by computational fluid dynamics applied to turbulent
flowing an annulus with an inner rotating cylinder, a dead end wall, and several
protrusions. The protrusions reduce the speed of the slurry particles and divert
them to the outflow stream. The size and location of the protrusions will be
optimized in the computational program and the results confirmed by
experimentation involving laser flow visualization and laser doppler velocity
measurements. The project has strong industrial participation.
