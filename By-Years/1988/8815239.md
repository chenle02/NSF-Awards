The Electrical, Mechanical and Chemical Engineering Departments and the
Materials Science and Physics Departments will participate in this research
activity to gain a fundamental understanding of the properties of
microelectromechanical devices and systems so as to be able to carry out
experimental research. In addition, this group will conduct research to develop
improved process technology for fabrication of three dimensional microcomponents
and the design of a demonstrative micro-control system. This research program is
organized into three components: o mechanical characterization of micro-
components made of semiconductors, metal and ceramics, including static, dynamic
fatigue, and tribological properties; o development of improved dry etching and
multiple layer fabrication processes and studies of assembly techniques of
microsystems and; o study and design of a one dimensional displacement control
system for biomedical and applications to probe neural activities or as a tool
for microsurgery in the brain.
