The Physics Department of Muhlenberg College is developing a workshop physics
approach to the General Physics course. The courses meet exclusively in the
laboratory where students explore topics by performing a large number of
computer assisted experiments. Students learn by doing, while formal lectures
have been abandoned. In the past students generally played a very passive role
in lecture courses and with this approach students are more involved in the
learning process. They make the decisions on what variations of the basic
experiments to perform, allowing students with different interests to explore
different aspects of the topic being studied. The course is structured around
the computer interface Series 6500 system from Pasco Scientific, which also has
a wide variety of compatible equipment specifically designed for the
introductory lab. We are phasing the new course in for all general physics
students over a two to three year period.
