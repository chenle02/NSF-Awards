Dr. Derck Massa, at Applied Research Corporation, and Dr. Edward Fitzpatrick, at
Princeton University will carry out new observations toward stars at near
infrared wavelengths which will be used with data obtained at ultraviolet
wavelengths to construct and analyze extinction curves. Interstellar dust is an
important constituent of the interstellar medium (ISM), and it plays a major
role in determining the physical conditions of the ISM. Understanding the
properties of interstellar dust is critical to understanding many basic
astrophysical processes. The observations of Drs. Massa and Fitzpatrick will
increase our understanding of the size distribution and chemistry of
interstellar dust grains.
