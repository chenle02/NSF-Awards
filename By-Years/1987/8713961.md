Slag foaming plays an important role in new in-bath smelting processes for
producing iron and in state-of-the-art electric furnace steelmaking; both
processes will be important in future steelmaking in the United States. Most
previous work on slag foaming simply measured a foaming index which was the foam
height or foam life for arbitrary conditions. Whereas such qualitative
information indicates what slags may foam easily it gives little information
concerning the basic phenomena. The present experimental work will measure
foaming as a function of slag composition, gas flow rate, slag viscosity slag
surface tension and temperature. The measurements will not only include foam
height and life but also the void fraction as a function of position, which is
one of the critical parameters in any quantitative analysis of foaming. The slag
compositions to be studied will include those relative to in-bath smelting and
electric furnace steelmaking. The effects of small concentrations of surface
active elements such as P2O5, and of suspended second phase particles will also
be investigated. The foaming of the slags will be correlated to the properties
of the slag and, the equations for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy
will be used to generalize the behavior. A new model concerned with foam life
will also be tested. The surface tension of the slags will be determined if no
such information exists for that particular slag. In addition, the rate of
nitrogen transfer through a foamed slag and its reaction with liquid iron will
be measured.
