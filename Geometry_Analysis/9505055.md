DMS-9505055 PI: Brylinski Brylinski will continue her research on the
quantization of nilpotent orbits. The main thrust of the project is to
investigate the symplectic and algebraic geometry of nilpotent orbits and to
find ways to quantize these orbits within the broad scheme of geometric
quantization. The outcome will be the construction of geometric models of
unitary representations. This work will result in a better understanding of
geometric quantization, quantization in general, and the geometry and invariant
theory of nilpotent orbits. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
