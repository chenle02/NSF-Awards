New organic conductors and semiconductors are currently being synthesized
chemically based upon the metal phthalocyanines. The possibility of growing
these new organic semiconductor materials in thin film form by a molecular beam
epitaxy method will be examined. Improved electrical properties are expected
over the bulk crystalline material.
