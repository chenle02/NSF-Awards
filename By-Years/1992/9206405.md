The underlying hypothesis of this research is that those firms that utilize an
internal capability to design a major part of their own manufacturing technology
will have competitive advantages that can be identified and ascribed to this
strategy. The objective of this research is to investigate and test this
hypothesis. The research plan includes field studies of the use of in-house
capabilities to develop and build new manufacturing technology and the
development and implementation for survey mechanisms to serve as benchmarks for
the United States' performance in this area. The project is an exploratory step
toward a full-scale cooperative research program that will study the concept of
proprietary process technology design and manufacturing in the United States,
Europe and Japan.
