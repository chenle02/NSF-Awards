This project led by Polk Community College is enhancing an existing Advanced
Manufacturing Engineering Technology program and converting it to an Open
Entry/Open Exit (OEOE) format. In the OEOE format, course objectives are divided
into single credit hour units that can be scheduled to fit time constraints of
students. The program addresses the needs of working students and provides a
learner centric focus. Through outreach activities, student interest in advanced
manufacturing and enrollment in the program is increased.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format is modeled on other successful programs
but tailored to fit the local constraints within the Florida College System. NSF
sponsored ATE Centers are partnered with Polk Community College to assist with
the curriculum development efforts. The project is responsive to local industry
needs and has industry involvement throughout the planning and implementation.
Students can also be placed in industries to obtain practical experience and by
collaborating with four year institutions; the project is enabling students to
transfer to four year schools to continue their studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format and a partnership with the Polk County
Public Schools enable secondary and college instructors to strengthen their
knowledge of Advanced Manufacturing principles by completing selected units of
study. This instructor development ensures a strong sustainable program.
