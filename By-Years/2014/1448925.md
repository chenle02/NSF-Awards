The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a novel child safety seat
technology that reduces the number of child deaths and injuries resulting from
motor vehicle crashes. Impacts beyond saving lives and preventing injuries
include reducing healthcare costs and advancing the field of vehicle occupant
kinematics research. The direct societal benefit of the proposed advanced child
safety seat technology is that, if successful, it will improve the effectiveness
of child safety seats and reduce the likelihood of head injuries.

The proposed project will develop an innovative sensing mechanism mounted in a
child safety seat that determines when to deploy time-of-crash protections
within the child seat itself. Children riding in child safety seats are
presently not protected by advanced time-of-crash technologies such as frontal
airbags and belt pre-tensioners. The implementation of this mechanism will be
extremely challenging given the cost and reliability constraints imposed by the
market. The societal and commercial rewards for success are substantial because
the technology would represent a key performance and market discriminator. It is
expected that the fatality risk for children protected by time-of-crash
technologies triggered by the proposed system will be lowered by about 12%.
