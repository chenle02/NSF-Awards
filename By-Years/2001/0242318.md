Although molecular models have played a crucial role in research and teaching
for over 100 years, today these models primarily are generated by computer
graphics displays that are powerful in some respects but lacking in others. In
order to bring balance to this situation, a computer program (SCULPT) has been
written to create solid models of selected regions of macromolecules by using
atomic coordinates from the Protein Data Bank. These model are constructed in
wax, wood, or other materials to a scale corresponding to commercially available
atomic models. This utilizes a dedicated computer numeric controlled (CNC)
milling machine capable of machining wood (10,000rmp spindle speed) and large
enough to build a model of most typical macromolecular binding or receptor
sites. An educational consultant assists with the preparation of study guides
and classroom materials for teaching high school advanced placement biology and
chemistry students. The P.I. is actively involved in undergraduate and graduate
teaching of biochemistry students. Research applications are derived from his
laboratory and from collaborations with other groups.
