9612017 Micromechanics is the study of how the microstructure of a material
affects its microscopic response. It provides the understanding necessary to
develop simplified models for design and preliminary analysis. Currently the
ability of industry to use micromechanics is limited by the tools available for
materials. To facilitate this understanding, means of comparing micromechanical
theories to experiments is required. The research addresses these issues with a
unique combination of advanced electron microscopy techniques, image processing
technologies, and large scale/massively parallel nonlinear finite element
methods. Analyses of the representative volume element (RVE) are used to compare
micromechanical theories to experiments. The micromechanical modeling of the
microstructures is conducted in collaboration with researchers at Alcoa. This
project has a balance between theory and experiment. The collaboration with
industry will ensure the research issues are realistically addressed.
