This project will develop a global numerical model of the electromagnetic fields
produced by ionospheric electromagnetic currents with the research goal of
enabling better prediction of the impact of space weather on the electric power
grid. The methodology involves finite-difference time domain (FDTD)
computational solutions of the full-vector three-dimensional time-dependent
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic wave propagation within the global
Earth-ionosphere system. In particular, the atmosphere-lithosphere volume
between 400 km above the Earth's surface to 400 km below will be studied in
unprecedented detail at high spatial resolutions. The research will build on
previous and current work in this area by using Active Magnetosphere and
Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) data and by establishing
collaborations with the Electric Power Research Institute SUNBURST monitoring
network project. The model will simulate the effects of ionospheric currents
that develop as the result of coronal mass ejections in order to improve our
understanding of the resultant electrodynamics. The fine spatial resolution of
the newly computed FDTD solutions will provide improved information for
assessing and mitigating potential hazards specific to the operations of inland
and coastal power grids and oil pipelines. One education goal is to develop a
sequence of three computational electromagnetic courses at the University of New
Mexico. A second goal is to initiate and establish a Residential College system
at the University of New Mexico.
