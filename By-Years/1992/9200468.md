This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses questions of the detailed dynamics of gas-surface
interactions. The objectives of the research are to develop an understanding of
the detailed dynamics of dissociative chemisorption of simple diatomic
molecules, and the recombination and desorption of adsorbed atoms from well
characterized solid surfaces. Velocity resolved, polarization sensitive multi-
photon ionization detection of scattered diatomic molecules and desorbed
molecules resulting from atom recombination will be carried out. Novel studies
of chemisorption of monoenergetic, aligned reagents will also be pursued. %%%
Dissociation of molecules on surfaces, as well as recombination and desorption
of molecules from the surface, are the principal elementary processes which
underlie a wide range of important technologies, including catalysis, corrosion,
and electronic device fabrication. This research project develops and applies
state-of-the-art methods to the study of the detailed dynamics of these
elementary processes. The information gained from these studies is essential in
developing our basic understanding of these critical technologies.
