9417523 Composto The purpose of this U.S.-Czech research project between Dr.
Russell Composto of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Petr Vlcek of Czech
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry is to synthesize
novel polymeric materials to study polymer adsorption at the polymer/solid
interface. To do this, the researchers will use anionic-living and group-
transfer polymerization techniques to prepare block copolymers and end-
functionalized polymers which bind to oxide surfaces. These specialty polymers
will be blended with a matrix polymer and spun-cast on an inorganic substrate.
The composition profile, amount absorbed, grafting density of the adsorbed
species, and the strength of adsorption will be measured. Results are expected
to contribute to our basic knowledge of polymer adhesion and may have relevance
to technological problems in the coatings industry. This project in materials
research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
