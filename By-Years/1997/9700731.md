EEC-9700731 Manno ABSTRACT This award provides funding to Tufts University
under the direction of Dr. Vincent P. Manno, for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Tufts-Rensselaer Thermal
Manufacturing Research-Curriculum Development Program." Thermal manufacturing is
the application of thermal-fluid sciences and materials science to the design
and control of manufacturing and materials processes which employ thermal
methods. This project involves a cooperative research-curriculum-engineering
practice program in Thermal Manufacturing involving Tufts University and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute along with industrial collaborators and NASA.
The program will develop and deliver a number of relevant curricular modules
sharing the common focus of Thermal Manufacturing, but spanning various formats
including semester-long course offerings, short courses, hands-on exploration
experiences, interactive multimedia and WWW-based venues. A major part of this
coordinated program is a set of Annual Summer Institutes to be held in 1998,
1999, and 2000. It is a goal of the project that the final institute will
establish the institute series as a long term self-supported technology
development and transfer forum in Thermal Manufacturing.
