The phototactic archaeobacterium H. halobium contains the light-driven proton
and chloride pumps bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin. It has been found that
mutants deficient in both rhodopsins are still phototactic, and that the light
signal receptors are actually two retinal pigments, the sensory rhodopsins
(sR's) I and II. They constitute a primitive color discrimination system based
on pigments chemically similar to the light and color sensing pigments of
animals. The goal of this proposal is to isolate, purify and characterize the
recently identified sR-II receptor, and compare its function and properties with
those of the sensory pigments of higher organisms. The results should yield new
insights on the principles which underlie the design of membrane proteins for
energy and sensory transduction and their evolutionary development.
