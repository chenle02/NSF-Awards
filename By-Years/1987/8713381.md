This Interagency Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the
Department of State supports the NSF/Europe office. Operating funds are provided
by the Department of State and reimbursed by the NSF for salaries and benefits
for the Head of the office and a secretary, their housing, educational
allowances, etc. The NSF/Europe office serves as an important link between the
American scientific community and the European scientific community through the
dissemination of technical information, the development of ad hoc reports, and
interaction with international organizations (NATO, OECD, UNESCO, the European
Science Foundation, etc.). This office provides an excellent opportunity for
U.S. science to keep abreast of changes and advances in European S&T activities
and the status of European science. NSF/Europe facilitates the Foundation's
ability to access and maintain liaison with European centers of excellence and
to target the activities conducted under INT's bilateral programs.
