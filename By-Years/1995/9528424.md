Tohline 95-28424 Dr. Tohline will study stellar formation using the
gravitational hydrodynamics code developed previously. Specifically, he will
address three problems -- to map out the critical states at which protostellar
accretion disks become dynamically unstable to gravitational fragmentation, to
examine the dynamical stability of ellipsoidal or dumbbell-shaped equilibrium
structures with nontrivial internal motions, and to examine the evolution of
warped HI galaxy disks to determine the extent to which the disk settling
process is connected to the global process of star formation. ***
