Failure to maintain exponential increases in supercomputer performance due to
power limitations could endanger U.S. competitiveness. Fundamental improvements
in parallel and distributed system design are needed, but the lack of standard
metrics and methodologies to evaluate energy efficiency for supercomputers
provides little incentive to design energy efficient systems. Developing new
metrics and methodologies is wrought with challenges since previous performance-
centric benchmarks do not accurately reflect differences in energy efficiency.
Additionally, for new benchmarks and methodologies to gain acceptance, results
must be easily verifiable and benchmark purveyors must have credibility and
traction in the domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project, the PIs are proposing to create novel metrics and methodologies to
evaluate energy efficiency for supercomputers.They will designe a distributed
software test-harness that enables automated, repeatable, and verifiable
measurements of both performance and energy efficiency. They will designe new
energy efficiency benchmarks for supercomputers using the software test harness.
The PIs, who started Green500 List of energy efficient supercomputers, are going
to work with vendors and end usersto encourage them to benchmark their systems
using these new methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;
