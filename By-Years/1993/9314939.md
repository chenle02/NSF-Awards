9314939 Patel This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Mitochondrial Alpha-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes,
scheduled for August 1994 at Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. The co-
organizers are Professor Mulchand Patel, Department of Biochemistry, State
University of New York at Buffalo, and Professor Yasuo Kagawa, Department of
Biochemistry, Jichi Medical School. Included among the U.S. participants are
several postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Since the last international
meeting on this subject in 1988, there have been many important developments in
various aspects of the structure-function relationship of component proteins,
the characterization of the genes, and their involvement in several inherited
metabolic diseases. The objective of the seminar is to bring together leading
U.S. and Japanese scientists who have been responsible for much of the recent
development to discuss current investigations of the structure, function,
regulation, and genetic aspects of the alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes.
It is anticipated that this meeting will set the stage for future research and
enhance collaborative research among scientists from the two countries. ***
