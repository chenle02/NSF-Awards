Sources of parallelism present in Prolog, including or-parallelism, independent
and-parallelism, and (determinate) dependent and- parallelism, will be exploited
in the development of a parallel Prolog system. In this project, the stack-
copying technique will be extended to include both kinds of and-parallelism. It
is expected that this will speed up the execution of Prolog programs because of
the parallelism and fewer inferences being executed at run time. Implementation
will take place on a Sequent.
