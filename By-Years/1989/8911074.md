The Mollusk Collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is
one of the largest and most significant collections in the United States and the
world devoted to a single group of organisms. Essentially all groups of mollusks
from around the world are represented in this collection, and thorough
systematic research in malacology almost always requires reference to specimens
in this collection. The collection includes more than 400,000 specimen lots,
comprising 10.3 million specimens, of which 11,700 are type specimens. Three
major curatorial projects are currently underway: computer cataloging and
accessioning of shells obtained as gifts, orphaned collections, and research
collections; sorting, identifying, cataloging and accessioning alcohol-preserved
specimens; and completion of a computerized catalog of type specimens. These
curatorial projects will improve greatly the research impact of the collection.
Visiting scientists will have more complete access to important material, and
malacologists from around the world will gain a clearer picture of the Academy's
holdings. Research in systematics, evolutionary biology, ecology, and
environmental management will be enhanced through these efforts.
