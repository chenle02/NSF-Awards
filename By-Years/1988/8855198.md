This project will train twenty (20) high school students, per year during the
academic years of 1989/90 and 1990/91 in ecologicalresearch methods, data
analysis and writing scientific papers. The students will conduct investigations
in the biology and ecology of the migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus
L.) at a wintering colony in southern California. The thermoregulatory behavior,
population dynamics, sex ratios,female reproductive status, body size, and
physical condition will be measured. The species of plants present, as well as
the height and diameter (dbh) of the trees at the colony will be mapped. The
wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and cloud cover will be recorded
during each visit and weekly summaries for the site will be obtained from the
California Department of Parks and Recreation. The data will be compared with
the information gathered during studies conducted in 1987/88 by students from
the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This program will expose high
school students to the duties of professional ecologists, wildlife managers, and
park rangers; increase the students's knowledge about the educational
requirements for a career in the sciences; and provide a solid background in the
fundamentals of ecology and conservation that will enable them to make informed
decisions about solutions to environmental problems.
