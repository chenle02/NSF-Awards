The term "Mean Field Games" was coined by P.L. Lions (Fields Medalist) and J.M.
Lasry, a few years ago. It is a remarkable idea to transfer a well known
approach of Physics to Social Sciences. The concept of Mean Field in physics
attempts to describe the effect of the media on the motion of a particle, this
media being composed of an infinite number of particles, similar to the
individual one. Conversely in economics, models consider that agents interact
through markets (real and financial) and equilibrium can be obtained through
prices. It has been widely acknowledged that these types of models cannot
realistically address all the phenomena that one can observe in real life, for
instance the issue of systemic risk.

Mean Field Games is a novel approach to understand what is missing in the
models. It has been a spectacular success. Besides economics and finance, it has
been very fruitful in many areas such as: traffic control, network analysis, as
well as in understanding how technology can expand, and how environmental
aspects impact growth. It turns out that the theory can handle also many new
considerations of risk management. Independently of the applications, these
concepts have completely changed control theory, differential games and
introduced new types of partial differential systems. However, Mean Field Games
is limited to agents who are identical, like particles. This is a serious
limitation, since in social sciences, unlike in physics, the reality is more a
situation of coalitions or dominant players. This is the major objective of this
proposal: To study extensions to consider coalitions. One has to solve much more
complex systems of partial differential equations. A second objective is to
develop an Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation approach to Mean Field Control Type
problems, which has never been done before, because of a basic difficulty,
called "Time inconsistency" inherent to Mean Field Control (different from Mean
Field Games). A third objective is to develop ideas relevant to risk analysis,
in which one cannot be satisfied in optimizing an average. Since risk aspects
have become predominant in engineering as well as in economics, this direction
can have very broad implications, in many areas of strategic importance.
