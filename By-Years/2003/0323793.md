This continued research will advance the comparative method in anthropology
through development and application of new methods involving synchronic
(variation across societies) and diachronic (variation across time) change.
Using tree- and matrix-based methods to control for "Galton's Problem" (the
independence of adjacent societies), and Boolean logic for holistic comparison
of cases, the project will develop methods that examine how suites of
characteristics covary using historical and present-day ethnographic
information; evaluate these methods in relation both to other synchronic methods
and to newly developed approaches in comparative historical sociology; and apply
these methods to test hypotheses using comparative data. The project will test a
set of hypotheses (mainly focusing on marriage and bridewealth) about cross-
cultural variability using the ethnographic literature (codings of 120 variables
for 38 societies) from East Africa over the past 100 years. This research will
advance our knowledge of East African societies, will help re-establish
comparative cross-cultural research as a central part of anthropology, and will
help link qualitative and quantitative research traditions.
