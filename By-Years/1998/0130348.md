This award renews support of the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the
University of South Carolina at Columbia. The deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus) and congeneric species are among the most abundant, speciose, and
widely distributed North American mammals. They range from Alaska to Central
America and occur in many natural habitats. They are frequently used as models
to study the fundamental processes underlying speciation, adaptative physiology,
behavior, and community ecology. Laboratory stocks of both wild-type and
genetically variant Peromyscus are used for investigations in which laboratory-
based studies are interfaced with those of natural populations. The Peromyscus
Genetic Stock Center was established in 1985. Today it provides a reliable
source of Peromyscus and related materials to the national scientific and
education communities. The Center currently houses seven species of Peromyscus
and more than 35 distinctive mutant and other genetically defined stocks,
primarily of the deer mouse. The Stock Center supplies researchers and educators
with live animals, and with selected biological materials including fresh or
preserved tissues, molecular probes and libraries of cloned Peromyscus DNA. It
also functions as a clearinghouse for information by sponsoring an Internet
database, maintaining a reference collection of reprints, standardizing the
genetic nomenclature for the genus and publishing a semi-annual Peromyscus
Newsletter. The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center continues to be widely used
throughout the U.S. and elsewhere.
