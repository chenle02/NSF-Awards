9727369 Aziz This research project explores the growth of metal films produced
by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). PLD uses an excimer laser to ablate a target
to produce the depositing flux. The principal objectives are to develop a
fundamental understanding of the kinetics of submonolayer island nucleation and
growth and of the kinetics of solute segregation, trapping, and alloying. Films
are grown by PLD with real time and post deposition structure and composition
analysis. Systems are selected to provide a wide range of monomer diffusivity
and deposition rate for model systems, such as face-centered cubic metals, where
there is knowledge of the values of the basic activation energy parameters.
Growth morphologies are followed in situ with RHEED and ex situ by UHV AFM/STM.
PLD film growth is compared to films grown by molecular beam epitaxy and to
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and analytical theories. %%% It is anticipated
that the enhanced understanding generated by this project will aid in the
production of new, interesting, and potentially useful assemblies of material
films. ***
