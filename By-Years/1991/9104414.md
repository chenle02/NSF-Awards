This grant supports operation of the Princeton cyclotron laboratory and the
nuclear physics research of the faculty and staff. The group will carry out
measurements at the frontiers of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and will
study fundamental symmetries and interactions. Some of the research will be
carried out in collaboration with scientists at other facilities - ATLAS at
Argonne National Laboratory, the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, the
Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, and the Soviet-American Gallium Experiment. An
experiment at Princeton will study the breakdown of time reversal invariance in
the B decay of polarized 19Ne. A 3He- 4He dilution refrigerator, operating at
temperatures below 0.01 K, will cool bolometric detectors to investigate the
possibility of a 17 keV neutrino mass state in the B decay of 63Ni. Research at
the Princeton facility by numerous outside users will be carried out using the
unique features of the cyclotron laboratory.
