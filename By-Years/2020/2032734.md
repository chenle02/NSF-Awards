As states begin to relax limitations on physical distancing in order to restart
economic activity, mass testing for COVID-19 will be crucial in identifying and
containing infection "hot spots" and to avoid more severe outbreaks. This Rapid
Response Research (RAPID) grant will support the collection of time-sensitive
data on serological and viral test outcomes. These data, along with census
block-level demographic information and mobility patterns, will be used to
develop a data-driven strategic framework for mass testing. As testing resources
will be limited at the onset, this framework can help guide a testing strategy
to use these resources most effectively. The project involves a collaboration
with LifeSouth Blood bank and the State of Florida Department of Health to
utilize data from north central Florida and is expected to be scalable to other
counties, regions, and states across the Nation. This research approach is
expected to help mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on public health,
society, and the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will collect
community testing data in order to develop a data-driven adaptive-sampling
strategy to optimize mass testing within census block groups based on (i)
aggregated community population, (ii) daily testing capacity and outcomes, (iii)
block group demographics related to contagion and morbidity vulnerability (e.g.,
race, age structure, employment type, housing crowding), (iv) symptom
prevalence, and (v) mobility patterns of people in the block group. The sampling
algorithms will “learn” from recent test outcomes (both positives and negatives)
to optimize the sampling approach over time, balance exploration and
exploitation to avoid overlooking critical areas while ensuring suspected areas
are frequently sampled. The project involves four tasks: (i) data collection
though collaboration with LifeSouth Blood bank and Florida Department of Health
for COVID-19 antibody testing and state testing data; (ii) geographic analysis
of community medical and social vulnerability data; (iii) development of an
adaptive sampling algorithm to determine the most informative test allocation to
regions in the community; (iv) cost-effective analysis to determine the daily
budget to balance between testing power and costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
