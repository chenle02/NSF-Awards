9319188 Alperin This award supports research on a number of different directions
in group representation theory. The principle investigator will apply results
which are consequences of recent discoveries in topology to representation
theory in work on block equivalences. He will also study the representation
theory of finite groups of Lie type using algebraic varieties and new ideas
associated with the complexity theory of modules from homological representation
theory. Finally, he will continue his study of Hecke algebras and study the
blocks of such algebras with ideas from the representation theory of algebras.
The research supported concerns the representation theory of finite groups. A
group is an algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of this,
groups are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and computer science as well
as mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for determining the
structure of groups.
