Recent developments in technology now enable biologists to study organisms at
the cellular and subcellular levels. This new field of Molecular Biology
promises to answer many previously unanswered questions about, e.g., regulation
physiology and the development of organisms. Use of radioactive isotopes for the
labeling and tracing of molecules has proved invaluable in Molecular Biology --
a technique which requires the new liquid scintillation counter provided through
this award. Actual experience with radioactive labeling and scintillation
counting is helping the students better understand new concepts and developments
in Biology. By incorporating labeling experiments into the study of plants,
animals and bacteria, the universality of cells is being stressed, thus
demonstrating how modern techniques may be applicable to diverse sets of
organisms and disciplines. Through this experience the students are receiving
practical training in the use of modern biological instrumentation, and are
improving their skills in understanding and solving biological problems.
