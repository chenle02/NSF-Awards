This award, "DEDS: A New Paradigm for Performance Analysis, Computation and
Optimization," made under the program for "Combined Research Curriculum
Development in Technological Areas of national Importance," is motivated by the
rapid technological changes which have brought the need to design, analyze, and
control Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS). DEDS are typified by networks for
communications, manufacturing, computer traffic, and other systems governed by
man-made rules. As a paradigm change is ripe to take place in the study of these
systems, perhaps similar to the major conceptual advances that occurred during
the Sputnik era in control system theory, new methods for design, control, and
optimization are needed. The major focus of this award is to bring research
results in DEDS into the classroom. This effort includes the development of new
courses and a simulation-based instructional "electronic" laboratory, and an
innovative approach for the dissemination of the project results that exploits
recent advances in educational technology.
