The proposed research involves use of vibrational spectroscopy at pressure in
order to (1) provide data on heat capacity, entropy, and the thermal Gruneisen
parameter for pressure and temperature regions inaccessible to calorimetry and
(2) characterize structural changes of minerals with pressure. In addition,
complete single-crystal IR spectra will be acquired (1) to replace the
inaccurate and incomplete powder data that is currently available, and (2) to
correctly interpet the high- pressure measurements. Theoretical treatments
proposed are to (1) develop a formulation relating the shear modulus and its
pressure derivatives to vibrational data at pressure, and (2) provide an
empirical formulation for thermal expansivity that can be extrapolated beyond
the range of measurements. Combination of the data with such theoretical work
will advance knowledge of the thermodynamic and elastic properties of minerals.
The ultimate goal is deduction of the composition and thermal character of the
earth's interior through comparision to seismic models.
