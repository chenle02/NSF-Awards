0443483&lt;br/&gt;Griffiths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a symposium
on U.S.-Korea Scientific Collaboration in Changing Times to be held in Seoul,
Korea in October 2004. The symposium will bring together a diverse group from
the United States and Korea to discuss the benefits and barriers of bilateral
science and technology cooperation. Focal points for the discussion will include
recent Korean advances in science and technology, opportunities presented by
information/communications technologies, and challenges of involving the non-
academic sectors. The organizers will broadly disseminate the report of the
symposium with the intent of stimulating more
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
