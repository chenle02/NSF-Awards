Dr. Ellen Currano is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at Southern Methodist University.
Dr. Currano will study the co-evolution of plants and herbivorous insects in the
African tropics during the Cenozoic. The research goals will be accomplished by
examining the extent of damage caused by insects in fossil leaves. The fossil
samples will be collected from two localities in northwestern Ethiopia that
represent the Late Oligocene period (28 to 23 million years ago). The
information from the fossil record will be compared with modern leaves to
understand how the plant-insect interactions were affected by physical processes
like droughts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Currano will contribute to
the education of two different audiences. First, undergraduate students, from
America and Africa, will assist in the collection of samples in Ethiopia.
Second, a lesson plan on paleo-botany for 8th grade will be developed and
distributed to school teachers in Texas.&lt;br/&gt;
