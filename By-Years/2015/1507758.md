CBET - 1507758&lt;br/&gt;PI: Clark, Robert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and
engineers have available several methods to manipulate particles and their
environments at the micron scale. Two such methods, optical trapping and
magnetic trapping, offer the advantage that particles can be manipulated using
external fields without direct access to the system. These two techniques can be
combined to improve particle manipulation, but few particles have the required
properties to respond to both optical and magnetic trapping. This project will
develop oriented magnetic micro-particles with appropriate arrangements of
material properties to give the particles superior properties for combined
optical and magnetic manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents an
advanced manufacturing technique for producing a novel type of super-
paramagnetic microparticle capable of simultaneous optical and magnetic trapping
and manipulation. These particles are produced via the directed self-assembly of
magnetic nano-particles within an optically nonlinear fluid media. The optically
nonlinear media is then exposed to a shaped ultrafast laser source causing the
formation of particles due to multiphoton absorption phase change. The magnetic
properties of the new particles will far exceed those of current state of the
art particles and will be influential and potentially transformative in
biotechnology applications involving molecular spectroscopy and advanced
manufacturing of smart structures such as adaptive liquid crystal-based imaging
systems.
