Understanding the deep structure of continental margins is critical in
determining the processes by which new ocean basins are formed during
continental rifting, in evaluating the response of the continental crust to
thermal events which accompany rifting, and in comparing volcanic and
sedimentary events which precede and post date rifting events. The East Coast of
the U.S. has had a complex geologic history which includes at least two stages
of rifting and a major period of continental suturing. Much of this history is
preserved in the deep, sedimentary strata along the continental margin. The
objective of the present project is to use seismic reflection profiling and
refraction data to acoustically image these deep sedimentary layers. These data
can then be interpreted to understand the geologic history of the East Coast as
well as the processes which accompany stretching and uplift of continental crust
during rifting of continental masses. Data will be acquired through lease of a
commercially available seismic ship and deployment of ocean bottom seismometers
off the southeast coast of the US.
