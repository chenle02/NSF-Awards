9531069 Cooper This project proposes to investigate the solution of ion
containing polymers. The following issues will be addressed: 1) Static
Properties of Ionomer Solutions. Viscometric, light scattering, SAXS, and SANS
experiments on model telechelic ionomers will be used to study interchain
association and to determine the structure and thermodynamics of low polarity
associating ionomer solutions over a broad concentration regime. 2) Dynamic
Properties of Ionomer Solutions. The effect of deformation on the structure and
chain stretching of model telechelic and polyurethane ionomers will be
determined. Particular attention will be paid to determining the molecular
factors governing shear thickening and shear thinning phenomena in associating
ionomer solutions. %%% The overall research findings resulting from this
investigation should be useful in defining more predictable processing
conditions for this important class of polymer. These materials find
applications as membranes, adhesives, coatings, viscosity modifiers, and
packaging mateials; all of which are sensitive to the material processing
history. ***
