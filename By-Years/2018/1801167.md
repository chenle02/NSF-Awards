The Congo River Basin is the second largest in the world and the hydrological
balance of the River is poorly defined. Runoff from rainfall is significantly
smaller than is expected and evapotranspiration is the dominant water cycle
flux. Thus, it is anticipated that upstream deforestation (for hydropower
production) will have significant impact on downstream discharges. Furthermore,
migration of the rainbelts will change as the northern hemisphere warms more
than the southern. This conference will bring 18 Congolese scientists to
Washington DC to interact with their North American and European counterparts.
The conference topics of discussion will range from the impact of climate
variability and human changes on the Congo River Basin system to sharing of data
within and outside the Congo River Basin to elucidate water balance unknowns.

Conference attendees will assess the current state of knowledge on the Congo
Basin water balance using historic and ongoing observations, and identify where
key information is lacking. They conference will focus the unknown magnitudes of
hydrologic processes including rainfall, evapotranspiration, climate
variability, human changes in the Basin, and power generation. The project will
enable best design of hydrologic measures for the region which will benefit both
the Congo Basin Region as well as better define the impact of variable climate
and water sustainability in the region. This information exchange will be used
to design plans for collecting new information and for distributing historic and
ongoing data. The key design for hydrologic data collection is toward specific
hydrologic targets that are designed to enhance discovery and definition of the
inner workings of the Congo Basin hydrologic cycle.
