This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project is designed to
enhance performance of small wind turbines, i.e., increased efficiency and kWh
production, through advanced aerofoil design (as achieved with the proposed
acceleration plate), will reduce the overall cost of operation (capital cost
minus energy cost savings) and decrease the achievable payback resulting in a
more overall cost effective system. The company and their university partner
combine business and university expertise needed to evaluate and enhance the
wind turbine design through modeling, simulation and experimental verification.
These activities include computational fluid dynamics, prototype construction
and testing in a wind tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;This wind harvester incorporates a novel
acceleration plate to direct air flow over the turbine rotors to increase the
air speed and enhance the performance of the wind turbine. This design is most
appropriate for small vertical axis turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development
of a small cost effective wind turbine as a result of this research program will
eventually have broad impact on society in the form of an inexpensive, clean
source of renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
