This Presidential Young Investigator Award includes research in structural
engineering and reliability. Research includes computer- based reliability
analysis with special emphasis on systems with nonlinear dynamic response and
hierarchical damage states, development of a hybrid reliability approach applied
to seismic response and fatigue crack growth. The traditional approach to such
problems is not applicable since explicit relationships between loading and
response parameters are not available. For complicated load and response models
such as nonstationary ground acceleration and seismic damage, an explicit
relationship does not exist. Complete simulation to establish the reliability in
such cases is impractical due to the number of random variables involved.
Through such studies, an attempt will be made to integrate simulation and
advanced reliability methods to solve multidimensional, nonstationary,
nonlinear, time-dependent reliability problems. Methods developed will have an
impact on many areas in structural engineering including the design of buildings
for wind and seismic effects, design and development of offshore structures,
aeronautical and space structure design and nuclear plant design.
