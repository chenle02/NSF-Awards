Large-scale optimization problems arise in a great variety of important
scientific, engineering, and economic applications, and exhibit structures that
allow solution via algorithms that possess a high degree of parallelism.
Research will be continued in the development of decomposition algorithms
appropriate for the distributed solution of such problems and in the
implementation and testing of these methods on a variety of parallel
architectures including the multicomputers and multiprocessors available at the
Computer Sciences Department and those available elsewhere via ARPANET. Such
algorithms have the large granularity and low data transfer properties that are
ideally suited to parallel architectures. Particular emphasis will be given to
network optimization problems, since a large proportion of the most difficult
real-world applications of mathematical programming fall into this category, and
since such problems also cover a broad spectrum of mathematical classes (from
linear to nonlinear, from convex to nonconvex, from deterministic to stochatic).
The development of parallel algorithms for these problems will also require the
development of scheduling and load-balancing techniques that will be useful in
the study of distributed techniques for other areas of large- scale scientific
computation. The decomposition of problems to run simultaneously on multiple
parallel processors is essential if these new architectures are to be
effectively used.
