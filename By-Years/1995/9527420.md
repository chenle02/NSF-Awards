ABSTRACT CTS-9527420 E. Dendy Sloan Colorado School of Mines A new state-of-the-
art for hydrate experiments is proposed by demonstrating measurements of the
hydrate phase structure and composition, using Raman spectroscopy. The work will
have two major impacts: 1. The hydrate structure is virtually never measured but
predicted. There are multiple instances in which the incorrect hydrate structure
has been predicted. With at least three common hydrate structures, the incorrect
structure (and associated formation conditions) is predicted more frequently
than commonly realized. We intend the proposed work to demonstrate how this
problem may be corrected. 2. The hydrate phase composition (both the guest-to-
host ratio and guest-to-guest composition) is also predicted rather than
measured. However, such measurements are necessary to correct the existing
thermodynamic model since hydrate formation conditions depend not only on
structure but also on the phase composition.
