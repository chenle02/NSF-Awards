A soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectin with subunit molecular weight of about
14,000 has been isolated from many vertebrate tissues. The lectin shows striking
developmental regulation in certain tissues and has been detected on the surface
of cells and in the extracellular matrix surounding them, suggesting possible
roles in regulation of cellular development and in morphogenesis. Recent studies
with the human form of this lectin indicate that there are several variants
which are the products of distinct genes. These findings raise the possibility
that these, like other lectins, may have a second functional domain distinct
from their carbohydrate binding sites. They also raise the possibility that
these structural variations mediate specificity in glycoconjugate binding. The
purpose of this project is to further characterize this gene family in humans,
with the ultimate aim of understanding its regulation and functions. To this
end, a series of full length human cDNAs will be isolated and sequenced. The
human genomic DNAs encoding members of this gene family will also be isolated
and sequenced.
