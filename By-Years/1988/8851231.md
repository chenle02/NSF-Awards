The modern undergraduate course in process control must cover not only theory,
but also state-of-the-art control instrumentation. Great improvements have been
made in recent years in microprocessor-based controllers which can be
configured, tuned, and operated from a personal computer. In addition to
conventional PID algorithms, the new instruments have many built-in features
such as transport lag, logic functions, alarm blocks, linearization blocks,
adaptive gain, and self-tuning. In order to upgrade the control laboratories
three sets of equipment are required. Each set includes four Taylor MOD-30
instruments (two controllers, one math unit, one recorder), an IBM personal
computer with Taylor software, and a communication link for operating the
instruments from the computer. With this equipment, a wide variety of
experiments will be developed which range from basic single-loop control systems
to complex systems involving all of the instruments. Advanced experiments to be
developed for which these modern instruments are ideally suited include cascade
control, feedforward control, adaptive control, self-tuning, and over-ride
control.
