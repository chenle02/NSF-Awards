This study will examine the stratigraphy of Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary
sediments deposited in the proto- Caribbean region to determine their
provenance, the way in which they were transported, and how local conditions may
have influenced their deposition. In particular, we will determine the size
distribution of impact melt spherules, both as a function of stratigraphic
height and with distance from their source; determine the compositions of impact
melt spherule glasses, whether they vary with stratigraphic height or with
distance from their source, and infer their provenance based on their
compositions; determine the distribution of shocked mineral phases (such as
quartz, feldspar, and spinel) with stratigraphic height and infer their
provenance; use this information to determine criteria which can be used to
assess whether a deposit of boundary sediments is undisturbed or has been
reworked; and determine the overall thicknesses of undisturbed boundary
sediments. These observations of boundary sediments will be coupled with
theoretical calculations of ejecta transport. The combined studies should
identify the approximate location of the source crater and the lithologies of
the target material, both of which should determine whether the Chicxulub
structure, which we have proposed to be the location of a terminal Cretaceous
impact, is a viable candidate. The study should also have wide application to
the deposition of ejecta from large (&gt;100 km) craters, a subject which is
poorly understood at the present time.
