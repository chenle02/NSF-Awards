This project will develop a chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) system
using isotope dilution for the in situ determination of peroxides in the
atmosphere with a 10 Hz time resolution. The instrument will be certified for
use on research aircraft including the NSF Gulfstream-V (GV). It will provide a
new tool to address a number of unresolved scientific questions surrounding the
atmospheric chemistry of peroxides. The fast response of this instrument will
also allow flux studies of peroxides in the troposphere, significantly improving
our understanding of hydroperoxide deposition and odd-hydrogen loss in the
continental and marine boundary layers. Using the GV platform, the instrument
will aid in quantifying hydrogen peroxide and methylhydroperoxide distributions
in the upper troposphere, lower stratosphere and tropical tropopause layer and
assess their transport and chemistry associated with deep convection. Finally,
the fast instrument will have a response time sufficient to enable detailed
studies of cloud processes affecting the peroxides. With cloud penetrations
lasting only a few seconds, current instruments are too slow to resolve clouds,
let alone resolve sub-cloud processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to
producing a new in situ measurement capability that significantly enhances the
chemistry package for future airborne scientific missions, the project will
involve undergraduate students and a post-doctoral scholar in the instrument
development, improving their research skill sets in instrument development for
atmospheric measurements. The post-doctoral scholar will also gain valuable
experience by teaching an undergraduate chemistry class while being mentored by
faculty at the U.S. Naval Academy.
