A Varian EM-360L Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer equipped with a
variable temperature probe and lock/spin decoupler is enabling the College to
achieve a major curricular goal in its chemistry program. The opportunity for
students to gain hands-on experience with instrumentation that plays a
fundamental role in the modern chemistry laboratory is being achieved. The NMR
is being incorporated into laboratory work in the College's organic, physical,
and inorganic chemistry courses. Laboratories are being enhanced with more
rigorous and instructionally richer experiments. Student research quality is
being markedly improved with the improved quality of the data and the unique
information the instrument provides. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
