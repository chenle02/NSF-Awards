This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Antal Jevicki of Brown University and Professor Tamiaki Yoneya of the University
of Tokyo. This project is an effort to solve the central questions in string
theory and quantum gravity. The goals are to develop an understanding and
complete formulation of the non-perturbative dynamics through the investigation
of exactly solvable low-dimensional models, and to ultimately apply these
results to higher-dimensional theories and the physics of black holes, early
cosmology, and ultra-high energy physics where present theories are known to
break down. Specifically the research will involve matrix models, conformal
field theory, non-perturbative string dynamics, symmetry breaking, w-symmetry,
topological phases, and high-energy behavior. The principal investigators have
already uncovered some of the key aspects of the rich dynamics of these theories
and have collaborated in developing an action principle. This research project
will enable them to vigorously expand these lines of research and extend the
collaboration to include the related efforts of other colleagues.
