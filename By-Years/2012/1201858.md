The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place just before
the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming
Languages (POPL 2012). This grant will support 15 or more students to attend the
PLMW event plus the POPL conference. While there is other funding available,
this grant is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from
underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent
residents. The broader impacts of the grant relate to the need to broaden
participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from top
members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.
