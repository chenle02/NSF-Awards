9213787 Orville This proposal's objective is to initiate a lightning research
program at Texas A&amp;M University. The PIs will investigate the meteorological
and physical characteristics of cloud-to-ground lightning and intracloud
lightning in convective systems. This includes squall lines, mesoscale
convective systems, and cold and warm fronts. Using the lightning and Doppler
radar data, they will focus on the location of negative and positive cloud-to-
ground flashes, their peak currents, and their multiplicity, with respect to a
convective systems' (1) maximum reflectivity area (dBZ) as a function of height
and time, (2) updraft and downdraft cores, (3) mesocyclone strength as
determined from the vorticity associated with the horizontal shear, and (4)
radial divergence of the wind as a function of height and time. ***
