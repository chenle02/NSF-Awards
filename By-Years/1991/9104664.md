This meeting on Molecular Biology of Signal Transduction in Plants will be an
open international meeting devoted to fundamental research on different aspects
of this field, with emphasis on molecular and genetic approaches. The
development of a higher plant is regulated by a multitude of signals from within
and without, that evoke both generalized and specific biological responses.
Therefore an understanding of signal transduction in plants is vital to
understanding plant development. The need for a meeting on this subject is
evidenced by the rapid advances in this field during the last few years, in
areas that range from environmental receptors to transcription factors. This
meeting will allow presentation of recent results and methodologies in these
different aspects of the field within a common framework, in an atmosphere of
face to face contact. The areas to be covered by the meeting are 1)
Environmental Receptors, 2) Hormone Receptors 3) Cell-Cell Recognition 4)
G-proteins and Protein Kinases 4) Transcription Factors, 5) Mutants in
Signalling Pathways 6) Transgenic Approaches. This international conference will
promote further research and the synthesis of ideas in the rapidly moving field
of cellular signal transduction in plants.
