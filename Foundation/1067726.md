This project involves the interaction between set theory and C*-algebras. The
primary goal is to settle old outstanding open problems using set theoretic
tools, which could involve proving independence results. Specific problems that
could be addressed include the following: Naimark's problem about the existence
of nontrivial C*-algebras with only one irreducible representation; Anderson's
conjecture about pure states restricting to pure states on diagonal masas; the
Kadison-Singer problem that has many equivalent formulations and is significant
to several areas of mathematics; the Stone-Weierstrass problem about the
existence of proper subalgebras that separate pure states; the problem of Brown,
Douglas, and Fillmore about the existence of an automorphism of the Calkin
algebra taking the image of the unilateral shift to its adjoint; and Arveson's
problem about the existence of sufficiently many boundary representations for
nonseparable operator systems.

C*-algebras, a class of mathematical structures that were originally studied
primarily for applications in physics, have over time found substantial
applications in a broad variety of areas of both mathematics and physics. Much
current work in this field focuses on developing further connections to these
other areas, but fundamental questions of basic theory remain open. In the past
decade a series of long-standing open problems in C*-algebras have been settled
using, in an essential way, techniques from the seemingly unrelated area of set
theory. This was a surprising connection that has enriched both fields. Further
work in this direction is expected to lead to a better understanding of
C*-algebras at a fundamental level.
