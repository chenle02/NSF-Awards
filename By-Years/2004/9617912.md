Cross-National Variations in Decision Behavior This proposal deals with cultural
differences in several aspects of decision making. It expands on the cross-
cultural project which the PI already has underway. The goals of this proposal
are to explore three aspects of decision making: (a) who makes different types
of decisions, (b) what it means to be a good decision maker, and (c) how good
decisions are justified.
