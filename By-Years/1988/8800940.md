This grant will provide travel assistance for participants at Symposium Number
135 of the International Astronomical Union. Special attention will be given to
aiding young scientists. The topic of the symposium is interstellar dust.
Interstellar dust is of major importance in astrophysics because of its central
role in processes such as star formation and the physics and chemistry of the
interstellar medium. Research on the properties of interstellar dust is an area
which has been developing with astonishing rapidity, but the last IAU Symposium
dedicated to the subject was over eighteen years ago. It is timely to convene
Symposium Number 135 to foster an effective exchange of ideas among observers,
theoreticians, and laboratory experimentalists in this important subject.
