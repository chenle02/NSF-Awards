Abstract

Award: DMS-0505632 Principal Investigator: Bo Guan

The primary goal of this project is to understand some nonlinear elliptic and
parabolic equations which arise from problems in differential geometry. The
research will be focused on three types of geometric problems: Plateau-type
problems for hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and in more general manifolds; the
Minkowski-type problems of finding closed convex hypersurfaces of prescribed
Weingarten curvature, and problems in isometric embedding. Each of these
problems involves solving some fully nonlinear partial differential equations.
Because of their origins in geometry, these equations are closely related and
therefore share many common technical issues. Thus, progress in one of the
problems will very likely lead to progress in the others, and more generally in
the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations (on manifolds) and
geometric analysis.

Fully nonlinear equations also arise in other problems in geometry and physics
as well as in science and engineering. Results from our research may have impact
and applications in areas such as string theory in physics, and optimal control
theory.
