This project will examine various factors affecting the deposition of snow on
roofs, with emphasis on the thermal and sliding effects of snow loads on
structures. The influence of the intrinsic properties of the structures on snow
distribution, density, and depth will be studied as well. The work will be
divided into two tasks: investigation of the effects of building heat loss on
roof snow cover; and continuation of snow sliding field studies carried out
during two subsequent winters (l983-84). Some laboratory simulation will also be
conducted. The primary purpose of the project is to increase the data base
developed by the PI on the above mentioned factors, and to extend the existing
basic knowledge for predicting snow loads on structures to be used in the design
of future structures.
