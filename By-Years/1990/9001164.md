This research will examine the understudied area of rural to rural migration in
a developing society. It will address the problem of peasant migration into
protected forests by investigating two related questions. First, since the
development and transformation of peasant classes is one of the most central
social dynamics in Thai peasant life, what is the relationship between this
development of peasant classes and the movement of farmers out of the fertile
core agricultural areas into marginal areas, particularly national forests,
where the land is not as productive? Secondly, how has Thai state policy shaped
this process of class formation and migration, specifically those state policies
concerned with land tenure? By understanding the social and economic sources of
migration at both a micro- and macro-level this research could then be applied,
in Thailand and elsewhere, to help develop state and local policies that would
take into account the often conflicting needs of the individual farmer and the
needs of the country as a whole.
