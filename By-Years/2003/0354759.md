After-school programs are a source of powerful, positive experiences for an
estimated eight to ten million youth, especially those in low-income, under-
represented populations (the majority of youth in these programs). Through this
conference grant, TERC, along with the Exploratorium and the Lawrence Hall of
Science, proposes to launch a national initiative to create, support and sustain
engaging, research-based science and mathematics activities in the after-school
community. This planning conference will bring together the leaders and experts
who run exemplary after-school programs, create quality science and mathematics
materials, and provide effective staff training to identify the challenges,
goals and questions of greatest interest and value to the national community.
Intellectual merit and broader impact are evidenced by the gathering of key
players, promotion of dialog and the facilitation of connections between
developer and after-school communities.
