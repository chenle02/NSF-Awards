The research objective of this grant is to create fundamental solutions for
defects in solids under dynamic loading that concern dynamically expanding
inclusions, which are regions within the material that possess general
transformation strain (such as due to thermal expansion that is constrained by
the matrix), and also solutions concerning expanding inhomogeneities (regions
where the material properties change as the region of transformation strain
expands). The solutions will allow the calculation of the "driving force," i.e.
the mechanical rate of work needed to be supplied to create dynamically an
incremental region of inclusion / inhomogeneity with transformation strain, and,
consequently, the evolution of these regions under dynamic loading. The static
counter-part of the phenomenon is the "Eshelby inclusion" and inhomogeneity,
which constitutes the most cited paper in Solid Mechanics in the last fifty
years. The theoretical predictions will be used in the analytical modeling of
experimental results regarding the microstructural evolution of phase
transformations in shape memory alloys due to stress wave
loading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applications and impact of these dynamic
solutions are wide in the characterization of materials in terms of the dynamic
evolution of their microstructure, such as the one of shape memory alloys widely
used in biomedical devices, as well as in the geophysical modeling of earthquake
sources. The research effort will have an impact on the graduate education
program in the dynamical properties and microstructural evolution of materials
at UCSD (University of California - San Diego) and nationwide.
