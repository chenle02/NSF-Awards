This is a project in which experimental studies will be performed of double
diffusive natural convection in layered salt systems contained in an enclosure.
Both the salt transfer and the heat transfer through the interface which
separates the layers will be determined. The temperature will be measured by
encapsulated liquid crystals. Possible applications are to binary crystal growth
such as gallium arsenide and to freeze crystallization used in the making of
polyesters.
