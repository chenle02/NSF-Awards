Many knowledge intensive products require the manufacturing of particulate
materials, such as ferroelectrics, ceramics, powdered metals, cements, and
pharmaceuticals. These materials often have their largest environmental impact
during the particulate stage when they are the most soluble. Particulate
production commonly involves the consolidation of individual particles.
Moreover, these materials often play a pivotal role in new technologies that
enable society to achieve greater energy and economic efficiency. Many
scientists recognize the unique contributions of these materials but lack the
information and analytical tools to consider the economic, social, and
environmental impacts of their process and product design decisions. The
objective of this MUSES project is to develop a research agenda to meet this
need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this goal, an interdisciplinary team at
Penn State, representing materials, economics, business and the environmental
fields; will work with several participating material science centers to
organize a one-day symposium for students and young researchers in the field and
a two-day international workshop on the industrial ecology of particulate
materials. The workshop will address the following key questions:&lt;br/&gt;What
spatial and temporal detail is possible for particulate material
balances?&lt;br/&gt;What are the determinants of particulate material
flows?&lt;br/&gt;What modeling approaches are best suited to represent these
determinants?&lt;br/&gt;How could these models guide process and product design
decisions? And&lt;br/&gt;What material technologies could improve environmental
quality?&lt;br/&gt;In addressing these questions, our inquiry will lay the
foundation for a conceptual framework to identify and develop a research agenda
in this emerging field. &lt;br/&gt;
