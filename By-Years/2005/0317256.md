The proposal develops new computational tools and techniques for the study of
multi-dimensional mode conversion and nonlinear wave physics in plasmas. It
proposes important generalizations to ray tracing that allows traversing the
mode conversion point for systems of dimension greater than one. In addition the
work focuses on the generation of large `wave' events, which has application in
many technical areas, such as ocean waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
