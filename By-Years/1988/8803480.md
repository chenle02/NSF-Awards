This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Vernon Parker, Utah State University. The work consists of a
systematic study of the reactions and reactivity of organic anion radicals,
dianions, cation radicals, and dications. Such reactive organic species are
important intermediates in a wide variety of organic reactions and an
understanding of their behavior has important practical signficance,
particularly for electrode processes and polymerization reactions. Using
quantitative electrochemical methods, a number of reaction types will be studied
including (i) reactions of cationic intermediates with nucleophiles, both
neutral and anionic, (ii) proton transfer reactions of cation radicals and
dications derived from methylarenes, and (iii) protonation reactions of anion
radicals and dianions. Specific issues which will be addressed are (i) the
intrinsic reactivity of ion radicals as compared to the corresponding doubly
charged ions and (ii) the factors contributing to the rates of proton transfer
to and from carbon of super acidic (basic) ion radicals and doubly charged ions.
These will provide fundamental new knowledge of importance to reactive
intermediate chemistry.
