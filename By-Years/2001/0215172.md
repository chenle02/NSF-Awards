This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was motivated by
the need for rapid in-line inspection of quality of nanometer-scale devices in a
production environment. An efficient diagnostics instrument, like the proposed
product, is a rudimentary requirement for improved business operation in related
industries minimizing possibilities for loss of revenue. The proposed innovative
approach aims at developing an integrated technology using both electron and ion
beams. Unique to this work is the idea of incorporating very special merits of
high-brightness negative ion beams in a critical technology for device
inspection. A novel system will be built to (i) deliver high yield in device
inspection, (ii) achieve nm-level resolution and (iii) insure device integrity.
This research will identify the characteristics of appropriate ion species from
proof-of-principles experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of this work
would be the design and development of an optimized ion beam column for the
microelectronics industry. The end product would be an integrated product with
improved optical characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
