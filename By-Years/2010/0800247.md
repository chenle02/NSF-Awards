The main theme of this proposal is to investigate the area lying at the
crossroads of the representation theory of Lie groups, quantum groups, cluster
algebras, and noncommutative algebraic geometry. A new approach to the study of
Lusztig's canonical bases and Kashiwara's crystal bases is proposed, based on
quantum cluster algebras and geometric crystals as developed in recent papers of
the proposer. New information resulting from this study will be applied to
computing the multiplicities for the symmetric powers of representations of
reductive groups, and constructing new totally positive varieties. The results
of this study will be applied for solving problems emerging in the
representations of discrete subgroups of reductive algebraic groups and
Cherednik algebras as well as for explication and elaboration of related
combinatorial and geometric structures including the ``geometric lifting'' of
crystal bases as a new tool in understanding the local Langlands correspondence.

Representation theory is one of the most dynamically developing fields of
modern Mathematics. It has a large impact in other fields of Mathematics and
numerous applications in other Natural Sciences. The concepts of canonical and
crystal bases are of great importance for the representation theory: a mere
establishing of existence of such bases has helped in solving classical
enumeration problems like computing multiplicities of irreducible
representations or decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations. A
new class of canonical bases discovered by the proposer is expected to settle an
old problem of decomposing symmetric powers of representations. Therefore, any
information on canonical or crystal bases would be very beneficial for the
representation theory. It has been revealed in the works of G. Lusztig and the
subsequent works of the proposer that there are algebro-geometric counterparts
for the purely discrete canonical and crystal bases: totally positive varieties,
geometric crystals, and cluster algebras. Understanding the relationship between
these structures underlying the canonical bases is one of main priorities of
this proposal. This relationship has proved to be a useful tool in the study of
Langlands correspondence -- the most mysterious and inspiring correspondence
between Algebra and Geometry of the 20th century Mathematics.
