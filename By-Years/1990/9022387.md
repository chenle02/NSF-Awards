The goal of the proposed effort is to eventually fabricate a high resolution and
high brightness thin film cathodoluminescent phosphor screen for high
performance display applications. In order to achieve this, the Phase I
experimental results indicate that it is possible to fabricated rare-earth-doped
CaS thin film phosphor screen directly on high resolution fiber optic faceplates
exhibiting a screen resolution of 114 1p/mm. In addition, it has been shown the
quantum efficiency of aluminized thin film CaS screens is comparable to that of
well developed ZnS-type powder phosphor screens. In the proposed Phase II
effort, additional optimization of various thin film preparation parameters will
be carried to further improve screen performance and to establish processes for
eventual Phase III manufacturing. The Phase II effort will also consist of
fabricating high performance image intensifiers using the new thin film
technology. Image tube fabrication and evaluation will be performed by Varian
Associates Electron Optical Sensors Division. It is expected that the prototype
image tube will exhibit superior overall performance to similar tubes containing
optimized powder phosphor screens.
