Many policy analysts recommend higher energy taxes as a way of dealing with
environmental problems such as global warming. An important potential objection
to the use of higher energy taxes is the claim that they are regressive. Another
major concern is the effect of these taxes on economic efficiency. Both the
progressivity issue and the efficiency issue require estimates of demand curves
or at least elasticities to quantify the effects. Thus they require
specification of a demand function. The contribution from this project comes
from developing new nonparametric estimation approaches to estimation of demand
curves and the related efficiency measures. The progressivity estimates and
efficiency estimates obtained using these new procedures will be robust to
demand curve specification. The project will estimate models of gasoline demand
using household data collected by the Department of Energy for the years 1979
through 1988 where over 18,000 observations are available. It will estimate the
progressivity effects and efficiency effects of gasoline taxes by income and
expenditure class and by geographical region to. The project will also use data
from the Department of Energy to estimate the demand for consumer durables.
Durables such as air conditioners and refrigerators have both important
environmental effects and energy using effects. The methodological research on
nonparametric estimation of demand functionals has four parts: the comparison of
parametric and nonparametric approaches for demand curve estimation, derivation
of exact welfare measures in the nonparametric case, derivation of
asymptotically normal sampling distributions for welfare measures in the
nonparametric case as well as the parametric case, and analysis of the
sensitivity of the welfare measures to components of nonparametric regression
estimators such as kernel choice and window width.
