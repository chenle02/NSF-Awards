0233175 Glenburg This award supports the PI and graduate students from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Mike Rinck of the
Institute for General Psychology at the Technical University of Dresden,
Germany. The combined efforts of the German and US groups will test the
hypothesis that understanding of language is action based and extends the
hypothesis to the domain of numerical cognition. According to the theory, words
and phrases are indexed to perceptual symbols or actual objects in the
environment. Ultimately, understanding language is understanding the actions
described to the implications for action in the situation described. Recent work
has supported the hypothesis for English, and the present work will test it for
German. This work has considerable implication for both basic and applied
research.

The project also has an educational objective. The project will allow the
graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another
country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them
while also learning important new technical skills.
