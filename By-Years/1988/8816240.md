This project will support a conference on Orthogonal Polynomials and Their
Applications to be held May 22 - June 3, 1989 at Ohio State University. Both
recent progress and new directions in both pure and applied aspects of
orthogonal polynomials and related areas will be discussed during this
conference; a high priority will be given to educating new researchers and
graduate students on these topics. There will be an international group of
eleven principal speakers (including Daniel Bessis, Walter Gautschi, Yves Genin,
Roger Haydock, Tom Koornwinder, Doron Lubinsky, Ian Macdonald, E.A. Rachmanov,
Edward Saff, Herbert Stahl, and Gerard Viennot) and approximately eighty
participants. There will be support available for participants, particularly
graduate students.
