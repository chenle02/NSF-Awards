This project will track recent public policy responses to biotechnology in
Britain, West Germany and the United States. In all three countries,
biotechnology has now progressed from the research laboratory into the
marketplace, creating a demand for new policies and giving rise to new
controversies and political alliances. The project will compare three areas of
parallel policy development in the chosen countries: controls on field-testing
of genetically engineered microorganisms, regulation of fetal and embryo
research, and patenting of genetically engineered life forms. Through a
combination of literature reviews, analysis of legal and policy initiatives, and
interviews, the project will identify the major actors, instruments and outcomes
that comprise the "new" politics of biotechnology and will analyze the values
underlying different national policy choices. The project will generate new
empirical information about a significant area of science and technology policy.
The comparative research will facilitate the testing of important hypotheses
about science, technology and political choice, such as claims about
technological determinism and the social construction of technology. By
including a comparative approach and attention to hypotheses of interest in
several different science, technology and society research fields, the research
will also provide a methodological alternative to the study of single cases and
controversies which currently predominates. Results are expected to include a
book, a number of articles for a variety of audiences, and presentations at
scholarly and other meetings, and will enrich courses and programs at the
investigator's university. Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports
research projects and related activities that promise to improve our
understanding of the intellectual and value contexts that influence the
development and use of science and technology. This project focuses on an
important, continuing episode of interactions among science, technology and
society. The research plan is solid, and provides an important comparative
perspective. The principal investigator is a productive scholar who is uniquely
qualified to undertake the research. Results promise to be very useful to a wide
range of audiences. Therefore, the project is recommended for support.
