This grant supports a workshop on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) and
Remanufacturing in the Transport Industries, to be held in Ypsilanti, Michigan,
October 4-6, 2001. Ford Motor Company and the Integrated Manufacturing
Technology Initiative (IMTI) are also supporting the workshop. The objective of
the workshop is to invite participants from industry and academia to discuss
future directions and opportunities for research collaboration in EBM that will
serve as a roadmap for the development of future research projects. While
research in the fields of Design for the Environment (DfE) and Life Cycle
Analysis (LCA) have focused on the product, there is a need to focus on
processes and their impact both on the manufacturing aspects and on the product
life cycle.

This workshop will explore the EBM issues to establish the fundamental research
needs to address current and future manufacturing enterprise.
