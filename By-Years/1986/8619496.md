There has been a significane growth in recent years toward the development of a
fundamental understanding of the physical processes which control transport
through polymeric membranes, composites and packaging materials. Advances in
these areas are critical to a number of separation processes, in conventional
inorganic processing, in biotechnology and in medicine, among others.
Correspondingly, the success or the failure of membrane processes is quite
predictably related to the material from which the membrane is made and the
manner in which the membrane structures are made. This funding is provided as a
partial support for an international conference to discuss the recent advances
in these areas and to project the long-range research needs. Among other things,
the following issues will be addressed: o Fundamentals of transport phenomena in
membrane materials, o Molecular criteria for the preparation of improved
membranes and barrier structures, o New membrane separation processes and
barrier film applications, and o Membranes in Biotechnology and Biomedicine
Funding at the level of $15,000 ($6,000 from Separation and Purification
Processes, $6,000 from Biotechnology, $3,000 from the Division of International
Programs) is recommended.
