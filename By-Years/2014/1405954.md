Compilers are software tools that bridge the gap between the functions supported
by hardware processor and high level programming languages. Cetus is a compiler
infrastructure at Purdue University, is publicly available (downloaded over 1000
times for use in compiler research), and has become an important part of the
global compiler research infrastructure. The Cetus compiler infrastructures
supports the goals of the NSF CRI program by providing an easy to extend code
base that allows the broader compiler research community to avoid having to
repeatedly re-implement foundational compiler techniques and thereby
accelerating the discovery of knowledge in the area of compilers and programming
tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work funded by this proposal has several goals.
First, the group will continue to maintain this essential infrastructure for the
community and to add enhancements that satisfy user requirements. Second, the
group will continue to keep Cetus' internal representations at a high level of
abstraction allowing it to be used as a building block for instructional
purposes. Third, while Cetus is the most advanced program parallelizer, its
capabilities will be further enhanced, particularly for GPU accelerators, for
analyzing and optimizing irregular programs, and for auto-tuning programs for
best results. Finally, Cetus will be made available for use with Purdue's
NanoHub, which is a cyber-infrastructure platform for research on emerging
technologies.
