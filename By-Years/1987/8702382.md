The overall goals of this research are to study the immune-like responses of
the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, and to compare the cells and
substances mediating its defense mechanisms with their counterparts in the
vertebrate immune response. The cockroach is an excellent experimental animal
for these studies for several reasons. It is relatively long-lived; it is easily
maintained in the laboratory; it can be bred in captivity to produce inbred
strains of animals for genetic studies; and previous results suggest that the
roach possesses an inducible adaptive humoral immune response. The current goals
of this project are: to identify the factor(s) mediating the humoral response by
various protein separation techniques in combination with an in vivo assay, to
develop a sensitive and quantitative in vitro assay for the humoral factor(s),
to generate specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against certain hemolymph
proteins found in immune roaches; and to purify the humoral factor(s) by
affinity chromatography. Knowledge of the complex mechanisms governing the
adaptive immune response of vertebrates has grown tremendously in the past few
decades. As yet, however, little is known about the analogous defense mechanisms
in invertebrates. The results of these studies will provide valuable basic
knowledge not only about the immune-like defense mechanisms of the cockroach,
which may suggest biologically rational methods of control of this insect pest,
but also will enhance our general understanding of the evolution of immune
function.
