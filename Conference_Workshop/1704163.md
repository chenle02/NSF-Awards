For additional information see the conference website:
http://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cmlr/Finger-Lakes/. The conference
is aimed at professors, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates. Its
purpose is to facilitate communication between the probabilists near the Finger
Lakes in Upstate New York, as well as to introduce graduate students and
advanced undergraduates to the latest developments. Probability is a rapidly
developing area with many applications, and it is hard to be aware of all
developments in the field. In past years professors and graduate students from
more distant locations such as Toronto, Boston, and New York City have also
attended.
