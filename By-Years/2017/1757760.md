On June 12-17, 2016, experts on the biology and engineering of human and animal
movement will assemble at the Deer Creek Conference Center and Lodge in Mt.
Sterling, OH, for a conference entitled, "Biomechanics and Neural Control of
Movement". The goal of the meeting is to promote intensive open-ended debate
about the current state of knowledge and areas of future research on human and
animal movement. Specific sessions will cover muscle, bone, locomotion, reaching
and grasping, modeling, and rehabilitation. The unique venue, isolated from
distractions, and the inclusion of experts from many different scientific fields
should make this conference different from many annually occurring conferences
that are focused on narrower aspects of human and/or animal movement. The
proposal seeks funding to publish the consensus findings of the expert panels of
the meeting to serve as a roadmap for scientists, engineers, and program
managers for federal funding agencies. The outcome should lead to greater
scientific advances in the treatment of individuals with movement disabilities,
creation of new technology for assisting human movement, and the design of
robots emulating biological movement. This conference proposal requests support
for journal publication charges. 45 invited experts in muscle biology, movement
energetics, skeletal biomechanics, neuromotor adaptation, locomotion,
sensorimotor control, rehabilitation robotics, and neuromusculoskeletal modeling
will come together in a conference center isolated from a major city. The remote
location, relatively small size (140 attendees), and ample discussion time in
the program should provide for considerable opportunity to have productive
debate on current understanding of the physiology and engineering of movement.
Roboticists, computer scientists, physiologists, kinesiologists, clinicians, and
biomedical engineers will bring their disparate perspectives to the meeting.
There are 9 invited panels with five speakers each. Each panel will prepare a
summary review journal paper for publication in a special issue of an open
access journal (e.g. Journal of Neural Engineering) to disseminate the
discussion and findings of the panel. The funding from this award will go
towards the page charges for the special issue.
