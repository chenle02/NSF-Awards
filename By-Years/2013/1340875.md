The reliable, predictable, and rapid dissemination of scientific data from where
it is generated to innovators, scientists, and collaborators is a challenge the
CC-NIE program seeks to address. Without world-class network infrastructure, the
ability of institutions to conduct world-class research is hindered and the
competitiveness of the US is reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MARIA 100G
project addresses a known bottleneck point in the NatCap network aggregation
facility operated by Virginia Tech on behalf of the research and education
community in Virginia, including the research institutions who are members of
the Mid-Atlantic Research Infrastructure Alliance (MARIA). The project is
upgrading the aggregation link to the Internet2 national research network, from
a 2x5 gigabit per second capacity shared by all institutions in the commonwealth
to a 100 gigabit per second capacity. The removal of the bottleneck paves the
way for the unimpeded exchange of dramatically growing data sets in the course
of scientific discovery.
