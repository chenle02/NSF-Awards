The principal goal of this research planning project is to prescribe a
performance evaluation environment that supports the effective, efficient, and
creative programming of parallel computer systems. Since the complexity of
parallel computer systems makes program performance evaluation and prediction
difficult, tools employing the experimental method to observe, analyze, and
display system activity are essential. Accurate insights about program
execution, particularly on future large systems, are possible only if innovative
techniques are used in the areas of instrumentation, data management,
visualization, and knowledge engineering. Within this context, this project will
study the relationships between properties of parallel programs and properties
of the performance representations produced during execution on scalable
multicomputer systems. The validity and utility of particular views and
statistics as indicators and predictors of program performance are to be
investigated.
