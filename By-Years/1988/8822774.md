This research is on three dimensional modeling methods for predicting
performance and characteristics of VLSI-ULSI circuits and devices. The focus is
on: (1) efficient computations of capacitances and inductances in three
dimensional configurations of on-chip and off-chip interconnection lines; and
(2) feasible and accurate computations of threshold voltages in three-
dimensional simulations of MOSFETs. The former computations are needed for
assessment of delay times in off- chip interconnection lines. The latter
computations are needed when modeling pulse propagation through MOSFET circuits.
The approach is to use infinite electrical network theory to simplify the
computation of coupling between interconnection lines and adjacent devices. This
theory leads to efficient numerical methods, including domain contraction
techniques, which yield more powerful computation algorithms. Professor Zemanian
is an outstanding researcher with a solid record of accomplishment over the past
decade in both applied mathematics and electrical network theory. His approach
to difficult problems in IC design is novel and backed by solid theory and
mathematical results. He is very likely to continue first class research. The
research approach to the topic of modeling electrical properties in VLSI-ILSI
circuits, is high-risk, high-payoff for an important problem. The problem is a
high priority within the Design, Tools and Test Program.
