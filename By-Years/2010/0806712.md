This project is awarding fifty scholarships over a four-year period to
academically talented, financially disadvantaged students who are pursuing a
two-year degree in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The
project's intellectual merit lies in its focus on enabling the scholarship
recipients to persist through completion of their Associate's degree and
transfer to a four-year institution. Each scholar works with a faculty
advisor/mentor to develop an individualized success plan. The scholarship
amounts are tailored to allow recipients to reduce either their loan package
and/or work hours so as to pursue a full course load in a rigorous curriculum.
Specific support services and enrichment activities are intended to increase
academic success and contribute to the formation of a cohort community. These
include a first-year college orientation course, study skills, and internship
experiences in local and regional industries contribute to increase the
opportunity for the scholarship recipients to pursue careers in STEM fields. The
broader impacts of the project are felt through its emphasis on achieving higher
retention and transfer rates, by making it possible for academically talented
students to enroll full-time and work fewer hours. The project is also striving
to attract students who have traditionally been underrepresented in their
participation in STEM disciplines.
