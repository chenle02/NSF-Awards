Early high-temperature metamorphism and deformation of oceanic gabbros record
the evolution of the lower crust near mid-ocean ridges. Deciphering this record
has proven difficult for two reasons: (1) imprecise temperature estimates for
metamorphism, and (2) uncertainties about the equilibrium state of mineral
assemblages. This study employs a combination of experimental, analytical, and
statistical methods to address these issues. Experimental studies focus on the
temperature and time dependence of secondary mineral compositions using natural
metamorphosed gabbros formed at the East Pacific Rise. The petrologic and
statistical component of this project will determine metamorphic mineral
compositions from a suite of gabbros from ophiolites and mid ocean ridges. This
study will yield a better understanding of the time scales and spreading-rate
dependence of lower crustal processes near mid-ocean ridges.
