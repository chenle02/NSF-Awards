Accurate short-term predictions of wildfire spread are essential to inform
people, minimize the loss of lives and mitigate damage and cost of wildfire
through effective suppression activities. It is critical to improve on these
processes in the aftermath of the devastation of the Lahaina Fires. Before
details are forgotten, it is critical to identify all the factors influencing
wildfire spreads and to determine how to incorporate them into the rapid
prediction process. This project will train Ph.D. students in computational
science and modeling. This project will involve high school and community
college students from the `Aina Data Stewards program on Maui. This project will
develop wildfire models that have the potential to save human lives and
infrastructure in future wildfires using level-set methods and Hamilton-Jacobi
equations to model wildfire spread coupled to human activity during and after
wildfire activity in residential zones. While level-set methods are relatively
well known for wildfire modeling with coupling to data assimilation methods for
real-time analysis, there is need to understand their interaction with human
activity especially as it relates to evacuation and protection of property
immediately after a wildfire event. A product of this research will be a new
model to provide an understanding of the complex algorithmic and mathematical
basis for wildfire response that can aid in resource allocation in a virtually
real-time disaster situation such as the Lahaina firestorm. This project will
show how to immediately deploy this model to avert the bottlenecks leading to
tragedy and the required technological advances necessary to implement paradigm-
shifting solutions in fire management techniques.
