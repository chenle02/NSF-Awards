In recent years the study of polynomial knot invariants like the Jones
polynomial gained new momentum. In particular the Volume conjecture that claims
a deep relationship between the Jones polynomial of cablings of the knot on one
side and the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement on the other side led to a
new point of view. The topics of the project are inspired by the Volume
conjecture. The scope is to gain a better understanding of both the colored
Jones polynomial and the hyperbolic volume. In earlier works of the principal
investigator and his collaborators it was shown that bounds for the hyperbolic
volume of certain classes of knots can be read off from coefficients of the
colored Jones polynomial. This made it interesting to study the leading and
trailing coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial. Under certain conditions
on the knot there seems to be an infinite polynomial, depending on the knot,
whose first n coefficients agree with the first n coefficients of the colored
Jones polynomial at color n of that knot. The nature of these infinite
polynomials as well as their number theoretical properties will be studied. Part
of the project will also be to find a better topological understanding of the
colored Jones polynomial. For this, earlier work of the principle investigator
and his collaborators will be used that interprets the regular Jones polynomial
as a state sum over subgraphs of a graph, embedded on an oriented surface, that
is assigned to each knot diagram. Thus, every state is equipped with three
parameters, the third being the genus of the
subgraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a long and fruitful tradition
to study objects that are embedded in three dimensional space, e.g. knots, via
their projections on a plane. However, information about the original object is
lost and additional information is needed to indicate which arc of the knot is
farther away from the projection plane. By projecting on other surfaces more
information about the original object can be preserved. These projections will
be used to gain understanding of the topological and geometrical properties of
knot invariants like the Jones polynomial.&lt;br/&gt;
