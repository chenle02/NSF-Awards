The Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) brings together an
interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer
interaction, security, and privacy. The program features technical papers,
workshops and tutorials, a poster session, panels and invited talks, and
discussion sessions. The tenth SOUPS will be held July 9-11, 2014 at Facebook's
headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. The funds support travel grants for students to
attend the conference. SOUPS is the top conference devoted to usable privacy and
security. By increasing student participation at the SOUPS conference, it may
encourage more students to get involved in usable security research and pursue
further graduate education and careers in this area.
