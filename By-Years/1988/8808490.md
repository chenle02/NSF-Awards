This is a Career Advancement Award-ROW. The goal of the research is to
understand the factors that affect the distribution of enzymes within a pore.
The research includes a fundamental study of the complex process of enzyme
catalyzed reactions in porous supports. The results have application in the
design of reactors for many biochemical processes.
