The project involves a program of observation and analysis of the influence of
local galaxy environments on the evolution of galaxies. A large body of
observational data obtained in the last several years will be used to
investigate differences in the fundamental properties of cluster and field
galaxies such as the mass and light distributions, and there will be an
evaluation of the effects such as the location within the cluster, the cluster
dynamical state, and morphological type. An outgrowth of this work will be a
calibration of the Tully-Fisher relation within clusters The Principal
Investigator is an expert in research of this type.
