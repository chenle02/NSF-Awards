This high-risk high-reward project is concerned with the urgent need to design
and deploy wireless networks that withstand time in hazardous, radioactive
environments, such as a nuclear plant disaster. A hazardous, radioactive
environment is particularly insidious because sensing and communication devices
deployed in the environment are exposed to radioactive emissions - hence, their
extraction for recharging/repair is challenging, and their efficient operation
may be seriously impacted if hardware not hardened for radiation is used, and
because in this physical space non-cooperating wireless communication
technologies, e.g., wireless mesh and sensor networks, need to coexist. This
EAGER project explores a pathway and solutions towards achieving a significant
increase in the operation time of coexisting wireless mesh and sensor networks
deployed in a hazardous environment. The intellectual merit lies in a radical
new approach (anchored in a new and solid Markov chain-based theoretical
foundation, for achievable throughput, delay and energy efficiency) for a
crosslayer design of ultra-energy efficient wireless communication protocols
that employ duty cycling and network coding. The broader societal impact of the
proposed research goes beyond the traditional impact of scientific research,
literally affecting life and death. Results of the proposed research will be
integrated with RESPOND-R, an NSF-funded instrument for emergency response
research, deployable in hazardous environments throughout the US, where it could
possibly save lives. This project will also offer research opportunities to
graduate and undergraduate students and to underrepresented groups.
