Proposal Number: 0335324&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Exposing Grand Challenges
in Information Security and Assurance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Eugene Spafford
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last decade
has seen a huge growth in the spread of computing in commerce, government,
research and personal life. However, as our dependence on these technologies has
grown, there have also been an increasing number of threats to this same
technology, and to the information and processing managed by it. The conference
to be supported by this proposal will seek to identify "grand challenges" in the
areas of information security and information assurance, or more broadly in
Cyber Trust. The conference is one of a series of conferences on grand research
challenges in computer science and engineering that began in June 2002 with the
"Grand Research Challenges in Information Systems" conference. A broad range of
viewpoints will be included at the conference, which will product a report
laying out a dynamic research agenda that will lead to substantive progress in
IS/IA. The agenda is expected to be of value not only to agencies and companies
wishing to establish a long-term research agenda, but to the research and
academic communities to help seed new projects.
