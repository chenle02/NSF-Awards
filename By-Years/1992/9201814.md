9201814 Amster Funds are requested for the purchase an extended mass range
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This instrument will used by investigators
in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry to determine the molecular
weights of peptides and proteins with sizes in the range 1,000-100,000 Da, the
primary structures of proteins, and the number and location of metal atoms in
native and modified proteins. The requested spectrometer will facilitate
characterization of transforming growth factor E, pyridoxal-5' phosphate binding
sites, biological electron transfer pathways, and a range of native and mutated
metalloenzymes and metalloproteins. The proposed instrument will be used for
training and research directly related to the NSF research training group in the
role of transition metals in biology at the University of Georgia.
