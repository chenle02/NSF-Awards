9722486 Kra This Americas Program award will fund an iberoamerican congress on
geometry, to be held in Cruz del Sur, Chile, January 7-11. 1998. Organizers are
Dr. Irwin Kra, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Dr. Rubi
Rodriguez, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. The congress will promote
international scientific cooperation, by bringing together active researchers
from US, Chile. Mexico and Spain, and other European countries. The central
theme of the conference will be the geometry of Riemann surfaces, an active
research area in many countries around the world. Other themes will be
Teichmuller theory and Klein surfaces. One of the objectives of the conference
is to create the opportunity for young researchers in these and other groups to
establish strong international ties. This meeting will foster this effort by
bringing together for the first time the principal leaders in the field. ***
