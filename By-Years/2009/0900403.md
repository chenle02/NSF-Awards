This award is to support LaserFest, a collection of public outreach and
education efforts surrounding the 50th anniversary of the invention of the laser
in 2010. The primary goals of the project are to: 1) inform students, educators,
legislators, and the general public about the impact of the laser, and 2)
illustrate the importance of scientific and technological innovation, using the
laser as a specific example. LaserFest is designed as an outreach activity.
Scientists will collaborate with media and outreach professionals to bring the
message of LaserFest to as broad an audience as possible. Communication will be
achieved by means of personal appearances in lecture and demonstration shows,
through an extensive body of information conveyed on the web and in video
presentations, and by leveraging LaserFest activity through media coverage. A
principal gauge of the success of the celebration will be through evaluating
audience feedback, and tracking web traffic and media exposure. This award is
cofunded by the Physics Division, the Division of Materials Research, the
Chemistry Division, and the Division of Multidisciplinary Activities.
