The goal of this research program is to investigate methods to improve the
performance of high frequency semiconductor devices. This will be achieved
through work in three closely related areas. These are: studies of the physics
of high frequency electron transport in semiconductor devices; modeling and
optimization of specific devices and device circuits; and investigations of
fabrication technology. The specific devices to be investigated are those
related to high frequency receiver applications. These devices are among the
smallest semiconductor devices yet developed and are capable of operating well
above 1 THz. Specific research will investigate: high frequency effects, the
effect of fabrication technology on device characteristics, the use of a
heterjunction to develop a high electron mobility diode structure, and the
utilization of numerical modeling techniques to optimize diode parameters for
mixer, varactor, varistor, and sideband generator applications at frequencies
above 1 THz. The results of this research will be applicable to future
development of other high frequency devices and circuits, such as high frequency
transistors and eventually millimeter wavelength integrated circuits.
