The Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska will further develop
flow cytometric techniques for marine biology and oceanography. The Institute
has been instrumental in adapting flow cytometry, a technology developed for use
in the biomedical research community, for ocean science research. With this
technique, a stream of bacteria, cells, or other microscopic particles is passed
through a laser light beam. Different cells and particles can be enumerated and
classified according to how they fluoresce or react in response to the laser
light. Analysis of the fluoresced signal can yield important information on cell
size, cellular constituents, and metabolic condition. This effort will continue
to focus on using flow cytometry for studying marine bacteria. Work will
continue on developing appropriate flow cytometry standards and protocols. The
laboratory will also be available for use by guest investigators. Coordination
with industry will promote further development and modifications to basic flow
cytometry instrumentation for oceanographic research. Improvements and
modifications will be directed towards expanding dynamic range of the instrument
and increasing sensitivity. Methods for determining protein content per cell and
membrane potential will also be explored.
