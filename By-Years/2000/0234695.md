A growing standardized communications infrastucture, over which, agents
belonging to different organizations can interact, is expected to raise the
importance of automated negotiation among self-interested automated agents. This
project investigates normative negotiation stratagies for agents, specifically:
a) extending work on single contracts by investigating decommitments, penalties,
etc. and their relationships to optimality; b) designing barganing protocals
that lead to optimal contracts, and c) studying sequences of contracts among
multiple agents, including the affects of changing the pace of decommitments,
contingancy contracts, and more powerful contract types that reduce needs for
backtracking. The results of these studies will be used to design a normative
hybrid multi-agent search algorithm that repesents the best chice in a space of
protocals where each dimension corresponds to a methodilogical tradeoff. Among
other things, this work is expected to impact electronic commerce, including
such aspects as the formation of dynamic alliances of small agile enterprises
through dynamic automated contracting. http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~sandholm
