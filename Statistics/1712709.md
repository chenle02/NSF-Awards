The problem of variable clustering is a corner stone in a multitude of areas
such as genetics, neuroscience, sociology, macroeconomics, to name a few. In
neuroscience, it aids in finding new functionally connected areas. In genetics,
it helps advance the discovery of genes with under-explored or unknown
functions. In macro-economics it can assist with the creation of new economic
indices. Despite its wide-spread importance and potential impact, this problem
has not received a systematic methodological and theoretical treatment in the
literature. Although clustering algorithms abound, and have a very long history,
assessing the validity of their input is somewhat arbitrary. A probabilistic,
model-based approach is put forward in this project. This will enable the
development of a unified framework for principled statistical variable
clustering.

Specifically, this project will introduce and investigate classes of latent
variable models for overlapping and non-overlapping variable clustering. The
focal points are: (I) The introduction of identifiable latent variable models
for clustering. This will provide well defined targets for estimation, and will
facilitate the scientific interpretation of the clusters. (II) The development
of polynomial time algorithms tailored to these models. (III) The creation of a
unifying framework for the theoretical analysis of clustering algorithms, with
emphasis on minimax optimality and high dimensional inference. (IV) The study of
the impact of model based clustering algorithms on downstream analyses, with
emphasis on graphical models, regression and classification.
