This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Truong's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. The research will develop and apply theoretical and
computational methods to study the reactive dynamics of chemical reactions in
different environments. Classical dynamics and quantum dynamics will be applied
to proton and hydride transfer in biological systems. Semiempirical molecular
orbital methods will be modified to treat reactions in solution. New methods for
describing marcromolecules on metallic surfaces will also be developed using a
variational transition state theory for the purpose of probing the details of
reactive dynamics in these systems. %%% The theoretical prediction of
environment effects on chemical reactions is important because it can result in
the better understanding of the rate at which reactions occur under
environmental conditions.
