9614612 Liebermann Phase transformations in mantle minerals at high pressures
and temperatures strongly influence the physical properties and dynamic
processes in the Earth's interior. The PI proposes to perform ultrasonic
measurements on high-pressure mantle phases to determine their elastic
properties at both high P, and simultaneous high P-T conditions that exist in
the Earth's transition zone. The data will be used to improve and refine
mineralogical models of the mantle through comparisons with seismic velocity
data. This research program takes advantage of the special opportunities
provided by the multi-anvil, large- volume facilities of the Stony Brook High
Pressure Laboratory and the associated analytical facilities of the NSF Science
and Technology Center for High Pressure Research (CHiPR). ***
