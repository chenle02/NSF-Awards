This project studies whether including population structures can change
unstructured models of ecological or epidemiological systems that converge to
equilibrium states into models that undergo damped oscillations. Mathematically
this amounts to converting systems of ordinary differential equations into
nonlinear partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions and
functional terms. These equations are studied as evolution equations in an
appropriate Banach space. Specific examples are age-structured models of
childhood diseases, infection-age-structured models of fatal infectious
diseases, and size-structured models of waterflea populations (waterfleas are an
important laboratory animal). The dynamics of structured populations and the
spread of infectious diseases are more complicated than simple models predict.
An understanding of the ways oscillations occur in mathematical models may well
be important to public health, by helping to predict the course of epidemic or
endemic infections.***
