Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0204532&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dibyen
Majumdar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Efficient and Robust Designs Based on
Ordered Units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to find efficient
designs for experiments conducted over time to compare different treatments,
varieties of objects or methods. A substantial part of the project deals with
crossover experiments, where it often happens that subjects drop out prior to
the conclusion of the experiment, thereby reducing the information content of
the data, or even jeopardizing the validity of the conclusions. Here the aim is
to identify efficient designs that are largely robust to subject dropout.
Another part of the project deals with experiments where a trend over time must
be accounted for in the model and analysis. Here the aim is to identify
efficient designs that are flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of
experimental conditions and models that arise in real
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proper statistical design is a critical
aspect of scientific experiments; it ensures that the conclusions, based on
observed data, remain valid in the larger context. This project deals with
experiments in a variety of fields, including biomedical, agricultural and
industrial experiments, that are conducted over time. As the experiment
progresses, uncontrollable factors could influence the outcome. The aim of this
project is to develop designs that perform well in diverse experimental
conditions as well as designs that are robust against the inadvertent loss of
experimental subjects before the conclusion of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;
