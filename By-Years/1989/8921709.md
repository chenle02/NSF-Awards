The proposed research will address several fundamental issues in modern quantum
optics dealing with the quantum interference of light from two independent
sources. Each source is comprised of a high-gain amplifier which amplifies the
vacuum field to macroscopic levels. Both phase-insensitive (stimulated Raman
scattering) and phase-sensitive (optical parametric) amplification will be
studied, for comparison. The phase- insensitive case will allow the first
observation of interference between two independent, thermal-like light sources.
The phase- sensitive case will explore the interference of two independent
nonclassical light fields, for which novel features are predicted. A new concept
for observing sub-shot-noise statistics is described theoretically and will be
attempted experimentally.
