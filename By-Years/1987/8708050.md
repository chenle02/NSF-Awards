This proposed research is funded under the National Science Foundation Program,
Research Opportunities for Women, which provides funds to allow female
scientists to change career fields. The research will involve room temperature
tensile and flexure tests as well as creep tests at elevated temperatures on
ceramic matrix composite materials. Fracture surfaces will be observed using
scanning electron microscopy, and the fiber surfaces will be studied using the
scanning Auger microprobe. Transmission electron microscopy studies will be
performed along with electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy dispersion x-
rays. The research program will provide an opportunity to explore the
feasibility of conducting fatigue tests on the ceramic composites. The
facilities and the institutional environment is excellent for the execution of
this research.
