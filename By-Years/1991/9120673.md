The objective of the proposed research is the development of appropriate
modeling capability to gain insight into the fundamental phenomena associated
with the flow and transport in systems with active interfacial regions as well
as provide useful design and operation data. The capability to investigate the
linear as well as weakly nonlinear stability of many such systems to three-
dimensional disturbances will be developed in general. Specific systems will be
investigated, the results compared to existing experimental results, and some
new experiments designed.
