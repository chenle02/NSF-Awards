The PIs will carry out the 3D simulation of current-carrying flux tube dynamics.
In particular, the PI will study: (1) the interaction of submerged flux tubes
that carry a substantial amount of current, and thus, helicity, and (2) the
global dynamics of solar flux tubes that lead to the morphology and evolution of
the overall active region dynamics. The combination of these two processes will
lead to the oft-observed global features' characteristics. The PI corroborates
his computational/theoretical results closely with the solar satellite and
ground-based observational results, particularly from Yohkoh.***
