Drug resistance represents a major obstacle to improving the overall response
and survival of cancer patients. While most tumors initially respond well to
drug therapies, the majority will relapse at a certain point following
treatment. Therapeutic failure may be attributed to intrinsic tumor
heterogeneity prior to therapy or induced tumor heterogeneity after initiation
of therapy. This project aims at developing mathematical models for studying the
emergence and the spatial and temporal propagation of single or multidrug
resistance under drug-specific treatment protocols. The tools developed in this
project will provide a foundation for designing personalized therapy that can be
adjusted based on the dynamics of the resistance to chemotherapy. The project
involves training of graduate students as well as curriculum and outreach
initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will focus on developing, simulating,
and analyzing new mathematical models for describing the dynamics of drug
resistance in cancer, as mediated by intratumoral heterogeneity. Biologically-
based mathematical models will include: hybrid discrete-continuous models,
integro-differential equations, stochastic models, and partial-differential
equations. The project opens new research opportunities that are guided by PI's
established collaborations with clinicians and experimentalists. The focus of
this funded project is on the mathematical aspects of the study. A successful
completion of this project will provide us with a wide range of mathematical
approaches for future translational research in experimental and clinical
studies.
