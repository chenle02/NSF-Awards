The project will improve MPICH-G2 collective operation performance to the state
of the art and also improve MPICH-G2's point-to-point TCP performance. Since
MPICH-G2 is a popular package and has been used in a variety of Grid projects
and applications, improvement will increase its usage and effectiveness.
MPICH-G2 has been used to set and utilize QoS parameters having real-time
network latency and bandwidth requirements, and has also been used in
client/server scientific visualization applications. The project will implement
a solution to the new symbol collision problem, which will also broaden the base
to include a new class of computing platforms, the Linux Cluster. The proposed
enhancements coupled with the extension of MPICH-G2's platform base to include
Linux clusters, are significant improvements. The broader impact of this work
will be realized by MPI application developers as the proposed activities will
significantly increase the utility of MPICH-G2 as an effective middleware
tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tool as been used in a number of traditional
scientific applications, most notably receiving the Gordon Bell Prize, Special
Category, for its role in an astrophysics application used for solving problems.
The work will significantly improve teh bandwidth for large messages over non-
vendor MPI communications and will further promote MPI as an effective Grid API
for non-traditional scientific applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
