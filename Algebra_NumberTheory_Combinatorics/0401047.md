Abstract for award DMS-0401047 of Thomas:



Groebner basis theory is today a central theoretical and computational tool in
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra with applications in myriad fields
such as computer science, optimization, robotics, statistics, and computer
modeling. The Groebner fan of an ideal or module is the decomposition of the
space of weight vectors that induce Groebner base, such that each cone in the
fan indexes a distinct Groebner basis. This project describes four problems from
combinatorics, optimization, representation theory and algebraic geometry that
revolve around Groebner fans. The first project investigates the complexity,
geometry and homological properties of initial ideals of toric ideals. Answers
to these questions have implications in integer programming and on the
computation of toric Groebner bases which themselves have several applications.
The next examines the variation of weight vectors in Kalai's theory of algebraic
shifting for simplicial complexes. The third project studies the polyhedral
geometry of moduli of resentations of the McKay quiver which (partially) resolve
singularities that arise in generalized McKay correspondence. The last goal is
to develop a software package for computing Groebner fans of arbitrary
polynomial ideals. Applications include the computation of tropical varieties
and the study of orbit closures and degenerations of representations of finite
dimensional algebras.

The proposed work will employ tools from combinatorics, discrete geometry and
optimization to solve problems from commutative algebra, representation theory
and algebraic geometry. All projects have a strong computational component that
aims at effective algorithms and serves as a laboratory for uncovering new
structure theorems. The collaborations include three graduate students and three
current or recent postdocs.
