Advances in information technology have provided a broad platform for anytime-
anywhere interactions, creating significant challenges for leaders to lead at a
distance and across diverse cultures and settings. Yet, it is not uncommon today
for people to relay stories of electronic communication that they misinterpreted
or that caused great distress in their relationships with fellow workers.
Currently, there is no protocol for technology-mediated leadership in virtual
teams. In this two-year field study at UNISYS, we will explore how virtual teams
form, develop trust, and lead themselves to higher levels of performance. This
study is unique in that most of the literature on virtual teams has ignored
leadership, which is one of fundamental drivers of team performance.
