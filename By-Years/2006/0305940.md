Two problems of gravity wave propagation in stratified flows will be studied:
the propagation of internal wave beams and the resonant interaction of nonlinear
modulated wavetrains with the induced mean flow. Since gravity provides a
preferred direction, internal wave disturbances generated by an oscillatory
source are anisotropic; rather than cylindrical fronts, they form straight beams
stretching radially outwards. The propagation characteristics of such beams will
be studied under various flow conditions using asymptotic and numerical models.
Particular emphasis will be placed on three-dimensional and non-axisymmetric
beams for which nonlinear effects are most pronounced. Secondly, a theoretical
study will be made of the so-called resonant self-acceleration of modulated
wavetrains; this strong nonlinear interaction between the wavetrain envelope and
the induced horizontal mean flow can cause instability and breakdown of nearly
vertically propagating wavetrains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although not as
familiar from everyday experience as ocean surface waves, internal gravity waves
are in fact ubiquitous in oceans, lakes and in the atmosphere, where they play
an important part in transferring momentum and energy. Internal gravity wave
beams in particular are often triggered by thunderstorms, and there is evidence
from numerical simulations and field observations that a significant component
of gravity wave activity in the atmosphere is in the form of beam-like
structures. Understanding the propagation characteristics of internal gravity
wave beams will thus prove useful in weather forecasting.
