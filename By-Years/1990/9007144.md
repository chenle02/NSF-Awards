Five related projects are proposed for a leaf mine-oak tree system in which we
will attempt to determine whether leaf-to- leaf, tree-to-tree, and tree-species-
to-tree species preferences of leaf miners results from differential egg
hatching, differential larval performance, differential pupal mortality, or
differences in movement of adult moths between trees. Previous research has
shown that leaf miners show a distinct preference for different species of tree,
different individual trees within a species and different types of leaf within a
tree. Such preferences are maintained year after year. Investigations into such
factors as leaf abscission, predation, parasitism, and host quality of leaves as
measured by amino acid content do not explain preferences of leaf miners for
certain leaves or trees. The propose to move miner eggs between leaves, between
individual trees, and between tree species. They also plan to move pupae between
trees and to mark pupae with heavy metals to determine movement rates of adult
moths that we will catch with sticky traps. Such research will greatly increase
of knowledge of forest dynamics.
