The major objective of this research is to assess the quantity and quality of
soil organic matter (SOM) and to test the roles of the active fractions of SOM
in CO2 and CH4 production in the arctic ecosystem. The first phase of this
project involves the sampling and full characterization of soils on the flux
study sites which were jointly selected by all PIs involved in this
collaborative proposal. The soil characterization will provide database for
extrapolating the results of gas flux studies over a geographic base. The second
phase involves the isolation and characterization of the inactive and active
organic fractions in soils and soil solutions; then identification of the
microbial active fractions using respiration experiments under controlled
conditions and the active components as substrates for gas flux (both CO2 and
CH4) using carbon labelling experiments. It is hypothesized that the major
sources of CO2 and CH4 production are the active fractions in SOM. The
composition, quantity of active and inactive organic carbon fraction and their
turnover rate are expected to closely relate to gas flux on different arctic
ecosystems. This project is part of the larger integrated Land/Atmosphere/Ice
Interactions (LAII) Flux study of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.
