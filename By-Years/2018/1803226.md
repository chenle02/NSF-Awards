Laboratories across the world have begun to develop high-powered laser systems
which can create electromagnetic radiation pulses that are so energetic that
they open new avenues of exploration. This project will assist these exciting
developments with ab initio computer simulations which have sufficient temporal
and spatial resolution to provide microscopic insight into the relativistic
interaction of photons with electrons and positrons. A better understanding of
these fundamental processes might open new ways to control atomic, chemical and
even biological processes on very short time scales. An important mission for
the grant is also to give undergraduate students the opportunity to gain
research experience. This educational experience provides them with important
skills including working as a team, gaining the endurance, intellectual
flexibility and experience to tackle serious research problems, and
communicating results in conferences and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
computer simulations are obtained by solving the coupled set of Dirac-Maxwell
equations of relativistic quantum electrodynamics on a numerical space-time
grid. These non-perturbative large-scale calculations are very CPU time
consuming but have become possible due to recent progress in the development of
specialized numerical algorithms for massively parallel computers. The
calculations are performed in Illinois. Some of the primary goals of the work
include optimizing the pair creation yield by suitable laser field designs,
developing more efficient approaches for general relativistic interactions,
exploiting several physical mechanisms to lower the laser intensity required for
pair-creation and providing a new diagnostic technique to monitor the creation
dynamics inside the reaction zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
