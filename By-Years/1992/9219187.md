This research is to install and operate for one year a five- station portable
broadband array of REFTEK/STS-2 seismic systems in northeastern Venezuela and
Trinidad. The goal is to image crustal and upper mantle structures of the
eastern Caribbean-South America plate boundary. The project is a collaborative
effort between the seismology group at INTEVEP, S.A. (Venezuela), scientists at
the Seismic Research Unit, Trinidad, and Carnegie Institution. The purpose of
the seismic experiment is to answer outstanding and controversial questions
regarding the nature of the seismogenic plate boundary. Seismic analysis will
focus on two broad areas: 1) the presence or absence of seismic evidence for a
relict slab beneath Venezuela and 2) determination of crustal and upper mantle
structure by analysis of boundary interaction phases, surface wave inversion,
and measurement of delay times and travel- times. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
