One of the exciting recent directions for music and technology is interactive
music performance, which requires advanced systems for sensing, listening, and
understanding creative new human-computer cooperative interfaces, advances in
real-time systems, and new models of music performance and synthesis. This
project introduces a new computer music application: a virtual Performer that
can fill the role of an accomplished musician performing popular music. This
work will establish a new framework for music making, essentially a new
genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work lies in the
scientific study of music and related research including reliable gesture
sensing, signal analysis, and the study of how computers can support cooperative
tasks. Results will have additional implications for music information
retrieval, human-computer interaction, and complex sensing and recognition
tasks. The broader impacts of this work include new music technology useful to
millions of musicians, amateur and professional alike, providing a stimulus to
creative musical practice, culture, and the economy. This new creative practice
will also promote computational literacy, and the research itself will motivate
a broader interest in computer science and related fields among new
students.&lt;br/&gt;
