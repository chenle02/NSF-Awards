This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students pursuing
careers in computer science. The goal is to encourage eligible students to study
CS, and help them find a desirable job upon completion of their Associate Degree
or transfer to a four-year university to enter in a baccalaureate program.
Selected participants receive tuition, books and fees paid for by the grant. In
addition to the financial assistance, they meet with the CS Advisor/Mentor on a
bi-monthly basis during the semester. This helps monitor their progress and
assure their success in the program. A series of workshops, offered throughout
the program, allow students to improve their problem solving skills,
interviewing skills, job-hunting techniques, and writing a resume. Students also
receive individualized support and peer mentoring as they move through the
program.
