This research develops a comprehensive model of wave induced heating of the
ionosphere to investigate these processes. The investigator will develop a two-
dimensional model and obtain numerical solutions for specified conditions.
Studies will focus on: (1) HF heating ranging from D-region to F-region of the
ionosphere; (2) self-focusing instabilities induced field-aligned
irregularities; (3) extremely low frequency/very low frequency generation due to
temporal modulation and spatial modulation; and (4) electron energization due to
the spatially localized electric fields and the associated enhancements in the
optical and infrared emissions. This research will have applications in
communications, underground explorations, diagnostics of ionospheric parameters,
and infrared countermeasures.
