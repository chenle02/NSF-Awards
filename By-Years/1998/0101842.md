Since 1998, The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University has been
conducting a project for Materials Development, Training and Support Services
(MTS) through the support of the Division of Research, Evaluation and
Communication. This award has permitted intensive evaluation training of faculty
and advanced graduate students through summer institutes. In addition, a number
of other training activities as well as support mechanisms for evaluators have
been developed, such as training materials, an Evaluators' Directory, and
checklists for evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, the work of
the Evaluation Center on MTS will continue. Forty-five participants will be
trained during the summer, and 18 of these will continue on into internships
during the following academic year. Additionally, a model for training
evaluators will be developed and tested, including an instrument for testing
knowledge and a self-assessment measure. There will also be training materials
developed by participants that will be made available to the field. Finally, the
web-site developed for evaluators will be enhanced and used more
widely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
