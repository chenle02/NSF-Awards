AST-9615626 Marina Fomenkova Drs. Marina Fomenkova and Barbara Jones at the
University of California at San Diego will take images and spectroscopic
observations of comet Hale-Bopp in the infrared wavelength range 1 - 20
micrometers in order to determine the basic physical parameters of the nucleus
and to monitor the changes in the state of cometary dust grains over a large
range of heliocentric distances. The project is expected to provide new insights
into the physical and chemical states of comets. This award is supported jointly
by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at NSF.
