9508705 Fieber The experiments proposed in this study will address control of
neural function in the marine snail, Aplysia. The simple nervous system of this
invertebrate is a model for the study of changes in neural function that
directly affect the animal's behavior. The neural control of egg laying in
Aplysia is the physiological phenomenon that will be examined. The study will
employ the technique of single cell voltage clamping, which flows through
special channels in a group of neural cells called bag cells. Two specific goals
of the study are: 1) to work out methods for studying single sodium channels to
understand how they execute their role in the neural pattern that results in egg
laying, and 2) to identify certain hormones that circulate in the body of the
animal during egg laying that may change the way the sodium currents operate.
These studies are the first step in a planned study that will explore the idea
that egg laying is dependent on specific changes in these sodium currents. Such
studies have broad relevance for understanding how an animal's nervous system
controls physiological or behavioral responses.
