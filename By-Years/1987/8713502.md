The goal of this project is to develop a rodenticide containing an emetic as the
active ingredient. There is an increasing need for such an acute rodenticide in
urban communities where rats are becoming resistant to warfarin and other
ridenticides of the chronic anticoagulant type. The problem wuth high toxicity
rodenticides such as zinc phosphide is that there is no safety margin to protect
human and domestic animals against accidental poisoning. In this project four
plant derived emetic compounds will be prepared and incorporated into an acute
toxicity rodent bait. Rats and mice which are unable to vomit will be poisoned
while cats, dogs and humans will be unaffected. The emetics are: scillirosidin
obtained from red squill, scillarenin from white squill, the digitalis derived
from digitoxigenin from digitoxin, and wisterine from wisterial vine seeds.
Preparative, analytical and animal test methods will be developed on the emetic
aglycones. The emetic activity will be established in pigeons, and later tested
with an acute rodenticide in a rat bait. The most likely candidates will be
field tested. Success in this project will provide a new approach to the growing
problem of rat infestation in urban communities.
