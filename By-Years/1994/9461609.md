This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward the
development and validation of a comprehensive computational model for chemical
vapor infiltration (CVI). It involves a macro model that describes the transport
processes in a porous preform. The macroscopic properties of the preform that
are needed in the macro model are determined from a micro model in which
detailed calculations are made for fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer
in a generalized unit cell comprising of fibers of rectangular cross section.
The technical objectives of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate the
validity of the crucial ingredients of the model for two-dimensional
infiltration process. The specific topics to be considered are: (a) validation
of the equivalent unit cell approach, (b) evaluation of preform properties as
functions of the density, (c) validation of the overall model for a two-
dimensional preform by demonstrating that the results of the proposed model
compare well with those obtained from full numerical simulation that accounts
for all geometric details, and (d) a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of
the proposed model as a design/optimization tool. Use of the proposed
computational model will lead to lower manufacturing cost and increased use of
ceramic composite materials.
