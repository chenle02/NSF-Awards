Development of Science of Computing 1 and 2 Courses at SUNY GeneseoA two-
semester introductory sequence of courses in computer science is being developed
based upon an equal weight being given to programming, mathematical analysis,
and experimentation, with the supporting mathematics being integrated into the
curriculum.This sequence has the goal of providing a foundation so that
thestudents can practice programming, experimentation, and analysis throughout
the curriculum. The first courses, Science of Computing 1 and 2, teach all three
(and the supporting mathematics) in enough depth to allow this practice to start
immediately. Programming, analysis, and experimentation are taught concurrently
in the courses rather than in the traditional sequential manner.
