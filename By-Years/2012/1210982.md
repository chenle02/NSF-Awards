This award will support several projects that involve the mathematics of quantum
mechanics. One main goal is the development of computer algorithms for studying
the quantum mechanical motion of nuclei in molecules. Another main goal is to
study adiabatic theory for weakly coupled quantum mechanical systems beyond the
lifetime of a resonance. Other goals involve the break-up of certain unstable
molecules and the study of molecular resonance states. Graduate students
involved in the project will be trained in adiabatic quantum computing, quantum
mechanics in random potentials, and many body scattering
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators, their
collaborators, and their graduate students will use support from this award to
study mathematical problems in quantum mechanics. One project will involve how
to use computers efficiently when computing the quantum mechanical motion of the
nuclei in reacting molecules. Other projects will study various theoretical
aspects of quantum computing. In addition, unstable molecules and other systems
with finite lifetimes will be studied. Graduate students will receive training
involving these and other aspects of quantum theory.
