Bridgewater State College will initiate a six-week, residential, Early Alert
Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics which will offer
science enrichment activities for 40 female precollege students entering grade
7. This program will emphasize investigations and communications in mathematics
and physics. In addition to the summer activities, participants will take part
in an academic year component during which they will visit career sites and work
with career mentors. They also will work in teams supervised by teacher mentors
on a series of mathematics and physics projects related to topics such as fiber
optics.
