ABSTRACT #1238502 Abbey

This proposal investigates the development and analysis of utility based
measures of diagnostic performance for the purpose of technology evaluation,
using screening mammography as an example. This approach represents an important
departure from the standard analysis, which uses receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to obtain area under the curve (AUC) as the
study endpoint. The utility methods confine attention to the most relevant part
of the ROC curve. This leads to a more meaningful measure of performance, and
also reduces sources of extraneous variability relative to effect size, thereby
leading to a more powerful statistical design of experiments.
