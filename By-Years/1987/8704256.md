Professor Wolch and her colleagues will analyze the ways industrial change in
city centers, changing patterns of low-income housing supply, and public
programs (including social programs and urban renewal) contribute to the number
and locations of homeless individuals in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The
study will provide a comprehensive analysis of the changing patterns and
mobility of the urban homeless. That analysis will in turn form the foundation
for a reinterpretation of urban structure and theory that will enlarge our
understanding of metropolitan problems and prospects over the next decade or
more.
