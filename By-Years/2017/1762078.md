The 5th Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory will be held at
the University of Notre Dame on April 21--22 2018. The workshop will benefit
graduate students and junior researchers in the field of discrete mathematics,
working at institutions in the Great Lakes area. It is built around two sets of
three tutorial lectures, focusing on state-of-the-art techniques and results
that the speakers feel are underrepresented in typical graduate sequences, and
on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to
expound. There will also be short talks by students and younger faculty members.
There will be ample unscheduled time during the weekend, allowing new research
collaborations to commence and active collaborations to be continued. Junior
participants will establish valuable connections with more senior colleagues,
and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal environment.

The tutorial speakers for the 2018 workshop will talk about "Connections between
Coxeter systems, permutation patterns and reduced words", and "Edit distance in
graphs". The website for the conference is https://www3.nd.edu/~conf/lmwcgt18/.
