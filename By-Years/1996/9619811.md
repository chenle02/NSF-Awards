9619811 Dixon The Department of Physics and the Center for Laser and Photonics
Research at Oklahoma State University will establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in the area of optical materials and lasers. The nine
student participants will be involved in projects that include crystal growth
and characterization of experimental and theoretical laser physics. Emphasis
will be placed on recruiting women and ethnic minorities. Following the summer
research activities, the student participants will present the results of their
work at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. %%% The REU project
at Oklahoma State University will introduce outstanding students at a formative
stage in their careers to the growing area of lasers and optical materials. ***
