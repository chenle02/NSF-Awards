Bandit problems have been studied in many different contexts and variations. The
vast majority of work focuses on a static environment, in which, at each time,
the probability distribution of the reward yielded by each action remains
unchanged. This static model may clearly fail to produce decision strategies
that are optimal in a dynamically changing environment. Despite their sounding
relevance in practical applications, such environments have received sporadic
attention in the statistical community so far. The contribution of the proposed
research to the current state of knowledge will consist in proposing models for
new dynamic environments that are motivated by a significant class of
applications, designing policies that adapt to dynamic environments, analyzing
the performance of these policies and assessing optimality from a finite time
(non asymptotic) point of view.

Sequential allocation in dynamic environments is a problem that arises at the
intersection of nonparametric statistics, machine learning and operations
research. This project involves techniques from these fields and points out
fundamental bridges between the extant results to form a more unified theory of
the subject. This theory will then serve as a basis for producing
computationally efficient allocation policies with potential applications in
clinical trials, drug discovery and real time web page content optimization.
