Daily physical activity is important for health and associated with positive
health outcomes during pregnancy. However, few studies have examined the impact
of daily physical activity on maternal calorie requirements and gestational
weight gain, and recent research suggests that calorie intake and expenditure
may be limited during pregnancy. This project examines whether there are upper
limits on maternal energy expenditure during pregnancy and considers potential
energy tradeoffs between activity level and other physiological tasks, such as
fetal growth. Project results can advance fundamental knowledge about human
metabolism and physiology during pregnancy and contribute to discussions about
the selective pressures that have shaped hominin bipedalism, metabolism,
infancy, and life history. The work can also inform public health research and
the management of nutrition and exercise during pregnancy. The project supports
student training and mentoring in STEM as well as collaborations between
anthropologists and clinicians that benefit both clinical and basic research
communities. The investigators test Maternal Metabolic Limits hypotheses by
measuring daily energy expenditure (calories/day), daily energy intake
(calories/day), daily physical activity, weight gain, and other health measures
in a large sample of pregnant mothers. Mothers are recruited to represent a wide
range of daily physical activity, from those who are sedentary and plan to
remain sedentary through pregnancy to athletes who intend to maintain high
exercise workloads. Mothersâ€™ daily activity and weight gain are tracked weekly.
Energy expenditure and intake are measured twice for each participant: early and
late in pregnancy. Health outcomes are taken from routine medical visits.
Maternal Metabolic Limits hypotheses are supported if highly active mothers
expend the same amount of calories late in pregnancy as mothers who are more
sedentary, and if high levels of exercise negatively impact weight gain.
