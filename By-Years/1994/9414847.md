Byrne: Richard Stockton College of New Jersey is one of only two 4-year
undergraduate institutions located in Southern New Jersey. The institution is
one of the few undergraduate institutions in the United States with a degree
program in Marine Science, serving approximately 100 degree majors. To sustain
this growth, the college plans to renovated and modernize the marine laboratory
on Nactoe Creek, a part of the intercoastal lagoon system in southern New
Jersey. Present conditions at the facility are inadequate and severely limit
research activities. Space dedicated to research and research training is not
properly partitioned and does not meet safety requirements. No seawater system
exists and the greenhouse facility in its present state is unusable. The heating
and cooling systems are antiquated and cannot support the level of use in the
building. Funds have been requested to renovate 1,678 square feet (156.1 square
meters) of research and research training space. In addition to modernizing
space, renovations will include: the installation of fume hoods, casework,
emergency eyewash showers and a seawater system. HVAC and fire protection
systems will be upgraded and the greenhouse will be reglazed. Once completed,
the renovated facilities will support research projects that cannot be conducted
at the moment. Redesigned space will promote more collaborative activities with
other institutions in proximity to the marine field station and will allow for
more student involvement. Opportunities for students to engage in the research
enterprise early in their undergraduate careers will increase the probability
that the students will continue in their pursuit of marine science.
