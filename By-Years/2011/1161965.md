This research project aims to investigate new approaches to solve large-scale
simulation optimization problems. The resulting methodology of this project will
be used to efficiently solve families of simulation optimization problems in
both discrete and continuous settings, and have applications to a variety of
domains such as manufacturing systems, supply chain, healthcare and enterprise
systems. The research targets at two fundamental challenges in simulation
optimization: 1) identify specific probabilistic structures that allow us to
improve the search efficiency, and 2) to measure quality of the current solution
obtained when little information on the objective bound is provided. Currently,
the majority of the research effort in the field has been devoted to building
heuristics. Very few theoretical results have been established, however,
addressing the underlying mathematical structure. This research project seeks to
build a specific yet widely applicable theoretical condition for simulation
optimization algorithms to quickly converge, while at the same time identify,
with little bounding information but a reasonably higher level confidence, the
distance between the global optimum to current solution obtained.

If successful, the new methodology and the resulting algorithms will have broad
applicability in solving large-scale simulation optimization problems in domains
such as manufacturing, supply chain and enterprise systems. The ideas resulting
from this project will be disseminated through publications, software
development, and conference participation at both national and international
level. This research project will also be closely integrated with the education
and training of engineering students by incorporating new developments into the
undergraduate and graduate optimization courses taught by PI. Finally, the
martingale method is expected to have a broader impact in the research community
by stimulating further discussion and study of the embedded stochastic processes
in simulation optimization.
