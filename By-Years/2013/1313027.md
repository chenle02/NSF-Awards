Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and other advances in hardware have made it
possible to address many security issues, such as ensuring that all loaded
software is from authorized sources. As an example, The Windows 8 Secure Boot
relies on TPM technology to provide strong guarantees for device integrity, and
both Intel and AMD chips include abilities to use external verifiers for code
verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although these hardware advances provide
extremely useful and powerful security properties, researchers and practitioners
have been slow to adopt these technologies. One of the main reasons is the lack
of familiarity with the capabilities and properties of these technologies. To
address this situation, the Trusted Infrastructure Workshop (TIW 2013) provides
training for current graduate students with experience in computer security
about these technologies and how they can be leveraged for research and
engineering. TIW 2013 offers students lectures by leading researchers from
industry, government, and academia that are actively developing and using
trusted computing technologies, as well as developing future infrastructure
technologies for building secure systems.
