The work in the preceding grant period demonstrated the utility of the single-
arm fiber interferometer as an all optical switch. It led to an all optical
switch of unprecedented low switchout power with no stabilization of the
interferometer. The fiber-ring reflector has similarly stable performance that
needs no external stabilization. The use of the ring reflector with a 42% /68%
coupler as an optical switch was first demonstrated by the research group at
British Telecom. The Principle Investigator has shown that an improved version
of the ring reflector can be devised if the 50% / 50% beam splitter is used.
Further, a very simple version of such a reflector is a means for producing
pulsed squeezed optical vacuum in a way that separates the pumping radiation
from the squeezed radiation. The P.I. proposes to concentrate upon various
aspects of switching and squeezing of this fiber ring interferometer,
generically equivalent to the single fiber interferometer, but easier to
construct and therefore preferable for experimentation. He proposes to develop
further the quantum theory of solitons. Finally, he proposes to investigate the
two photon absorption in silica fibers that may, or may not, affect the
switching properties of optical fibers.
