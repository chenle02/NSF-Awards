This is a joint project to develop a data management capability for the US
Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS), based on a novel software approach to a
distributed data base system. The objective is to allow individual scientists to
use their existing computer and data analysis software to operate on data from a
variety of sources regardless of format. The proposal calls for developing the
necessary software for the most common hardware configurations, preparing files
of existing data, and preparing an on-line capability for storing GOFS data.
