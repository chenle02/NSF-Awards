9421707 Han The standard model is the currently accepted interpretation of the
elementary constituents, quarks and leptons, and the forces between them. It
does not explain many central problems, such as the origin of mars.
Understanding what lies beyond the standard model is the central problem in high
energy physics. A conference on this topic "Beyond the Standard Model IV", to be
held Dec. 13-18, 1994 at the Granlibakken Conference Center on Lake Tahoe,
California, organized and hosted by the Univ. of California at Davis is likely
to be timely, important and fruitful. It will allow for presentation of new
experimental and theoretical results, with discussions among leading experts.
This is the fourth in the series of much conferences, held every other year; all
have been successful. ***
