Funds are requested for the purchase of a Finnigan MAT 252 light isotope ratio
mass spectrometer with a "Kiel device" and ancillary equipment. This
spectrometer will be dedicated primarily to CO2 analysis, primarily for the
analysis of very small individual samples of carbonate, but also with later
anticipated analysis of ice, water and organic matter. Funding from NSF will be
matched with moneys from the Pennsylvania State University.
