This equipment is being used by Professor Mazumder for his research on problems
in IC design. In testing, problems addressed are parallel testing, error
correction for three dimensional memories, and neural network optimization
techniques for built-in self-repair of VLSI components. Physical design problems
concern in layout optimization techniques using genetic algorithms. Large
systems are being modeled by a hardware description language; and software for
verifying correctness, compiling the design, determining the Boonlean equations
and implementing them as a VLSI design is being built. In addition, the
equipment is being used to design specialized chips for a hexagonal mesh
architecture used as an experimental testbed to investigate the behavior of
distributed algorithms for real-time systems. This is an equipment grant which
will provide Professor Mazumder an engineering workstation, necessary to
research in IC design problems. The principal investigator is a promising and
productive young professor who is likely to make significant contributions to
the field. He has a record of useful, innovative ideas in VLSI testing and IC
design. His research topics have high-priority within the Design, Tools and Test
Program.
