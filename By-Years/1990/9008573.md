This project provides international travel support for development of
trilateral cooperative research in frontiers of constructed facilities between
the U.S.A., Japan, and Korea. A workshop program will be formulated to rivet
attention of research communities on the directions for new research in emerging
technologies for advanced constructed facilities. The topic areas to be examined
include new materials, smart structures, super large-scale structures,
underground facilities, structural evaluation techniques, experts systems, etc.
Considerable common interests exist in these areas for possible joint research
efforts in developing new frontiers of construction and natural disaster
mitigation measures in connection with the new constructed facilities. At a time
when there is a great urgency to revitalize the U.S. technology in construction
and to restore the industry's competitiveness and leadership, the collaboration
with Japan and Korea, both leaders in the field, is both timely and
strategically meritorious. This effort will lead to a comprehensive future
research agenda in advanced constructed facilities research and practical ways
to implement these programs by way of international cooperation.
