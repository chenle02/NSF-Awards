The PIs propose to establish a five-year ITR program that will lead the
development of the next generation distributed video sensing systems for
understanding human movements. Novel models of human movement and structure will
be used for modeling the movements of singe-joint and whole bodies with
applications to animation, biomotion, and gait analysis for diagnosing and
treating movement-related disorders. The interdisciplinary team includes leading
researchers from three core institutions - the University of Maryland (lead
institution), Stanford University and New York University. The researchers cover
a broad spectrum of interests, including biomechanics, computer science and
engineering, electrical engineering, and kinesiology. The proposed research
efforts will enable novel approaches for realistic animation and the detection
of subtle variations in movement, leading to better diagnostic tools and
personalized programs for rehabilitation of movement disorders. Strong
educational and industrial outreach programs will also enhance our research
program.
