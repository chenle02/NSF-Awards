It is proposed that the scattering of positrons and electrons by atoms and
molecules be studied experimentally in order to learn more about basic
interactions of antimatter with matter. The proposed research includes
measurement of total, differential, and inelastic scattering of positrons by
atoms and molecules, as well as a search for positron scattering resonances. An
important part of the research program is to make corresponding electron
scattering comparison measurements in the same apparatus using the same
technique. Information will be obtained that is of interest in many areas of
science and technology. For example, the scattering of positrons by atomic and
molecular hydrogen is of importance to astrophysicists for the interpretation of
positron annihilation gamma rays observed in solar flares and in the central
region of our galaxy.
