Approximately 20 leading scientists will attend this workshop to discuss the
"state of the field" with respect to designing novel proteins and enzymes. These
scientists represent a broad range of expertise: Some specialize in
computational design of novel proteins, while others focus on evolutionary and
combinatorial methods for selection and optimization. The purpose of the
workshop will be threefold: (i) To describe how contributions from different
disciplines have enabled enormous recent advances in our ability to devise novel
proteins that fold and function; (ii) To discuss the potential for future
developments in this field, and describe how cross-fertilization between
disciplines can enhance this progress; and (iii) To explicitly discuss
challenges and/or roadblocks that might impede this progress, and to propose
approaches that will enable researchers to overcome these challenges in the
coming decade. The workshop will focus on both basic science and real-world
applications of protein design, engineering, and selection.
