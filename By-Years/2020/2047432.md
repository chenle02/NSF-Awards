This research will explore how social technologies can support and augment the
ability of family caregivers to effectively communicate and coordinate during
hospitalization, and develop sociotechnical principles that inform the design of
next-generation caregiving coordination technologies for family resilience
during a health crisis. During such a crisis, families must adjust and adapt,
taking on new roles and staying connected while they coordinate care and support
each other. A major protective factor is the familyâ€™s resilience, or ability to
withstand and rebound from disruptive life challenges, emerging strengthened and
more resourceful. Systems that enable computer-supported cooperative work hold
promise to support and augment family resilience, but they are designed using
assumptions that may not hold true in the case of family health crisis. These
technologies have great potential to help groups form on short notice, establish
supportive roles and coordination routines, support each other in information
work without neglecting emotional wellbeing, and adapt their collaboration
practices as conditions and needs change over time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a combination of rigorous qualitative
investigations, family-driven design, and hospital-based technology deployments,
this research will address three specific aims: (1) Modeling needs and design
opportunities for family resilience technologies; (2) Collaboratively designing
and prototyping next-generation caregiving coordination technologies that
augment the ability of families to coordinate care; and (3) Developing,
deploying, and evaluating a suite of caregiving coordination tools for families
of seriously ill children that embodies family resilience principles, helps
family members cope with evolving needs, and enables a variety of support
practices. This work will be grounded in the case of pediatric cancer, the
leading cause of disease-related deaths in youth, but also has significant
implications for family caregiving in diverse contexts. The research will
involve the participation of graduate students in an emerging and promising new
area of research, and will support interdisciplinary collaboration between the
medical and computing communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
