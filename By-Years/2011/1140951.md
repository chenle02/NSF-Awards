In this project students at UCLA are selected to enroll in a series of 3
seminar-style classes, one in each quarter, supplementary to their Introductory
Life Science lecture and discussion course. In the classes, teams of students
learn to produce short documentary videos on topics of societal interest in
evolutionary biology, which they have researched in the literature and through
conversations with experts on the UCLA faculty. Their improvement in high-level
cognitive mastery compared to a matched control group is expected to increase
their academic success and foster their retention in life science majors.
Students are chosen from among those identified as underrepresented in STEM
disciplines and who have experienced life challenges. Such students are
particularly susceptible to abandoning STEM majors, so success in this program
has a broad impact. In addition, the video products, developed collaboratively
and with the help of graduate-student facilitators from theater, film, and
television backgrounds, are shown to UCLA students majoring in other disciplines
and to middle-school students. This project thus has an unusually broad impact.
