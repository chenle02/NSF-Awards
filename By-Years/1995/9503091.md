Scientists have consistently focussed on the size and shape of the face in
studies of both function (chewing, seeing, etc) and ancestry. There clearly has
been a great deal of room for conflicting interpretations of the same materials.
All the problems would be clarified by an improved understanding of the
influences that differences in size during growth of the face, which is
acknowledged to have at least some major effect. This study will evaluate the
hypothesis that differences between individual facial size and shape are
primarily the result of some common inherited patterns of growth differentials.
This will be the first broad, comparative, and explicitly phylogenetic
investigation of developmental patterns within and between some monkey species
and genera. The study has considerable relevance for understanding the dynamics
of facial growth and will aid in the superior training of a new young scientist.
