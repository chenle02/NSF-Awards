This project provides hands-on experience for undergraduate mechanical
engineering students on modern corrosion testing and measurement equipment. The
equipment funded for this laboratory enhancement includes: a potentiostat, a
corrosion cell, interface for a PC, and corrosion software. This equipment is
used to measure corrosion current and corrosion potential of common engineering
materials in different service environments, and to study the electrochemical
principles of corrosion. The project is significant because the equipment serves
as a teaching tool to give junior-level students experience with corrosion
principles and it builds on experience with modern instrumentation that students
have acquired in sophomore-level course. This award is being matched by an equal
sum from the grantee.
