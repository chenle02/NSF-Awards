9615044 Billah Wind-induced vibrations of flexible structures occur in variety
of practical cases ranging from tall buildings to transmission towers. It is
well known that the response of many structures in a direction perpendicular to
the flow is more complex since vortices are usually shed in the wake, not only
for quasi-steady (deterministic) conditions but also in the presence of natural
turbulence. The corresponding structural response calculations have been fraught
with difficulty since the vortex-structure interaction mechanism is not very
well understood. A conceptual understanding that has emerged recently is that
vortex-induced vibration is initiated due to the creation of parametric
instability condition. the concept has received substantial support from
experimental results as well as from analytical calculations. The present
research initiative will rigorously try to validate the parametric instability
condition and its various ramifications from fundamental fluid-structure
understanding.
