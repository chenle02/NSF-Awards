Sixteen one week workshops, eight in the summer of 1993 and eight more in the
summer of 1994, are being held at sites geographically distributed throughout
the country. Each workshop will have 24 participants from high schools, two and
four year colleges, and universities. Workshop leaders will be drawn from the
ranks of those who have led the reform movement. The leaders will illustrate the
use of the particular materials and methods they have developed and prepare
participants for obstacles that confront curricular reform. Participants will
engage in the activities of a particular approach to reform, consider the
criticisms that led to the calculus reform movement, be presented with a
national overview of curricular reform, and be asked to reflect on the goals and
expectations they bring to teaching the course. They will then be asked to
consider their own situation and to formulate a plan for action in their home
institution.
