This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, is to develop a strategy to form an experimental
approach to the health monitoring issue of structures. This approach will have
its origins in control system realization theory. An analysis is to be developed
that would allow the field engineer to compare current realizations of an aging,
or possibly damaged complex structure, to realizations of the structure when the
system was "new" and assumed healthy.
