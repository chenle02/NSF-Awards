9314502 Orcutt The broad motivation for this study is to further understanding
of the relationship between the nature of the seismicity (depth, mechanisms,
spatial-temporal behavior), the character of ridge axis morphology, and the
generation of acoustic T-waves along the Iceland-Svalbard plate boundary. The
recent availability of several new seismic/acoustic data sets provides an
exciting opportunity for a well-constrained investigation: the Norwegian land-
based seismic array data, the U.S. Navy hydrophone array data, and detailed data
on the plate geology and tectonics.
