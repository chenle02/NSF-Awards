This interagency transfer will pay for a NASA Learjet 705. Funds will cover the
cost of fitting scientific instruments aboard the aircraft, as well as allowing
30 flight hours for collecting atmospheric radon observations. This aircraft is
being used under the auspices of an existing grant (Mark Kritz, SUNY Albany),
and is critical to the success of that project.
