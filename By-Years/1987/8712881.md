Professor Wilson and coinvestigator Neilsen will analyze soil and crop yield
information to develop an improved version of the soil productivity index
developed by Larson and associates at the University of Minnesota. The index
will also be modified so it can be applied to cereal grain crops. The
investigators will use data on Montana's climates, soils, and cropping systems
to further modify the index so that it can be used to compare productivity index
values across geographic regions. They will test the accuracy of the resulting
model in two small drainage basins for which they will obtain detailed erosion
and productivity measurements. Relationships between soil erosion and
productivity are complicated. They are of worldwide concern because of the great
losses of productivity that can result from severe erosion. Developing a
productivity index that could be applied across regions would be of considerable
theoretical interest. Such an index would also be helpful in developing policies
and programs to reduce erosion associated with cropping.
