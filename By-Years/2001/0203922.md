Experimental Computer Science: Low-Level Optimizations for Next-Generation Disk
Drives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;File input/output (I/O) has traditionally been a
performance problem for several applications. The proposed research seeks to
optimize the performance of file I/O operations by taking advantage of next-
generation disk devices (i.e., devices with embedded and programmable high-
performance processors). The postdoctoral research associate will be involved
with the introduction and evaluation of a new device-level architecture, new
disk controller software, and modifications to standard host operating systems.
The expected outcomes are performance improvements for a wide spectrum of disk
workloads, ranging from random and small file accesses to large sequential
accesses. Evaluations will employ combinations of detailed simulations and
actual implementations along with native executions of disk-bound applications
(e.g., video-on-demand, data mining).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
