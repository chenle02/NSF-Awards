Funds are requested to support the travel of speakers invited to the 51st
Annual Symposium of the Society for Developmental Biology, which will be held
June 24-28, 1992 at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. This
year's symposium is organized by Merton Bernfield, current President of the
Society, on the subject of "Molecular Basis of Morphogenesis". Each session will
focus on a specific organ system as studied in a variety of organisms. Sessions
will be on gametogenesis, early organogenesis, on root, flower and leaf
morphogenesis, and on organ systems, including cardiovascular, nervous, muscle,
and skeletal, epithelial and hemato-lymphopoietic systems. Two minisymposia will
precede the main symposium by one day and focus on "Inheritance Mechanisms at
Fertilization" and on the "Molecular Embryology and the Study of Lung
Development". The meeting is usually of medium size (300-400) registrants) with
a single platform session held at a time (25-30) speakers total), and with 60-80
posters presented at three sessions. It is attended by graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers. All speakers have been requested
to prepare summaries of their presentations for publication in the annual
symposium volume.
