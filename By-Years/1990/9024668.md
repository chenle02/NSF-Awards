The objective of this proposal is to develop static and dynamic light scattering
techniques for the characterization of fractal soot aggregates in flames.
Current fractal-based theories for the optical properties of soot particles will
be incorporated in the proposed techniques. The results from several static
scattering/extinction measurements on soot clusters will be compared to soot
clusters selected from flames and viewed by an electron micrograph. The Photon
Correlation Spectroscopy, a dynamic technique to be further developed by Dr.
Sorensen during this project. The research topic is important for scientist
understanding of soot formation and of light scattering diagnostics, and has
engineering applications in combustion and environment.
