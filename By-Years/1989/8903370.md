Proposed is research on temperature-compensated magnetic materials. Phase II
seeks improved base and compensation alloys with suitably high coercivities and
energy products by advanced processing techniques employing casting, sintering
and thermal treatments. Blends of these alloys are bonded into magnets with
specific temperature coefficients of magnetization. A computer model is used to
predict properties of blends. In Phase I a method of internal temperature
compensation for bonded rare-earth permanent magnets was demonstrated. This is
of interest for bonded magnets based on Nd-Fe-B, whose strong temperature
dependence of spontaneous magnetization in the typical use range of 0 degrees C
to +150 degrees C is a problem in many applications since magnetization can
decrease rapidly as temperature increases.
