This is a novel method for processing polymer films to make gas separation
membranes. A polymer sheet is simultaneously stretched and compressed by pulling
it through a roller (roll-truding). The purpose of the prior work was to produce
higher strength polymer sheets. However, the flux of gases through the resultant
films has been round to be very high, approximately 1000 times what one would
expect for the unprocessed films. It is suggested this has occurred because
there has been an alignment and segregation of microcrystalline domains within
rubbery domains of the film, thus making the diffusion path through the film
less tortuous. Further, the domain size separating the crystalline domains is of
angstrom dimensions, and can be controlled by the roll-truding process and by
subsequent annealing. If still thinner films can be produced, domain sizes might
be used in conjunction with differences in diffusion rates and solubilities to
add a stearic selectivity to a gas separation process. If the films can be used
for gas separations, this will constitute a major breakthrough in gas membrane
separations, as a very wide variety of polymers, which could not previously be
used for gas separations, can be turned into gas separation membranes by this
process. Though it is probably not possible to produce hollow fiber membrane
modules by roll-truding, the process should be ideal for making spiral-wound
modules.
