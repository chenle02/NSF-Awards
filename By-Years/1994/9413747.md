9413747 Arbabi, Freydoon This is an instrumentation award. The instrumentation
in this proposal will enable the civil and environmental engineering faculty to
further develop their research in civil engineering materials. Major research
specialties will include cemented aggregate mixtures (portland cement and
asphaltic concrete), incorporation of industrial residuals into cemented
aggregate mixtures, dynamic behavior of materials, wood engineering, composite
utilization, and adhesives. ***
