The objective of this research is to develop a fast hardware for multi- variable
fuzzy control systems using Logic Cell Arrays (LRAs), user programmable gate
arrays. These Logic Cell Arrays combine the logic integration benefits of custom
VSLI with the advantages of using standard Integrated Circuits. In this work,
the multi-variable fuzzy control system is reduced to Boonlean expression that
can be stored in the Logic Cell Array. Using the on-chip memory, the Logic Cell
Array is configured so as to store the Boonlean expressions. Therefore, the
fuzzy logic inferences per second (FLIPS) of the system are determined by the
response time of the Logic Cell Array. In most of the current applications of
fuzzy controllers, software is employed as a medium for the implementation of
fuzzy control rules. The hardware approach pursued in this research gives a
cheaper and more effective implementation. Furthermore, it expands the actual
use of fuzzy controller in many application areas where speed is critical such
as robot control and speech recognition, among others.
