This action provides funding to the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS). Funds provided by this award will support preparation and
dissemination of an updated directory of graduate programs in science,
engineering and public policy (SEPP). The current directory resulted from a
partially NSF-funded AAAS survey of such "SEPP" programs six years ago. It is
also the only such directory in existence.
