For over half a century, the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) has been one of
the main observational tools for galactic studies and cosmology. It has been
used with ever-increasing sensitivity and resolution to investigate the
structure of our own Galaxy and of other disk systems, their interactions with
other galaxies, the large-scale structure of the Universe, and the physical
conditions of high redshift systems. The recent evolution of 21 cm detectors,
spectrometers and multi-feed systems has dramatically expanded both the
accessible volume of parameter space and our ability to sample it quickly. The
new seven-feed array for the Arecibo telescope enables it to study the HI
Universe to unprecedented volumes and low mass levels.

The first part of this research will explore the faint end of the HI mass
function, and act as a pilot for the second part, which will carry out, develop
the necessary analysis tools for, and process and make publicly accessible the
products of, (a) a fast survey of the Arecibo HI sky, (b) a medium-deep survey
of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and (c) a deep extragalactic HI survey in the
Zone of Avoidance, all using the Arecibo feed array system. All three surveys
lend themselves to synergistic coordination with several different projects, not
just the present ones, including studies of Milky Way structure and high
velocity clouds, a pulsar search, and the detection of radio continuum
transients.

The software tools and data products will be made available to the community,
and the research work will provide fertile ground for the training of a new
generation of US-based single-dish radio astronomers.
