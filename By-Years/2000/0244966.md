The objective of this research is to test Newton's inverse-square law of
gravitation with a resolution of 1 part in 1000 in the range near 100
micrometers. To reach this sensitivity, the experiment will be cooled to 1.2 K
and a highly sensitive superconducting accelerometer will be used to search for
a signal from a carefully designed gravitational null
source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newton's law is a cornerstone of Einstein's General
Relativity. However, this celebrated law has been challenged from several fronts
of particle theories. In particular, a possible violation of the law at sub-
millimeter ranges has recently been suggested by string theories. Confirmation
or rejection of this prediction would have a major impact on our understanding
of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;
