The principal investigator will study whether the analog of the strong law of
large numbers holds for reinforced random walk on the integers, whenever the
initial weightings are equal, under arbitrary past dependent reinforcement. He
also will investigate recurrence of two dimensional, and n dimensional,
reinforced random walk. In addition, he proposes to find necessary and
sufficient geometrical conditions for certain classes of domains, including the
class of those domains in R**2 with boundary in a sense given locally by the
graph of a function, for the semigroup connected with the Dirichlet Laplacian to
be intrinsically ultracontractive. The principal investigator will conduct
research at the interface between probability and analysis. He will work on two
classes of problems: reinforced random walk, and intrinsic ultracontractivity.
