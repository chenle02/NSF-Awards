This award is for the partial support of the conference in the field of Partial
Differential Equations at the University of Arkansas. The conference will
concentrate on the area of solutions of PDE's in periodic media. The conference
will be a part of the Arkansas Spring Lecture Series and will attract
researchers from other areas, such as Differential Geometry (Dmitri Burago) and
Dynamical Systems (John Mather).
