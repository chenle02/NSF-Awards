The world will need to increase agricultural yields dramatically to meet the
demands of the rapidly growing population for food and renewable fuel. The
edible parts of several major food plants, including corn, rice, wheat, beans,
and peas, undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication in which their
cells enlarge and increase their DNA content several fold. Despite its
importance, little is known about how endoreduplication is regulated, and it is
difficult to investigate in food plants because the endoreduplicating nutritive
tissues are buried deep within their developing seeds. To overcome this
difficulty, the research proposed will use genetics, cell biology, and genomics
to investigate endoreduplication in exposed cells on the surface of the
Arabidopsis flower. In this new system, the cells are accessible for
experimentation in growing plants. In particular, the research will address the
question of how endoreduplication influences the cell undergoing the process.
First, a mutant with increased numbers of endoreduplicated cells will be used to
elucidate how endoreduplication is controlled. Second, the mechanism through
which endoreduplication turns off one gene will be determined. Normally
scientists think of external signals turning on and off genes within a cell.
However, exciting recent results suggests that in, at least one case,
endoreduplication can turn off a gene. Finally, to find how many genes are
turned on or off by endoreduplication, the expression levels of all of the genes
in the Arabidopsis genome will be compared between endoreduplicating cells and
their non-endoreduplicating neighbors. Findings from this research may show new
ways to increase crop yield. In addition, this project will train two graduate
students, provide opportunities for summer research for three undergraduate
students, and will enable workshops targeted to interest school girls in
science.
