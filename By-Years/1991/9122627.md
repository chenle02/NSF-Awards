Plans to reduce the number of military personnel by 25% have stimulated public
interest in the social representativeness for the U.S. military and in the
effects of voluntary military service on civilian labor market outcomes. The
military is the largest single employer of young people and veterans benefits
constitute the largest federal subsidy to education and training. The purpose of
this project is to analyze the impact of military service on the earnings of
veterans after leaving the military. What is at issue is whether or not military
service, on average, has a positive or negative effect on success in the
civilian labor market. Errors in the scoring of military entrance examinations
in the late 1970's increased the probability that low ability applicants would
be accepted. This exogenous shift in acceptance probabilities provides a natural
experiment that can be used to estimate the effects of voluntary, military
service on civilian labor-market outcomes. The effects of military entrance
standards on the social composition of the armed forces will also be analyzed.
The empirical strategy is to match armed forces administrative records on
military applicants to military records on entrants, and finally to longitudinal
social-security earnings records. The matched data set will consist of a long
panel containing information on earnings, test scores, veteran status, and
demographic characteristics. Semi-parametric estimators will be developed for
estimating the effects of military service in nonlinear models with unobserved
individual effects.
