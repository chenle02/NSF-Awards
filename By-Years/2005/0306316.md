Abstract

Award: DMS-0306316 Principal Investigator: Alexander Givental

Gromov-Witten invariants characterize global properties of phase spaces in
Hamiltonian mechanics. The project concerns with various problems of
constructing and generalizing Gromov-Witten invariants, developing methods of
their computation, interpreting the geometrical information they encode and
understanding the rules that govern relationships among them. In particular, the
role of integrable hierarchies and their Virasoro symmetries in Gromov-Witten
theory and in its mirror partner - singularity theory - is to be investigated.
To this end, certain vertex operator constuctions based on the theory of
vanishing cycles in singularity theory will be explored as a promising tool for
describing and manipulating with integrable hierarchies. Exploiting the twisted
loop group of hiden symmetries discovered recently in the structure of Gromov-
Witten invariants and uncovering the origin of the symmetries are among key
motives for this project.

In a broader prospective, the projects continues the legacy of the past two
centures in the development and application of modern mathematics. The methods
of algebraic geometry, topology, group theory and quantum mechanics laid down in
the classical work of Gauss, Riemann, Lie, Klein, Poincare and Weyl come
together to address the problems posed lately by string theory in its search for
the ultimate unity of fundamental interactions.
