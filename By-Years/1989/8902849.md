The scientific goals of the project are to evaluate climate change on four time
scales: 1) the last 18,000 years; 2) the last 150,000 years; 3) the last 10
million years; and 4) the period 200 to 250 million years ago. The research
strategy is to isolate the factors which are causing climate change on these
time scales through a series of climate model experiments, then compare the
model results to geological data in order to test how well the observed changes
in climate have been reproduced. The research will focus on isolating the
climatological impact of changes in incoming solar radiation, changes in
geography and orography, and changes in ocean circulation. This research is
important because it will determine the climatic significance of various
geological processes leading to a better understanding of the natural variation
in the climate system.
