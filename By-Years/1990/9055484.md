The Western Mathematics Scholars Program is a regional teacher enhancement
effort for teachers of grades seven through twelve in Colorado, Nebraska, North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Each of 126 teachers will participate in the
program for two full summers and academic years. The program includes a five-
week summer institute, to be offered each of two summers at three campus sites
(South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Chadron State College in Nebraska,
and Cheyenne Community College in Wyoming.) Each summer, 42 teachers will
participate at each site. They will take courses in discrete mathematics, data
analysis, geometric perspectives, and modeling with modern technology. Each
course includes concept exploration and development, together with laboratory
sessions focusing on classroom implementation. Special speakers and extra
sessions are included; as part of the teacher enhancement process, exemplary
modules demonstrating the use of project approaches in classrooms will be
developed by the participants. During the academic year, teachers will implement
project ideas in their classrooms, conduct inservice activities in their local
areas, and attend regional followup meetings. The project extends the successful
model of the Nebraska Mathematics Scholars program (TPE 8550604) by providing
opportunities for teachers throughout five states to become involved. The
project is administered through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; subcontracts
are included for Colorado State University, the University of South Dakota,
Minot State University in North Dakota, and the University of Wyoming. Cost
sharing is provided by participants' schools and other sources as 19% of the NSF
award.
