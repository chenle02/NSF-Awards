This grant is to provide 50 CRAY hours Supercomputer time on Class VI computer
to conduct modelling studies of the process of crack initiaiton and rapid crack
propagation in semiductile and ductile materials where the inelastic material
response and material inertia affect the load transfer characteristics. The
studies are intended to provide detailed quantitative descriptions of the stress
and deformation fields in the near-tip region and to relate these near-tip
descriptions to the overall structural behavior. The computational simulation
study requires the computing power of a Class VI computer. The computational
results will help to establish criteria for crack initiation, propagation, and
arrest under dynamic conditions.
