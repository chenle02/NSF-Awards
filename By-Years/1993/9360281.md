9360281 Kebabian Analysis of the stable isotopes in atmospheric methane samples
can be used to identify local sources and to define the global budget of this
radiatively important greenhouse gas. This proposal would develop a portable and
less expensive alternative to isotope mass spectrometry for measuring 13CH4 and
CH3D components in methane samples. The method is based on infrared absorption
using a helium neon laser at 2999.24 cm-1. The laser line can be Zeeman shifted
into coincidence with closely spaced line pairs of 13CH4 - 12CH4 and CH3D - CH4
so that both ratios may be obtained with a single instrument and sample. Phase I
research will identify the exact line positions of these pairs and the laser
line using tunable diode laser spectroscopy, and will establish the baseline
parameters for evaluating the ultimate sensitivity of the technique. In Phase
II, the prototype instrument will be constructed and intercompared with samples
analyzed by mass spectrometry. ***
