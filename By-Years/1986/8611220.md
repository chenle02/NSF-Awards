The objective of this research is to apply formal language methods from computer
science to the field of solid modeling. In particular, research will be created
into the use of shape grammars as formal, direct generators of physical solids.
How solids are combined to meet physical and functional requirements is a
central question in design that has yet to be answered. This research will
contribute to a better formal understanding of both the relationships between
known descriptions of solids, for example, constructive solid geometry and
boundary representation, and the possibilities, constraints, and complexities of
solid modeling.
