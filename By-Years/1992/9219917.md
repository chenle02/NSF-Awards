This research will investigate upper mantle stratification in the vicinity of
subducting slabs by means of stacked seismograms that reveal underside
reflections from discontinuities. A systematic analysis will be made of
earthquake records for deep and intermediate depth events in the circum-Pacific
subduction zones using broadband digital data as well as WWSSN and LRSM analog
data. This will provide constraints on the character of mantle discontinuities
in the thermally perturbed mantle near subducting slabs and back-arc basins.
Variations in depth and impedance contrasts for P and S wave reflectors will
then be interpreted in terms of thermal and petrological models for upper mantle
layering near subduction zones.
