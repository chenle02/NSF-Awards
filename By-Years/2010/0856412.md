Janet Iwasa, Harvard University, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for
the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years. This fellowship will bridge between
a Chemical Bonding Center (CBC) and the Boston Museum of Science by providing
scientifically accurate, dynamic molecular visualizations. The audience for
these visualizations spans from researchers to the general public. Iwasa's key
goal will be to present chemical evolution in a clear and engaging way to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is
supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking
new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research
expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their
research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their
projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to
workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports
both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.
