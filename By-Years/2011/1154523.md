The Scholarship, Leadership, and Mentoring in the STEM Fields (SLMS) project at
Tougaloo College is supporting 15 students with 4-year scholarships as they earn
degrees in science, computer science, or mathematics. To augment traditional
studies, the SLMS program also is focusing on leadership training in addition to
community building. SLMS scholars are benefiting from individual mentoring from
a faculty team of two and from targeted academic support through the college's
Science Success Center. In addition, SLMS scholars are being given opportunities
for internships with workforce partners as well as research opportunities with
on-campus faculty. SLMS scholars are being invited to take advantage of
intensive career counseling in addition to leadership skill-building workshops
and seminars. Scholars are participating in the ACTIVE seminar series in which
they are building their scientific writing and presentation skills while also
interfacing with the invited distinguished faculty visitors.

Intellectual Merit: The SLMS program is removing one of the major hindrances
concerning minority student success in STEM disciplines, namely financial need.
With a revamped curriculum, Tougaloo is positioned to increase STEM student
engagement and build hands-on investigative and critical thinking skills. This
program is providing data on the impact of financial support on recruitment and
retention-to-degree of African-American students at a small private HBCU .

Broader Impact: The project is building on a strong base to provide everything a
student needs to attend college and to succeed as a major in a STEM area.
Academic enrichment, professional development, and a hands-on approach to
mentoring are at the core of this program that is graduating well-rounded,
scientifically literate, community-committed, minority students who are
increasing the diversity in the STEM workforce.
