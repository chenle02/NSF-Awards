This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Phase I project aims at developing a novel bioasphalt production technology
using a recycled agricultural byproduct and recycled coal-fired power plant
waste. Demand for asphalt in the United States is projected to increase 2.3
percent annually from 2006 to reach 38.5 million tons in 2011. Because of
concerns over dependence on foreign oil, high energy consumption, a high asphalt
price and unstable supply, and climate change, non-petroleum based bioasphalt
made from renewable sources needs to be studied and developed. In this Phase I
research, the optimal conditions for bioasphalt production will be determined,
and the properties of the bioasphalt produced will be characterized. The
performance of the hot mix bioasphalt concrete will be evaluated and compared
with the petroleum based asphalt. The technical feasibility of this technology
will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this
technology will result in a renewable and sustainable material that will ensure
the asphalt industry a sustainable development and lead to a revolutionary
change towards environmentally sound practices and foreign oil independence. The
application of renewable material based bioasphalt for highway and other
infrastructure construction will prompt local economic growth, increase jobs,
and benefit the nation with environmental protection and energy independence.
