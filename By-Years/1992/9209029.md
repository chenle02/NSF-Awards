Deductive databases provide a declarative framework based on first-order logic
for writing queries. Entries in the database define the answer to a query
without indicating how to answer the query. By allowing recursion, deductive
databases yield higher expressive power than classical relational databases. The
two main problems addressed in this project are semantics and optimization. This
research studies semantics for deductive databases extended with aggregate
operators such as ``minimum'' and ``sum.'' Extensions of such semantics to
programs with second-order constructs are also considered. The project is
assessing how effectively second-order features can be incorporated into
present-day relational databases. Optimization techniques for deductive
databases with aggregates, both new techniques and extensions of existing
strategies are also be investigated. This project will contribute fundamental
knowledge about how to provide declarative features, such as aggregation and
second-order constructs, within deductive databases.
