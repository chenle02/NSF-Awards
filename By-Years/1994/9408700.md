This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing award. Three-
dimensional data taken from complex scenes place strong demands on the
robustness and generality of visible surface reconstruction techniques. In this
research a complete reconstruction algorithm will be developed that
distinguishes between surfaces, space curves, and clouds of points based on
asymmetries in point distributions in expanding three-dimensional image
neighborhoods. The properties of this algorithm will be studied analytically and
confirmed experimentally on both synthetic data and range data acquired from a
variety of sensors. The software will be made available to other researchers for
further testing. The goal is to understand fully both the strengths and
weaknesses of the technique. This will provide a solid basis for future research
and will make it easy to evaluate the technique's usefulness for specific
applications. Potential applications range from robotic navigation to reverse
engineering.
