This project is focused on the development, analysis, and empirical testing of
automated methods for load-balancing parallelized discrete-event simulations
that use certain "conservative" synchronization protocols, on distributed memory
parallel architectures. Both static and dynamic methods of load balancing will
be investigated. The algorithms will be evaluated by their performance on large
simulation models of queueing networks, Petri nets, and communication networks,
executed on an Intel iPSC/2 distributed memory multiprocessor. Automated
techniques for load balancing parallel simulations is essential if parallel
simulation is to move out of research labs, and become widely used.
