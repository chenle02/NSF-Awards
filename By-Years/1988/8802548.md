The Committee on Earthquake Engineering was established in 1983 as a continuing
committee within the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National
Research Council. The committee, in its fourth year, successfully completed the
following projects: (1) Recommendations for the Strong-motion Program in the
United States and (2) Review of Phase I of the National Earthquake Engineering
Experimental Facility (NEEEF) Study. In its fifth year of operation, the
committee will continue to oversee the completion of the following three
projects: (1) Earthquake Engineering for Concrete Dams, (2) Seismic Policy
Adoption and Implementation, and (3) Seismic Effects on Large Underground
Structures. The committee also proposes to begin the following two new programs:
(1) U.S.- PRC Earthquake Engineering Program, and (2) Conference on Strategic
Planning to Reduce the Potential Economic Impact of Earthquake Hazard Worldwide.
