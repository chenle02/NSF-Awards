While traditional video-rate applications have required no more than 10-bit
resolution, new applications such as wide-dynamic- range imaging systems require
at least 12-bit resolution. The requirements for such applications exceed the
capabilities of present, state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converters using
CMOS technologies. Progress in this area could dramatically reduce the cost of
signal processing for these applications by allowing the use of digital signal
processing techniques. The objectives of this project are: 1. to create
techniques that can overcome the practical linearity limitations of analog-to-
digital conversion interfaces without an associated loss in conversion rate and
without the use of trimming or calibration, and, 2. to demonstrate these
techniques by fabricating prototypes. The focus of 1. will be on pipelined,
analog-to-digital conversion interfaces in CMOS technologies for high-
resolution, video-rate applications. Circuit techniques that can overcome the
practical linearity limitations will be studied. Since these techniques may
reduce the maximum conversion rate, combinations of parallelism and digital-
signal-processing techniques that have the potential to overcome such a
reduction will be explored.
