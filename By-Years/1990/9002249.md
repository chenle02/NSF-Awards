The principal investigator will study several problems in optimal deterministic
or stochastic control and probability, using the theory of nonlinear partial
differential equations. The project consists of three parts. The optimal control
of a singularly controlled Brownian motion will be studied using the results for
free boundary problems. This approach has yielded regularity results when the
dimension is equal to two and it is the first multi-dimensional result which
yields the construction of the optimal process. It now appears that it can be
generalized to higher dimensions. The second part of this project is devoted to
the perturbation theory of infinite dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As a
case study, the principal investigator will study an asymptotic problem related
to simple exclusion processes. Finally, an application of the finite dimensional
perturbation theory to a problem of production planning is described. The model
to be studied has failure-prone machines, and the goal is to construct
approximate optimal policies by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the
model.
