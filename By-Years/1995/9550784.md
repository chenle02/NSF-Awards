This funding supports the continued development of a program of field-based
instruction and undergraduate research on limnology and Quaternary geology. The
new equipment increases the university's ability to integrate hands-on
activities and research projects into introductory courses, the summer science
program for high school juniors, a planned outreach program for area science
teachers, and selected upper-level courses and improves the opportunities for
undergraduate research projects. The most important use of the equipment is in
introductory courses, which expose the maximum number of students to geology
early in their academic careers. The growing emphasis on field- and research-
based instruction in these courses has improved the learning experience for
students by engaging them in the process of solving local geologic problems
using data that they have collected themselves. Students learn about geologic
materials and the process of scientific investigation through a series of
interrelated exercises. This introduction ultimately provides students with a
familiar reference with which to compare concepts presented in class.
