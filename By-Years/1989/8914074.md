The U.S. - Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research is the third
in a series of joint structural research projects done under the auspices of the
Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects of UJNR. Research in the U.S. began in the
mid-fall of 1985 and is progressing well. The Japanese research began
approximately 18 months earlier and is also in good order. Joint meetings are
held every year, alternating between countries, for the purpose of exchanging
ideas and information to the benefit of both countries. This research project
supports attendance of eight U.S. researchers at the October, 1989, meeting in
Japan. Review of work during the previous year is emphasized. Additional
emphasis will be placed on discussion of formulating design rules based on the
research.
