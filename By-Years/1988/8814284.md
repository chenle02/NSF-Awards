This grant is to support a three-day workshop to define the primary research
issues in Advanced Intelligent Flexible Assembly Systems. The workshop will
identify existing blockages as well as opportunities and strategic directions
for research in this area. The study is expected to provide stimulation to
industries, universities, and U.S. government research agencies in their
collective efforts for the enhancement of the science and technology in Advanced
Intelligent Flexible Assembly Systems. The workshop will be held at the
Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Systems in Cincinnati, Ohio, on September
