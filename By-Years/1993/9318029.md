9318029 Cadoff, E The Robert Wood Johnson Medical School requests support from
NSF for connection of their campus network and affiliates' networks to GES
(JVNCnet). GES is the midlevel network located in the New Jersey. It will
provide operations management and information services and it will give The
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, St. Peter's Medical School, and The Cancer
Institute of New Jersey a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET,
a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits pep second) National Backbone network. The
Schools need greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
