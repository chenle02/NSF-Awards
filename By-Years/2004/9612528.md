ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS 9612528 Principal Investigator: Sarpkaya, Naval
Postgraduate School The objectives of this investigation, involving two
universities, are: (i) To carry out complementary experimental and numerical
research in order to explore the structure and dynamics of vortex breakdown in
turbulent swirling flows; (ii) To elucidate the physics of the phenomena and
provide archival-quality experimental data for the assessment and validation of
CFD codes with anisotropic turbulence models and for current as well as future
scientific and technological developments; (iii) To carefully assess existing
phenomenological models; (iv) To develop an understanding of the consequences of
turbulence on vortex breakdown for its intellectual challenge and technological
applications in aerodynamics, in combustion, and in general, in the development
of effective flow control strategies in devices employing swirl dynamics. It is
intended that this study would lead to reliable computer codes which might be
used for industrial research and design. This grant is for the experimental
component. A matching grant was made to the Utah State University for the
numerical phase (CTS-9613143).
