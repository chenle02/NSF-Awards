The project concerns an augmented hydrostatic extrusion process for the
production of fine wire, less than one mil in diameter, needed for the bonding
of microchips. Results from earlier work led to a detailed understanding of the
factors limiting the productivity of this process and a prototype laboratory
unit has verified the effectiveness of appropriate control procedures in
overcoming these limitations. An integrated system for clean room operation will
be designed. The prototype will demonstrate both the economic advantages of the
augmented hydrostatic extrusion process and the reliability and quality of the
wire produced.
