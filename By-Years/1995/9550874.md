The college is procuring two Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, primarily for
introductory astronomy courses. A 12-inch telescope is being mounted permanently
in an 18-foot dome on top of the Strawbridge Observatory and an 8-inch telescope
is being tripod mounted and is, therefore, portable. By incorporating
observations with these two telescopes, the college is dramatically increasing
the opportunity for its students to observe how astronomy is done, as well as to
learn about the importance of careful scientific observations and measurements.
