Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are structurally similar to carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) with many similar properties such as extraordinarily high mechanical
strength and thermal conductivity. Unlike CNTs, BNNTs have a uniform band gap
(~5.5 eV) that is not sensitive to structural variations. Furthermore BNNTs are
chemically more inert than CNTs, and have a higher resistance to oxidation at
high temperatures. However, there are few research groups in the world capable
of producing high-quality BNNTs. Based on their unique capability in growing
high-quality BNNTs researchers will investigate a scanning chemical vapor
deposition (SCVD) technique. Preliminary tests of the small SCVD system have
demonstrated a 10-fold higher production yield of BNNTs. The yield could
potentially be further improved by 1000-fold with the use of a bigger CVD
system.

If successfully completed, this project may further the use of BNNTs in various
branches of science and engineering, including 1) insulating heat sink materials
for high-performance electronic devices and engines, 2) doped BNNTs for
nanoelectronic and photonic devices without the need of post-synthesis sorting,
3) chemically inert and high performance ceramics/alloys/composites, 4) boron
neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer treatment, 5) drug delivery using
BNNTs.
