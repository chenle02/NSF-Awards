The focus of this project is to improve undergraduate teaching of software
development for massively parallel computers. The instruction will include
communication between processors, programming languages, parallel algorithms,
artificial intelligence, and data structures. Since massively parallel computers
are quite different from traditional sequential machines, it is becoming more
important to introduce massively parallel computing early in students careers. A
1024-processor Distributed Array Processor was acquired to support the teaching
of massively parallel computing, parallel language constructs, artificial
intelligence, and parallel algorithms for computational physics. This project is
significant because it focusses on the early introduction of students to
massively parallel computation, which is rapidly becoming an important area of
computing technology.
