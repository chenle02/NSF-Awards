The PI will conduct laboratory studies, field tests and instrument
intercomparisons to thoroughly characterize the static thermal gradient cloud
chamber technique for the measurement of cloud condensation nuclei. Clearly
establishing the level of capability for routine measurements of cloud
condensation nuclei is a high priority and will enable the routine deployment of
such instruments in future field campaigns designed to investigate the effects
of marine dimethyl sulfide on cloud condensation nuclei and thus on cloud
development and climate.
