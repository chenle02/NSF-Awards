9624698 Zavaliangos The objective of this CAREER development award are to study
the mechanics of densification and the development of residual stresses in
heterogeneous powder mixtures. Emphasis will be placed on the design and
manufacture of functionally gradient materials which constitute a new class of
composites that allow spatial optimization of properties because they are
characterized by a significant variation in composition across a composite.
Beyond instructional activities of course and laboratory development and
outreach activities, the educational plan involves the development of
interactive, media rich computer- aided instruction modules for materials
engineering courses. In addition, it is also intended to establish prototype
paradigms of experimental facilities that can be remotely controlled over a
computer network. ***
