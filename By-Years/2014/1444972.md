The Sixth Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium will take place at Yale University on October
23-26, 2014. It is the latest of a triennial sequence of meetings focusing on
the aspects of analysis, geometry, and partial differential equations originally
explored by Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers and leading to a robust modern theory
with ramifications and connections to many other fields, including dynamics,
topology, mathematical physics and number theory. The field is characterized
today by an interaction between analytic methods, using the tools of classical
calculus and its generalizations, combinatorial ideas in which diagrammatic
patterns are built and studied, and topology in which one studies flexible
spaces and their deformations. The recent solution of a number of guiding
problems and the corresponding introduction of new methods promise that the
conference will be vibrant and forward looking. The organizers plan to attract
and support early-career mathematicians and under-represented minorities, and
hope that the resulting interactions and new connections will reverberate long
after the conference is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten plenary speakers will
discuss recent results in dynamics of rational maps, dynamics of interval
exchanges, Teichmuller theory, harmonic analysis, the structure of automorphism
groups, hyperbolic geometry, probability and Schramm-Loewner evolution, and
others. Parallel sessions with contributed talks will be held broadly in these
areas, where the conference organizers anticipate about 50 speakers. The
