The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel methods for
telecollaboration - remote collaboration that effectively integrates video and
voice communication, computer vision based tracking, and augmented reality
display in order to enable participants to more fully leverage the local
physical environment in their remote interactions. In this telecollaboration
paradigm, remote and local users will interact with the physical environment
using models derived from live imagery from a camera that the local user holds
or wears, rather than merely passively viewing the video stream. A key aspect of
the approach is that it does not require preparation of the environment or model
information, so it can be viewed as an "anywhere, anytime" mobile communication
technology. Intellectual merit: The proposed research builds on promising
preliminary work on telecollaboration showing the effectiveness of world-
stabilized "telepointers" - markers controlled by the remote user that stick to
the real-world referents in a dynamic environment. The project will advance the
state of the art in remote collaboration by providing new capabilities to
integrate real and virtual, verbal and spatial, local and remote. The proposed
developments are needed in order to make the physical space a more fundamental
part of telecollaboration, and significant user studies will be conducted to
acquire a better understanding of the opportunities and limitations of
physically-grounded remote interaction. Broader impacts: Better, more compelling
tools for telecollaboration can have a tremendous impact in terms of
productivity and environmental consequences, as improved remote interaction
reduces the need for physical collocation and thus travel. The educational
impacts of the project include the training and mentoring of graduate students
and a new seminar course. The research team will disseminate research results
and collected data widely and use the developed technologies to provide outreach
opportunities for select groups to participate in lab open houses.
