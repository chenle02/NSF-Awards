9452550 Mulroy Quantitative reasoning, scientific communication skills, and
comprehension of biological concepts are being enhanced by integrating the use
of computers in classrooms, laboratories, and field studies. The computers are
incorporated in introductory and advanced biology courses, and are used by
undergraduates in all phases of independent research projects. Students also
learn statistical concepts, data analysis, and scientific communication in a
biological context. As a result of this project, we expect to graduate students
with greater competence in contemporary technology and in modes of thinking
central to scientific inquiry, including abstract, critical, and quantitative
reasoning.
