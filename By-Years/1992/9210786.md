In accomplishing some tasks, biological visual systems can outperform even the
most sophisticated image processing systems. The goal of this research is to
build optoelectronic circuits which perform some important image sensing and
processing tasks in a somewhat similar manner to the biological visual systems.
The circuits are then not only useful in performing these tasks better than
conventional methods, but also provide a tool of analysis, a level of
abstraction, for the original biological systems. This goal is methodically
pursued by proposing elements of a visual system that are based on a basic model
of ionic conduction in nerve membranes. Processing capabilities of each of the
proposed elements is demonstrated. Next, more sophisticated tasks are proposed
which can be performed by combining these basic elements together. It is argued
that this intelligent control of acquisition of visual data is essential for
real time operation in a complex dynamic world.//
