Calorimetry has been extensively used for the study of physical transformations
and for the investigation of the kinetics of both homogeneous and heterogeneous
chemical reactions. The methods is based upon the colligative properties, where
the heat changes of the reactions are monitored. Calorimetric measurements are
useful in studying catalyst surfaces and polymers. This award from the Chemistry
Instrumentation Program to the Department of Chemistry at Florida International
University, an undergraduate institution, will help acquire a Heat Flux
Calorimeter. The acquisition will enhance the ability of the Department to
educate undergraduate students and will enhance chemical research in the
following areas: 1. Thermodynamic Study of Precursor Complex Stability in Inner
Sphere Electron Transfer Reactions 2. Comparison of Calorimetric and Gas
Chromatographic Measure- ments of the Thermodynamics of Molecular Association in
Liquid Organic Salts 3. Calorimetric Studies on Oligomers Containing B-Z
Junctions 4. Preliminary Studies on the Heat of Metalation of Cyclic
Tetraphyrroles
