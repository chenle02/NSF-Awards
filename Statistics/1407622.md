Statistical analysis of large datasets and complex models is in tremendous
demand, with applications throughout the natural and social sciences,
engineering, business, and biomedicine. A major limitation in meeting this
demand lies in current computational algorithms, which fail to scale adequately
to large problems and data sets. At the same time, advances in computer
processor speeds have slowed dramatically, prompting a shift in the computer
hardware industry towards parallelization. As a result, the demands on Bayesian
computational algorithms are increasing rapidly as the platforms underlying them
are changing. This work explores several promising new directions for producing
highly efficient and scalable algorithms, and corresponding software tools,
suitable for general-purpose Bayesian calculations.

The work involves new directions in Bayesian computation, including (1) true
parallelization of general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers, a class of
algorithms traditionally viewed as "inherently serial," (2) algorithmic and
theoretical advances in "static data" particle-based sequential Monte Carlo
samplers which are highly parallelizable but currently fail on many complex
high-dimensional posterior distributions, and (3) new tools for empirical
monitoring of convergence of Monte Carlo samplers specifically designed for
complex distributions and high-dimensional problem domains. All facets of the
work are directly motivated by applications of Bayesian statistics in chemical
kinetics, structural bioinformatics, and systems biology. This work also has
immediate applicability to problems in broader areas of statistical physics,
computer science, and molecular simulation.
