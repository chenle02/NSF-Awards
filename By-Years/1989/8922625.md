This grant to support the Symposium "Computer-Enhanced Analytical Spectroscopy"
is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield
of computer-based research. This request would provide five beginning untenured
Assistant Professors and faculty from undergraduate institutions the opportunity
to attend and participate in a Symposium on Computer-Enhanced Analytical
Spectroscopy, June 6-8, 1990, in Snowbird, Utah. The goal of this symposium is
to provide a direct interface between analytical spectroscopy and chemometrics.
The aim is to create excitement about contemporary methods at this interface
with the result that these faculty will return to their institutions and be more
effective in conveying this enthusiasm to students who may be swayed towards a
career in science. Selection criteria will include the above point, the quality
of the applicant's teaching and research background, and the possible impact on
improving participation of women and minorities in chemistry.
