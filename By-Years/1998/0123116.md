The project goal is to offer a variety of academic services to low-income
college students from underrepresented groups to enable them to complete a
bachelor's degree and compete in the work force as professionals or continue
graduate studies in computer science or electronic engineering technology. The
services that the project provides to achieve this goal include scholarship
stipends; a program of scholarly activities to prepare students to carry out
research; an individual research project; seminars, and other educational
activities; tutoring; academic counseling; motivational activities; internship
in industry; and activities to assist participants in securing admission to and
financial assistance for enrollment in graduate programs, especially in computer
science and electronics engineering technology. The one-hundred twenty students
selected for the project will be students who are academically talented, have
potential to succeed in their studies, but have not had the opportunity to
develop their talents and potential due to economic and other limitations.
