The PI plans to examine (1) involvement of natural hydrocarbons for the
formation of H2O2 and HCHO in air and (2) liquid phase formation of H2O2 and
organic acids in clouds. Specifically, he will conduct continuous measurements
of formaldehyde and peroxides in the gas phase, in cloud water, and in
precipitation at Whiteface Mountain with concurrent measurements of other key
atmosheric trace gases, including O3, CO, NOy, SO2 and selected hydrocarbons and
trace elements. The goal is to document the chemistry of individual cloud events
and to determine seasonal and air mass specific differences in cloud water
chemical composition. Additionally, the PI plans a limited flight program
focussing on measuring horizontal and vertical profiles for H2O2 and O3 under
clearly defined meteorological conditions in clear and cloudy air, including
airborne cloud water collections. He will also add measurements of other
photochemically important species such as hydroperoxides and other low molecular
carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) as the initial research program
matures.
