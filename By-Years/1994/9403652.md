9403652 Lott The research entails several problems in index theory and analysis
of the spectrum of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds. Topological
questions relating to the index of these operators on possibly singular spaces
will be addressed. The research has potential applications to other areas of
mathematics, quantum theory and solid state physics. ***
