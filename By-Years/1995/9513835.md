9513835 Bahcall This proposal has two main thrusts, string theory and neutrino
astrophysics. String theory is an attempt to move beyond the quantum mechanical
description of elementary particles as point like particles to a formulation of
them as excitations of a microscopic string-like object. These excitations would
include not only quarks, gluons, leptons etc., but also the graviton, the
quantum excitation of gravity so that one would have a truly unified theory. The
ultimate aim of this research is a better and deeper understanding of space-time
and a quantum theory of gravity. The interior of the sun is cooled by the
emission of neutrinos whose interactions are so weak that they can escape from
the surface. By studying the detailed properties of these neutrinos, as seen in
terrestrial detectors, one learns about neutrino properties and about the
interior of the sun. ***
