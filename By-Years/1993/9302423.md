Dr. Michael E. Kort has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kort earned his Ph.D. degree at the University of Wisconsin under
the supervision of Professor Steven Burke. Dr. Kort will continue research at
the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor Andrew
Myers. Dr. Kort's postdoctoral training will provide him skills in advanced
synthetic strategies, manipulation of DNA, and the application of high-field NMR
to organic synthesis. Longer term, Dr. Kort plans to study the stereoselective
synthesis of the enediyne class of anticancer antibiotics. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
