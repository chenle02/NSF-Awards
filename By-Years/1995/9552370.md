This project is enhancing and expanding undergraduate teaching and research
laboratories through the acquisition of a multipurpose rapid-scanning
spectrophotometric system. The system is designed for easy flexibility such that
novel absorbance, fluorescence, and chemiluminescence experiments can all be
performed. Time-resolved absorbance or fluorescence spectroscopy can be done
with or without the stopped-flow attachment. The instrument is intended for
specific laboratory uses in undereraduate laboratory courses including
analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, polymer chemistry, biochemistry, and the organic and inorganic
synthesis laboratories. In addition, the instrument is a valuable addition to
extensive ongoing undergraduate research programs which require fluorescence and
time-resolved kinetic experiments.
