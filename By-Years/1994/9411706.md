9411706 LEE The focus of this study is the weaving culture of Alaska Yup'ik and
Inupiat Eskimo. Practiced continuously for at least a century, coiled basketry
is nonetheless almost completely undocumented. Coiled basketry is a women's art
and as such has been eclipsed by male art forms such as ivory carving and mask-
making. This collaborative Alaska Native study will be a first step in
documenting this art form. The hypothesis that rapid social change negatively
impacts indigenous art forms will be examined as will the role of art in
reinforcing cultural and gender identity in Native Alaska. *** ??
