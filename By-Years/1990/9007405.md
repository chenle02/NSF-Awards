This research is concerned with the genetic architecture of the MSP (major
sperm protein) gene family in Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes. Gene
families appear to be adaptive solutions to the demand that cells produce
certain kinds of proteins in great abundance, and the MSP gene complex is a
paradigm for this evolutionary mode. MSP in C. elegans is coded by 40-50 genes
that occur in four clusters on two chromosomes. Genes within clusters are more
similar in sequence than are genes residing in different clusters. Hypothetical
mechanisms for the evolution of gene families include the "radiation" of
duplicate genes within a cluster from an ancestral gene (in which case
similarity is by descent) and gene conversion in which sequence information is
homogenized within a cluster by unequal crossing over or some comparable
mechanism. The investigator will test these and other hypotheses by comparing
the architecture of the MSP complex between various strains of C. elegans and
other species in the same genus. The mechanisms of gene family evolution are
formulated in terms of population genetics but the comparative methodology, to
include stimating phylogenies for gene families, draws heavily on the principles
of systematic biology, whereas a major goal is to understand the structure of
this important class of eukaryotic genes; thus, this research is truly
interdisciplinary.
