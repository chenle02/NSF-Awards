Intellectual Merit - Coralsnakes represent an extraordinary radiation of highly
venomous, brightly colored snakes that occur through Asia and the Americas. The
phylogenetic relationships of these snakes, however, are poorly known, and their
taxonomy is chaotic. This project will investigate the evolutionary
relationships of coralsnakes through the collection and analysis of a
multigenomic (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA) and morphological character dataset
encompassing nearly all coralsnake taxa. Results will be utilized to guide
taxonomic amendments at the species and genus levels. In addition to resolving
the currently chaotic state of coralsnake taxonomy, this work will explore
theoretical and practical issues of combining and analyzing diverse phylogenetic
characters to solve systematic questions. Also, this work will provide a strong
evolutionary framework for future coralsnake research and establish a rich
morphological and molecular database for coralsnakes from which to launch future
studies on natural history, mimicry, venom evolution, therapeutics, and clinical
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - Undergraduate and graduate
students from several countries (including students from underrepresented groups
in science) will be trained in collection and analysis of molecular and
morphological data. The project will forge strong collaborative networks and
partnerships in diverse countries (in Asia and Latin America), whereby
collaborators will participate in increasing taxonomic sampling, morphological
and molecular data collection, and manuscript preparation. A multilingual
website will be erected to provide general information about coral snakes,
taxonomic updates, available research results and publications, unpublished
supplemental data, an index of coral snake researchers, and be used to attract
additional collaboration and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
