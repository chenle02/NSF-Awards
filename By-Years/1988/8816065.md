This award provides a portion of the funds required to purchase a computer,
printer and plotter system. The system will be installed and operated in the
Edmund C. Leach Nuclear Science Center at Auburn University. The University will
provide the remaining funds required for the purchase of the computer system.
The equipment is needed for research projects involving geological samples that
require neutron activation analyses of trace elements. The equipment will be
used to record and analyze multichannel spectra collected in the gamma ray
counting laboratory provided by the Nuclear Science Center.
