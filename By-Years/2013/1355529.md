The proposed activity investigates the commercial potential of self-adaptive,
ultra-low modulus alloys for biomedical implants and other technological
applications. The proposed technology offers a solution to complications caused
by the mismatch in elastic modulus between human bone and alloys used in
conventional medical implants that lead to the loss of bone quality, possible
loosening of the implant, and the reduced resistance of the bone to fracture
from accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology offers
unprecedented advantages for orthopedic and dental implants. Considering the
notable increase in the number of orthopedic implants every year and the need
for longer lifetime implants due to continued increase in life expectancy and
ever-decreasing age of patients receiving implants, the improvement in implant
lifetime and reliability offered by the proposed technology has potential to
significantly reduce both the probability of disabling injuries from accidents
and the frequency and necessity for revision surgeries.
