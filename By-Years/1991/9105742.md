In this project, the PI's will maintain a project office for the US component of
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). During the operational phase of
WOCE, the office will provide assistance to the Interagency Panel, and staff
support for the US Science Steering Committee and its subcommittees, and
individual scientists. The principal tasks involve communication, both among US
PI's and with the International Project Office, the Data Information Unit, and
the WOCE Hydrographic Program Office. Annual budget requests for the entire US
WOCE program and annual updates to the US WOCE Implementation Plan will be made.
