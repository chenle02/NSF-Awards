9352613 Cordes The project involves upgrading a lab course in astronomy that
gives students the opportunity to work with state of the art optical and radio
astronomy equipment. Work to be done includes the upgrade of existing equipment
to improve performance and allow experiments and observations to be performed
more efficiently and purchase and construction of new equipment to allow new
kinds of observations on astrophysical masers and neutron stars. The signal
processing component of the course is being strengthened considerably. Students
are able to measure neutral hydrogen from neighboring galaxies for comparison
with the rotation curve of our own galaxy. In pulsar observations, students
learn about time-transfer technology, dispersive propagation in plasmas, and the
rotations of neutron stars. Maser observations teach students about coherent
radiation mechanisms. Students are taking part in some of the construction of
new equipment, interfacing of equipment to computers, and writing of software.
