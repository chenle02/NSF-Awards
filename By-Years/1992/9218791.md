New analytical approaches have made possible the high quality, reproducible
18O/16O analysis of diatom silica. These techniques could be applied to
diatomaceous sediments from oceanic and lacustrine environments to obtain
detailed information on paleoclimate and climate change. However, some evidence
suggest that the fractionation of oxygen isotopes between biogenic opal and
water may be kinetically controlled. If so, diatom 18O may depend partly on the
silicic acid content of the water from which diatoms extract their silica.
Because the silica concentration of ancient lakes and seas would seldom be
known, a silicic-acid dependence--if on exists--could diminish the precision of
an otherwise promising paleothermometer. In this investigation, marine and
lacustrine diatoms will be cultured to learn whether their 18O depends on the
silicic acid content of the environmental water. A kinetic fractionation model
will be developed if a dependence is found. Diatom silica is valuable source of
information having application to paleohydrologic studies.
