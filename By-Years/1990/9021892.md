This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office to Ball State University provides funds for the
repair and renovation of the Cooper Physical Building which houses that
institution's research and research training activities in chemistry. This
building was constructed in 1965 and last renovated in 1978. The ARFMP grant of
$120,000 and $142,879 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities of the Department of
Chemistry. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the quality of research
that can be conducted by providing larger, more efficient fume hoods and an
upgraded ventilation system. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical
synthesis research and for the training of quality undergraduate students in a
department with a particular commitment to increasing the number of minority and
nontraditional majors graduated.
