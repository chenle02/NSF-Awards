Robert Pecora is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research involving motions in liquid and
polymer systems. A variety of light scattering techniques are used such as
Fabry-Perot interferometry and photocorrelation spectroscopy as well as total
intensity light scattering and transient electric birefringence decay. The
dynamics of both dilute and nondilute solutions of rigid and semirigid rodlike
molecules including polypeptides, collagen, small rodlike protein,
oligonucleotides, and DNA fragments will be studied. The effect of interaction
and entanglement will be investigated, and the nature of slow modes will be
elucidated. A model composite liquid has been developed which consists of small
coated silica spheres and a rigid polymer immersed in a solvent. This system
will also be studied by dynamic light scattering and transient electric
birefringence decay. Composite liquids are a ubiquitous class of materials which
contain polymer, particles and solvent. They are used as ceramic precursors,
lubricants, paints and coatings, adhesives, and in chromatographic columns. Due
to their complexity and the lack of adequate model systems, the interactions
between the species in such systems are not well understood. Pecora has
constructed a model rod/sphere composite liquid whose dynamics can be studied
over a wide range of composition of both the rods and the spheres using an
experimental technique known as dynamic light scattering.
