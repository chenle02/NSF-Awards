A series of studies is proposed jointly between the University of Georgia and
the Guangdong Rice Research Institute on determining how photosynthesis has been
increased in a new hybrid rice developed in China. On-going experiments in China
indicate that the utilization of photosynthetic heterosis in a hybrid rice, from
a US high-light adapted ecotype crossed with a South China low-light adapted
ecotype, is a promising approach to increasing photosynthesis, broadening
environmental adaptability, and increasing productivity. In this project,
coordinated studies will be conducted to compare a hybrid rice (Le/Qi) and its
parents to determine how photosynthesis has been modified. Portions of the work
will be conducted at three sites -- Georgia, Arkansas, and China.
