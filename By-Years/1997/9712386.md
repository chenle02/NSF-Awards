This research explores a new two-dimensional distributed actuator system for
transporting a human body on a flat, compliant surface by generating periodic
waves on a bed surface. An array of fiber actuators made of NiTi Shape- memory
alloy (SMA) are woven into a bed mattress, and periodic surface waves are
created by coordinating the SMA fiber actuators that move the individual coil
springs in both vertical and horizontal directions. This active surface system
allows transfer of a bedridden patient between a bed and a chair without lifting
the patient. It also provides assistance to the patient for changing his/her
position or posture in the bed to prevent bedsores. In this project, kinematic
and static behavior of the active surface system interacting with the human body
will be analyzed; optimal wave forms for transporting the human body comfortably
and efficiently will be obtained; control algorithms for moving the human body
and changing its posture will be developed based on the estimate of the body
posture; and the design and control guidelines for reducing the complexity of
the distributed actuator system will be addressed.
