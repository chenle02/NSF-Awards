The electric and electronic properties of insulators are difficult to measure
by conventional methods which apply metal contacts to the insulator surfaces. A
new technique has shown great potential. It enables determination of contact-
free, previously unmeasurable fundamental properties of materials, especially of
materials with very low charge carrier concentrations and of semiconductors. The
technique consists of measuring the dielectric polarization in an electric field
gradient. By deconvoluting the various components of the dielectric
polarization, bulk and surface contributions can be separated. Thus, unique
information is obtained about surface charges, their sign and density as well as
their associated internal field. The method is also highly sensitive to changes
in the bulk polarization such as may be caused by the dissociation of defects
and generation of mobile charges. By applying a static electric field gradient
and measuring the response as a function of time, processes with long relaxation
times, of the order of seconds to hours, can be evaluated. Such processes may be
due to charge carriers with very low drift mobilities which, however, may play
an important part in determining the long-term stability of electronic devices
or ferroelectrics. The objective of the research is to develop a Charge
Distribution Probe which allows one to perform measurements with high spatial
resolution and determine the electronic properties of thin insulator layers.
