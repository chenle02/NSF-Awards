ABSTRACT

OCE-0133160

A PI from Georgia Institute of Technology will use MRPG funds to study the
distribution, transport and behavior of 37Cs in the Savannah Estuary. The goal
of this project is to ascertain whether sediments in estuaries are a permanent
sink for naturally-occurring and anthropogenic radionuclides. About 20 sediment
cores will be collected in this estuary along with some samples from nearby
riverine and marine environments to obtain "endpoints". Samples will be analyzed
for 37Cs, major cations, trace metals, mineralogy and grain size. The PI also
will analyze her samples for 210Pb, 226Ra, 234Th and 7Be to identify the
dominant physical transport processes affecting sediments in the Savannah
Estuary.
