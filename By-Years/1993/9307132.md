9307132 Mayden This research involves a detailed phylogenetic study of North
American cyprinid fishes using a combination of morphological features and
nucleotide sequences of mitochondria ribosomal genes. This phylogeny will be
used to establish a stable classification of these fishes and to examine
patterns of morphological, ecological, and behavioral diversity within this
important group of fishes. %%% Cyprinid fishes form a major component of aquatic
ecosystems in North America, representing nearly 30% of the fish fauna.
Therefore, it is important to understand the biological diversity of this group.
A more reliable understanding of the relationships of these fishes will
contribute greatly to our understanding of the biogeography, ecology, and
behavior of this important group of fishes. In addition, this research will help
identify unique populations and species, a requisite for any management scheme
directed toward the conservation of aquatic ecosystems in North America.
