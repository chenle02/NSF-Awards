The University of Michigan College of Engineering is collaborating with the
University's Center for the Education of Women in designing and conducting this
model project to address the problem of "the higher the fewer." Efforts are
being made to increase the participation of women in engineering careers through
testing, evaluation and dissemination of a program for undergraduate women
designed to encourage their entry into and completion of graduate study.
Involved is a comprehensive set of activities, starting in the junior year and
continuing through the senior year. The activities include seminars focusing on
graduate school and career issues in engineering; research internships; support
and discussion groups designed to address work and family concerns and related
personal issues; and the preparation of symposia, funding applications and
research prospectuses.
