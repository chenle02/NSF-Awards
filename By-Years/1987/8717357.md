This grant supports development and application of an experimental design model
to identify the system parameters of the Chi Chi Basin aquifer in Taiwan. This
cooperative project between Drs. Wen-sen Chu, University of Washington, and
Robert Willis, Humboldt State University, and Dr. Y.S. Tsao, National Taiwan
University, will focus on the Chi Chi Basin, an important agricultural center in
southwestern Taiwan. The study will identify an optimal set of experimental
conditions for the identification of the hydraulic parameters and boundary
conditions of the Basin. Following formulation and application of the
experimental design model, baseline information on the performance of the model
under actual field conditions will be gathered and analyzed.
