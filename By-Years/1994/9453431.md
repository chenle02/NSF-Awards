9453431 Gleiser This project is aimed at studying the interface between high-
energy particle physics and cosmology by examining in detail the dynamics of
phase transitions in the early universe. The study of such systems both in and
out of equilibrium involves both analytical and numerical methods to understand
the approach to equilibrium and the nature of phase transitions in field
theories. The project also has potential overlap with topics in condensed matter
physics, such as liquid crystals and binary fluid mixtures. ***
