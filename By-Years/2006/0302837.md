Potential flow approximation or assuming zero vorticity does not necessarily
require making an inviscid approximation. In most cases, the effect of viscosity
in potential flow is negligible and not important. However, in the cases
outlined by the PI, the viscous effect may have subtle but significant
consequences. The Pi has pioneered the investigation of what he refers to as the
viscous potential flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be important in
cavitation of liquids near capillary collapse (the phenomena under active
investigation in the physics community), supercavitation and stress induced
cavitation, and other areas such at acoustic effects.&lt;br/&gt;
