Dr. Schepartz proposes to use a new technique - protein affinity cleavage - to
analyze the mechanism of protein folding. The method requires the synthesis of
bifunctional molecules which contain a protein-cleaving reagent covalently
tethered to a protein-binding ligand. Once the ligand is bound the hydroxyl
radical is loosed to allow cleavage in the neighborhood of the active site.
Analysis of the sites of peptide cleavage will help elucidate the active site
and surround to a resolution of single amino acids. It is claimed to be superior
in this regard to other techniques, such as affinity labeling experiments. The
results from this study promise to provide evidence for this claim and should
give interesting data on the peptidy-prolyl isomerase enzymes which will be
studied.
