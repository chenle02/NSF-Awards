This is a continuation of the research program at the University of
Massachusetts on the computer modeling of advanced semiconductor devices. A
specific objective is to extend the state-of-the-art of the numerical modeling
of heterojunction semiconductor devices for high speed and/or high frequency
applications. Over the past twelve years, we have modeled semiconductor devices
ranging from large VMOS power transistors to submicron permeable base
transistors (PBT) in our laboratory. In view of recent interest in high speed
heterojunction transistors such as HEMT (high electron mobility transistors) and
HBT (heterojunction bipolar transistors), it is natural to extend our research
to the modeling of semiconductor devices involving heterojunctions. Focus will
be placed on the AlGaAs/GaAs system but the InGaP/GaAs heterojunction and the
InGaAs/GaAs strained-layer heterojunction may be included as well, time
permitting. The basic heterojunction GaAs structures to be modeled are vertical
devices such as HBTs. Hot carrier transport in the graded base region of these
devices will be investigated. Both transient and small-signal ac drift-diffusion
analysis will be performed to accurately determine the unit-current gain cutoff
frequency.
