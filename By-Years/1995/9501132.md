PI: Bahri DMS-9501132 Bahri will investigate questions arising in dynamical
systems, nonlinear partial differential equations and geometry. These include
collisions and existence of periodic orbits on 3-body type, the existence of
infinitely many elliptic and infinitely many hyperbolic orbits on a given energy
surface, the Weinstein conjecture and pseudo-orbits of contact forms, and the
superlinear elliptic problem. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations.
