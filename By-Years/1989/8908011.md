This is an interdisciplinary travel grant award to provide partial support for
American scientists attending the XIVth International Conference on
Photochemistry which will be held in Beijing from August 21 through 26, 1989.
The local host will be the Institute of Photographic Chemistry of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. This Conference will provide an opportunity for American
photochemists to meet, interact and perhaps establish collaborative
relationships with their Chinese counterparts. Four established American
scientists will be plenary speakers in each of three Sino-American minisymposia
dealing with physical photochemistry and spectroscopy, organic photochemistry,
and photosynthesis. Funds are provided for trans-Pacific airfare for the
speakers and for registration and partial lodging expenses for 15 other American
photochemists.
