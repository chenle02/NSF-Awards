9452697 Goldberg Occidental College seeks to initiate a four week summer
residential Young Scholars project in mathematics for 32 students in the
northeast Los Angeles area entering grades eight through ten. The recruitment
area is the attendance regions of the eleven public high schools nearest the
College. Most students are minority group members. Students will actively
participate in the process of mathematical development: seeking patterns,
formulating conjectures, reasoning, writing and speaking. Problems will be
chosen from areas of discrete mathematics. Students will use personal
programmable graphing calculators. Computer and science laboratory experiences
will complement mathematics workshops. Academic year follow-up activities will
include class, lectures, career and college admission workshops, field trips,
and Science Fair participation. Local scientists, engineers and other
professionals will visit the students. ***
