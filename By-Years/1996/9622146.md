9622146 Reimanis This Research Equipment Grant will allow the Center for
Advanced Ceramics at the Colorado School of Mines to purchase a high vacuum hot
press which is essential for several research projects in Ceramic Engineering
and in Materials Science. This equipment is clearly needed by the investigator
to develop fully-dense ceramics for research studies on ceramics and composites.
The research studies on ceramic synthesis and metal/ceramic functionally graded
materials are important and novel research topics. PI has a strong record of
quality research and has demonstrated competence in his studies of the failure
of ceramics. In addition to research studies the equipment will be available to
undergraduate students for educational purposes. The institutional cost-share of
50% of the project costs will come from a State of Colorado capital equipment
grant for the renovation and construction of the Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering building at the Colorado school of Mines. ***
