The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will help
satisfy the growing demand in 3D capturing technology primarily caused by the
need for photorealistic content for 3D applications, and better computer vision
solutions for autonomous machinery. Additionally, for researchers and
conservationists, 3D capturing is a way to preserve precious artifacts and study
them without endangering of permanently losing them during transportation or due
to natural deterioration. For retailers and designers, low cost accurate 3D
representations of products are needed for virtual reality (VR) and augmented
reality (AR) applications that open new possibilities to connect with their
customers. Finally, as display makers continue to improve upon light field (LF)
displays, LF image and video will potentially become mainstream and a pipeline
will need to exist to capture, compress, and stream this new form of
media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes a specialized computer
numerical control camera and compression algorithms to record multiple photos of
an object or a scene and based on this raw data to construct light field (LF)
images which preserve the complex interactions between the lights and the
surfaces in the scene. This project develops compression and reconstruction
algorithms that exploit the redundant information found in LF images while also
allowing quick decompression on viewing devices (applicable for web, virtual
reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR)). The 3D content (object or scene) can
then be viewed with six degrees of freedom and in stereovision. This provides a
complete solution to capture a generic object regardless of shape and material
in a portable 3D format without manual post-editing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
