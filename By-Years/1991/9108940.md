This proposal s to develop a new way of estimating blood flow distribution
across a plane using wideband ultrasound. The work will compare the spatial and
velocity resolutions that can be obtained using different estimation techniques.
A simple flow- model will then be used to compare the theoretical predictions
with experimental data. If successful, the work will result in improved
technology for generation two-dimensional color images of blood flow. The long
term outcome should be better diagnosis of vascular diseases.
