9522728 Smith Gasoline is produced through a costly and complex chemical process
which relies heavily on sulfuric acid to convert less desirable alkenes to more
productive high octane components. The acid is expensive in itself, and
monitoring the acid concentrations to ensure peak performance is currently a
rigorous task, compounding time and expenses. This research is to develop a
diode laser-based, full-spectrum Raman scattering instrument prototype to safely
and precisely monitor the required acid concentrations and reduce the cost of
gasoline production. Fiber optic-coupling will allow for safe remote monitoring,
and an inexpensive CCD array will offer full spectrum capabilities that can
reduce or eliminate lag time. Maintenance of this system will also be reduced in
comparison to other sample handling systems. The successful development of this
instrument will allow for rapid, continuous on-line and remote monitoring of the
sulfuric acid concentration in the presence of hydrocapbons. This will minimize
the use of excess acid in the production of gasoline, and therefore reduce
material expenses, as well as the related costs of transportation and handling.
