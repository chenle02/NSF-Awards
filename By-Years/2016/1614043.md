Macroscopic physics is deterministic, with predictability limited only by the
intrusion of chaos. Conversely, microscopic physics is widely thought to be
intrinsically probabilistic, the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics a
complete description of the microscopic world. A decade ago, Yves Couder and co-
workers in Paris discovered the first quantum analog system. The system,
consisting of millimeter-sized droplets self-propelling along the surface of a
vibrating fluid bath, represents a macroscopic realization of the pilot-wave
mechanics proposed by Louis de Broglie in the 1920s for microscopic quantum
particles. The fact that this hydrodynamic system exhibits quantum-like
statistical behavior raises the question as to whether there really is a
qualitative difference between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. The
investigators explore this question by studying the potential and limitations of
this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analogue. Graduate students are involved
in the work of the project.

The walking-droplet system raises a number of fascinating new mathematical
questions concerning the dynamics and statistics of wave-particle systems in
which a particle generates a wave field, then moves in response to it. The
investigator and co-investigator have developed a theoretical framework for
describing this system, a hierarchy of mathematical models of increasing
sophistication that have been carefully benchmarked against experiment. The
project is directed towards rationalizing the stability of single- and multiple-
droplet static and dynamic states by analyzing, extending and adapting these
models. Specifically, we analyze the stability of both steady and periodic
solutions to the model equations. Particular attention is given to rationalizing
the interactions of multiple droplets of equal or unequal size, pairs and
lattices, which are known to exhibit a variety of novel dynamical bound states
and instabilities. New rationale for the behavior of single and multiple
droplets is sought through an energetic analysis, by assessing the relative
magnitudes of the global energies of the accessible solutions of the model
equations. Theoretical developments are guided and constrained by a supporting
experimental program conducted in parallel in MIT's Applied Math Laboratory.
