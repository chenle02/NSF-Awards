9311621 Tseng This research comprises two parts. The first part concerns the
study of certain error bounds for nonlinear programs, complementarity and
variational inequality problems, and the solution of convex inclusions. Roughly
speaking, an error bound is a bound on the distance from a point to the solution
set that depends only on some error function evaluated at that point. The
investigation will focus on, though not restricted to, error bounds in which the
error function is related to the solution set. Such error bounds are of interest
because they are the key to analyzing, under minimal assumptions on the problem,
the rate of convergence of iterative methods based on fixed point iterations.
The second part of the research concerns the design and the convergence analysis
of iterative methods using the above error bounds. The methods to be studied
include the gradient projection algorithm of Goldstein and of Levitin and
Polyak, coordinate descent methods, the proximal point algorithm, operator-
splitting methods, the affine-scaling algorithm for semi-finite linear
programming, and new methods motivated by error bounds. ***
