This project is developing and disseminating a set of modern lab exercises in
observational astronomy. These lab exercises employ modern electronic imaging
detectors (CCDs) and computers to acquire images of a wide variety of
astronomical objects, including the Moon, planets, the Sun, stars, nebulae and
galaxies. Introductory students will measure brightness and sizes of the imaged
objects to gain an understanding of our universe, as well as experience the
techniques of modern observational astronomy. These newly developed lab
exercises are being disseminated to other universities and colleges via site
visits at which the equipment and procedures are demonstrated. There is a
network of users of this type equipment allowing the exchange of ideas,
astronomical images and instructional techniques.//
