Integrated electronic circuits (ICs) today are ubiquitous in that they affect
every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from use within all forms of mobile
devices (smart phones, laptops, etc.) to all modes of transportation (cars,
aircraft, etc.). Advances in electronics also form the foundation for the recent
and forthcoming advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence,
autonomous vehicles, etc. The research work stemming from the project will aid
the continued advancement of the electronic semiconductor industry by helping
leading companies ensure that electronics work properly and reliably over long
time periods. Additionally, the research conducted will include undergraduate
student researchers, and the results will be disseminated to the research
community, and incorporated into post-secondary
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will specifically examine how
electronic failures are modeled, and for any shortcomings discovered, new models
that are more accurate will be developed. While it is widely known that model
effectiveness greatly depends on the IC and its fabrication, it is not known
which models will be proven ineffective beforehand. In addition, especially for
cutting-edge technologies, it is expected that there also will be a need for
new, more accurate fault models for state-of-the-art ICs. Therefore, the
objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive data-driven methodology
for the continuous evaluation and development of fault models. Data from failed
ICs will be analyzed to understand the likelihood and types of failures. For the
expected mismatch between existing models and measured data, new models will be
proposed and evaluated. Successfully meeting the objective of this research
would will enable IC manufacturers to produce more reliable ICs at much lower
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
