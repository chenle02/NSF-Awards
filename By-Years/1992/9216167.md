This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California in the purchase
of an x-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode source and low temperature
capability. Research areas to be supported by the acquisition of this instrument
are: 1. X-ray diffraction studies of long lived carbocation salts. 2. Reactions
of hydrocarbons in the coordination sphere of soluble metal complexes. 3.
Structural coordination chemistry. 4. Structure analysis of metal hydrides and
other compounds by x-ray and neutron diffraction. 5. Study of the relationships
between structure, reactivity and energetics in organometallic complexes. 6.
Synthetic organic, bioorganic and organometallic chemistry. %%% An x-ray
diffractometer is an instrument used to measure the precise structure of a
chemical compound, or molecule. Distances between the atoms in a molecule are
measured to a precision of about 0.1 picometers (there are 1,000,000,000,000
picometers in one meter; one meter is about three feet). X-ray diffraction
measurements also give precise information about the relative location and
orientation of a given molecule to the other neighboring molecules in the single
crystal.
