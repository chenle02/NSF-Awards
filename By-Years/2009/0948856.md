This project preserves and provides access to the image data associated with the
ClueWeb09 dataset. The ClueWeb09 dataset was created by the PI in early 2009 to
support research on the web, information retrieval, and related human language
technologies. The dataset contains the texts of about 1 billion of the most
important web pages written in ten major languages. The dataset was adopted
quickly by the research community: 55 copies were licensed in the first 3 months
of availability, and it was used in 4 out of 7 tracks of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) 2009 TREC evaluation of information
retrieval research.
