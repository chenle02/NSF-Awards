This award will provide funds to partially support the 21st annual Conference
Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting
of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held jointly
with the Physical Society of Japan in Waikoloa, Hawaii October 23 - 27, 2018.
The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research
experience to present the results of their research and interact with other
students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely
successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad
introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable
senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial
support will be provided for approximately 26 undergraduate students, out of a
planned total of 136.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
