This is a fundamental engineering study pertaining to the in vitro growth of
cartilage. The successful completion of this project will require cooperation
among engineers, cellular physiologists and biochemists. The importance of this
topic as an emerging engineering technology can not be over stated. Living
cartilage tissue grown in vitro will have an enormous impact upon the
replacement of defective body parts. This research will induce a known strain
upon a section of cartilage grown in vitro and test the cartilage for the
synthesis of important molecules related to its structure and/or function. This
fundamental study should lead to the production of various forms of cartilage
that could ultimately be used for transplantation.
