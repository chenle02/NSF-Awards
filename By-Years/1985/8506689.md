Techniques for direct observations of non-equilibrium superconductivity
phenomena are developed. A novel, non-equilibrium superheating effect is
observed and characterized. The normal-to-superconducting relaxation in the sub-
nanosecond regime is measured. Dispersive microstriplines are characterized and
light interaction with Josephson junctions is studied. Planned research
activities include the study of transient non-equilibrium effects in
superconducting microstrips and tunnel junctions; the continuation of the
development of the cryosampler, especially the adaptation of gallium-arsenide
material for the sampler; the investigation of fluxon dynamics in Josephson
transmission lines; and the study of the feasibility of a novel superconducting
field effect transistor that uses the magneto-electric effect.
