Professor Miguel Garcia-Garibay, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
at the University of California at Los Angeles, is supported by the Organic
Dynamics Program for his studies of the ground state and photochemical
reactivity of triplet carbenes in the crystalline solid state. Carbenes are
generated photochemically by extrusion of molecular nitrogen within crystals of
their arylalkyldiazo precursors. Specific substrates are chosen to allow the
investigation of intramolecular 1,2-hydride and 1,2-phenyl migrations as well as
hydrogen abstractions. Professor Garcia-Garibay examines the correlation between
solid-state structural aspects of the precursors and reaction trajectories of
the resultant carbenes, studying both the energetics of the reaction processes
and their potential application in the synthesis of organic compounds through
stereoselective solid-state carbene rearrangements. Although the chemistry of
carbon compounds, forming the basis of organic chemistry, is dominated by the
preference of this element to form bonds to four other elements, compounds in
which carbon is bonded to only two other elements are also known. These so-
called carbenes, which arise as intermediates in a number of important chemical
transformations, display a variety of intriguing properties, including high
reactivity and a propensity to undergo molecular rearrangements. Professor
Garcia-Garibay harnesses the chemistry of these reactive carbenes by generating
them within crystalline hosts, thereby permitting the physical and chemical
examination of their structures and chemical reactions. These studies address
both fundamental issues regarding the chemistry of carbenes and practical issues
regarding the use of carbenes in the controlled synthesis of important organic
compounds.
