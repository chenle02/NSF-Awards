This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a modern ratio mass
spectrometer that will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology
and Geophysics at the University of Utah. The University of Utah is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for this purchase. The new mass
spectrometer will replace a fourteen-year old spectrometer which is obsolete and
does not provide the analytical capabilities to solve modern research problems.
Specifically, the new spectrometer system will allow the analysis of very small
gas samples, a feature required by a growing number of research projects
undertaken by the Principal Investigator, colleagues, and students at the
University of Utah.
