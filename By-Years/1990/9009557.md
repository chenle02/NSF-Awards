The proposed work is to design and initiate a research program to investigate
the detailed sedimentology and hydrodynamics of tidal creeks along the Georgia
coast. The approach will be a quantitative analysis of low processes and
sedimentation, which is especially important because few existing facies models
accurately explain fluvial to marine transitional deposits in terms of modern
processes. A research program will be developed in modern coastal environments
that will lead to better three-dimensional models useful for interpreting the
ancient sedimentary record. Specifically this research will lead to better
understanding of the mechanisms that control evolution of tidal creek-salt marsh
ecosystems and how they are preserved in the geologic record.
