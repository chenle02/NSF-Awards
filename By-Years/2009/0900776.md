Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Shlyakhtenko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposal is
to study connections between four areas of mathematics: von Neumann algebras;
subfactor theory; free probability theory and random matrix theory. The main
tools for the proposed research come from a synthesis of ideas from these four
subjects. This involves free stochastic analysis and the theory of square-
integrable cohomology in free probability theory; Popa's deformation-rigidity
theory in von Neumann algebras; combinatorial structure of random matrices
related to random multi-matrix models with a potential; and the planar algebra
approach to subfactor theory, as pioneered by Jones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
of the four areas mentioned above are amazingly rich mathematically. For
example, Jones' subfactor theory has led to the discovery of a novel knot
invariant, which has uses in diverse areas of mathematics and beyond (including
the study of structure of DNA). Research in random multi-matrix models has
engineering applications such as cell phone design. The focus of the present
research is on the interplay between these four areas with the aim towards
developing tools and techniques that are likely to impact all of the areas
involved.&lt;br/&gt;
