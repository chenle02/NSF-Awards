For the past decade, The University of Texas--Pan American has sponsored the
Hispanic Engineering, Science and Technology (HESTEC) Week to promote STEM
careers to students in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, a predominantly
Hispanic area of the United States, and to reach out to the community at large.
With National Science Foundation support, HESTEC will partner with an NSF-funded
Science and Technology Center, Colorado State University Center for Multiscale
Modeling of Atmospheric Processes, to provide professional development for
teachers (Educator Day), hands-on science activities for middle school students
(Middle School Challenge), and science shows and experiment stations for the
entire community (Community Day). NSF support will permit students and staff
from CMMAP to bring its Little Shop of Physics to HESTEC, where the hand-on
science activities will reach an estimated 68 educators, up to 4000 middle
school students, and thousands of community visitors. UTPA undergraduates will
work directly with CMMAP staff and their students to operate the demonstrations
and to engage the HESTEC participants. The Little Shop of Physics was awarded
the Robert A. Millikan Medal by the American Associate of Physics Teachers in
2001. The program has reached 250,000 students in schools throughout the
Colorado region and now has a prominent place at HESTEC.
