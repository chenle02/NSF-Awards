0138697&lt;br/&gt;Dorfman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be
devoted to further studies on the foundation&lt;br/&gt;of the theory of
irreversible processes in fluid systems. Such processes&lt;br/&gt;include
viscous and thermal flows as well as diffusive motion,
chemical&lt;br/&gt;reactions, in both classical and quantum systems. Recent work
by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and co-workers has shown that for most systems of interest,
there is an&lt;br/&gt;underlying chaotic dynamics which can be viewed as the
source of the&lt;br/&gt;irreversibility. The sensitivity of the motion of a
chaotic system of&lt;br/&gt;particles to the precise values of the initial
conditions of the particles&lt;br/&gt;reflects itself as an apparent randomness
in the dynamics of the system.&lt;br/&gt;Current research is devoted to a study
of entropy production and related&lt;br/&gt;irreversible phenomena in
classically chaotic systems, as well as to the&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical
versions of the systems and their processes. This&lt;br/&gt;latter direction is
stimulated in part by recent work by many authors on&lt;br/&gt;the quantum
behavior of classically chaotic systems which can be&lt;br/&gt;fruitfully
applied to a study of irreversibility in quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt; Finally,
work will be carried out to determine the analogous&lt;br/&gt;properties of non-
chaotic systems, or of mixed chaotic and non-chaotic&lt;br/&gt;systems, with
transport to study the modifications of the theory needed to&lt;br/&gt;treat
such systems, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
