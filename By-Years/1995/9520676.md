POWER 9520676 The proposed research will link patterns of genetic variability in
barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) with ecological interactions between the BYDV,
and the virus' grass hosts and aphid vectors. We will measure genetic
variability using serological and sequencing surveys of natural virus
populations. Ecological interactions will be assessed with greenhouse
experiments designed to distinguish between two ecological hypotheses explaining
genetic structure in populations of the virus: genetic subdivision occurs as a
result of different colonization opportunities for the virus or genetic
subdivision reflects variability in the probability of a colonization resulting
in a new infection. This research will improve our understanding of ecological
factors affecting the evolution and epidemiology of barley yellow dwarf, a major
disease of crop plants, and contribute to our understanding of the ecology of
plant pathogens in natural communities. It will aid in management of this
disease by providing information about the relative importance of different wild
host species as sources of virus inoculum for crop plants.
