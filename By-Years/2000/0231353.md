Physics reform efforts are changing classroom instruction, but administrative
mechanics have had limited impact on homework. Web-based homework offers a
partial solution, but is limited by types of responses available, and student
drawings and graphs are especially problematic. This project is creating a set
of flexible, modular Java applets for drawing simple graphs and diagrams. These
self-grading applets can work with most web-based homework systems as well as
standard HTML pages, enabling the use of new classes of exercises. The PI and
undergraduate students are developing a complete set of exercises using these
applets to accompany a standard introductory physics curriculum within a widely
used web homework system and HTML pages. The project is also investigating usage
patterns, sources of difficulties, and effectiveness with assessment as an
integral part of the project. Dissemination is via the Internet, web-homework
systems, conference talks, and workshops.

Intellectual merit: these applets simultaneously solve significant difficulties
with both physics curricular reform efforts and web-based homework using widely
available technology.

Broader impact: these applets have clear applications beyond introductory
physics to math, chemistry, engineering and any areas where graphs, vectors,
tables and equations are used. The availability of exercises can help to
encourage and assist instructors who teach in a traditional style to incorporate
more research-based methods and activities in their classroom.

Teacher preparation: Undergraduate students who are future high school physics
teachers are an integral part of this project.
