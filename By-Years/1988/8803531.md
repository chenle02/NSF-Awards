System identification (SID) technique is applied to determine structural
properties such as the mass, damping, and stiffness from the structure response
records of the October 1987 Whittier earthquakes. The objectives are: (1)
prediction of the structural response to future earthquakes, (2) to detect the
structural damage, and (3) to study the nonlinear system effect. These efforts
would help to develop the nonlinear SID techniques suitable for applications in
earthquake design.
