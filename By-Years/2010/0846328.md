ctual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed microfluidics system uniquely
allows examination of a combinations of factors in a physiologically relevant 3D
environment, and holds great promise for elucidating guidance principles that
underlay neurodevelopment and for identifying and implementing regenerative
therapies, particularly in conjunction with the quantitative modeling of growth
cone and filopodial (thin cytoplasmic protusions from the cell)
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands
of patients suffer from central nervous system (CNS) trauma and degenerative
disorders and may ultimately benefit from this research. Two hundred
economically disadvantaged students are recruited into the Future Scholars
program each year - or 1,000 students over the course of this proposal, and
Rutgers' home communities are largely dominated demographically by under-
represented groups. The proposed initiatives provide unique opportunities to
these students that will excite them about education and training in biomedical
and tissue engineering and helps shape future leaders of our scientific and
engineering communities.
