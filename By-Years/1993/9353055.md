9353055 Nashner-Whitney The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology
will initiate a four week commuter Young Scholars project in discrete and
applied mathematics for thirty African Americans entering the ninth grade. The
program will stress positive career skills, appropriate problem solving skills
and the development of a network supportive of pursuit of mathematics or
mathematics dependent careers. Students work in small groups with peer, tutor,
and instructor support provided as needed. Students work with mentors from
community businesses and agencies to solve problems in staffing schedules,
restaurant waiting line management, traffic flow, bus routing and decision
making protocols for trauma victims. Discussion of issues in the ethics of
science will use the case study method. Career activities will feature site
visits and guest speakers (especially African Americans). Four quarterly
Workshops providing academic counseling, math review and a continued
introduction to community professionals who use mathematics in their work will
complete the project activities. ***
