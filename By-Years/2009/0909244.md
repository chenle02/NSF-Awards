Early historical records about people of the Aleutian Archipelago of Alaska
emphasized the importance of coastal resources to the cultures, leading Laughlin
(1980:20) to conclude ?The interior land surfaces on the other hand were
irrelevant to their way of life.? The project researchers argue that
archaeologists limited surveys for sites to the shoreline and eventually
concluded there were no sites upland. The research team of Hanson, Staley, and
Corbett found an upland site in 1983 with 17 bermed, circular, cultural
depressions on Adak Island leading to a profound shift in their understanding of
land use in the Aleutian Chain. In 2007, the three archaeologists returned and
found eight new sites in the same area, demonstrating that upland sites are not
anomalous nor were ?interior lands irrelevant?.

The goal of the project is to determine the function of upland sites on Adak
Island. The objectives of this project are to incorporate data from site surveys
and excavations into culture histories for the Central Aleutian Islands; develop
a predictive model for upland sites; share the resulting information with
colleagues, Aleut people, and the interested public; and provide a film about
Aleutian Island archaeology to children attending Alaska Public schools.

The project activities will occur over three years. During the first year, the
project will expand on earlier surveys to develop a predictive model for upland
sites. The archaeologists will record new sites using a handheld GPS and map the
new sites and sites found during the 2007 survey using a Trimble GeoXT or a tape
and compass. Archaeological excavations will be undertaken in year two and an
educational video about Aleutian Island archaeology will also produced as a
means of community outreach and public education. In addition, the project
includes the facilitation of individualized research programs for graduate,
undergraduate and local community high school students.
