This experimental research program is aimed at the study of atomic coherence and
interference phenomena manifested by electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) in cold atoms and the exploration of related applications in nonlinear
optics and quantum optics. Because of the negligible Doppler broadening and the
dense atomic density in a magneto-optical trap, cold atoms are well suited for
the proposed studies, and quantitative comparison between experimental
measurements and theoretical calculations can be obtained. Several research
projects such as slow-light nonlinear wave mixing at low light intensities,
which may lead to photon correlation and entanglement, EIT enhanced Kerr
nonlinearity and cross phase modulation, group velocity matching for enhanced
EIT nonlinearity, cavity meditated EIT, cavity enhanced EIT Kerr nonlinearity
and cross phase modulations will be studied. The broader impact of the program
involves student education, particularly of members of under-represented groups
at the university.
