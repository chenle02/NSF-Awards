9615575 Suh This award is to partially support a Mechanical Engineering
Curriculum Workshop. This workshop will evaluate and consider future directions
on how to retain the core disciplines while letting other educational aspects
evolve. Since the mechanical industry is not primarily driven by technology, the
mechanical engineering education curriculum must reflect this. The results of
the workshop will be a widely disseminated document so that others can benefit
from the evaluation that will take place. ***
