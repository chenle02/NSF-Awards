Machine learning is a powerful tool for artificial intelligence and data mining
problems. However, its success critically relies on a good feature
representation of the data; therefore, the problem of feature construction poses
a fundamental challenge. In recent years, representation learning has emerged as
a promising method for learning useful feature representations from data.
However, the current state-of-the-art methods are still limited in building
intelligent agents that can learn and interact with complex environments and
large amounts of sensory input. Specifically, the majority of the existing
methods cannot scale well to large-scale data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this project is to fill this gap by formulating a new framework that can
effectively learn representations from complex environments and scale to large
data. Specifically, we propose novel approaches for learning robust
representations from large-scale data by (1) controlling the complexity of the
feature representations and (2) adaptively modeling relevant patterns in the
presence of significant amounts of irrelevant patterns or
noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key intellectual contributions of this project will
be (1) a novel framework of representation learning that provides robust
representations from large amounts of unlabeled data and relatively small
amounts of labeled data, and (2) theoretical and algorithmic advances for
inference, learning, and related optimization problems in representation
learning for large-scale, complex sensory information
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will serve as a catalyst leading to
applications, such as multimedia processing and search, medical image
processing, speech recognition, and autonomous navigation. The results will be
disseminated through publications and free software.
