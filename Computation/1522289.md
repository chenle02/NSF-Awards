The frontiers of science are explored today by elaborate computer-based
simulations of real-world phenomena. An essential tool in this endeavor is the
finite element method, which has been used over an incredible range of temporal
and spatial scales to deepen our understanding of physical behavior. Modern
methods rely on a wide variety of finite element "types," each with its own set
of challenges and potential benefits. Many of these element types have been
classified by the recently developed and widely distributed Periodic Table of
Finite Elements. While the table characterizes the most well-known finite
elements, some of the included types have never been implemented in practice,
due in part to a missing piece of mathematical theory. Further, the mesh element
geometries presented in the table do not include a number of key shapes that are
used throughout national laboratories and academia, implying that a need exists
for a broader characterization of finite element types. This project will
address these mathematical gaps in knowledge, thereby promoting best practices
in finite elements for computation in a wide range of contexts.

In conjunction with collaborators and student researchers, the PI will carry
various tasks aimed at enhancing the usefulness and scope of the framework
defined by the Periodic Table of Finite Elements. These tasks include the
construction of canonical sets of local basis functions for the serendipity
family of finite elements, the description of finite element families for key
geometries employed in practice but not appearing in the table, and proofs that
certain finite element families have minimal dimension in a mathematically
precise sense. Proof techniques and basis constructions will involve the use of
generalized barycentric functions, Whitney differential form spaces, and
gradient bounds for error estimation. The research activities will be
accompanied by an outreach program through the Math Teachers' Circle Network and
the American Institute of Mathematics.
