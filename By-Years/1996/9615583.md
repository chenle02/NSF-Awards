9615583 Grossman This research involves participation in an integrated
observational and modeling effort that includes planning and conducting the 1997
field campaign for the Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-97)
and subsequent data analysis. CASES-97 will be conducted for a four-week period
in May, 1997, in the Argonne Boundary Layer Facility (ABLF) located in the
southern two-thirds of the Walnut River watershed, southeast of Wichita, Kansas.
The specific objectives of the research supported under this award are: Document
the diurnal cycle of the fair-weather planetary boundary layer (PBL) in terms of
both surface properties and the budget equations of the PBL profiles of wind,
temperature and humidity; Relate diurnal variation of PBL profiles and depth to
surface processes, the presence of clouds and entrainment; Collaborate with
other researchers to test PBL and surface schemes in numerical models; Optimize
the design of planned long-term PBL and surface observations in the ABLF and
CASES arrays, through comparing ABLF profiles to independent observational data,
and through evaluating degradation of budget calculations when CASES-97
measurements are selectively eliminated. ***
