9508223 Wilkerson The Department of Mathematics at Purdue University will
purchase four high performance workstations. These would be integrated with a
fileserver and highspeed networking to form a highspeed computing cluster
compatible with the existing departmental network. This equipment will be
dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences and will be
used for research projects, including in particular the following projects in
pure and applied mathematics. The projects from applied mathematics include the
3-D modeling of flow in porous media, the numerical solution of 3-D time
dependent PDEs by the gradient-weighted moving element method, and the
application of wavelets to fast nonlinear image processing in 2-D and 3-D.
Projects in pure mathematics propose to implement numerically new decompositions
of classical kernel functions from complex variables, to apply symbolic
calculation techniques to problems from commutative algebra, algebraic geometry,
and algebraic topology. These projects share the demand for high performance,
since in most instances the current test cases demand many hours or days on the
available equipment.
