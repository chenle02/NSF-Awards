This project advances learning methods for obtaining linguistic knowledge from
raw or nearly raw text; such knowledge constitutes a core component of natural
language processing technology but is difficult to obtain, usually relying on
expensive manual annotation of text data. Specifically, this project aims to
automate some of the mechanical aspects of developing learning algorithms for
linguistic structure (in part by using a empirical Bayesian framework to unify
considerable past work by the PI and others), to enrich models with richer
linguistic bias (particularly through lexicalization and integration of
morphology and syntax), and to apply these techniques to new natural language
processing problems (identifying boilerplate and quotation extraction). Another
exciting dimension is learning from text collections in multiple languages (not
necessarily including translations), which past work has shown can lead to
better unsupervised learning. The project will lead to working systems,
including generic tools applicable to many problems in natural language
processing and machine learning. These tools will provide infrastructure for the
PI's courses and will be publicly available to the research community. Research
results will be published in leading journals and at major conferences. The
project supports one primary graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher.
Major impacts of this project will be improvements in the quality of rapidly
ported natural language processing tools for new languages and text domains, as
well as a deeper scientific understanding of natural language learning by
machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
