9725833&lt;br/&gt;Chesley&lt;br/&gt;Despite long and intense scrutiny some of
the most basic questions concerning ore deposits, such as age, duration and
source, remain poorly constrained for many deposit types. This collaborative
research effort between Washington State University and the University of
Arizona is designed to investigate the age, duration and evolution of a large
copper deposit in Canada. The evolution of the Gasp√ö hydrothermal system in both
space and time will be determined utilizing primarily three isotopic systems:
[1] Sm-Nd in garnet, pyroxene, scheelite and fluorite; [2] Re-Os in molybdenite,
chalcopyrite and pyrite; and [3] U-Pb in titanite, allanite, zircon and garnet.
The compositional contrasts among magma, skarn and wall rocks combined with
multiple minerals which can be analyzed with these systems, provide an
unparalleled opportunity for investigating the age and duration of
mineralization, the age of individual mineralization/alteration episodes/zones,
the sources of metals, and the behavior of different isotopic systems in a
complex hydrothermal environment. The insights gained from this research will be
applicable to a wide variety of ore deposits.&lt;br/&gt;
