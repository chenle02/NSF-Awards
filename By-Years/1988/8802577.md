In this collaborative research project, a behavioral ecologist (K. A. Sullivan)
and a physiological ecologist (W. W. Weathers) examine the relationship between
foraging efficiency, social dominance, and survivorship in a small passerine
bird, the yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaenotus). The study focuses on juvenile
birds during the two-week period following the termination of adult care. During
this period, juvenile mortality is high (42%) and body mass is a significant
predictor of survival. The period of intense selection provides an opportunity
to determine whether foraging efficiency and/or social dominance also affect
survivorship, and hence fitness, as predicted by current theory. The study will
provide insights concerning such diverse topics as how juvenile foraging
efficiency affects the length of parental care, the energy costs and benefits of
social dominance, the effect of microhabitat selection on daily energy
expenditure, and population regulation by juvenile survivorship.
