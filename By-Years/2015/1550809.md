This project plans to hold a workshop between U.S. and Japan researchers on the
subject of windstorm hazard reduction on critical infrastructure. The objectives
of the workshop are to evaluate accomplishments of the past in the two countries
and to move forward in identifying collaborative projects in changing
environment. During the past five years there have been progress in wind hazard
research in both countries, namely computational wind engineering in Japan and
experimental research facilities in the U.S. This workshop is critical because
researchers of the two countries can learn from the complementary research
subject areas of the wind hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held
at Yokohama National University in Japan during the month of May 2016. Twelve to
fifteen persons will be invited from the U.S. researchers and equal number from
Japan to participate in the workshop. The proceedings of the workshop will be
open to other interested individuals. The program of three days will include
brief presentations, panel discussions, and one-half day visit to a site of
implementation of wind engineering. Engineering and scientific practices can be
improved through international exchanges of technical data/information,
researchers and research equipment.
