Reward Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is the improvement of
performance of an agent due to rewards and punishments. Most studies of the
phenomenon so far have assumed that the learning proceeds through maximizing the
discounted total reward from the environment. Discounting tends to favor the
sacrifice of higher long-term rewards in favor of short-term rewards. On the
other hand, performance is often better enhanced in real situations by the use
of average reward per unit time. One such application is the scheduling of
automatic guided vehicles (AGVs - robots used for material handling tasks in
flexible manufacturing systems), where optimization of discounted total reward
will influence the robots to serve machines that are close and neglect those far
away, leading to stoppage of the more distant machines, and perhaps to the
halting of the entire manufacturing system. The objective of this project is to
use the AGV scheduling problem as a means of studying reinforcement learning
methods that optimize average reward to avoid such pitfalls, leading to a better
understanding of the factors that influence performance under automated average
reward reinforcement learning.
