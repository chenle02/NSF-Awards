Diamondiferous kimberlites are closely associated with stable Archean cratons,
whereas diamond=bearing olivine lamproites are intruded into adjacent mobile
belts. However, a newly discovered diamond field in NW Syria differs from both
these settings. Clusters of rift-induced diamond-bearing eruptives into Jurassic
dolomites of the western block of the Syria Graben are dated at 110-115 m.y.,
similar in age to the Mesozoic reuptive event in southern, west and east Africa,
brazil, North America, and Siberia. Diamond host rocks in syria are neither
kimberlites nor lamproites, but some approach the composition of essexite or
basanite. Samples of unweathered drill cores are exotic polymict volcanoclastic
breccias with serpeintine, glass and mineral fragments set in a carbonate
matrix. Upper mantle-derived xenoliths are garnet lherzolite, dunite and
discrete megacrysts of ilmenite, diopside, and garnet. Crustal xenoliths are
garnet granulites, gabbros, and amphibolites. The N-S Syria Graben is an
extension of the East African, Ethiopian, Afar, Red Sea and Dead Sea Rift
systems, parts of which have been continuously active since at least the
Jurassic. Rift-induced alkali magmatic sampling of paleo-kimberlites or
lamproites in pre-existing conduits is one possible model for the generation of
the non-trrditional diamond host rocks in the Arabian Plate of NW Syria. This
unusual tectonic setting and the exotic nature of the hybrid diamond host rocks
is the focus of this proposal. Bulk and mineral chemical and stable isotope
techniques will be applied to test the hybridization model, or alternatively to
establish that these are indeed primary upper mantle melt products from within
the diamond stability field.
