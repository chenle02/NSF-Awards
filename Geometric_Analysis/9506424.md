9506424 Ru The proposed research lies in the interface of number theory and
several complex variables. It seeks to understand the somewhat mysterious
relationship between Nevanlinna theory and diophantine geometry. In particular,
the investigator proposes to give a single proof for the second main theorem in
Nevanlinna theory and the Roth-Schmidt-Faltings theorem in diophantine geometry.
Recently, formal analogies between certain areas of complex geometry and number
theory have been observed. This is exciting in that on the face of it these are
two totally unrelated areas of mathematics: number theory deals with integer
equations whereas complex geometry deals with non-discrete objects.
