9401627 Bass This award supports research on a number of questions in group
theory using geometric methods. The principal investigator will work on
linearizing flat families of reductive group representations; renormalization in
interval dynamics and automorphism groups of rooted trees; calculating the
stabilizer, in the outer automorphism group, of the hyperbolic length function
of a simplicial tree action; developing the theory of non-uniform tree lattices;
and several topics in the representation theory of finitely generated groups. A
lattice is a set of objects together with an order on these objects such that
any pair of objects has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Lattices
have shown to be quite useful in the study of Lie groups. In a similar spirit
this project will explore lattices in the automorphism group of certain trees.
This work is of interest to many different areas of mathematics. It also has
potential applications in information theory.
