The principal investigator, in collaboration with Drs. Yuen and Halley of the
University of Minnesota, will study the atomistic and thermodynamic properties
of H2O systems using computational techniques. The main aim is to theoretically
predict the behavior of H2O under temperature and pressure conditions that are
impractical for direct experimentation. Data such as these will be especially
valuable to earth scientists studying the behavior of H2O-bearing systems that
exist deep within the Earth.
