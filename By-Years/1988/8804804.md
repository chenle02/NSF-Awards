This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study photochemistry of several prototypical systems at low temperatures. The
research will elucidate the mechanisms of photolysis, identify intermediate
species and elucidate their energy levels. Three systems are to be studied
including the photolysis of dimethylacetylene, photoreactions of 1,4-diene
systems and pseudo Jahn Teller interactions in phthalazine-alcohol complexes.
