The REU Site program involves participants in research projects in machine
learning techniques and emerging applications, including text analytics and
health informatics. Student projects are expected to yield results that will
contribute to ubiquitous software-based technologies in innovative ways. The
students are introduced to the research topics and helped to obtain in-depth
understanding through introductory and on-going presentations. The REU Site
program is focusing on training future computer scientists from institutions
with limited research opportunities. An emphasis is given to recruiting under-
represented minority students into computer science research at an early age.
The research experience will encourage these students to be productive
researchers in academic and non-academic environments during their future
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will be involved in research in
machine learning and its applications in diverse and emergent areas such as
intelligent software testing, intelligent complier design, health informatics
and natural language processing. Students have the opportunity to utilize a
combination of theoretical reading, analysis, and research within laboratory
environments. The students develop algorithms to solve interesting and timely
problems, develop software, perform hands-on research on novel problems, conduct
experiments, and gain experience writing scientific papers and in oral
presentation of their work in a conference-like setting. More information on
this project can be found at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs REU
Site website (http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita/reu.html).
