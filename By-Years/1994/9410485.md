9410485 Sundaram The framework of Markovian or Stochastic games has been used to
analyze a great variety of issues in economics and game theory. It is somewhat
surprising then that, in contrast to the very well-understood framework of
repeated games, remarkably little is known in general about the properties of
abstract Markovian games. The first part of the project addresses open
theoretical questions about the existence of subgame-perfect equilibrium in
Markovian games, and the properties of the equilibrium set. The second part
continues ongoing research by the investigators into the applications of the
Markovian game framework to economic problems. Research is continued on common-
property resource games, research and development in oligopoly, and repeated
elections and principal/agent games. Two new classes of games studied are those
of information-processing and of natural- resource exploitation. The
investigators plan to complete a paper detailing the literature on the
applications of Markovian games and publish it jointly with an earlier paper
providing a detailed summary of available theoretical results on the existence
and properties of equilibrium in abstract Markovian games as a monograph for
other researchers and advanced graduate students.
