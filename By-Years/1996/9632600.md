9632600 Theirs The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) has been funded to support
two specimen cataloguers to help complete the North American Bryophytes
Catalogue. The project will involve databasing 96,000 North American bryophyte
specimens from the NYBG bryophyte herbarium. NSF-supported staff would catalogue
62,400 specimens (65%), and NYBG-supported staff will catalogue the remaining
33,600 over a two-year period, using the NYBG specimen databasing application
CASSIA. The NYBG bryophyte herbarium the largest in the western hemisphere, with
approximately 600,000 specimens. Long-term plans call for databasing the entire
bryophyte collection, but the North American collections will be done first to
expedite preparation of the bryophyte volume for the Flora of North America
project. The synchronization of the two projects will be very advantageous to
both. The NYBG bryophyte holdings represent the largest single source of raw
data for the preparation of the Flora. Participants in the project (authors,
reviewers and editors) will be able to access the NYBG North American Bryophytes
Catalogue via the Internet to select specimens to borrow for morphological
study, to determine distributions of taxa, and to obtain habitat and type
specimen data. This project is not only a partnership between the New York
Botanical Garden and the Flora of North America project, but also between the
Research Collections in Systematics &amp; Ecology Program and the Database
Activities Program of the NSF, which have co-funded the project.
