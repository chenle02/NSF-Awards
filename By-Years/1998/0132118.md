This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate using
a prototype design the commercial feasibility of electrospinning to produce
nanofibers. Nanofibers will be combined with conventional filter media to form a
novel NanoFilter media for liquid and air filtration applications. These
applications have been shown to remove particles smaller than 3 microns from
effluent streams with superior filtering efficiency and attractive cost
potential. The acrylic nanofibers will be electrospun as a nanoweb directly on
to a conventional support (filter media) substrate. The web will be combined
with a protective cover layer to form a sandwich structure, which will be
collected as a roll. The filter will be easily tailored to achieve the desired
composite filter performance by varying architecture: substrates, nanofiber
diameter, nanoweb density, and the nanoweb thickness. This project will be
carried out collaboratively with academic centers and major corporations as its
strategic partners. &lt;br/&gt; Nanotechnologies developed in the coming years
will form the foundation for a significant commercial platform. Commercial
applications in a variety of filtration processes such as: high-end industrial
raw material purification, biological separations, ultra pure air and water
systems, hospital clean rooms, agriculture and food industries filters, and
microelectronic industries next generation clean environment needs are
anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;
