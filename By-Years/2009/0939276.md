This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Nano Undergraduate Engineering at The George Washington
University (NUE@GWU)", at George Washington University (GWU) under the direction
of Dr. Robert R. Vallance, will develop a program that will prepare
undergraduate engineering students for careers or graduate studies in the design
of systems and devices employing biological nanotechnology. This goal will be
accomplished by infusing bio-nanotechnology into GWU's undergraduate engineering
degree programs with new content, in the form of new courses and new laboratory
experiments. With strong institutional support, faculty from the Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Civil and
Environmental Engineering departments will collaborate to develop six new
courses along with a set of ten laboratory experiments to enhance existing
courses.
