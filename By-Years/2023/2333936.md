The purpose of this project is to plan and organize the 2024 National Science
Foundation (NSF) Smart & Connected Communities Principal Investigator (PI)
Meeting. This meeting will convene all PIs of active awards the NSF S&CC Program
and the PI Meeting is to take place during February/March of 2024 in Nashville,
Tennessee. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored S&CC
researchers, local government and community organization representatives, and
Federal agency representatives to gather and review S&CC progress and
developments, identify new and emerging research areas, and to discuss research
and application gaps and barriers. The program agenda is community-driven and
includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past year program
activities, and showcasing of new S&CC advancements and innovations. This will
be a hybrid PI meeting. It will include both in-person and virtual elements. The
virtual component of the PI meeting will also enable a larger community of
researchers across academia, government, and industry to participate.

The annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the NSF-funded S&CC
PIs meet to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and
challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore,
the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to
interact with government agencies with vested interest in S&CC research and
development. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the S&CC
community. It has played a major role in growing the community across a broad
range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have
interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers,
transition partners, or sponsors. The 2024 PI meeting will feature presentations
from researchers, poster sessions, special topic workshops, and demonstrations
and keynotes from leaders in the research community and local government.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
