The massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory Atmospheric
Sciences group, which staffs, maintains, and operates the Millstone Hill
incoherent scatter radat facility, will undertake a detailed investigation of
the design criteria pertinent to the development of the radar control and data
acquisition system of the Polar Cap Observatory, to review and evaluate current
and proposed technical developments in this area, and to provide an optimized
design and cost plan for this crucial system element.***//
