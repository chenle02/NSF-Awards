The past decade has witnessed tremendous technological advances in the
miniaturization, low-cost, and high-performance sensors, actuators, computing
and communication modules. These advances have been the primary accelerator for
the fields of robotics and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which have gained much
progress since its initiation a little more than a decade ago. To date, MAVs
have shown increasing applications in a variety of scientific and commercial
applications in defense, civil, industrial, and agricultural areas. Compared to
fixed or rotary wing MAVs, flapping wing MAVs are unique in its hovering
capability, maneuverability, and stability.

The intellectual merit of this work include the creation and development of the
first hardware prototype of autonomous flapping wing MAV capable of hovering,
and a foundational framework and methodology for system dynamic models and
flight control of flapping wing MAVs. Over the past few years, this I-Corps team
has developed several prototypes of flapping wing MAVs inspired by insects and
hummingbirds. These working prototypes feature low power, high frequency
flapping wing motion, long fatigue life with minimal moving parts (without four
bar mechanisms), and the potential of autonomous flight. During the course of
the proposed I-Corps project, the team will investigate the market feasibility
of the flapping wing MAVs to be applied in various industrial, civil, military,
and commercial areas.
