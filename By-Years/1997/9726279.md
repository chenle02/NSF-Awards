Evolutionary studies of primate foraging strategies and adaptations often
assume that there are species-typical foraging patterns. The degree to which
such species-typical patterns exist is debatable however, as within-species
variation has not been studied in most species. This study examines within-
species variation in feeding and ranging behavior of two neighboring groups of
redtailed monkeys in a Kenyan forest. The groups are similar in size and
composition, but their habitats differ, as one group lives along the forest edge
while the other occupies the interior. We will compare the monthly diets of the
two groups, and will document the degree to which preferences for particular
foods are shared between them, the degree to which differences between groups
are related to differences in which foods are available, and the ways in which
specific ranging patterns are related to diet. Data on foraging and food
abundance will be collected over an annual cycle by directly observing the
animals and monitoring their food sources. This study will not only provide
insight into the extent and explanations of within-species variation in redtail
foraging, but will also contribute valuable comparative data that are useful for
models of optimal diet, and for planning conservation and management strategies.
