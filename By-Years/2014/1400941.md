This award provides funding for a three-day workshop "Advances in Nonlinear
Analysis", to be held March 13 - 15, 2014, in the framework of the 2014 Theme
Semester on Analysis and Convex Integration in the Department of Mathematics at
the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the
conference is recent developments in nonlinear analysis and partial differential
equations, including geometric analysis, geometric measure theory, optimal
transport, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and calculus of variations. Some
leading experts in these areas are confirmed as participants and will give
lectures. Special attention is paid to recruit junior participants and members
of underrepresented groups. Ample opportunity is provided to graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. The workshop is a
part of a one semester thematic program including several minicourses in the
research areas at the University of Pittsburgh.
