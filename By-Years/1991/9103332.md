A preference-based approach to the problem of leader election in distributed
computer systems is examined. This approach is based upon the observation that a
leader in a distributed system should represent a "good" choice for the system
from a performance standpoint. Individual nodes "vote" for different candidate
nodes based upon locally available information. The votes are combined using an
election scheme to determine the leader. To develop and test this approach, it
is planned to investigate its application to the problem of leader election in
two specific system models: the delay model and the reliability model. Both,
experimental and theoretical, techniques to develop and study different leader
election schemes are used. The preference-based approach is of considerable
practical interest and importance. Voting represents an efficient way by which
to use locally available information to make a global decision that reflects the
preferences of indididual nodes. Thus, the preference- based approach is not
merely a solution to the problem of leader election; it represents, a
generalized framework in which solutions to problems of choice may be developed.
