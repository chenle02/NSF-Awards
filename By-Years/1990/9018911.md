This project will measure the uniaxial compressive stress- strain relationship
of a suite of cemented tungsten-carbide samples. Because of its high strength,
cemented tungsten carbide is used as a key structural component in the design of
state-of- the-art high pressure multi-anvil apparatus capable of experimentation
up to 25-30 GPa. Optimal design of high-pressure apparatus is hampered by a lack
of information about the fundamental rheology of this material under conditions
that mimic the conditions imposed on the material in such high-pressure systems.
This project is intended to provide the necessary data, and the results will
also enable finite element analysis of new designs for improved high-pressure
apparatus. Experimental capabilities in the ultra-high range of static pressure
are necessary for basic research in earth sciences and materials science.
