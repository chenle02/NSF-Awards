9316122 Norris PI will test rates and modes of speciation in planktic
foraminifera using stable isotopic and morphometric analyses. He will: 1)
compare rates of morphological and ecological speciation at sites distributed
around the globe, 2) determine whether or not ancestral species survive at low
abundance following anagenetic speciation events, 3) evaluate the relationship
between speciation and water column structure to understand nature and
geographic extent of oceanographic controls on diversification.
