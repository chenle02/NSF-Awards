This SBIR research project will develop and implement sensor-based models into
an intelligent, adaptive, and neurally-inspired control system for a high-
density, low-pressure plasma process on a microwave plasma reactor system. The
goal is to address the need for nonlinear and adaptive control methods created
by the uncertainty in sensors and components of the microfactory/clustor tools.
Special interfaces tailored for the control system will render the time response
of the sensors, the neuro-controller, and the actuators to within 1-5 seconds,
which is fast enough to achieve real--time and in-situ control. Moreover, the
use of analog VLSI chips in implementing the algorithms results in reducing the
learning time to, at most, a few milliseconds. This savings in the computational
requirement will ensure ample time for precise and fast actions.
