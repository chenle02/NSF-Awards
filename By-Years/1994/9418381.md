This award is for support for a two year project to study subtemperate basal
processes at Meserve Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The basal layer at
Meserve Glacier has a distinctive amber color and is silt-rich. The origin and
properties of distinctive layers often observed at the base of sub-temperate ice
masses are not well understood. Most mechanisms for entrainment require melting
or at least partial melting at the bed, and it is not clear how the layer
properties could evolve under present conditions. A specific goal of this study
is to determine whether the basal layer at Meserve Glacier could have formed at
sub freezing temperature, or whether its existence implies past basal conditions
were significantly warmer than today.
