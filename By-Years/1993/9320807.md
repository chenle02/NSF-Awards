9320807 Williams With this planning grant from The National Science Foundation,
Dr. Sloan Williams will develop models which will allow her to reconstruct forms
of prehistoric social organization using DNA data obtained from the analysis of
ancient bone. In the course of archaeological fieldwork in southern Peru, Dr.
Williams and her collaborators have excavated a series of cemeteries which
contain well preserved human skeletal remains. The graves also yielded numerous
burial goods which provide information on the social and occupational status of
the associated individuals. Using current biochemical techniques it is possible
to extract and analyze DNA from these bones and with the data thus collected
determine the degree of relatedness among individuals. On this basis it should
be possible to reconstruct biological affinity and relate this to social and
occupational organization. While the archaeological significance of this work is
clear and the research is technically feasible, Dr. Williams must still develop
analytic techniques which bridge the gap between data and question. This grant
will provide her the time to accomplish this. The project is important for three
reasons. It will help to develop an analytic technique of potential widespread
use. It will pave the way for Dr. Williams to design a large scale effort. It
will also facilitate the development of a promising young scientist. ***
