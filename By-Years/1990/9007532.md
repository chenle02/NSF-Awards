This research is concerned with describing the movement of discrete units in
stochastic networks. There is a small class of queueing networks which can
presently be solved analytically. These are Markovian and have product form
solutions. Extension to this class will be made by considering "partially
balanced" networks, which allow for dependencies among nodes and routes (so
called intelligent networks). The results of this research will be very
important both for the theory and the applications of queueing networks.
