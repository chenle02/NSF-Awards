&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial chromosomes and plasmids are usually circular.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, has linear chromosomes and harbor
linear as well as circular plasmids. These linear replicons have closed hairpin
ends (one DNA strand turns around and continues but becomes the complementary
strand to form a linear duplex without free ends). In the temperate lambda-like
phages N15 of E. coli and KO2 of Klebsiella oxytoca, upon lysogeny the prophage
DNA's are not integrated into the circular bacterial chromosome, but exist as
linear plasmids with closed hairpin ends. Occurrences of this type of DNA ends,
though not common, have recently been recognized in different branches of the
bacterial kingdom. The goal of this research is to study the mechanism with
which these closed hairpin ends are generated using both genetic and molecular
biological approaches. Both the phage encoded as well as the Borrelia bacterial
encoded systems will be investigated. An integrase/recombinase-like protein
called protelomerase has been identified as the enzyme that acts in a sequence-
specific manner via a cleavage-rejoining mechanism to generate the closed
hairpin ends. The specific interaction between the protein and the target site,
as well as the pathway of hairpin end generation will be investigated in detail.
A saturation mutagenesis will be conducted to identify critical amino acids
needed for function. This project can also lead to the design of new linear
cloning vehicles especially for cloning lethal genes. The study of linear
hairpin-ended replicons will provide new insight into chromosome maintenance.
Since all pathogenic Borrelias have linear chromosomes with hairpin ends, this
research will also contribute to the understanding of the biology of Borrelia
diseases.&lt;br/&gt;
