This award provides support for an REU Site at Purdue University for up to three
years. Ten students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-week
summer experience in research related to biomedical engineering. The program
will serve to encourage undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering
and thus impact the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and
permanent residents engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated
that this REU Site will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have
broader participation in the research enterprise of citizens and permanent
residents from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in science and
engineering.
