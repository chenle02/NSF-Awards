*** 96-60731 Qian This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop a new type of total and dissolved carbon (TOC/DOC) analyzer. It is
expected to have greater selectivity, narrower peaks (less than 1 minute sample
throughput time), higher sensitivity, lower detection limit, lower system blank,
lower gas consumption, easier maintenance, lower backpressure, and longer column
lifetime. The Phase I design will couple a closed, loop-type sample autoinjector
to a two stage, small bore, open tubular quartz combustion column. In addition,
Phase I will examine the feasibility of a new detection system which reduces
carbon dioxide, formed during the combustion step, to methane, and follows with
flame-ionization detection. Accurate TOC/DOC measurements are needed for oceanic
models, as well as for food web and climatic studies. The new analyzer is
expected to have extensive use in high precision, routine seawater analysis.
Potential non-marine applications include monitoring of effluents from municipal
sewage, industrial wastes, dump site drainage, agricultural run-off, and
eutrophicated systems. Other applications may include monitoring organics in:
process water, e.g., power plant cooling and boiler feed water; high purity
water generating systems; semiconductor reclaim water; and a variety of
pollution regulation operations. ***
