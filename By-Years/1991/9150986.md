This project is providing instrumentation and equipment to support undergraduate
study in analog communications and electronics in the radio frequency bands. The
Electrical Engineering program at the University of Evansville has undergraduate
courses and laboratories in place to support the study of concepts in analog
electronics. The laboratory component of this program is being developed to
include study outside the audio frequency band. The additional equipment being
obtained includes RF signal generators, a tracking function generator, wide band
amplifiers, RF voltmeters, 500 mhz oscilloscopes, and fabrication equipment to
support junior and senior level project laboratories in analog electronics. This
capability allows the students to extend their labotatory understanding of
analog electronics beyond the audio frequency range.
