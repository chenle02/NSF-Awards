The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the mechanisms by
which transcriptional regulation influences the cell tropism of retroviruses. As
a model system, the P.I. is studying the contribution of the transcriptional
enhancer of a replication competent mouse retrovirus, the Moloney murine
leukemia virus. There are multiple binding sites for host nuclear transcription
factors on the Moloney virus enhancer. One of these binding sites, the Leukemia
Virus fact b (LVb) site is the most highly conserved sequence in the enhancers
of mammalian type C retroviruses. There is indication that a protein(s) that
binds the LVb site contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the Moloney
virus. Dr. Speck plans to characterize, purify and obtain molecular clones
encoding the nuclear DNA-binding protein that binds to the LVb site in the
Moloney virus enhancer, and most likely to the enhancers of many mammalian
C-type retroviruses.
