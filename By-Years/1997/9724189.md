9724189 Hilton This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
Program, provides $277,718 as partial support of the costs of acquiring a rare
gas mass spectrometer equipped with UV and IR laser probes, in-house manufacture
of the associated gas extraction lines and half-time support for a lab
technician for the noble gas isotope geochemistry laboratory at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography. Establishment of this state-of-the-art facility
will allow high spatial resolution micro-sampling of geologic materials and
subsequent high sensitivity analyses of rate gas isotopic compositions in order
to resolve such issues as crustal versus mantle contributions to hotspot and arc
volcanics, production rates of cosmogenic nuclides (i.e. 21Ne) in subaerial
rocks for use in exposure-age dating and studies of the Earth's ancient
atmosphere based on analyses of the 20Ne/22Ne ratio of gases that may be
preserved in mineral fluid inclusions in Proterozoic rocks. ***
