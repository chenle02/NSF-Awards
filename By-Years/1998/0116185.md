ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0116185&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A researcher from
the University of California-San Diego proposes to continue his studies on the
calcium (Ca) cycle in the ocean by making additional measurements of Ca inputs
and outputs. Initially, the PI will measure the Ca isotopic composition of
additional river water samples to increase the available database and help
constrain the present-day river input of Ca. In addition, results from these
samples will be used to assess whether the lithology and maturity of the
drainage basin affects the Ca isotopic composition of river samples and if
adsorption of Ca onto clays influences the isotopic signal. Next, Dr. Macdougall
plans to collaborate with Dr. Paytan at Stanford to ascertain if barite samples
record the Ca isotopic composition of seawater without the fractionation
observed in biogenic carbonate. Lastly, the PI will analyze samples of a single
foraminifera (Globigerinoides sacculifer) in downcore sediments from ODP Site
806 in the western Equatorial Pacific which document the Quaternary oxygen
isotopic record, to determine whether Ca isotopes can be used as a paleo-
temperature proxy. &lt;br/&gt;
