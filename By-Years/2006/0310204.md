This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Analyzing the role of hTPR in
retention of pre-mRNA in mammalian cells." Eukaryotic cells retain intron-
containing mRNAs in the nucleus until splicing is complete. A protein Mlp1p
mediates the retention in yeast. This research investigates the role of its
homologue hTPR in mammalian cells. Its role in the topology of splicing,
splicing control steps and spatial positioning is being assessed by monitoring
the formation of pre-mRNA in vivo as a function of RNAi dependent hTPR
knockdown.
