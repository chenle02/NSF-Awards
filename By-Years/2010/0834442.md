German-USA Collaborative Symposium, Munich, June 8-11,
2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns the organization of a
binational meeting of researchers in the field of computational neuroscience
from the USA and from Germany, to be held in Munich, June 8-11, 2008. The
meeting will combine the exchange of current scientific ideas in the field with
an exploration of possibilities for strengthening collaboration between
researchers from the two countries. The meeting will be attended by US and
German researchers, and representatives from private and governmental German and
US funding organizations.&lt;br/&gt;
