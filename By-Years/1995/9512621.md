9512621 Ja Ja The project proposes to establish an ATM-based high speed
communication network connecting six research laboratories to the UMIACS
Parallel Processing Laboratory (PPL). The six laboratories reside in the
Departments of Computer Science, Geography, and Physics, and the Institute of
Physical Science and Technology. The proposed network will consist of seven ATM
local area networks connected by multimode fiber to four additional switches
managed by the campus Computer Science Center. High-speed off-campus connections
will be established to SURAnet and the NSF-funded National Scalable Cluster
Project (NSCP). The UMIACS PPL provides approximately 20 Gigaflops of
computational power and 400 Gigabytes of online disk storage to these
laboratories. The proposed network will serve as a research instrument for
addressing critical issues in networking research, operation and management
network computing using distributed shared memory, distributed multimedia
databases, and scalable I/O. The network will substantially enhance a number of
collaborative research activities including (1) the development and evaluation
of transport layer services over ATM LAN's, (2) the development of methodologies
and tools for creating wide-area DSM, (3) experimental high energy physics
requiring statistics-intensive data analysis, (4) visualization in scientific
computations for chaotic dynamics and computational mechanics, (5) the
application of remotely sensed images in the analysis of the Earth's
environmental systems, and (6) techniques for creating and manipulating
multimedia databases and scalable parallel I/O. ***
