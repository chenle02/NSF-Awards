9452674 Elkhader Northern State College seeks to initiate a comprehensive,
residential program, called South Dakota Native American Mathematics Enhancement
(SDNAME), consisting of a four-week summer enrichment institute for 30 high
potential Lakota/Dakota students in grades 10 and 11. SDNAME is targeted at
native American students, half of which will be female. Students will
participate in activities and experiments involving discrete mathematics, game
theory, and mathematical biology. The goals of the proposed project are to:
develop students' interest in mathematics; build a peer group interest in
mathematics; and raise self confidence and encourage the study of mathematics or
mathematics-dependent fields. ***
