Louis Stokes South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participantion (LS-
SCAMP)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes-South Carolina Alliance for
Minority Participation (LS-SCAMP) has &lt;br/&gt;become a keystone for
undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering and technology &lt;br/&gt;(SMET)
retention and a catalyst for degree completion within the state. Committed
&lt;br/&gt;leadership from top- level administrators is paramount to the
successful &lt;br/&gt;implementation of the goals proposed herein.The new LS-
SCAMP Phase I will be lead&lt;br/&gt;by South Carolina State University
(SCSU),nationally ranked for African American/Minority&lt;br/&gt;SMET degree
completion and the largest producer of underrepresented minority SMET
&lt;br/&gt;degrees in the state. Currently all of SCSU's SMET baccalaureate
degree programs are &lt;br/&gt;ranked nationally as a result of African-
American/Minority degree completion. Biology&lt;br/&gt;, Mathematics and
Engineering Technology are ranked 4 th in the nation while Computer
&lt;br/&gt;Science is ranked 13 th and Physics is ranked 21 st . LS-SCAMP
includes all seven of the&lt;br/&gt;HBCUs in the state of South Carolina and
represents a new beginning and a new era of &lt;br/&gt;support for the success
of underrepresented minorities in SMET. To meet the strong&lt;br/&gt;demand for
higher education and to combat the persistent barriers toaccess, the
new&lt;br/&gt;LS-SCAMP will build on the foundation established during the prior
SCAMP phases.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically the following Phase I goals will be
achieved:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase underrepresented SMET baccalaureate
degree production at a rate that is&lt;br/&gt;40% higher than the national SMET
degree rate.&lt;br/&gt;2. Strengthen and expand undergraduate research
opportunities for SMET students.&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide opportunities for SMET
students to develop knowledge and skills that&lt;br/&gt;will improve their
qualifications and enhance their preparation for graduate&lt;br/&gt;studies in
SMET fields.&lt;br/&gt;4. Build a transfer bridge to increase by 100% SMET
majors from 2-year&lt;br/&gt;institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outstanding
track record for the production of minority graduates at many of &lt;br/&gt;the
Alliance institutions, the unprecedented level of support for the AMP program in
&lt;br/&gt;South Carolina and the new statewide infrastructure, will allow the
goals of Phase I to&lt;br/&gt; be met.&lt;br/&gt;
