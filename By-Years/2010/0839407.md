This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is to develop a novel,
low cost, high performance and compact wavelength blocker for Reconfigurable
Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) in fiber telecommunication networks.

The primary benefit of an enterprise ROADM network is its ability to add
capacity wherever and whenever it is required, with the assurance that the
underlying network will automatically compensate for the added traffic,
eliminating the need for manual tuning or wholesale upgrades. ROADMs are very
rapidly becoming a must-have for equipment vendors serving carriers' metro
network needs, resulting in a multi-billion dollar market in near future.
