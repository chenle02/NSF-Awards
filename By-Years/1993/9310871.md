This award supports intermediate energy nuclear research carried out by staff of
the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the University of Illinois. Activities are
focused on the physics of nucleon and few-body nuclear structure and on the
magnetic moment of the muon. Specifically, they involve measurements in five
areas. First, there is the electron scattering program at the Bates/MIT
accelerator that will try to determine if the proton is spherical or
ellipsoidal. Second, there is a program of parity- nonconserving electron
scattering at the Bates/MIT and the CEBAF accelerators that will try to measure
new aspects of the structure of the proton and neutron. Third, there is the
experiment to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Fourth, there are experiments involving proton-antiproton
collisions at the Low Energy Antiproton Ring at CERN. These experiments search
for new, exotic forms of nuclear matter, such as glueballs. And fifth, there are
experiments using beams of photons at the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory.
These seek to study certain aspects of the structure of protons and neutrons as
well as their interactions in light nuclei. All of these experiments address
issues in intermediate energy nuclear physics that are at the forefront of our
knowledge.
