Beran Modern statistical methods for large data sets rely on rotation of the
data in high dimensions (as in Fourier analysis, wavelet transforms, or
projection pursuit), on smoothing (as in nonparametric regression), on shrinkage
(as in Stein estimation or ridge regression), on variable selection (as in
linear regression), and on combinations of these ideas (such as thresholding of
wavelet or Fourier coefficients). Concurrently, statisticians have introduced
computer-aided techniques, such as cross-validation or the bootstrap, for
assessing the uncertainty in patterns recovered though data analyses. This
research project develops: (a) necessary and sufficient conditions under which
bootstrap distributions converge correctly plus diagnostic methods for detecting
bootstrap failure in data analyses; (b) modulation estimators that recover a
signal from noise by adaptively tapering the rotated data plus confidence
regions for the signal that are centered at the modulation estimators; (c)
nonparametric bootstrap confidence sets for all pairwise rotational differences
among the mean directions (or mean axes) of several independent samples of
directional (or axial) data. The computer revolution in scientific and social
measurement has created large, complex data sets. In response, data analysts
have devised computer- assisted methods for recovering patterns from data.
However, incompleteness of the data as well as measurement errors induce
possible errors in the conclusions reached. The recent controversy about Census
undercounts in the cities is a prominent example. How much uncertainty is there
in patterns recovered through sophisticated data-analyses? The statistical
technique called the bootstrap, which relies on fast computers, has grown since
1979 into the most widely applicable method for assessing uncertainties inherent
in data-analyses. Unfortunately, bootstrap methods, as currently used, can
sometimes give a misleading asse ssment of uncertainty. Part (a) of this
research project provides computer-intensive ways to detect and to correct such
bootstrap failure. This portion of the work contributes to the Federal Strategic
Area of high-performance computing. Part (b) of the project develops uncertainty
assessments for signals recovered from noisy measurements. Electronic images
recorded by a satellite camera are an instance of such measurements. This
portion of the work provides statistical methodology for analyzing satellite
data in the Federal Strategic Area of global change. Part (c) of the project
develops uncertainty assessments for analyses of directional and axial data
sets. Geophysical measurements in earthquake studies, oil exploration, and
studies of volcanic activity are examples of such directional and axial data.
