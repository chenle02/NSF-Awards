The objective of this work is to understand the events that take place during a
non-lethal selection for mutation that increase the cells metabolic capability.
Specifically, we will study a selection for alterations which allow the uptake
of large maltodextrins across the outer membrane of the bacterium Escherichia
coli. We will determine what parameters influence the selection and if the
selection itself influences the type of mutations that we obtain. We will
biochemically and genetically characterize the events that occur during the long
period of stationary growth on solid media that occurs during non-lethal
selections. We will determine if the selection results in induction of stress
response systems. And we will determine if starvation stress induces
mutagenesis. Finally, we will attempt to determine the basis for the selection
biases that occur. The knowledge gained from this work will help to clarify the
nature of the events and forces that influence how cells respond to non- lethal
selections for enhanced growth ability.
