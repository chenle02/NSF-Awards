One plant genome, Arabidopsis, has been sequenced, and a second one, rice, is
nearing completion. These plant species represent the major taxonomic division
of the plant kingdom and include the first major crop. Rice is also a member of
the cereals that include crops like wheat and maize, which are much larger in
genome size, 35-times and 5-times, respectively, and, therefore, more difficult
to sequence. However, since maize is a major crop in agriculture and a
significant factor to the economy of the United States, sequencing its genome
will provide a critical infrastructure to advance food supply, quality, and
safety, with simultaneous reduction of risk to health by chemical pollution. To
enable sequencing the larger maize genome, this project seeks to provide sets of
overlapping cloned DNA fragments, about 150 kb in size that are placed on the
genetic map of maize. This placement will be greatly facilitated by zip code-
like sequences of these cloned DNA fragments. These zip codes are in particular
valuable since a certain percentage is conserved in sequence and order between
maize and the closely related rice genome (synteny). Since the rice genome
sequence is aligned to the rice genetic map, ordering the sets of overlapping
maize DNA fragments will be greatly enhanced in regions of synteny. The
resulting map of DNA fragments will be used to generate contiguous genomic
sequence. This will show whether the larger size of the maize genome, largely
due to non-genic, repeat sequences, will require a different method for
obtaining the gene content of maize. A few examples of long stretches of maize
genomic DNA provide biologists for the first time information about the
variability in gene density and a correlation of the genetic and physical map
over several centiMorgans. Such genetic distances are already long enough to
demonstrate to breeders how genes are discovered based on linkage of traits to
DNA.
