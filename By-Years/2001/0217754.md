This conference is designed to assist key university and college leaders, those
with responsibility for institution-wide undergraduate education, in adopting
tested strategies to implement programs of change in STEM curriculum and
pedagogy on their campuses. The focus is on ways to implement change and
demonstrate its effectiveness.

The program acquaints participants with a sense of what some of the exciting new
pedagogies and technologies are and how to infuse these innovations into the
curriculum. Presenters for the workshop detail the ways in which these
innovations can be applied to several fields and then demonstrate how they use
them in their own teaching. They discuss what worked and what failed in the
process of implementation. Attendees will leave with both general ideas and the
specifics of a particular application. Opportunities for interaction with
industrial education leaders is included.

The expected outcome is to have a group of leaders who can return to their
campuses energized and with a better understanding of how to implement these
changes within the curriculum.
