Lactose is synthesized in high levels only in the lactating mammary gland. The
enzyme complex "lactose synthase" is composed of two subunits, a glycosyl
transferase called galactosyl transferase and a modifier protein, a-lactalbumin.
Using the techniques of fluorescence, ESR and NMR, Dr. Berliner will
characterize, assign and map specific cation binding and other regions on the
a-lactalbumin molecule in solution. Kinetic experiments will also be employed to
test the efficacy of modified calcium binding loop derivatives in lactose
biosynthesis.
