9523207 Bykovski This research is to develop a holographic species analyzer for
detecting chemical species. This analyzer will operate through a holographic
memory designed to recognize the whole light patterns from different species and
generate a position-sensitive mapping of species in an output plane. This
technology is to replace a diffraction grating and will have many advantages: 1)
it will be highly selective, 2) it will not include any wavelength scanning, 3)
a master template can be computer generated once and then copied, 4) the output
displays a peak for a species to be monitored, and 5) a compact "smart card"
approach to a contact species analysis is possible. The project, if successful,
will lay foundation for a new, high performance method of chemical analysis and
a new class of commercial analyzers for environmental, biomedical, process
control, and food processing, and other applications.
