This research award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by
Professor Gregory H. Robinson at The University of Georgia to probe the
synthesis of a series of provocative low-oxidation state main group compounds.
Importantly, sterically demanding N-heterocyclic carbene ligands will be
utilized as stabilizing agents in this project. Major goals include: (a) the
synthesis of various low-oxidation state boron compounds; (b) the preparation of
interesting phosphorus anions and main group clusters; and (c) the synthesis of
carbene-stabilized dimetallic complexes. It is expected that the fundamental
discoveries that will result from this work will augment and expand our
knowledge of highly reactive diatomic molecules such as B2, P2, and Si2. In
addition, the carbene-stabilization of highly reactive molecules suggests
unprecedented opportunities in synthetic chemistry from catalysis to materials
chemistry. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows
(from diverse backgrounds) engaged in this work will gain valuable experience in
basic synthetic chemistry, the manipulation of air-sensitive compounds, single-
crystal X-ray diffractometry, and basic computational chemistry.
