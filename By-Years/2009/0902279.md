Funding is provided to reconstruct past hydroclimatic variables (precipitation,
soil moisture, streamflow) in the Great Basin region over the past 5,000 years
using long tree-ring chronologies. The aim of the research is to place the
modern instrumental record in a longer-term context. Previous research by the
group shows that dry conditions in the Great Basin of the western United States
between circa AD 500 and 1350 partly resulted from tropically forced changes in
winter Northern Hemisphere circulation like those associated with modern La Ni√±a
episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the promise of
greater understanding of Great Basin hydrology and development of unique high-
resolution records of climate from tree-rings.&lt;br/&gt;
