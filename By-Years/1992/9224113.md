Graduate student Edmund Crane, under the supervision of advisers Jonathan
Wendel and Donald Farrar at Iowa State University, seeks to clarify the
taxonomic delimitation of species and genera in the tropical fern family
Vittariaceae and to infer a phylogenetic framework for the relationships among
these taxa. The phylogenetic study will focus both on morphological features of
these ferns and on DNA sequence data from chloroplast genes. The ferns are
mostly tropical epiphytes, a group little studied with respect to DNA variation
within and among species. Geographic outliers include the strange "Appalachian
gametophyte," Vittaria appalachiana, which is widespread in the eastern U.S. but
found solely as the asexual, clonal haploid stage or gametophyte and not known
in the wild in the sexual, diploid spore-forming stage. Gene sequence data from
samples representing a wide range of fern families will be analyzed to determine
the likely genealogical position of the Vittariaceae among the leptosporangiate
ferns. The results of the interfamily analysis will then be used to assess the
likely derivation of morphological traits within the Vittariaceae. Both
morphological and molecular datasets will be integrated in the interpretation of
evolutionary pathways in these plants.
