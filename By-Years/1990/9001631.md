Using the method of induced hyperbolicity developed earlier by the principal
investigator, families of nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied. Of
particular interest will be their stochastic behavior. One-parameter families of
diffeomorphisms close to the unstable manifold of the Feigenbaum fixed point
will be inspected. And Sullivan's approach will be used to investigate when
topological conjugacy implies quasiconformal conjugacy for maps with absolutely
continuous invariant measures. An invariant measure of a dynamical system is
positive on invariant sets of the system which attract or repel. The principal
investigator will study such systems which are close in some parameter space to
the Feigenbaum limit. This limit of period-doubling bifurcations has raised
intense interest from investigators in a wide variety of physical and biological
sciences. Just past this limit lies the onset of chaos.
