The fish gill is the primary interface between the fish and the fish's
environment. The gill plays a major role in respiration and in the regulation of
ion and water balance. Control of blood flow through this organ is then of
primary importance in the maintenance of internal body fluid homeostasis. Dr.
Olson plans a series of studies on the action and metabolism of hormones and
hormone-like factors in the blood that regulate blood flow through the gill
vascular network. Dr. Olson has developed a gill perfusion procedure that allows
measurement of blood flow, blood pressure, etc. in the presence and absence of
various agents such as angiotensin, bradykinin, biogenic amines, and other
compounds that are known to be regulators of blood flow in other tissues. He has
adapted the procedure so that he will be able to measure the uptake and
metabolism of these compounds by the gill tissue as they pass through the gill.
He will then be able to correlate vascular changes with the metabolic events and
determine which of these factors are the major actors in the regulation of blood
flow. The research results are of primary importance to our understanding of the
regulation of blood flow in respiratory organs. In addition the results will
contribute to our understanding of hormone metabolism by gill tissue and to the
role of environmental factors (i.e. pollutants) that might damage the gills and
thereby disturb blood flow through the gills and upset hormone balance within
the stressed fish.
