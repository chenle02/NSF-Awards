The I/UCR Center for Hazardous Substance Management (HSMRC) at the New Jersey
Institute of Technology (NJIT) plans to form an Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Partnership for Science and Engineering with the University
of the Philippines in Manila. This partnership will involve development of an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in hazardous waste management
research; build educational and research linkages between the two institutions;
include components of shared curriculum development; provide opportunities for
students at participating Philippine academic institutions to enroll at NJIT;
and provide opportunities for Philippine faculty members to carry out research
and develop curricular partnerships with colleagues at NJIT. The Program
Director recommends New Jersey Institute of Technology be awarded $100,000 for
24 months.
