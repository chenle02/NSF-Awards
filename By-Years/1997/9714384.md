9714384 Eluszkiewicz The principal investigator seeks to understand the
physical processes responsible for transport of trace species in the
stratosphere across internal barriers such as the tropopause and the boundary
between the tropics and extratropics. The transport rates across these
boundaries are important in determining the budgets of key constituent gases,
including stratospheric water vapor and lower stratospheric and tropospheric
ozone, and play a crucial role in the assessment of the chemical and climatic
impact of trace gases emitted to the atmosphere, for example by supersonic and
subsonic aircraft. Despite its recognized importance, progress in understanding
this transport has been impeded by the fact that the relevant spatial scales are
often smaller than can be resolved by spacecraft observations or computed using
Eulerian advection schemes. Under this project the PI will simulate the global
effects of both large and small scale transport using a specially developed
Lagrangian trajectory package incorporated into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory SKYHI general circulation model (GCM). The Lagrangian technique will
be used to explore the following: ( The difference in the trace gas
distributions computed using Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches and the impact
of these differences on the mean age of stratospheric air as computed in a GCM (
The nature of stratosphere-troposphere exchange in the extratropics and the
seasonal patterns as revealed by the mass fluxes across the tropopause simulated
in the model. Insights gained from this research will be useful in the general
development of trajectory techniques for other GCMs and/or assimilation models.
In particular, this research will study the sensitivity to the choice of
vertical coordinate and to the sampling frequency of the wind data used in the
trajectory calculations, including the option of performing the calculations on-
line, i.e., on each integration time step of the wind-generating model. These
studies will thus contribute to a better understanding of the Lagrangian
approach both as a three-dimensional high-resolution advection scheme and as a
visualization tool.
