Great subduction zone earthquakes, such as the Alaska earthquake in 1964) and
tsunamis originate in seismogenic (earthquake generating) zones of subduction
zones, where vast tracts of seafloor slide beneath adjacent continental margins.
One such region is the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which extends from northernmost
California to southern British Columbia, Canada. Great earthquakes occur along
this margin at interval of several hundred years; the last was in 1700. Given
the population density of the region today, the next is likely to cause
considerable damage and loss of life. Learning a much as possible about
seismogenic processes in Cascadia is clearly imperative. Much has been learned
in recent years about how energy is stored and released in seismogenic zones.
Among the most interesting phenomona are episodic tremor and slip (ETS) and very
low frequency events (VLFE). These are not earthquakes; instead, the Earth
groans, but these processes are not well understood. This deployment of ocean
bottom seismometers is part of an international collaboration aimed at
investigating these seismic processes. Aside from its obvious societal
relevance, the broader impacts of this effort include the international
collaboration and its contribution to upcoming broader Cascadia initiative.
