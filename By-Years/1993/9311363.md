During the last few years, major scientific progress has been achieved in fields
related to computer aided analysis of multibody systems. In view of this
progress and recent developments of computer hardware and general purpose
software, there is a need to access the current state of art and results from
different schools of thought, with the objective of focusing trends in future
research. This Advanced Study Institute (ASI) will bring together developers of
different segments of these schools of thought as lecturers, with advanced
design engineers and researchers as students, for the purpose of presentation,
refinement, and publication of a comprehensive work on different methodologies
in Computer Aided Analysis of Rigid and Flexible Mechanical Systems.
