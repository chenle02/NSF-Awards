This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in physical
chemistry between Kenneth C. Janda, University of California at Irvine, and
Nadine Halberstadt, University of Paris, South (Orsay). The research combines
theoretical and experimental studies to determine the potential energy surface
for electronically excited rare gas halogen complexes known as van der Waals
molecules. The objectives are (1) to obtain a detailed interpretation of
vibrational predissociation for ArCl2 molecule using a newly implemented IVR
(intramolecular vibrational relaxation) theory, and (2) to extend this theory to
the structure and dynamics of four-atomic clusters, such as HeCl2. The U.S.
research group produces very detailed spectra of van der Waals molecules for
which theory is applicable. This work has yielded fundamental data about the
dynamics of chemical reactions and the physical transition from gaseous to
liquid state. This is complemented by the French investigator's work on
scattering theory as applied to the dissociation dynamics of van der Waals
molecules. The proposed effort will advance fundamental understanding of cluster
dynamics and transitions from gas to liquid state.
