The goal of this project is to make progress on computational problems that
elude the most sophisticated computers and Artificial Intelligence approaches
but that infants solve seamlessly during their first year of life. To this end
we will develop a robot whose sensors and actuators approximate the levels of
complexity of human infants. The goal is for this robot to learn and develop
autonomously a key set of sensory-motor and communicative skills typical of
1-year-old infants. The project will be grounded in developmental research with
human infants, using motion capture and computer vision technology to
characterize the statistics of early physical and social interaction. An
important goal of this project is to foster the conceptual shifts needed to
rigorously think, explore, and formalize intelligent architectures that learn
and develop autonomously by interaction with the physical and social worlds. The
project may also open new avenues to the computational study of infant
development and potentially offer new clues for the understanding of
developmental disorders such as autism and Williams syndrome.
