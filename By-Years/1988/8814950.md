This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr. Matthew
Platz at Ohio State University. Dr. Platz will continue to investigate the
spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms of transient intermediates such as
radicals, polyradicals and carbenes. His work will emphasize chemical and
physical methods including laser flash photolysis and low temperature matrix
isolation spectroscopy. A principal goal will be to measure the kinetics of
reactions of alkyl, dialkyl and aromatic carbenes. These studies will test
dynamical theories of chemical reactions which have entropic but no enthalpic
barriers. He will test for the presence of reversibly formed intermediates in
the reaction of carbenes with olefins and nucleophiles. Spin-forbidden reactions
of triplet carbenes with singlet reagents will be examined in detail.
