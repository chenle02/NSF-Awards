Dr. Lawrence J. Hall is a young theorist doing research in elementary particle
physics. He is mainly concerned with the construction of field theory models
which will improve our understanding of elementary particles and their
interactions. His special field of interest is in rare processes, i.e., proton
decay, rare K and mu decays and neutrino masses. He is also interested in
astrophysical problems, such as the solar neutrino and missing mass problems.
Dr. L. Hall is an outstanding young theoretical elementary particle physicist.
He has been honored with a Presidential Young Investigator award, so that he may
pursue his research in elementary particle physics and in astrophysics.
