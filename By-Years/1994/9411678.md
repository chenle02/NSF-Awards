This proposal is for funds to purchase a Time-of Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometer
system and to upgrade an existing Nd:YAG laser system. The equipment will be
used in conjunction with a planned fast-flow reactor/Resonance Enhanced
Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI)-TOF facility in support of several research
projects related to the incineration of hazardous wastes.
