This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal
benefits, and integrates research and education. The Lifespan Approaches to
Diverse Psychological Science REU at Duke University promotes the progress of
science by providing underrepresented students with truly unique research
experiences using a combination of methodological approaches across the lifespan
and across three main areas of psychology: Developmental, Social, and Cognitive
Neuroscience. This REU supports education and diversity by training
underrepresented students in every aspect of psychological research. REU
students will work with diverse groups of research scholars, all committed to
recruiting, training, and conducting research with underrepresented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this REU is to provide
underrepresented students with the skills, socialization, connection, and
continuity they need to begin developing a scholar-researcher identity. During
this 10-week REU, students will get hands-on experience conducting experimental
and observational research in addition to individually-tailored academic writing
and graduate school application preparatory sessions. Students will participate
in weekly lab meetings, small group meetings, various professional development
trainings, and one-on-one sessions with their mentors in addition to meeting
with other Duke undergraduates and faculty. Attendance at weekly research talk
series will also expose students to other types of psychological science methods
and researchers. Students will also have the opportunity to attend and/or
present at national professional conferences. Since the program’s goal is to
enhance underrepresented students’ research experiences to increase the number
of diverse students who enter Ph.D. programs, students from underrepresented
backgrounds inclusive of first-generation student status will be given priority
consideration. Through this experience, REU students will gain the skills and
support network they will need to succeed in graduate school, all while
enhancing and diversifying psychological science along the
way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
