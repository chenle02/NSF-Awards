The main objective of this project is to develop, theoretically as well as
computationally, efficient numerical methods for solving problems in which
convection dominates diffusion. The solutions of such equations typically
exhibit shocks, whose accurate and efficient computation is difficult. Special
attention will be paid to nonlinear hyperbolic systems, to models of
semiconductor devices, and to compressible Navier-Stokes equations for viscous
flows. Study of numerical methods will center on the so-called Runge-Kutta
Discontinuous Galerkin method, a parallelizable method that adopts from several
finite-difference methods their techniques for evaluating cell fluxes. This work
will extend to higher dimensions earlier results on one-dimensional problems.
Applications of this research arise in studying and designing semiconductor
devices when using the drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic models to describe the
devices, and in solving flow problems that come from aerodynamics.
