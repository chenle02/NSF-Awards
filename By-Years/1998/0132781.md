This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, supports a three-day workshop for about
twenty graduate students and postdoctoral students that aims to prepare them to
initiate careers at the college and university level. Professor Jespersen from
Saint John's University and faculty from diverse institutions will host this
workshop at the Fall 2001 Eastern Analytical Symposium meeting in New Jersey.
Similar workshops will be offered in 2002 and 2003 with the goal of establishing
the workshop as a traditional, self-sustaining component of the Eastern
Analytical Symposium. The objective of this project is to make future college
and university teachers more fully aware of the opportunities and
responsibilities that will accompany this career choice so that they will be
more successful. Of particular interest will be attracting women and minorities
to academic careers and increasing their retention rates in the teaching
profession.
