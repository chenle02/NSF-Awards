RNA is the molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the rest of the
cell. RNA is a copy of DNA, but unlike the DNA double helix, the RNA copy of
each gene forms a unique three-dimensional shape that strongly influences its
behavior, including how it interacts with proteins. This project uses x-ray
crystallography and other biochemical tools to learn the three-dimensional
structure of the bulge-helix-bulge RNA protein complexes. The bulge-helix-bulge
RNA structural motif specifically binds to a protein enzyme called the splicing
endonuclease, leading to breakage of chemical bonds at two specific locations of
the RNA. This cellular process is an obligatory step required to maturate RNA
molecules, much like the way movie films are edited. The motifs are commonly
found at the exon-intron junctions in intron containing archaeal tRNA
transcripts and in the processing stems of archaeal precursor ribosomal RNA
transcripts. This research will delineate the chemical principles involved in
association of RNA and proteins and protein catalyzed RNA cleavage reactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge obtained from this research will enhance
classroom teaching of both biochemistry and molecular biology. This project will
also provide research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, graduate and
post doctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;
