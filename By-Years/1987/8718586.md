This project will fly auroral x-ray imagers on the same balloons as the
University of California astrophysical x-ray and gamma ray spectrometers. The
purpose is to make qualitative measurements of the flux of energetic electrons
that cause the aurora, and to correlate these measurements with other
geophysical measurements, such as magnetic pulsations and the behavior of the
solar wind. The auroral measurements will also take advantage of the UCB
spectrometers, since those will provide high resolution measurements in a very
small, but known, portion of the imagers' field of view. The resulting images
will also complement the images made by the new imaging riometer (IRIS) at South
Pole. The investigators, and the University of Washington, are leaders in
magnetospheric physics.
