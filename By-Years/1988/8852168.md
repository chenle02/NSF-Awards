The teaching of modern spectroscopic and kinetic techniques is markedly enhanced
by the use of up-to-date laser instrumentation. This project will establish a
Laser Chemistry Laboratory to give undergraduates the experience of using state-
of-the-art equipment in a broad range of chemical subdisciplines. This ILI award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at Dartmouth to acquire laser instrumentation that will enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction and undergraduate independent research.
