Previous research has shown that Recursion Equations provide an excellent
Computer Hardware Description Language (CHDL). Currently this approach is not
practical because it produces simulators that are too slow. These investigators
plan to develop a program in the C language, which will lead to practical CAD
tools. They also plan to investigate compiling recursion equations into parallel
simulators for commercially available MIMD computers such as the Alliant and
Butterfly. This work will lead to practical CAD tools that are faster and easier
to use than the current ones.
