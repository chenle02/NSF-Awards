*** 9727040 Richman This project is a study of the formation of deep and bottom
water masses on the continental shelf off East Antarctica. In a collaborative
program with the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and
Southern Ocean Environment, a series of oceanographic moorings will be set out
in early 1998 and recovered in December 1998. This project will contribute two
current meters, temperature recorders, and temperature-salinity sensors to be
incorporated into the Australian moorings, and participate in the analysis of
the recovered data. The antarctic continental shelves are the source regions for
globally distributed deep water masses, particularly Antarctic Bottom Water.
Water intruding on the continental shelf is cooled because the atmosphere
extracts heat from the ocean at high latitude, and its salinity may be increased
because of ice formation. Newly formed sea ice is substantially less salty than
the ocean water in which it froze; the excluded salt thus raises the salinity of
the remaining water. Since both processes increase the density of the water mass
it will flow to the ocean bottom, driven by gravity. The rate at which deep and
bottom water masses are replaced is an important factor in global climate issues
such as the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the latitudinal
temperature gradient. The mooring site will be off the Mertz Glacier, where an
annually persistent area of open water enhances both ocean heat loss to the
atmosphere and ice formation. Both the deployment and recovery of the moorings
will be done from the Australian supply ship M.V. Aurora Australis. ***
