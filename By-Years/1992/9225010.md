9225010 Whinston The last ten years have witnessed a dramatic growth in the use
of computer networks. While the networking has grown in use, its management has
not kept pace. Poor network management (as caused by incorrect pricing or the
absence of pricing) can contribute to one of two effects: overuse and long
response times when prices are too low, and under use when prices are too high.
Poor network management prolongs new product design and delays decision making.
So far research has concentrated on either heuristic methods or sound economic
theory based methods to solve this problem for single processor, single user
cases. We propose to extend these theories to the multiple processor, multiple
user case. In brief, we will develop a "user transparent" mechanism for
efficient resource allocation in distributed computer networks based on our
previous research. We propose to test the mechanisms we develop in the form of
mathematical theorems or algorithms by implementing them in an existing network
simulation environment CSIM. During this simulation stage, the mechanisms will
be further refined, leading up to their implementation in actual industrial test
en vironments.
