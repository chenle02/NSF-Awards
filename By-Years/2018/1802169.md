The main purpose of this project is to bring to bear new methods for the PI's
ongoing study of certain spaces defined by polynomial equations, which have
proven to be fruitful ground for exploiting relationships between two disparate
kinds of objects, one from the world of analysis, involving infinite sums, and
the other from the world of geometry, involving the knowledge of how certain
subspaces meet each other. The path to such relationships, starting from the
classical work of Gross-Zagier, has greatly enhanced our understanding of
elliptic curve cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
study the intersection theory of higher codimension cycles on orthogonal Shimura
varieties with an eye towards Kudla's conjectures relating intersection numbers
with central derivatives of certain Eisenstein series. This will involve a two-
pronged approach: First, to define suitable generating series of such cycles on
integral models, and to show their modularity. Second, to develop a p-adic
analytic theory of Ekedahl-Oort strata, which can be combined with recent
advances in a rigid analytic intersection theory to compute the relevant local
intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
