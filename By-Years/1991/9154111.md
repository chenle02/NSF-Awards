The Encyclopedia of the Environment is a comprehensive reference for Grades 5-9
that promotes science education by sing the environment as a theme. It takes
advantage of trends in both state/federal education strategies, which
increasingly advocate environmental education, and in science reform efforts
(e.g., Project 2061), which advocate the use of major integrating themes. It
will be interdisciplinary, including science history economics, geography,
social studies, and humanities. It will be designed in two formats: conventional
books and interactive, multimedia "Compact-Disc-Read only Memory" (CD ROM). The
print version (publisher: Macmillan Publishing Company) will include twelve,
144-page, separately indexed full-color volumes, using case studies to integrate
topics. Sidebars will contain interesting facts relevant information,
explorations of science themes, literature, careers, and biographies. The CD-ROM
(publisher: Jostens Learning Corporation) will contain all print version
material, plus audio (sounds, speeches, narratives), possibly full motion video,
and simulations. It will be searchable through multiple paths, including topics,
picture/movies, problems, point-of-view, historical/geographic, and careers.
Also included will be a set of 20 off-line lessons, integrating the encyclopedia
into science and social science curricula and providing a model for curriculum
development. Contributing organizations include the AAAS, the World Bank, the
U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the U.S. EPA, and the National Gallery, the
Smithsonian Institution, and other government agencies. Simultaneous publication
will be September 1993.
