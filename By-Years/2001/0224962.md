The investigator and his colleagues study problems in the overlap&lt;br/&gt;of
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. A major goal&lt;br/&gt;is to
understand the structure of minimal free resolutions&lt;br/&gt;of homogeneous
ideals, particularly those defining &lt;br/&gt;zero dimensional schemes. Ideals
of interest range from ideals &lt;br/&gt;of fat points (motivated by their
intimate connections to questions &lt;br/&gt;about linear systems on projective
varieties),&lt;br/&gt;to ideals of generic forms (work on which is closely
connected to&lt;br/&gt;work on the Weak and Strong Lefschetz properties
&lt;br/&gt;for Artinian algebras, and, via Matlis duality, to work on
&lt;br/&gt;fat points), to ideals whose quotients are Gorenstein rings (and
&lt;br/&gt;hence involve problems on arithmetically Gorenstein subschemes
&lt;br/&gt;of projective space, and Gorenstein liaison). This broad range of
&lt;br/&gt;methods and motivations is a significant hurdle that young and
&lt;br/&gt;future researchers must overcome to do productive work&lt;br/&gt;in
this area. This grant aims to advance the training and career
&lt;br/&gt;development of young investigators and graduate students by
providing&lt;br/&gt;travel support to attend and interact with leaders in the
field at &lt;br/&gt;an international conference addressing the research cited
above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational issues underlie much of this research,
and machine &lt;br/&gt;computation is both an important tool in the research
described &lt;br/&gt;above and the object of some of this research. However,
work in this &lt;br/&gt;area can easily outrun the capability of any conceivable
computer, so &lt;br/&gt;theoretical studies are essential not only for
understanding the results &lt;br/&gt;of machine computations, but to achieve
results beyond the reach of brute &lt;br/&gt;force computation. This is, for
example, a significant issue for applications &lt;br/&gt;of the research
described here to interpolation. Large data sets are a&lt;br/&gt;common feature
of modern life, whether in science, technology or business.&lt;br/&gt;Such data
sets often involve functional relationships among various&lt;br/&gt;variables.
Among the most tractable functions are the polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;If one wants
to model relationships with polynomials it is helpful to know
&lt;br/&gt;theoretically how complicated the worst case such polynomial might
be&lt;br/&gt;(as measured, say, by degree), whereas it might be expensive or
impossible to&lt;br/&gt;determine this directly. Such theoretical results about
polynomials&lt;br/&gt;are what researchers aim for in studying minimal free
resolutions&lt;br/&gt;of homogeneous ideals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
