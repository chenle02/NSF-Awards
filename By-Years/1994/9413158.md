9413158 Top In this project, the PI will collect and analyze samples for Helium-
3 and Tritium on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections, I-1 (10degN), I-7N
(Arabian Sea), and I-9N (95degE and Bay of Bengal), as part of the WOCE Indian
Ocean Expedition (IOE). The objective is to describe and quantify the strength
of the thermohaline circulation, using the water mass isolation age information
inherent in the He/Tr distributions, and to evaluate the extent of ventilation.
