This award provides funds to support travel by U.S. academic scientists for
participation in the ICES Annual Science Conference, its Working Groups and
Workshops, Symposia, Theme Sessions, and Training Programs. Applications by
young and established scientists will be considered to assure strong and diverse
representation by the U.S. academic community in ICES
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is
important for the United States to maintain a leadership role in marine science,
in accord with the recent Presidential Executive Order on ocean stewardship, the
Ocean Research Priorities Plan and the goals of the U.S. Commission on Ocean
Policy. The new structure of ICES and its five Steering Groups that are focused
on science for ecosystem-based management provide opportunities for U.S.
scientists to engage in collaborative international research. NSF funding will
insure that U.S. academic science can exercise both leadership potential in ICES
and the ability to recruit young scientists into ICES activities. Funds also
will help to insure that the academic community is well represented, balancing
the strong input of U.S. governmental science, primarily through NOAA.
