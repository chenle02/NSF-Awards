9318952 Stone This project supports the historical ecological research of
several anthropologists studying how two peasant farming populations exploited a
previously unsettled land area of Nigeria. Using images from remote satellites
to document changes in land use, maps, censuses, and detailed ethnographic
studies of labor inputs to farming by peasant households, the project will
compare the different historical effects of culturally distinctive patterns of
land exploitation by two groups. Specific questions to be asked include
analyzing the differences between the two groups in their propensity to
intensify production and to abandon through land exhaustion different areas.
This research is important because land degradation is a critical problem in
many areas of the world, and the solutions to the problems are not simply
technological. We must understand local models of how people use land in order
to understand why some groups maintain and conserve land resources and others
exhaust them. This sort of intensive comparison will provide new ideas on how
traditional peoples exploit their agricultural land. ***
