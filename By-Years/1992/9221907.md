Theoretical research will be conducted to address problems in condensed matter
physics which are concerned with explaining and predicting the physical
properties of a variety of interesting materials which are currently subjects
for experimental studies and technological promise. The properties of these
materials are so unusual that new theoretical approaches and techniques are
often required. These will be developed based primarily on the methods of
quantum statistical mechanics. Thus research to be carried out has both
intrinsic theoretical importance and immediate experimental relevance. The
research will have impact on materials science, solid state physics and quantum
chemistry. The materials which will be investigated in this project include:
new, strongly correlated metallic and magnetic materials; heavy- fermion
materials; high temperature superconductors; disordered electronic substances;
and, quantum solids and fluids. In all of these subjects, the interactions
between the elementary constituents play a fundamental role. The theoretical
approach will introduce and elaborate models and methods which deal directly
with that central issue. %%%
