This award will support the participation of invited speakers, junior faculty,
postdocs, and graduate students in the ?Conference on One and Several Complex
Variables? that will be held at the University of Kentucky from May 8 to May 10,
2008.

The conference program will feature five fifty-minute plenary lectures by
established senior scientists (Roger Barnard, Peter Duren, Ian Graham, David
Minda, Stephan Ruschweyh). There will be twenty shorter (twenty-five minute)
talks, a substantial number of which will be delivered by young mathematicians
(graduate students, postdocs, not-yet-tenured faculty). The topics of the talks
will fall under the general heading ?Geometric Function Theory,? be it single-
variable or multivariate. The conference will close with a round-table
discussion of open problems and of directions for future research.
