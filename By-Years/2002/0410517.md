Mathematical sciences (21) This project is adapting textbook and modular
software materials for an applications-focused and technology-intensive course
on coding theory and cryptology to help "bridge" the passage of students to more
advanced courses in the mathematical sciences. Several sources of learning
materials are being drawn from projects at Williams College, the United States
Naval Academy, Cornell University, and Rhodes College (originally funded by DUE
- 9555113, that led to a published text) with an eye towards attracting students
early in their careers to further study in mathematics. The project team
involves cooperating faculty at Olin College (a new, gender-balanced engineering
college), Babson College (an established business college), Wellesley College (a
renowned women's liberal arts college), and Brandeis University (a comprehensive
university). In addition to the core mathematical sciences topics, the course is
addressing the technical, social, and historical aspects of coding theory and
cryptology. Students are also improving their communication skills through group
work and presentations, while broadening their horizons and improving their
teaming skills by working with peers from colleges providing very different
educational environments.
