The 10th Symposium on Thermophysical Properties is part of a well- established
series of symposia which are regarded as the most effective international forum
for workers in this field. Important current issues in thermophysical property
research are: (1) properties of composite materials; (2) properties of ceramics;
(3) thermophysical properties of supercritical fluid mixtures; (4)
thermophysical properties of coal-derived liquids; (5) aqueous systems; (6) new
experimental techniques; (7) phase-equilibrium phenomena; (8) high temperature
melts; and (9) non-equilibrium measurements. These areas will be emphasized in
the Symposium.
