This objective of this award is to improve the solvability of combinatorial
optimization problems by integrating information obtained from a partial
application of dynamic programming (DP) within valid inequality generation
schemes for mixed-integer programming (MIP) algorithms. Computationally, the
advantage of this technique is that one can execute a partial DP algorithm (up
to a tractable number of stages) for the problem at hand. The optimal state
values obtained in this process can then be used to provide lower bounds (for
minimization problems) on partial objective function values, as a function of a
small number of key variables. A deeper analysis of the technique reveals that
the process uses DP to project the MIP feasible region onto a key subset of MIP
variables. The state information obtained from the truncated DP execution yields
valid inequalities, which provide bounds on a portion of the problem objective
as a function of these key variables. It is hoped that these investigations will
shift focus from not only examining facet-defining inequalities for MIP
polyhedra, but also to generating inequalities that capture strong relationships
between a set of designated key variables and partial objective function values.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of important problems in production, supply chain
management and national security can be modeled as combinatorial optimization
problems. For example, the capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP) is solved in
numerous industries to make periodic inventory re-ordering and production
scheduling decisions. Unfortunately, this, and other combinatorial problems, can
be hard to solve. Preliminary analysis has shown the proposed solution method to
be successful at solving the CLSP. If successful, we hope the method can improve
the solvability of other hard, but important, problems in supply chain
management (generalized assignment and prize-collecting routing), finance
(knapsack) and security (node detection and network monitoring).
