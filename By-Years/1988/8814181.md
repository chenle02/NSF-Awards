Using a fine-resolution mesoscale model, Professor Mass and Dr. Ulrickson will
investigate how surface property variations affect diurnal flow in the Los
Angeles Basin. Numerous studies have shown that variations in albedo, roughness,
soil density, moisture availability, surface thermal conductivity and heat
capacity can generate mesoscale weather features, but none have shown the role
such variations play in an actual, complex setting. The research to be conducted
is an outgrowth of Dr. Ulrickson's Ph.D. thesis research in which a number of
the observed mesoscale features in Los Angeles Basin were simulated. A better
parameterization of surface properties is considered the next major improvement
on the model. This reserach should bring a better understanding of the
interaction between surface forcing and mesoscale circulations.
