Technology is advancing rapidly in such areas as genomics, bioinformatics, and
imaging, but not all species of plants and animals that are currently being
studied for important biological questions can be used with the latest
technology. This workshop will explore the need and importance of developing
tools for new or emerging model systems that will enable scientists to address
specific questions appropriate for understanding the complexity of life. This
workshop will facilitate the achievement of this goal by identifying the
"toolmakers" in the scientific community and the resources needed to develop
important tools for a broad range of species that are best-suited for studying
biological systems in a modern, integrative manner. At a broader level, this
workshop will bring together researchers from many different disciplines to
discuss what kinds of new tools and resources are needed. These discussions will
result in the formulation of a broad and coherent set of goals to advance many
different fields of biology. This workshop will include a great diversity of
scientists in terms of their rank, areas of expertise, and institutional types
and locations. In addition, scientists from groups underrepresented in Biology
will be represented at the workshop.
