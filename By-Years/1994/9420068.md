The technique of thermophoretic sampling coupled with electron microscopy, as
developed by the PI, has been extensively used in steady flames to help
elucidate the mechanisms of soot growth and oxidation. The objective of this
proposed research is to demonstrate that the technique of thermophoretic
sampling can be applied to forced flickering flames. Because of the time varying
nature of flickering flames, application of the thermophoretic sampling
technique takes on a degree of high risk, making this proposal an ideal
candidate for the SGER program. The PI hopes to optimize both the forcing
frequency and probing time so that meaningful soot samples can be collected from
these forced flickering flames. If this indeed can be shown to be the case, the
resolution to the question of why flickering flames appear to form significantly
greater quantities of soot as compared to similar steady flames should be closer
to a solution. This could be significant in the understanding of soot formation
in turbulent combustion since flickering flames are viewed to bridge the gap
between laminar and turbulent flames.
