9354379 Felder An evaluation is being conducted of a number of instructional
methods that have been shown by educational research to promote effective
learning, including cooperative (team-based) learning and frequent assignment of
open-ended problems and problem creation exercises in class and homework. Two
groups are being studied and compared---an experimental group consisting of
students who experience the proposed approach for several semesters, and a
comparison group containing students who proceed through the curriculum as
normally taught. The objective of the research is to demonstrate that the
systematic and repeated use of the specified methods can have a significant
beneficial effect on academic performance, retention, problem-solving ability
and creativity, and attitude toward chemical engineering as a curriculum and
career choice. The products of the research will include a body of data on over
300 entering engineering sophomores relating to their backgrounds, reasons for
choosing engineering, academic strengths and weaknesses, levels of confidence
and anxiety, academic performance, retention in engineering, and responsiveness
to different instructional methods. ***y
