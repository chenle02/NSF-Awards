The goal of this research project is to study the interplay between constraints
and mappings in interactions from XML to XML sources, or XML to relational data
sources. The approach consists of developing a language (or languages) that is
(are) sufficiently expressive to capture interesting classes of constraints,
structure and mappings, and techniques for reasoning about how constraints are
translated through these mappings. Using these techniques, algorithms for
reasoning about the correctness of mappings with respect to constraints will be
developed. Since an XML view also represents a mapping between two different XML
sources, one of which is virtual, the related question of how to map an update
on an XML view to the underlying data source will also be considered. The
results of this work will provide the ability to detect whether or not semantic
conflicts will arise before data exchange actually occurs, thus avoiding time-
consuming and unanticipated errors as data loading is performed at the target
site. The project is motivated by problems in bioinformatics applications
involving gene expression data sharing between projects in the Penn Center
Bioinformatics. Since data exchange occurs in many different application
domains, for example e-commerce, science, and government, the impact will be
broadly applicable to all these areas. The research performed will be included
in an advanced database course taught by the PI, and undergraduate students will
be involved in the research through a senior projects course. The results will
be broadly disseminated via the project's Web site
(http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~susan/NSF-IDM2005.htm).
