The grant explores the physical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline
metals with emphasis on the relaxation of shear bands and grain boundaries
respectively in these materials. The objective is to modify the relaxation state
of these defects by thermal treatment. The goal is to characterize the
structural changes using the state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopy
including high-resolution imaging and energy filtering. The materials will be
processed using electrodeposition and ball milling techniques. Various
properties such as the stored enthalpy, stability, hardness, strain-rate
sensitivity and diffusion behavior will be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results from the grant are expected to contribute to the fundamental
understanding of the structure of shear bands and nanograin boundaries,
modification of this structure, and the resulting property changes. These will
contribute to the knowledge base for structural&lt;br/&gt;applications of
amorphous and nanocrystalline metals such as in MEMS and NEMS technologies. The
grant helps to educate and train graduate students in state-of-the-art electron
microscopy and property characterization of structural materials.
