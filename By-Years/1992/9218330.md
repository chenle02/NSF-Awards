This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in ecology
between Doyle B. McKey, University of Miami, and Finn Kjellberg, at the Center
for Ecology and Evolutionary Ecology, Montpellier, France. The objective is to
study interactions in one of the classic cases of insect-plant coevolution: figs
and pollinating wasps. For fig/wasp mutualism to persist, the pollinator wasps
require flowering trees year-round as in tropical environments. The
investigators address fig/wasp mutualism in potentially destabilizing seasonal
environments as in more northern, subtropical climes found in Florida and
mediterranean France. They will conduct parallel experiments to characterize
wasp response to phenology, receptivity of individual figs and wasp behavior and
chemical attraction to figs. The collaborative arrangements enable the
investigators to pool complementary expertise and obtain comparable results.
Both Miami and Montpellier are ideal locations to investigate the responses of
fig/wasp mutualism to seasonal constraints. Because fig/wasp mutualism is a
model system for studying many questions about co-evolution, the results from
this study will make a major contribution to co-evolutionary studies in general.
