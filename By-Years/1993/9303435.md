This award will provide partial support for the international symposium on
Directions in General Relativity to be held at the University of Maryland,
College Park, during May 27-29, 1993. The NSF funds will provide travel and
subsistence for graduate students to attend the symposium, where they will be
able to interact with leading experts in the field. Present at the symposium
will be many of the theorists who are most active in general relativity. One of
the talks will deal with the LIGO project, which is being funded by the NSF.
