This proposal will support the continuation of the U.S. STEP (Solar Terrestrial
Energy Program) Coordination Office, established in December 1990. STEP assists
the U.S. science community in components in spacecraft, ground-based, rocket,
balloon and theory and simulation programs capable of studying the complete set
of coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer of matter and energy from
the surface of the Sun to the surface of the Earth. The continuation of this
coordination office at the University of Colorado will interact with domestic
science programs for the purpose of: (1) collecting and disseminating STEP-
related information and data, (2) coordinating joint campaigns for data
acquisition and analysis which meet the national and international science
objectives of STEP, and (3) organizing professional society meetings and special
sessions.
