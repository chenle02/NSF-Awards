Mechanical forces and mechanical perturbations have ubiquitous roles in
biological systems over different length scales, from molecular to subcellular
to cellular to organismal levels. The problems in this area are of
interdisciplinary nature, spanning engineering and biology. Understanding the
effect of mechanical inputs to biological systems has significant ramifications
in several areas of biomedical science and engineering, including, but not
limited to, cell biology, cellular and tissue engineering, and regenerative
medicine. The 2014 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference will
catalyze developments in this field by bringing together leading academics with
interests in experimental and theoretical aspects of multi-scale mechanobiology,
and by enabling and encouraging the exchange of ideas and interactions among
young and established investigators and among scientists with complementary
interests and expertise.
