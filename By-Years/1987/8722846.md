This is a unique conference in advanced research in VLSI, and will continue a
series partially funded by NSF since 1979 and meeting at major VLSI research
centers. The conference brings together researchers and students in all aspects
of VLSI design and systems research to discuss the latest advances in VLSI.
Participants will be from both universities and industries. The conference will
emphasize the interaction of a wide range of VLSI topics and their integration
into systems. Over the last several years there has been an explosion of new
ideas for the application of VLSI technology. This conference has played an
important role in producing a synergy across disciplines by bringing together
productive researchers from universities and industrial laboratories to discuss
the newest developments in the field. This conference will emphasize the most
advanced research ideas in VLSI systems. It differs from more traditional and
specialized conferences in its emphasis on interdisciplinary interactions. A
conference proceedings will be published and be available to the conference
attendees. The conference will play a role in focusing the research programs in
the new Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
