The proposed study will assess the state of smaller multi-user facilities within
the materials research complex in the United States. It will consider methods
for optimizing the use of existing resources, including consideration of
structural strategies and actions to provide services more efficiently, such as
consolidation of smaller facilities into regional centers. The study will
consider university and national laboratory facilities and possible some
facilities in the commercial sector. The study will also examine the ways other
countries manage smaller facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assessment will
include: (1) a definition of such facilities and their role in the scientific
complex; (2) collection of data on, and an analysis of, the usage, structure,
and cost-effectiveness of facilities currently in use; (3) an analysis of
verious models for facility operations, their effectiveness, and appropriate
metrics for success; (4) an assessment of opportunities for instrumentation
research in the context of facilities; (5) the educational role played by
smaller facilities; (6) the optimization of investment in smaller facilities,
including the reallocation of existing resources; and (7) the development of
long-range models for the support of regional centers.
