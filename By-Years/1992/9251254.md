This project will allow undergraduate political science majors at Grambling
regular access to a data analysis and computer lab for use in conjunction with
statistics and research methods courses to enhance data collection and analysis
skills, computer skills and general analytic skills for the minority
undergraduate student body (the student body at Grambling is nearly 98% African-
American). The statistics and research methods sequence, which figures
prominently in this project, will feature the hands-on development of small
manageable datasets (students are encouraged to collect primary datasets in the
areas of political behavior, national political institutions, or public
administration from sources readily available on campus or nearby), the
preparation of the data for analysis and all other steps necessary for correctly
evaluating data. Utilization of Exploratory Data Analysis techniques will allow
students maximum flexibility in their analyses.
