This proposal is the first in a three-phase initiative aimed at generating
planning tools and direct assessment measures for use on undergraduate research
projects. The purpose of Phase I is (1) to identify specific experiences and
skills that contributed to learning and competency in geoscience skill
development, and (2) to identify the processes faculty engage in when designing
their projects, categorize successful design elements, and codify assessment
methods used on past projects. Information gained in the proposed study will
inform the second phase of the initiative: development of a planning/assessment
protocol for use in geoscience and field-based undergraduate research projects.
