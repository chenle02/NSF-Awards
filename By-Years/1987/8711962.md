Studies of seasonal and interannual variations of rates of benthic processes
and the cycling of material across the sediment-water interface and their
relationship to particle fluxes are proposed. The research seeks to determine
the influence of seasonal changes in the input of particulate matter to the sea
floor on sediment reactions, fluxes of dissolved components across the
interface, biological activity as it affects sediments, and the preservation of
CaCO3 in the sediments. In this fashion we seek to evaluate the influence of
events in the surface ocean upon benthic rates and processes. The site chosen,
off Bermuda, is characterized by conditions found in many areas of the ocean
making the conclusions drawn applicable beyond the immediate study area.
Research on the factors governing the preservation of CaC03 in sediments on a
regional scale is also proposed. These studies are focussed upon evaluating the
effects on bottom water saturation state and organic matter metabolism upon
rates and the extent of post-deposition dissolution of CaC03. The studies would
be carried out on a transect of the east coast of the United States.
