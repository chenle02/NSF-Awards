Increasing demands on the strength and temperature tolerance for composite
materials will require innovative approaches in composition and fabrication.
Composite materials composed of single crystal whiskers show promising tensile
strength but have proven difficult to grow and have not been produced in useful
lengths. LaserGenics Corporation is proposing to investigate the growth of
single crystal fibers of VC and NbC by the laser- heated pedestal-growth
technique. Fibers of these materials will be grown, their morphology
characterized, x- ray diffraction and strength measurements made during the
Phase I effort. Single crystal fibers of multi-metre lengths of these very high
melting point materials will be the basis of a Phase I program. Composite
materials incorporating the fibers will be made, the effect the fibers have on
strength will be determined.
