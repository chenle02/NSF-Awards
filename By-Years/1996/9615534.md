The information-abundant user interface approach consists of two complementary
parts: organization and coordination of information. Users can semantically
organize complex information according to roles and relationships. Pieces of
information are accessible with partial knowledge of nominal, spatial, temporal,
and visual attributes. Users can explore semantic inter-relationships between
pieces of information and navigate large information spaces by specifying custom
coordinations between multiple filtered views. The research focus is on semantic
visualization and task-oriented interaction. The main contributions of this
project will be an improved understanding of psychological processes, a taxonomy
of user tasks, notations for describing multiple window coordination, and new
user interface techniques for information organization and coordination.
