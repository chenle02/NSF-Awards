Vulnerable populations are especially at-risk if they consume inaccurate
information about COVID-19. This project generates data and analyses that can be
used to better limit and control the spread of inaccurate information about
COVID-19 that targets vulnerable populations. The data shows how the amount and
focus of inaccurate information on several online platforms changed after the
initial outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, and how the information moved across
platforms and among different groups. The project examines how to potentially
mitigate the effects of inaccurate information about the pandemic on public
health, and in particular seeks to protect individuals in vulnerable groups from
relying on inaccurate information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project collects
data on online groups across multiple online platforms. Using a combination of
human- and machine-coding, the diffusion of inaccurate information targeted to
vulnerable groups across platforms is documented. Mathematical modeling is used
to understand the dynamics of how inaccurate information diffuses across
networks, as well as the relative potential effectiveness of strategies to
reduce its spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
