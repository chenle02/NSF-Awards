With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Gardella and his group at the State University of New York at Buffalo are
examining the surface composition of various model polymer systems. Using a
range of surface spectroscopic probes, the composition, polymer molecular weight
characteristics, and the surface reaction kinetics of siloxane- and
fluorocarbon-based polymer systems are studied. Copolymers, polymer blends, and
polymer/molecule mixtures are examined, with the goal of providing a
quantitative understanding of the relationship between surface structure and
composition, and the reactivity and properties of these materials. This project
includes an extensive effort to integrate research with the education of
undergraduate students and secondary school teachers.

An understanding of the composition and structure of polymer and polymer blend
materials is the goal of this research project supported in the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program. Information obtained from these studies is useful in
applications of polymer materials in microelectronics, packaging and
pharmaceuticals.
