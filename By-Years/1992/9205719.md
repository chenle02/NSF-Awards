This project supports the continuation of the dissertation research of an
anthropology student from Yale University in Tanzania, Africa. The project
studies the interrelations between pastoralists, foragers, and the local fauna.
The student will study subsistence strategies in a marginal environment by
analyzing how local people perceive shortages in resources and how these
perceptions affect their decisions and behavior. Using a combination of methods
including participant observation, intensive interviewing, surveys of human and
non-human behavior and data from remote sensing, the project will test the
hypotheses that risk avoidance is the primary cognitive factor affecting
decisions, while labor shortage is the primary socio- economic factor
constraining production. This research is important because human responses to
harsh environmental constraints must be understood if policies to ameliorate
human suffering and develop local economic and ecological systems are to be
successful.
