The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing
short-lived nuclear beams together with the development of instrumentation,
techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. Specific experiments will
emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms at very low
collision energies of neutron- and proton-rich light nuclei near the limits of
nuclear stability.. Much of the work is related to the synthesis of elements in
normal stars, as well as in supernova explosions and other extreme astrophysical
environments. The work primarily will be done at the University of Notre Dame
and will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of
Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and
students from several other (primarily undergraduate) colleges and universities,
most located in the Midwest . As in the past, the proposed work will have
applications in other areas using nuclear technology including medicine and
national security..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
