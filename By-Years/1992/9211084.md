Modern imaging technologies are capable of producing three- dimensional scenes
for use in scientific, industrial and medical applications, thus presenting the
need for image processing and image analysis algorithms designed for
manipulating 3-D volume data sets. Three-dimensional images in general, and
biomedical images in particular, present large scale computationally- intensive
image analysis problems especially amenable to parallel processing solutions. In
order to fully exploit high performance/supercomputing technologies and move
biological image processing to a parallel environment, two key research areas
must be investigated. The first is intelligent algorithm design for the most
efficient means of programming parallel processors. Parallel computing versus
sequential computing algorithms for 3-D biomedical image processing will be
studied utilizing a Connection Machine 2 (CM-2) 16k fine-grain single-
instruction multiple-data stream (SIMD) supercomputing node, a Stardent GS- 2025
four-processor vector computer and a conventional serial SUN Microsystems
reduced instruction set computer (RISC). The second topic to be studied is the
interprocessor communication bottleneck in large scale image processing. The use
of data structures and programming methods appropriate for efficient
manipulation of large data sets will be investigated. The algorithm design will
be generic, modular and flexible so that the software can be easily modified as
needed with hardware technology improvements. This can reduce the cost of high
performance processing and assist in bringing massively parallel computing into
the general scientific community for use as a research and teaching tool with
broader applicability. Results of this investigation will be applied to
biomedical images.
