9731321 Koke Southwest Texas State University provides a 60 month Teacher and
Student Development Through Research Experience project. The project consists of
two components. The first component provides research opportunities for up to 30
middle and high school teachers each year in the areas of biology, chemistry,
physics, mathematics, and technology. The teachers work with faculty
scientists/mentors on current research projects during an 8-9 week summer
experience and are supported to transfer elements of the research into classroom
experiences for their students. The second component engages 18 high school
students and up to 8 teachers each summer in courses and study leading to
mathematics research. Teachers also study learning theory and research topics in
order to develop modules incorporating mathematics research topics into their
instruction. During the academic year student/teacher teams develop research
projects and present them at a spring conference. Participants communicate
electronically with each other and a university faculty mentor. An important
element of the project is the phased shift of resources from NSF to
institutional support over the project life.
