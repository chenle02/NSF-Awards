Reinforced and prestressed concrete structures subjected to shear and torsion
are currently being designed by empirical or semi-empirical methods. No
satisfactory theory has yet been developed to predict the shear strength and
behavior of structures, such as shear walls and nuclear containment vessels
under earthquake or wind motion. The main purpose of this research is to develop
a general truss model theory which can take into account the contribution of
concrete, the constitutive law of cracks, and the softening effect of concrete
in structures. To establish the parameters required in the general truss model
theory, a minimum of 50 shear panels will have to be tested. Each of the panels
will be 250 x 250 x 12.7 cm. (98 x 98 x 5 in.) Since no suitable facilities are
available in the United States, the tests will be carried out at the Kajima
Institute of Construction Technology in Japan on the basis of research
cooperation.
