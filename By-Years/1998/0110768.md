Mitochondria have their own genomes, however, the majority of their proteins are
nuclear-encoded and the expression and import of these proteins requires a
highly regulated, two-way communication between organelles and the nucleus. To
date, it has not been feasible to isolate the elements of mitochondrion-nucleus
communication in plants. The missing component has been an easily scorable trait
for mitochondrial function, one responsive to environmental signals. Plant
mitochondria have a branched respiratory pathway with an alternative oxidase
(AOX) not coupled to proton translocation and ATP synthesis. Cold, wounding,
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and pathogen attack, among others, increase
alternative oxidase activity and Aox gene expression. AOX, in the laboratory, is
also a dispensable activity in plants, thus its levels may be genetically
modified and potential mutants lacking AOX activity recovered. Our research is
centered around the isolation of mutants in mitochondrion-nucleus signaling
using AOX expression to score for mitochondrial function. We have devised a
visual screen for impaired AOX induction after challenge by oxidative stress. To
complement this screen, we use microarray analysis to further characterize the
mutants, and to identify genes and gene clusters involved in stress-induced AOX
expression. Preliminary microarray experiments on mitochondrial gene expression
in Arabidopsis leaves establish that this approach can be successful. [Initial
data are available online: http://genome www4.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD under
experimenter "McIntosh"] To ensure complete coverage of the genome we will use
oligoarrays, cDNA arrays and directed "mitochondrial" arrays. Mutants in
conjunction with transgenic plants will be used to decipher mitochondrial
involvement in oxidative stress signaling and cell death, and the role of AOX in
the hypevirulence response. AOX and ROS involvement in cell death will be
studied through cytochrome c gene family (At-Cc) expression, cytochrome c levels
in the mitochondrion and cytosol, and cytochrome pathway activity.
