The project focuses on integration of two learning paradigms for modeling
stochastic visual patterns, and on developing a computational paradigm for
effective stochastic inference. The work will strengthen the move from
descriptive to generative models. Algorithms for learning and inference stronger
than those existing today will be developed. A few order of magnitude
improvement is expected for the mew methods. There is a good education program
that includes improvement in the curriculum and design of new courses. Strong
collaboration with industry and governmental labs will provide students with
interesting experience.
