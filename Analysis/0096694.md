. Abstract of the proposed activity. The Fred and Lois Gehring Special Year at
the University of Michigan 2001/2002 is devoted to Complex Analysis, Complex
Dynamics and their interaction. There are several Experts in Complex Analysis
and in Complex Dynamics at the University of Michigan, and in addition there
will be several senior long-term visitors and several junior faculty hired in
these areas and a good number of short term visitors. Also there will be two
conferences highlighting recent developments and bringing in experts from around
the world. 2. Abstract of Proposed Research. Many phenomena in nature and human
society, such as the weather, or the stock market, are chaotic and hard to
predict and analyze. In fact any time three or more entities interact, the
behaviour tends to have chaotic features as the interaction between any two of
them is constantly interfered with by the third and the effects of these third
person interferences accumulate and backfire. Large systems are beyond our
ability to calculate completely. One can only understand with complete precision
lower dimensional systems and then one can hope to infer from these which
phenomena can happen in larger systems. Complex dynamics provides the low
dimensional setting with the most tools available for such analysis. The theory
of complex analysis provides powerful methods for complex dynamics. It is also
exciting that complex dynamics provides tools back to complex analysis. So
getting these groups together for an extended period should have strong impact
on both areas. One of the main tools in complex dynamics is (pluri)potential
theory, which is a key area in complex analysis. Using Green functions from
potential theory one can get invariant currents and measures for the dynamics
via the complex Monge ampere operator. A basic problem here is that in some
cases it is difficult to define this operator due to the fact that one needs to
multiply distributions. Kobayashi hyperbolicity is another key concept.
Invariant regions which are Kobayashi hyperbolic gives rise to nonchaotic
behaviour because iterates are then a normal family. It is however difficult to
decide which regions in complex manifolds are Kobayashi hyperbolic. The best
results on the embedding problem for Riemann surfaces in C^2 use complex
dynamical techniques, but there are many open cases still. And these are only a
few of the topics that will be investigated by this huge group of researchers
