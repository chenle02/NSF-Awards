Abstract

Proposal Title: DNA Separation on a Chip by Lateral Electric Fields Proposal
Number: CTS-0302271 Principal Investigator: Anuj Chauhan Institution: University
of Florida

The objective of this project is to separate DNA molecules of different sizes
in microfabricated channels through the combination of pressure-driven flow
through the channel and electric fields orthogonal to the flow. The electric
field will concentrate the charged DNA molecules near the wall, while the axial
flow will tend to transport the smaller molecules with higher diffusivities more
rapidly down the channel. Operation in a cyclic manner should lead to an
effective separation of DNA molecules by size. Several variations on this method
are proposed to increase the efficiency of the separation. The current, standard
method for the separation of DNA molecules is through capillary electrophoresis,
which is effective for smaller molecules up to about 20,000 base pairs. As new
methods for sequencing larger molecules become available, the most difficult
step will be the isolation of DNA. The proposed separation method may be
applicable to molecules in the megabase pair range. In terms of the broader
impacts, separation of DNA fragments on the basis of their lengths represents an
important step in a number of areas of molecular biology, especially DNA
sequencing for applications in medical diagnostics and drug delivery. The
proposed strategy does not require any gels, and it could be implemented in lab-
on-a-chip devices. In the educational area DNA separation topics will be
included in transport courses, and outreach will include visits to middle and
high schools for demonstration e
