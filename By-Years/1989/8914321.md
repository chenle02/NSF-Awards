Condensed phase exciplex lasers have recently been demonstrated by the PI in
both solid and liquid phases. These lasers possess attractive properties such as
wide spectral coverage from the vacuum ultraviolet to the far red, broad
tunability and unprecedented energy densities (50 Kjoule/liter demonstrated).
Halogen-doped rare gas crystals, liquids and high density fluids, constitute the
simplest model systems for studies of reactive many-body dynamics.
Photodissociation, diffusion, recombination and charge transfer dynamics are all
amenable for rigorous scrutiny in these systems. The experimental studies are
aimed at obtaining the fundamental photodynamical parameters pertinent to the
design of condensed phase tunable UV and VUV lasers and the characterization of
lasing properties on the promising candidates. The work will pursue (a) systems
that may lead to the development of continuous and broadly tunable UV-VUV
lasers, and (b) development of high temperature (up to room temperature) solid
state, supercritical fluid lasers.
