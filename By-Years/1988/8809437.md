This research should further our understanding of how to build reliable
distributed systems. The proposed checkpointing algorithm emphasizes
practicality and should show that checkpointing is a practical way to provide
reliability in a working, general-purpose, distributed system. The algorithm
possesses a set of desirable properties that are crucial in such a system. Novel
solutions are provided to satisfy the conflicting requirements of these
properties. The algorithm also shows how checkpointing can be incorporated with
other well-established concepts in distributed systems, such as atomicity and a
modular architecture using shared memory for efficient intra-node communication
and message-passing for inter-node communication.
