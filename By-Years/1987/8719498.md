The question of how large amounts of rain are produced in the tropics without
involvement of the ice phase has intrigued cloud physicists for some time. A
field investigation to study this "warm rain" process was held in Hawaii in the
summer of 1985. An unexpected observation from the 1985 field program was the
presence of extremely large raindrops (diameters >5 mm) which formed in shallow
trade-wind cumuli. This observation is surprising from two standpoints. First of
all, it implies a precipitation process which is more efficient than formerly
was thought likely. Secondly, previous laboratory and modelling studies indicate
that drop break-up processes would not allow large raindrops to exist in as
large concentrations as observed in this data set. The Principal Investigators
will continue their research using this rich data set. Special emphasis will be
placed on evaluating the cloud-scale environment that produces large raindrops
from shallow clouds and to study the evolution of drop spectra within these
clouds.
