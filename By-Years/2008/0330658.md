This project will develop the architecture and components to automate
configuration and management of a large, mixed-use server cluster. The
cornerstone of the architecture is a cluster site manager called Cluster on
Demand (COD) that adds a fundamental new capability to manage a cluster as a
multi-purpose modular resource hosting different environments in isolated
partitions. COD will support secure isolation of multiple user communities,
pushbutton control over software environments subject to appropriate
authorization controls, and dynamic policy-based resource provisioning. The COD
design leverages widely used open-source components to support diverse hardware
platforms and software configurations, and to evolve rapidly with new
technology. The project will develop a COD software release integrated with
other components of the NMI software suite, and evaluate it through test
deployments at Duke University and MCNC, with grid connections to the NC
BioGrid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact - The
project will facilitate the deployment of clusters to advance science and
education, reduce costs and improve return on investments in cluster
infrastructure, and remove key barriers to sharing cluster resources across
organizational boundaries. The project will also provide research experiences
for graduate students and promote participation by underrepresented groups.
Among the students participating in the project are two female PhD students. The
project will also create opportunities for Duke's Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program to mentor underrepresented undergraduates
(primarily African-Americans) during summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;
