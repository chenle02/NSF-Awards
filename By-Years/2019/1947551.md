2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiences of maternal stress are
important mediators of the relationship between mental and reproductive health
and vary among women facing different stressors. Identifying the precise factors
that affect experiences of diverse mothers and how these, in turn, impact
vulnerability, is thus critical to informing efforts aimed at alleviating
maternal and infant health disparities. This project examines the experiences of
pregnancy among foreign-born immigrant women and native-born women who face a
diversity of stressors and supports during pregnancy. The research includes
presentations to disseminate results to community stakeholders and a white paper
to disseminate results to policymakers. The project will be conducted through a
Hispanic Serving Institution, offering research training for undergraduate and
graduate students from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research seeks to understand how
women internalize immigration-related stress and in what ways women's
experiences shape biological markers of stress. The research builds on the
theoretically influential, but often poorly operationalized, concept of
embodiment by examining the specific pathways that link experiences of stress
and individual histories to demonstrable biological markers of stress. These
issues will be investigated using a multi-phased design that includes analysis
of survey data, self-reported experiences of stress, biological stress data,
health records, and in-depth interviews. The research offers an important window
and a holistic perspective on concerns and the differential experiences of
immigrants and native-born women in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
