This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
polarization effects in mono-layers of evaporative deposited prolate metal nano-
spheroids in order to fabricate low-cost, high performance polarizing optical
coatings. Recent investigations of nano-spheroid arrays have resulted in a major
technical innovation for achieving high performance polarization in the spectral
region from 1300 nm to 1650 nm. Techniques for fabricating these polarizing
nano-spheroid (PNS) layers will be investigated in order to demonstrate the
feasibility of fabricating near-IR polarizing coatings. The research effort will
consist of assembly of test equipment for precision characterization of the
nano-spheroids, development of PNS mono-layers with high performance
characteristics, encapsulation of the PNS layers in a dielectric matrix and
demonstration of a multi-layer PNS polarizing coating.

Commercially, a high performance PNS polarizing coating will provide a low-cost
alternative to expensive glass polarizers now used in Optical Fiber
Communications components including optical isolators, high-frequency
modulators, and fiber tip coatings for Metro and Home optical fiber links.
