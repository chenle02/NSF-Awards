ABSTRACT HRD 0928213&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina Agricultural &amp;
Technical State University (NCA&amp;T) is incorporating Superpave Technology
into the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. Currently, the Superpave
Binder system has been adopted by all of the 52 State Highway Agencies including
those of Alaska and Hawaii. Since 2001, the North Carolina Department of
Transportation has required all asphalt mixes be designed using the Superpave
method. However, due to a lack of equipment, NC A&amp;T State University has
been teaching an outdated method (Marshall Design) instead of the Superpave
method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is acquiring Superpave asphalt binder
test equipment, including a Dynamic Shear Rheometer, a Bending Beam Rheometer
and a Direct Tension Test Device. The addition of this equipment is improving
the quality of undergraduate education, including development of learning skills
through laboratory experience. The use of this instrumentation is enhancing
students? understanding about Superpave technology and pavement design and
increasing students? competitiveness to pursue graduate study in the field of
transportation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These improvements are supporting North
Carolina A&amp;T State University in its effort to meet the highest educational
standards. The improved curriculum places students in a more competitive
position for employment and careers in the field of transportation and allows
NCA&amp;T to produce knowledgeable and effective engineers for the local, state,
and national job markets.&lt;br/&gt;
