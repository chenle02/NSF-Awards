Form 7 ABSTRACT ESI-9453694 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Ms Abbie Willetto
INSTITUTION: The University of Colorado, Boulder TITLE: Conference on the
Cultural Needs of and Strategies for Educating American Indian Precollege
Students in Science, Mathematics, and Technology This project is for a
conference to be held over three days and three nights to explore cultural
concerns and issues which prevent Native American children from fully
participating in science and mathematics. PI's from current NSF funded projects
who have significant Native American population will be invited to attend. (
about 30) In addition there will be another 16 Native Americans who have special
expertise in this subject who will be participant leaders. The conference will
generate guidelines to address cultural needs of Native Americans. A document
describing the outcomes, guidelines and recommendations will be published to
assist future PI's, teachers, and other interested parties as they develop their
teaching strategies and curriculum materials. The conference is to take place on
May 19 through May 22 at the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO.
