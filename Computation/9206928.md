The investigators undertake research in three areas of approximation theory:
wavelet analysis, multivariate splines and wavelets, and radial basis functions.
In the study of wavelets, beyond the mathematical analysis a major focus is on
applications to real-time (or on-line) time-frequency analysis. Hence the
investigators study the analysis and algorithmic and computational aspects of
spline-wavelets and non-orthogonal wavelet packets. In particular, they will
design a predictor-corrector algorithm along the line of the Kalman filter to
implement the spline-wavelet decomposition without truncation and to take care
of noise processes such as white noise. The research on multivariate splines
also extends to the construction of multivariate wavelets using box splines. One
of the most difficult problems is the study of minimum supports that give rise
to reconstruction sequences with minimum length. Again a predictor-corrector
algorithm will be implemented to avoid truncation of the decomposition
sequences. "Radial basis functions" is a tool that allows fiting both regular
and scattered data by continuously differentiable functions. Certain matrices
associated with interpolation and approximation processes arise in connection
with the data fitting. The investigators will study the "stability" of these
matrices. They also consider various aspects of the question of how rapidly the
approximating surfaces approach the underlying surface from which the scattered
data are sampled as the number of data points increases. The wavelet transform
is a tool that cuts up data or functions as well as their spectra into different
frequency components and then studies each component with a resolution matched
to the appropriate scale. For example, given a signal, one is interested in
"cutting" up its frequency content with local time-information. This is similar
to music notation, which tells the player which notes to play at any given
moment. Wavelets, wavelet transforms, and wavelet packets help in analyzing
signals and data. Wavelet analysis is useful in data reduction, which already
has been applied to high-definition T.V. Using wavelets, the investigators aim
at decomposing and reconstructing signals as simply and accurately as possible.
Another aim is to represent the underlying processes generating scattered data
by means of "simple" radial functions. This allows one to analyze and
extrapolate data, which is important for artificial learning devices.
