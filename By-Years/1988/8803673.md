This project is in the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative in the Office of
Special Projects in Chemistry. The objectives of this research are to understand
the physical chemical foundations of control of gene expression in living
systems. The general thermodynamic principles governing stability and
specificity of regulatory proteins and nucleic acids, and the important steps
involved in the association and dissociation of these macromolecular species,
are now reasonably understood in dilute solution under laboratory conditions.
This project will extend the this level of chemical understanding to the crowded
environment of the cell cytoplasm. This fundamental research will have
biomedical and biotechnological significance. Experiments will quantify a) the
chemical environment of the cytoplasm of E. coli and the variability of this
environment, b) the properties of and structures of DNA in this environment, and
c) the effects of the cytoplasmic environment on noncovalent interactions of
proteins and nucleic acids. In particular the project wil address the origins of
the in vivo-in vitro paradox in which protein-DNA interactions are highly salt
dependent in vitro and salt independent in vivo. This project is a renewal of
one previously supported by the Foundation.
