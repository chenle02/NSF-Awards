STAT-MAPS will develop materials for teaching statistics grades 9-12. STAT-MAPS
builds on the experience and results of SIM-PAC, a previous NSF/MDR project, and
will be done concurrently with STAT-LINC, a NSF/PTE project. The STAT-MAPS
instructional design is based on experiential learning through engagement with
problem solving activities. STAT-MAPS begins with statistical foundations for
problem solving, specifies learning objectives through its activities and
provides materials to implement the instructional strategies. The materials
development plan provides for extensive class testing and review. The expected
outcomes are a student text and activities manual, and a teacher manual and
teacher version of the activities manual. The materials are comprehensive,
giving special attention to the needs of the teacher as well as the student. The
materials are designed for use in statistics courses as well as providing units
for other courses. STAT-MAPS anticipates the commercial publication of materials
and provides an evaluation scheme for its work.
