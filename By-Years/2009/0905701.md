This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Evolutionary and
ecological determinants of community composition in Caribbean reef fishes" for
Dan Warren. The host institution for this research is the University of Texas at
Austin, and the sponsoring scientist is Dan Bolnick.

Despite decades of research, evolutionary ecologists are still left with major
questions about the interactions between species' ecology and their co-
occurrence within communities. This research program employs publicly available
databases to address fundamental questions regarding evolutionary ecology and
biogeography in reef fishes. Specifically, two questions are addressed: how does
ecological similarity between species at one scale affect similarity at other
scales? Second, what are the primary determinants of reef fish community
composition? This research contributes both to understanding of marine fish
community composition and to the methodological toolbox that future
investigators can use to study the evolution of communities in all systems. The
data set resulting from this research also helps investigators and managers
predict how future global climate change will affect reef fish distribution and
community composition.

Training plans include developing advanced skills in programming, Geographical
Information Systems, statistical analysis, and interpretation of ecological
patterns at multiple scales. The results from this research are being
disseminated through publications and presentations, and educational activities
include mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of
Texas-Austin. Other outreach activities include working with the Reef
Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) to discuss results of this research
and to promote citizen participation in data collection.
