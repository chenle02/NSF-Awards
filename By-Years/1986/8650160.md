This award funds a program for those teachers in the Greater Philadelphia area
who have little formal background in either physics or physics teaching. The
project will provide a repertoire of lecture- demonstrations and experiments to
be used in the classroom. The workshop will be offered to 20 participants.
Fourteen sessions, seven in the Fall and seven in the Spring, will be offered
during the late evening hours. Each session will consist of one hour of lecture
and two hours of laboratory work. Each session will present and explain basic
lecture material, demonstration material, and laboratory experiments. In
addition, participants will learn to maintain equipment, to use the computer as
a laboratory tool, and will have an opportunity to bring in and identify new
equipment.
