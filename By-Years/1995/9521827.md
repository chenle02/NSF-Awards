9521827 Mittal A Conference on Combustion, Environment, and Heating Technology -
The Role of High Performance Simulation will be organized by the Ohio
Supercomputing Center (OSC) in 1995. The OSC has organized a series of meetings
focusing on combustion sine 1991. The primary purpose of these meetings has been
to identify the needs of industry and the challenges it faces, to explore the
role of high performance computing and simulation in the design and analysis of
new combustion systems, and to promote better understanding of combustion
science. The 1995 meeting will be held at the Ohio State University during the
Fall of 1995 with a special focus on environmental consequences of combustion
process.
