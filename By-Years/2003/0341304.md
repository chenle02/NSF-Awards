NSF 0341304 Assured Software Composition for Real-Time Systems Vitek

This projects investigates fundamental issues involved in the construction of
scalable, reconfigurable, real-time embedded systems. The work focuses on
application of object-oriented technologies and, in particular, the Real-time
Specification for Java (RTSJ) to the domain of mission critical embedded
software systems. The specific outcomes of this projects are: (A) Configurable
Real-Time Java Framework: The technical foundation for the project is a new
framework for real-time Java execution environments called Ovm. The Ovm
framework allows domain experts to configure a real-time virtual machines to the
operational requirements of a particular mission, e.g. tune footprint or
predictability characteristics. (B) Automatic Configuration of Component
Families: Automatic techniques for adapting part of an embedded system in
response to changes in its environment, such as, hotswapping bug fixes are
studied. Behavior adaption is based on a combination of plugging and reflective
object techniques. (C) Integrated Testing and Verification: Software composition
requires strong assurance about the behavior of individual components and the
system as a whole. This project includes development of compliance tests for
real-time embedded systems wrt functional and non-functional aspects. These
results will be validated by synthetic benchmarks and representative
applications built on the NASA Mission Data System (MDS) testbed running Real-
time Java.
