&lt;br/&gt;ATE 0903148&lt;br/&gt;Green Building and Alternative Energy
Curriculum Infusion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the fastest growing regions
in the country, Southwest Florida is faced with many difficulties associated
with maintaining the critical balance between providing for an ever growing
population and the fragile environment in which that population must live.
Edison State College is heavily involved in efforts to raise awareness among
building and manufacturing professionals about the need to employ green building
materials, design and construction techniques through hosting conferences and
symposia. The college is leading by example to promote the use of
environmentally sound practices in construction projects in the region by
infusing curricula at both the secondary and postsecondary levels with
instructional activities that will ensure mastery of green building techniques.
Beginning in high school students have the opportunity to learn about the
environmental impact of construction practices through college credit courses
and summer camps. Through the use of the established associate degree program in
Drafting and Design Development, a new curriculum for green construction and
manufacturing is being developed. Students are further investigating the
regional impact of green building as well as the barriers to the adoption of
those building techniques through faculty guided research experiences. As energy
conservation becomes a priority for more and more communities, the efforts of
Edison State College to create partnerships between industry, government and
both secondary and postsecondary institutions can serve as a model for
dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
