This research project in the general area of quantum interferometry will
investigate interference phenomena at both the single and multiparticle levels.
A varied set of experiments will be conducted, all of which have as their focus
some property of entangled states or quantum measurement and communication.
Atoms, neutrons, and photons will be used as the interfering elements. The
experimental component will be accompanied by theoretical development in the
general area of quantum interference.
