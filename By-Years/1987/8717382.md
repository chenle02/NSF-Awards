The Manufacturing Studies Board will establish a series of committees to
analyze research directions and to develop a strategic research framework for
technologies specifically related to manufacturing. To accomplish this, the
committee will: (1) identify and prioritize manufacturing-related technologies
and disciplines to produce a comprehensive manufacturing research agenda for the
National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. research community, and (2)
conduct a series of analyses of the technologies and disciplines in the research
agenda to determine the current state of the art, research activities, and
needed future research initiatives. The resulting reports are expected to
provide the NSF, as well as academic and industrial researchers, with an
authoritative basis for focusing their research and funding activities. The
activities of the committees are intended to be steps in a dynamic process that
will adapt as technologies and the competitive environment change.
