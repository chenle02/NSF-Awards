9494160 Dockery The investigator studies wave phenomena in several singular
perturbed systems. The models come from biology and chemistry. Several important
topics are addressed. The first topic is to provide mathematical existence
proofs for traveling waves and standing patterns for these models. The methods
of geometric singular perturbations are used to ascertain these existence
results. Related to this topic is the study of the stability and bifurcations of
these waves and patterns. Another project is devoted to developing a predictive
model of biofilms. Some biofilms can serve beneficial purposes, while others can
cause extensive damage in the natural or industrial environment. Understanding
the processes and interactions occurring in these systems, and formulating
conceptual and mathematical models enable one to control biofilm processes, and
thus reduce their negative effects or enhance their positive effects. At present
an understanding of wave propagation in biological and chemical contexts is
quite limited, especially in comparison to wave phenomena in other physical
systems (water waves, acoustic waves, etc.). One reason for this is that the
equations are difficult to analyze. These equations typically exhibit a number
of different time scales, i.e., the systems are singularly perturbed. Despite
these difficulties, wave propagation in these systems is a very important
phenomena. By way of example, reentrant waves on myocardium are thought to be
the pattern of excitation responsible for ventricular tachycardia. The
investigator studies wave phenomena, motivated by several problems in biology
and chemistry. Of particular interest is biofilm modeling. In the vernacular, a
biofilm might be called slime or sludge. Biofilms occur in nature without human
interaction, or can artificially be introduced to industrial or natural systems.
Because of their pervasive effects on water quality, power generation, energy
eff iciency, and product quality, their negative effect is felt in most U.S.
industries. Biofilm processes can also offer distinct process advantages,
including capacity for higher process throughput, more efficient
separation/purification, and bioremediation of hazardous waste sites. The
potential of biofilm process control has yet been fully realized due in part to
a lack of fundamental knowledge of these processes.
