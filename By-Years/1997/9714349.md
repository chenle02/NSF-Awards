ABSTRACT OPP-9714349 VAN WOERT, MICHAEL OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH This project is
a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface
Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted
for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. A large array of instruments
will be deployed from a central camp surrounding the ship to measure ice, ocean,
and atmospheric conditions through a full annual cycle. This research will be
important for the determination of the effects of incoming heat radiating onto
the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The
SHEBA results will help determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to
adsorption of heat by the sea ice. These measurements are critical to
understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the
summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in climate.
This project will provide the research support at the ship and surrounding camp
and will include transport of instruments and supplies to the ship/camp, setting
up experiments, and providing transportation to distant research siteq. The
logistical infrastructure provided by this project makes an essential
contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers. The combined set of measurements
in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those
improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and the
permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could
occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
