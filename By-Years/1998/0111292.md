Professor Horacio F. Olivo, of the Medicinal Natural Products Chemistry
Department at the University of Iowa, is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of the synthesis of novel
marine macrolides. Professor Olivo is exploring the efficacy of the Ireland-
Claisen rearrangement of products derived from biocatalytic desymmetrization of
cyclopentenediesters to prepare substituted bicyclic lactones. Mild methods for
the generation of enynes via palladium-catalyzed coupling of
1,1-dihalo-1-alkenes with vinylstannanes and the chemoselectivity of bis-
haloalkenes in Ni/Cr coupling reactions are also being examined. Newly developed
methodologies are applied to the synthesis of callipeltoside-A and
auriside-A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much current effort in the field of organic
synthesis is directed toward the selective preparation of molecules with
precisely defined three-dimensional structures. Biological catalysis is an
attractive approach, given its potentially low cost and minimal environmental
impacts. By developing new methodologies for the conversion of products of
biocatalysis to useful organic molecules, Professor Horacio F. Olivo, of the
Medicinal Natural Products Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa, is
demonstrating biocatalysis as an efficient and low-cost method for the
generation of valuable intermediates in organic synthesis. With the support of
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Olivo is exploring
general synthetic methodology utilizing products of biological catalysis and
applying this methodology to the synthesis of several complex natural products
of marine origin.
