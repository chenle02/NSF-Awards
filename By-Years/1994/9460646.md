This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
improved accuracy in the observation of atmospheric water vapor, temperature,
and pressure profiles to permit better modeling of the atmosphere for weather
forecasting. This can be accomplished using Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL)
of water molecules at 1.9 ªm with a narrow bandwidth (ca. 50 MHz), tunable
infrared diode laser as an injection seed to a Q-switched, solid state laser. As
the first step in the development of this laser instrumentation, pulse
amplification of a tunable DFB diode laser over the range from 1.85 ªm to 1.95
ªm using a solid state amplifier will be investigated. In addition, overlap of
the solid state laser gain profile with water absorption rotational lines
suitable for accurate temperature measurements will be investigated. In addition
to use for obtaining atmospheric water vapor, temperature, and pressure profile
measurements using the 1.9 ªm water absorption band, the diode laser seeding
will be an improvement over the current laser technology for use in Doppler
LIDAR wind measurements operating at 2.01 ªm, which are not tunable and require
an intricate ring laser as the injection seed.
