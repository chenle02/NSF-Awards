ABSTRACT AST-9319895 Smith, Harding This proposal will support a 3-year program
of observational studies of the relationship between dusty active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and luminous Starburst galaxies. The two phenomena -Starbursts,
where rapid formation of massive, hot, young stars produces high luminous energy
output, and AGN, thought to be powered by gravitational energy as a massive
compact object accretes material at the nucleus of a galaxy-are found together
in many galaxies and there is an increasing body of evidence that there may be a
casual or evolutionary relationship between them. The focus of this research
program will be imaging and spectroscopic observations of Starbursts and AGN
using a newly developed mid-infrared imaging spectrometer, constructed at UCSD
by B. Jones and R. Puetter, on the 10-meter W.M. Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea,
Hawaii. Supporting observations, using University of California optical
facilities and national radio facilities will also be made.
