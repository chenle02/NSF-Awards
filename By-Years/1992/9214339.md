This award will provide one-half the funding required for the acquisition of an
X-ray powder diffraction system to be installed and operated in the Department
of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University. The University is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed. The modern X-ray diffraction system will be used by the PI,
colleagues, and graduate students primarily in the quantitative analysis of clay
and other very fine-grained mineral constituents of soils in research projects
in environmental science and in pedology.
