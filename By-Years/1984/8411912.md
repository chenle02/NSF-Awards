This study investigates the phenomenon of soil liquefaction induced by low
levels of ground shaking. The results of the engineering research on soil
liquefaction, to date, provide only a limited understanding of the relationship
between the earthquake intensity and soil liquefaction. The general assumption
is that liquefaction occurs at high earthquake intensities (for example, above
intensity VI in Modified Mercelli Intensity Scale). An investigation of this
phenomena is likely to provide new insight into understanding the liquefaction
process. A labortory test program will be conducted of cyclic triaxial
compression tests on very loose to medium dense saturated sands and conditions
will be determined that will trigger liquefaction. A correlation of the
experimental data will be made with the analysis results of liquefaction at
moderate levels of ground shaking. The results will establish the initial stress
conditions and the effects of superimposed dynamic stresses on the potential for
progressive failure of slopes.
