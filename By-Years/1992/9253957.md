As part of the efforts of a number of researchers to address the problem of
underrepresentation of women and minorities at the doctoral level in science and
mathematics, this investigator will test a model of determinants of PhD
completion by analyzing by logistic regression methods data on PhD completion
possessed by the National Research Council that can be linked to the records of
those applying to the NSF's Graduate Fellowship Program up to about 1981.
Variables such as completion or noncompletion of the PhD and time taken to
completion will be related to factors such as individual and demographic
characteristics, academic background, field of science, and market
characteristics for PhD hiring in and outside of academia. The effects of
receiving and not receiving a GFP award per se will be estimated. The analysis
of this highly select group -- those applying to the GFP -- will bring previous
work by other investigators by tracing PhD completion up to the mid- to late
1980s.
