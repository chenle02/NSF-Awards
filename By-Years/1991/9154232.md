A five-day workshop on recent developments in algorithmic number theory will be
conducted for 35 college and university faculty. The workshop will introduce
participants to topics that can be used to enhance undergraduate courses in
number theory, algebra, and the theory of computation. It will include ten one-
hour expository lectures by Eric Bach, computer assignments on the topic, and
discussions among participants about inclusion of these topics in their classes.
The lectures will discuss classical algorithms in number theory, algorithms for
finite fields, and methods for primality testing, factoring, and discrete
logarithms. Besides their intrinsic interest to number theorists, these
algorithms are useful in cryptography, pseudo-random number generation, and
computer algebra. Other applications will also be discussed.
