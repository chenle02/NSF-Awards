High-order discontinuous Galerkin methods are widely used in the simulations of
many scientific and engineering problems such as aeroacoustics,
electromagnetics, transport of contaminants in porous media, weather
forecasting, and image processing, among many others. These methods are known
for their flexibility in handling complex geometries, different boundary
conditions, and irregular meshes. In this project, the PI will explore the
flexibility of these methods in choosing the approximating functions that
preserve locally certain important features of the exact solution. This project
will comprehensively cover the algorithm development, analysis, implementation,
and applications of such local-structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin
methods, with the objective of obtaining new numerical methods that perform
better than existing ones in computational electromagnetics, computational solid
mechanics, and computational fluid dynamics. The proposed research will provide
projects for the training of graduate students and advanced undergraduates.
