9630458 PI: Seeds Neurons in the developing and regeneration peripheral nervous
system (PNS) must accurately direct their long thin axonal process toward a
specific target tissue. The path these axons take toward their target is often
blocked by other cells and extracellular matrix components. Studies will examine
the role of the extracellular plasminogen activator (PA) proteases in the
developing and regenerating PNS. Plasminogen activators are protein degrading
enzymes that are secreted by migrating neural crest cells, and sensory neurons
of the PNS. These PAs bind with high affinity to a receptor on the surface of
sensory neurons, where PA is thought to facilitate axonal growth and
regeneration by cleaving cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions that block the path
of the growing neuron. The dependency of sensory neuron axonal growth and
extracellular matrix degradation on these PA proteases and their cell surface
receptors will be assessed in 3-D cultures of extracellular matrix proteins
using cells from mutant mice that lack the genes for these PA proteases and
their receptors. Another approach will determine the importance of these
extracellular proteases in nerve regeneration for both pain and pressure
sensitive neurons in these same PA-deficient mutant mice. These studies will
provide a greater under standing of the cellular mechanisms by which neuronal
axons grow to their synaptic targets in both the developing and regeneration
peripheral nervous system.
