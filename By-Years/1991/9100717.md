Currently, hazardous waste is staged for retrograde outdoors at the hazardous
waste storage yard at McMurdo Station. At this storage yard the materials are
exposed to the elements of cold, wind blown snow and surface water runoff.
Further, spill containment and security are minimal to non-existent. A modern
hazardous waste storage facility/building would improve the handling and
managing of hazardous waste. The Army Corps of Engineers will design a hazardous
waste storage facility/building which will be an improvement over the current
situation. The Army Corps of Engineers will use design criteria and past
experience to see that the facility/building will be properly designed and
constructed.
