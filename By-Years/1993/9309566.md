9309566 Fox The objective of this research is to develop a multi-dimensional
creep model for soft soils based on definitive laboratory experiments.
Laboratory creep tests will be performed on an inorganic clay and a fibrous peat
under oedometer, triaxial, simple shear and cuboidal (true triaxial) shear
conditions. Data from the experimental program will be analyzed to determine the
nonlinear mathematical relationship between effective stress, strain and strain
rate tensors during multiaxial creep displacement. The developed theory will
account for soil cross isotropy, coupled effects between axial, lateral and
shear strain rates and the dependence of creep rate on intermediate principal
stress. Experimental data for the peat will be compared with numerical
simulations using a newly developed discrete element model for organic soils.
