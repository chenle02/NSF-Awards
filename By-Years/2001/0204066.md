This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the
dynamics of mechanoreception in fish." Fish can perceive mechanical vibrations
even when water flows over the body during swimming. Both the swimming motion
and mechanical stimuli generate forces on mechanosensory structures on the
surface of the body. By integrating experimental and computational approaches,
this work examines how these forces vary with stimuli and with the swimming
motion.
