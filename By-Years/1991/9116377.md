This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the catalytic antibody
work of Professor Kim Janda at Scripps Clinic. Specifically tailored antibody
catalysts for the synthesis of organic and biological molecules will be made and
studied. Antibodies which will survive in water miscible/immiscible solutions
will be made and examined. Haptens will be synthesized which are designed to
elicit antibodies which can catalyze peptide bond formation and the catalytic
properties of the resulting antibodies will be studied. The use of antibodies to
catalyze ring forming reactions will also be explored. %%% The ability of
antibodies to increase the rate of organic and biological transformations will
be examined. The immune system of mice will be induced to produce these
antibodies by injection of molecules which correspond in structure to the
highest energy point between the starting materials and products of these
transformations. These studies are important since they will provide proteins
designed to catalyze specific reactions for which no natural enzymes are
available.
