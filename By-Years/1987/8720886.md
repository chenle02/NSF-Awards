The goal of this project is to establish a high resolution isotope stratigraphy
for the late Carboniferous using marine deposits from the south-central portion
of the North American continent. Earlier work (Grossman et al., 1985; Adlis et
al., 1987) on Virgilian (late Pennsylvanian) cyclic deposits in north- central
Texas has shown that original isotopic composition is preserved in many calcitic
shells of marine organisms. The availability of such material provides a unique
opportunity to develop a near-continuous isotopic record for the latest
Carboniferous and earliest Permian (a 15-20 million year time interval). Such a
record, with proper paleontologic and sedimentologic control, can be used 1) to
document secular variation in the 18O of seawater, 2) top determine changes in
paleotemperature and paleodepth of the sea floor at the time of deposition, and
3) using paleodepth data, to determine the magnitude of late Carboniferous
eustatic changes in sea level. Distinguishing the 18O record paleotemperature
trends from changes in the 18O of seawater has always hampered isotopic studies.
Detailed paleontologic and lithologic data to distinguish isotopic trends caused
by local salinity change, or temperature change associated with changes in
paleodepth, from isotopic trends derived from changes in seawater 18O associated
with glaciation will be used. As a further check on depth effects we will
determine a separate isotopic curve based on thick-shelled brachiopods from the
zero depth horizon. This methodology will permit quantification of the eustatic
sea level changes that produce Carboniferous cyclic deposits, but more
importantly, will produce an isotope stratigraphy for testing and extending the
emerging cycle stratigraphy of the Carboniferous and Permian, eventually leading
to a global isotopic event stratigraphy.
