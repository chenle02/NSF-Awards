Over the last two decades, the interest and research in the benthic and nekton
communities of the polar regions has advanced to the point where remote sampling
and observation are limited in the specific kinds of data that can be recovered.
Dividing technology has advanced to the degree that first-hand observations and
experimental manipulations are possible in the shallow water areas of these
previously inaccessible regions. While the initial diving investigators were
subject to great hardship, advances in diving equipment have allowed access to a
greater number of persons, many with very limited knowledge or experience with
such diving environments. The accumulated experience in these diving
environments lies primarily with a handful of scientific divers who have
informally passed on the experience to the novice participants. As the number of
investigators increases, the dissemination of this information becomes more
difficult and the risk of accidents increases. While the safety record for
scientific diving operations has to date been excellent, it is the result of the
organized, formal training programs of a general nature at the institutional
level. In general, these programs do not provide a level of training for polar
environments adequate for the accomplishment of cost- effective diving
operations during the participants first exposure. This Polar Diving Workshop is
designed to provide a vehicle that will allow the dissemination and practical
exchange of specific information on the unique requirements of scientific diving
operations in polar environments through classroom lecture and in-water
sessions. The proceedings of the workshop will be assembled and printed,
providing a source document for research diving activities in such environments.
