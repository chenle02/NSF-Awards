ESI-9452794 Phil J. Gersmehl A CD-ROM and associated software and data bases
are being developed for use in teaching geography of the United States in
secondary schools. This project is based on a previously funded NSF project,
Activities and Readings in the Geography of the United States (ARGUS), which is
presented in a print format. The CD-ROM will have four key components:
photographic images that will bring selected aspects of the world into the
classroom for description and analysis; maps and graphs that will summarize the
geographic patterns of phenomena and illustrate theories that geographers have
developed to explain those patterns; short animations that will lead viewers
around the images, maps, and graphs and make transitions between them, for
example by highlighting an earthquake fault in a photograph or showing how data
in a table apply to a specific location on a map; simulations and supporting
data tables that will encourage and model active exploration within the context
of a problem situation. The materials are being developed in focused modules
that can become the basis of a course on geography or be used as units in a
number of courses.
