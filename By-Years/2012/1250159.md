This award will defray costs associated with hosting the 31st Annual Technical
Conference of the National Association of Black Geologists and Geophysicists
(NABGG) in Washington DC (September 5-8, 2012). An important goal of NABGG is to
encourage students of color to pursue baccalaureate and advanced (MS and PhD)
degrees in STEM fields in order to help provide a competent and diverse
workforce in these economically critical areas for the 21st Century and the
conference will provide an opportunity for mentoring underrepresented students
in the Earth and environmental sciences. The planned conference will have wide-
ranging technical programs, career success workshops for students, and
interactive exhibits with appeal to professionals, students, and science
educators in the Washington DC are. The theme of the conference will be Focus on
Environmental Change, emphasizing innovations in geosciences that facilitate the
understanding environmental change. Faculty from the University of Arkansas and
University of California Museum of Paleontology will facilitate student
participation at the conference.
