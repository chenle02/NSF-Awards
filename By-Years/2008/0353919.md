The award from the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Virginia for the summers of
2004-2006. The PI is James N. Demas and Milton Brown is the co-PI. Faculty
members from the Department of Chemistry will provide research projects in their
area of specialty. The students will be from small liberal arts colleges and
HBCUs. Research work will be supplemented with training in computer software
tools, notebook procedures, written and oral communication skills and scientific
ethics. Progress will be monitored by weekly meetings, interim talks and
reports, a final written report and a talk presented at a mini symposium.
Students will complete a post program evaluation questionnaire.
