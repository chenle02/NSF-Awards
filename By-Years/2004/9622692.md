9622692 Kurfess Modern machining facilities can produce parts with complex and
precise geometry, but high precision coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are
still needed to validate these geometries. The CMMs measure Cartesian
coordinates of points on the part surface, and these points are fit to nominal
part geometries using criteria like mini-max or least squares. These methods
yield conflicting or inconsistent results because measurement uncertainty has
not been addressed by the analysis. This research will develop methods that
relate multivariate confidence intervals, the optimal location of point
measurements for a feature, and the number of points in a way that maximizes
information content. An experimental program, in cooperation with industry, will
test these advances in processing CMM data. This research impacts both
productivity and quality in manufacture. For example, one application of this
methodology is to specify the number of points to be collected on the CMM based
on time or cost constraints, and then generate a sampling plan and an estimate
of the confidence regions for the measured features. Alternatively, if a
specified degree of accuracy is needed, then the methodology can provide a
sampling plan for making measurements and specify the number of points needed to
achieve a the specified confidence region.
