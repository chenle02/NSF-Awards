Numerical modeling of physical processes related the aurora and substorm
dynamics in the earth's magnetosphere will be studied. A numerical model will
address the question of acceleration of auroral electrons. Appropriate boundary
conditions and the role of collisions will be included in the calculations. The
study of the transport of plasma (especially heavy ions) from the ionosphere to
the plasma sheet will be conducted. The model should be able to explain the
presence of O+ ions in the plasma sheet. The convection electric field can
accelerate the ions over the polar cap. The role of ions in the substorm
dynamics will be established by the numerical model. A magneto-inductive
particle code will be used to model field- aligned currents. The model includes
the effects of non- adiabatic particle motion in the self-consistent magnetic
field. This model should be able to provide information on the storm- time
interaction between auroral electrojet and the near-earth plasma sheet. The
results from this model calculations will be useful in understanding current-
driven ion cyclotron heating in a converging magnetic field. Information on the
ion conics and micro-double layers also will available from this model.
