Machine vision technology is an important component of factory automation. At a
time when American manufacturing seemingly has lost its competitive edge and
reputation for quality, machine vision can provide cost-effective solutions to
alleviate these problems. Unfortunately, making this technology work effectively
and reliably on the plant floor has been an unexpectedly difficult and
troublesome task. Linear-camera based systems can be an effective solution for
such problems and is the focus of this research. In particular, this work
addresses the current limitations of linear camera systems to enhance the low-
level image processing capabilities, research into dedicated high-performance
processor for intermediate-level processing and develop suitable optimized
algorithms for linear camera systems. The selection and implementation of
appropriate hardware elements are made with the realization that programming is
usually a very significant part of the overall cost of application development.
