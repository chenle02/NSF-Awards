IIP 0934400&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Ruzic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign (UIUC) iis planning to join the existing multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "The Center
for Laser and Plasma for Advanced Manufacturing" which was created in 2002. The
center was initially established as a single university center and currently has
grown to a multi-university center with participation from the University of
Virginia (lead), the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and the Southern
Methodist University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the center's
research has been in laser applications for advanced manufacturing. Some of the
center's research activities have included laser removal of oxides, laser micro-
machining of titanium, laser microtexturing, optical sensor for laser welding,
micromachining of aluminum alloys and carbon nanocomposites. The addition of
UIUC would strengthen the plasma component of the center and bring in a more
diverse industrial base. The research at UIUC will cover a wide spectrum of
plasmas and plasma manufacturing techniques, and the proposed site's research
plan will center around three research thrusts: development of large scale
plasma deposition system, directed etching assisted by lasers, and atmospheric
plasma induced polymerization. In addition, UIUC will work towards solving a
multitude of research problems in plasma manufacturing that are both near-term
and long-term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort at UIUC will broaden the many
years of plasma-related research into the rapidly expanding arena of
lasers/plasma assisted manufacturing. The proposed center will offer new
opportunities for industry partners as both short term and long term engineering
problems are solved. Industry partners can use the technology to develop new
markets, improve product quality and performance, and reduce manufacturing
costs. The proposed project also provides undergraduate and graduate students
the opportunity to collaborate with industry, and expand their problem solving
and research skills. Results of the research will be disseminated through
publications and presentation in reputed journals. UIUC also has a postdoctoral
plan in place to enhance the post-doc experience. &lt;br/&gt;
