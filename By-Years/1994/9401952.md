9401952 Rocca There is significant interest in the development of compact and
efficient sources of coherent and incoherent x-ray radiation for existing and
emerging applications. Our previous research has studied the generation of
highly ionized plasma columns of =200um diameter with electron temperatures of a
few hundred eV and good stability utilizing currents that are 1 to 2 order of
magnitude lower than those commonly used to create hot plasmas in large pulsed
power generators. Building on these recent results, which include the
observation of emission from the 3p-3s laser candidate transitions in neon-like
Ca in a 40kA discharge, we propose to advance on the search for soft x-ray
amplification in the plasma of fast capillary discharges. The proposed research
also includes the study of the conversion efficiency of the electrical stored
energy into incoherent x-rays to explore the feasibility of developing an
efficient incoherent x-ray source. ***
