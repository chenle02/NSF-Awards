The objectives of this project are twofold: 1) to revise the existing models of
Holocene vegetational cover and climate change along the prairie-forest border
in eastern Iowa and 2) to reconstruct the history of stream behavior and soil
development in a region where the effects of vegetation and climate can be
compared. This is a cooperative project between investigators at the University
of Iowa and North Dakota St. University. They will analyze pollen, plant
macrofossils, bryophytes, mollusks and insect remains in samples collected along
two streams in eastern Iowa. The samples from the stream cuts span at least the
last 12,500 years. This research is important because it will resolve
discrepancies in our climate reconstructions for the Holocene in this region and
it will provide the first complete Holocene sequence containing these fossil
taxa.
