Plants capture the energy of the sun in the process of photosynthesis, but this
is an inefficient process that limits their growth potential. Some bacteria have
specialized structures (called carboxysomes) that increase their efficiency of
photosynthesis, and if carboxysomes can be introduced into crop plants such as
rice, wheat and soybeans it is anticipated that this would improve their growth
and yield. The smaller the number of proteins that are needed to reconstitute
functional carboxysomes, the easier it will be to succeed. The goal of this
project is to combine the roles of two carboxysome proteins into one; in other
words, one protein will play two essential roles by combining structural and
enzymatic functions. It is proposed to develop two types of bi-functional
carboxysome proteins: one that will help deliver carbon dioxide to the interior
of the carboxysome, where it will be available to RUBISCO, a key enzyme of
photosynthesis; the second will detoxify a molecule (2-phosphoglycolate) that is
formed as an unwanted by-product of chemical reactions that compete with
photosynthesis.

Broader Impacts: This project will provide interdisciplinary training in
biochemistry, protein chemistry and synthetic biology to a postdoctoral fellow
and to undergraduate students. In addition it will explore innovative approaches
to the engineering of structures such as the carboxysome and has the potential
to improve crop yields for both food and biofuel.
