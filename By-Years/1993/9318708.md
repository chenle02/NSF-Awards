9318708 Snell Dr. Snell proposes to study cell fusion in the biflagellated alga,
Chlamydomonas. During the mating reaction of this unicellular organism, gametes
of opposite mating types initially adhere to each other via adhesion molecules,
agglutinins, on their flagella. Adhesion and fusion of the cell bodies of the
two interacting gametes occur at the tips of protuberances termed mating
structures, whose activation at the apical ends of the cell bodies is induced by
signals generated during the initial flagellar adhesion. The activated mt minus
mating structure is a dome-shaped, apical swelling of the plasma membrane,
whereas the activated mt plus mating structure is a microvillus-like, actin-
filled tubule called the fertilization tubule, that extends several microns from
the surface of the mt plus gamete. Dr. Snell will use an integrated approach to
identify and characterize the molecules on these fusion organelles that bring
about their adhesion and fusion. He will isolate mt plus fertilization tubules
and apply biochemical and immunological methods to identify the membrane
proteins that are responsible for adhesion/fusion with the tip of the mt minus
mating structure. These experiments will be complemented by both biochemical and
molecular genetic studies on mutants with non-adhesive fertilization tubules,
including new fusion-defective mt plus mutants generated in his laboratory by
insertional mutagenesis. Dr. Snell will clone the genes that were tagged by the
inserted DNA and will study their role in cell fusion. The distinctive
properties of these fusion organelles in Chlamydomonas, along with excit ing new
developments in molecular methods for studying this organism, offer a unique
possibility for learning more about the molecular and chemical mechanisms
underlying fusion of cellular membranes. *** ( 4 ( 9318708 Snell Dr. Snell
