0201872&lt;br/&gt;Clark&lt;br/&gt;Support provided for this design project at
the University of Massachusetts-Lowell will make possible senior level
engineering design projects involving the application of computer and
electronics technologies to the specific needs of persons with disabilities,
thereby enhancing the quality of life of those
individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The individual design projects involve the
work of l-4 senior students, each of whom must visit and communicate with their
client. Through these meetings, a specific definition of the needs and therefore
the specific objectives of the student design project are formulated. The
students then develop project schedules and budgets and within one academic
semester generate a solution to the need. Assistive devices or software
resulting from successful projects are delivered, at no cost, to the client.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assistive Technology Program where the students work
has been in existence for the past ten years. This design project is a
continuation of the work that has been supported by the National Science
Foundation for the past six years. &lt;br/&gt;
