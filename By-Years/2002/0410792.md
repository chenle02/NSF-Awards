This project is focused on the accurate, reliable numerical simulation of
viscoelastic fluid flow. Such fluid flows are ubiquitous in our every day lives,
from the flow of blood in our bodies to the production of polymeric material
(such as plastics). Calculations are routinely performed to simulate such flows
however the results are very limited due to the large number of unknowns
necessary to compute an accurate solution, and the often failure of the solution
algorithm to converge. This research will address these problems by (i)
developing accurate and stable discretization algorithms, and (ii) developing
reliable solution algorithms for the resulting linear/nonlinear algebraic system
of equations.

Through our interactions with the (NSF sponsored ERC) Center for Advanced
Engineering Fibers and Film, results from this research will be immediately
available for incorporation into simulation software currently being developed.
Polymer processing is a multi-billion dollar industry. Improvements in the
accuracy and reliability of viscoelastic fluid flow simulations will strengthen
the USA's competitiveness in this important area by helping improve current
manufacturing processes.
