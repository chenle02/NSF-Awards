The Summer Intern Program at the College of William and Mary's Virginia
Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) introduces undergraduate students to the
complex environmental issues facing coastal ocean and estuarine systems
globally. With funding from the Division of Ocean Sciences, VIMS will host
twelve students each summer for a ten-week internship. Student participants are
recruited from throughout the United States and include individuals from
underrepresented groups and those from colleges and universities where research
experiences are limited. Students who are accepted into the program contribute
to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research projects
and participation in ongoing long-term research. They receive a stipend, housing
and travel expenses to attend the program. In addition to conducting independent
research, students receive training in professional skills such as
communication, scientific writing, public presentations and scientific ethics.
Through this intern program, a total of thirty-six U.S. students will have
opportunities to participate in coastal ocean science research and career
development activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the coastal ocean science
theme, internships are available in the areas of marine ecology, biological and
chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography,
and marine policy. The coastal ocean is an accessible natural laboratory, faces
significant environmental pressures and is of high socio-economic and aesthetic
value to the nation. A high percentage of the students who have participated in
prior REU programs at VIMS are enrolled in graduate school, have obtained
advanced degrees in science and/or continue to work in a scientific or technical
career. Thus, the program provides an important contribution to the nation's
scientific and technical workforce.
