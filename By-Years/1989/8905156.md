The studies outlined in this proposal are designed to provide information on
the roles played during Xenopus development by the src proto-oncogene product
pp60{superscript c-src} (pp60). Src is a member of a gene family which encodes
protein-tyrosine kinases of a non-receptor type. Immunocytochemical methods will
be used to identify the types of cells that contain pp60, and to examine the
correlation of this presence with different developmemtal processes in these
cells. Oocyte and developing embryo phenotypes induced by pertubation of pp60
cellular localization and activity will be investigated. Particular attention
will be paid to oocyte maturation and nervous system maturation, which are
likely to be sensitive to pp60 function. The results of this work should provide
detailed information on the function of pp60, and increased knowledge of the
general functions of cellular protein-tyrosine kinases.
