9731136 Kelemen This award will support the participation of United States
scientists in a cooperative project with Japanese colleagues to use a research
submersible to study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The scientific objectives of the
project are to examine an area of the ridge where mantle rocks are located at
the seafloor. Either the formation of normal ocean crust is significantly
reduced in this area, or faulting has exposed lower crust and upper mantle. The
U.S. scientists will specifically be focusing on geochemical studies of the
recovered samples to understand their formation history. Data from this project
will also be used to identify sites for future crustal drilling. ***
