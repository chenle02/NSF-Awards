Abstract HILDEBRAND, R. H. AST-9614886 Funds will be used for a series of
improvements to the University of Chicago polarimeter, Hertz, which should
greatly extend the range of objects that can be investigated. An undersized
filter is to be replaced, anti- reflection coatings are to be installed, an
inefficient polarizing beam splitter is to be replaced, and provision is to be
made for operation of the detector at a lower temperature. New, high-
responsivity detectors are also to be tested and a continuously rotating half-
wave plate will be developed to permit new modes of operation.
