Elliptic boundary value problems occur in many disciplines. In cases where the
boundaries are complex and irregular, these problems are recast as integral
equations and solved by boundary integral equation methods. This technique
requires the solution of a linear system. In many problems of practical interest
these systems are large enough that the computational effort required for their
solution is prohibitive. In recent years, vector supercomputers have expanded
the range of problems which may be solved numerically but there remains a
significant number of problems which lie beyond current capabilities. The
combination of parallel supercomputers and powerful iterative methods holds the
promise of expanding the territory of solvable problems. This SGER project
addresses both aspects of this combination. An O(N) algorithm which was recently
implemented on serial and vector machines will be implemented on a parallel
architecture, and the existing repertoire of iterative methods will be expanded
to uniquely augment the power of the O(N) algorithm.
