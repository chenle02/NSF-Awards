The purpose of this research is to obtain in situ temperature and freezing depth
data at the Town of Hubbadston municipal waste landfill, in Hubbardston,
Massachusetts. The temperature profiles in the landfill cover as a function of
depth, and thus the number of insitu freeze/thaw cycles the cover experiences
will be studied. Samples will be obtained from the cover to determine the
hydraulic conductivity. The insitu change in hydraulic conductivity will be
compared can be compared to the laboratory change in hydraulic conductivity due
to freezing and thawing. Such data is not readily available and will be of great
value in geoenvironmental technology.
