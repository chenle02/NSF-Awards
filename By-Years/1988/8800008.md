This research will be supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The research will develop the chemistry of a class of sulfur containing
molecules as a new synthetic pathway to the synthesis of molecules containing
polycyclic systems. The development of these reactions will result in new
methods for the preparation of the complex materials needed in medicine and
agriculture. The chief objective of the research on the chemistry of unsaturated
sulfones is to open up new synthetic methods for the preparation of unusual
polycyclic ring systems. It is envisioned adding a variety of functionalized
nucleophiles to phenylsulfonylallene followed by a subsequent base induced
cyclization so as to prepare novel ring systems which could be of considerable
use in organic synthesis. Substituted thiophenyl allyl sulfones undergo a
1,3-allylic sulfonyl shift and this process will be utilized within a
metallation-alkylation sequence to prepare a variety of sulfonyl functionalized
substrates. Other studies will deal with the recently uncovered ı3+2!-anionic
cyclization of phenylsulfonyl-allene with methyl vinyl ketone. Since the
ı3+2!-anionic cycloaddition strategy has not been investigated for the general
synthesis of cyclopentenes, the cyclization reaction with a number of activated
allenes and alkenes will be studied. Plans also include a study of the chemistry
of diazafulvene, which it is believed can be generated as a transient species
from the cycloadduct derived from diazomethane and phenylsulfonylallene. Another
objective of the investigation will be to develop the chemistry of sulfonyl
substituted cyclopropenes as reagents for the synthesis of some novel polycyclic
ring systems.
