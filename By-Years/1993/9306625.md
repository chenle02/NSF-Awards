9306625 Hey This research asks basic questions about the formation of biological
species. Although it is clear that species formation, whereby single species
splits into two, has been a common process in the history of life on earth, we
have only limited understanding of how it occurs. Dr. Hey will study two groups
of species, the Drosophila virilis species group (5 species) and the Drosophila
pseudoobscura species group (4 species). Within each group the species are
closely related and are genetically similar. For each group, the basic data are
the DNA sequences of several genes. These genes will be sequenced from each of
several individuals in each of the species in each species group. From the
pattern of DNA sequences variation found among different copies of the same
gene, Dr. Hey will be able to generate descriptions of the history of these
genes.%%% By studying several genes and applying newly developed models of the
relationship between gene histories and species histories, Dr. Hey will develop
a historical portrait of genetic divergence during speciation within these
groups.***
