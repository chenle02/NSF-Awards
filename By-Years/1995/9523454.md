This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to
examine the feasibility of applying conventional and interferometric synthetic
aperture radar techniques to map the basal portion of glaciers. Conventional
imaging synthetic aperture radars (SARs) provide only a two- dimensional view of
the bottom of the ice, and limited information on basal physical properties.
Three dimensional maps of the bottom can be obtained with Interferometric
Synthetic Aperture Radar and would significantly enhance the utility of radar
data in the study of glacial dynamics. This feasibility study will examine the
characteristics of electromagnetic propagation through glacial ice, the optimum
conditions for synthetic aperture radar imaging and the scattering
characteristics of the bottom ice. The result of this work will be a
determination of the optimum set of system parameters needed for a synthetic
aperture radar to map the basal characteristics of glacial ice.
