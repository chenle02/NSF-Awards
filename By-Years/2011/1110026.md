The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry
Division supports Professor Bruce S. Ault at the University of Cincinnati for
studies of the reactions of organometallic precursors with ozone. This project
is an experimental and theoretical study to enhance the overall understanding of
the reaction mechanisms of ozone with a wide range of volatile organometallic
precursors. These will include metal alkyls, metallocenes, metal carbonyls and
metal acetylacetonate complexes. Thermal reactions will be used to generate
initial intermediates, which will be trapped at low temperature by matrix
isolation and characterized by spectroscopic and theoretical techniques. By
employing several deposition techniques, the reaction time and thermal energy
provided to the initial reactants will be varied in a systematic way. This
provides a means to 'stop' the reaction at varying times after initiation, and
will permit the trapping of different intermediates in the reactions. The
identification of a sequence of intermediates will permit the development of a
reaction mechanism. Since, very little is known about these reactions, an
increased understanding will allow the development of routes to the oxidation of
the metal-carbon bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reaction of ozone with volatile
organometallic precursors has been used in recent years for the formation of
metal oxide thin films on a variety of substrates. These thin films have
applications ranging from solar energy conversion to the microelectronics
industry. Understanding of the reaction mechanisms should enable the development
of more effective thin film formation processes. A number of younger scientists,
from early undergraduate research students through doctoral students will be
engaged in this project where they can gain exposure to the excitement of
research in chemistry. In addition, a strong linkage to the Women in Science and
Engineering (WISE) program at the University of Cincinnati is in place, and will
continue to assist in the development of female scientists.
