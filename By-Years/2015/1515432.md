Ceramic nanomaterials have the potential to revolutionize energy storage because
of their unique combination of geometry and chemical nature. By assembling oxide
nanosheets into porous, sponge-like structures, we may build battery or
capacitor electrodes applicable for commercialization. A clear advantage of the
materials of interest is their low cost and broad availability. Further, by
using different processing methods the final 3-D sponge structures might be
optimized for specific applications. By using earth-abundant materials and
traditional ceramic and chemical processing techniques, these nanostructures can
be made at reasonable cost and with high reliability. Additional research into
the structure and energy storage of these ceramic nanomaterials will take place
in Japan?s science city, Tsukuba. Under the direction of Dr. Takayoshi Sasaki,
the leader of the Soft Chemistry group at the National Institute for Materials
Science, the new research will focus on new and improved processing approaches
to optimize the nanostructures to achieve breakthrough charge storage capacity.

Nanosheets derived from layered oxide materials, such as MnO2 and V2O5, are of
interest due to their high surface area and variable chemistry. By a unique
flocculation method, these nanosheets can be self-assembled into porous 3-D
macrostructures with surface areas exceeding 100 square meters per gram. The
process involves oxide synthesis using a solid state process, followed by ion
exchange and exfoliation. Thus far, it has been shown that colloidal nanosheet
suspensions can be flocculated via coprecipitation with other nanosheet
suspensions and controlling the suspension ionic strength. With their porous
morphology and large accessible surface area, electrodes formed from these
macrostructures may approach theoretical capacitance values. The proposed work
will focus on developing the processing science needed to control the oxide
nanostructures, focusing on the self-assembly of nanosheets. This NSF EAPSI
award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science.
