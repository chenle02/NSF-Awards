The investigator and his collaborators propose to study some problems in
analytic number theory. Specifically, they seek to prove an asymptotic formula
for the large sieve inequality; this would have applications to small gaps
between zeros of Dirichlet L-functions and to mean value formulae for sixth and
eighth moments of Dirichlet L-functions. Further, they want to show that there
are infinitely many Dirichlet L-functions associated with real primitive
characters that have no positive real zeros. This assertion is not known to hold
for any infinite family of L-functions. Also, they will investigate the
Balazard-Saias criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis. For example, is this
criterion equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis?

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with problems involving
whole numbers. Applications of number theory to coding, networking, data
compression, and cryptography have thrust number theory into the forefront of
modern mathematics. L-functions provide an important tool for investigating many
questions of number theory, yet our understanding of the fundamental properties
of L-functions is incomplete. The investigator and his collaborators seek to
fill in some of the gaps in our basic knowledge of L-functions.
