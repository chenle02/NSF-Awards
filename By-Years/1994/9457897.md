9457897 Bigelow A research program in experimental atomic physics will be
initiated. A novel trap will be developed that will be able to store two species
of atoms simultaneously. This will allow the study of the collisions of
different ultra-cold atoms, in which different processes will dominate as
compared to same-atom collisions. ***
