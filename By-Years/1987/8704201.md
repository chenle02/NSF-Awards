With support from the Field Museum of Natural History, Dr. Matthew Nitecki has
organized a symposium addressing the general topic of Biological Innovations, to
be held in May of 1988. Speakers from fields of molecular biology, morphology
and anatomy, systematics, and paleontology will address problems related to the
origin of novel biological structures, molecular pathways, and functions, at the
levels of population, species, and lineage through time. A major focus of the
discussions will be efforts to disentangle cause and effect in the study of
evolutionary innovations, defined as new structures or functions that open up
new ways of life for particular groups of animals or plants. Dr. Nitecki and the
Field Museum have a strong record of managing and hosting symposia addressing
significant topics in the field of systematic and evolutionary biology. The
symposia attract over 200 researchers, including many students, and have been
held since 1978. Results are published promptly, and these publications have
been regarded as of high quality.
