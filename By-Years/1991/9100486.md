This award supports a continuing program of investigations into the physics of
extragalactic radio sources by two of the leading contributors to this field.
Using the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A as a Rosetta stone for the process of
particle acceleration, a unified program of numerical simulation and high
resolution observations will probe the mechanisms which provide the relativistic
particles producing the non-thermal emission of radio galaxies.
