An international symposium entitled "Polymer Design for Biology: Activity and
Structure"&lt;br/&gt;is being organzied for Oct. 3-6, 2004. This meeting is
sponsored by the Polymer Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;Division of the American Chemical
Society. The goal of this symposium is to&lt;br/&gt;educate both the polymer and
biotechnology communities of mutual needs and capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;This
interdisciplinary symposium is consistent the the goal of the National
Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation to foster interactions between different technical
areas. Funds are sought to&lt;br/&gt;help defray the travel costs of young
