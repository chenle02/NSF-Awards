9703892 Schorr This grant for $78,150 to the Information Science Institute of
the University of Southern California will fund a workshop on research and
development opportunities in Federal Information services. Three meetings will
be held, resulting in a workshop report which should be of great value to
individual federal agencies, both research and mission, and also to cross-agency
planning and budgeting organizations such as the Office of Management and Budget
and the President's Government Information Technology Service Board.
