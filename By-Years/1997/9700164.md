9700164 Hunsperger the objective of this research is to develop a
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for detecting corrosion of embedded or
encased high strength steel rods and cables. The proposed method involves using
Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) to locate and evaluate corrosion sites. TDR is a
well established technique in the field of electrical engineering and has been
used for many years to detect breaks in transmission lines. Preliminary
numerical simulations indicate that TDR shows promise for being able to detect
both surface and pit corrosion of steel strands embedded in concrete. A
reliable, accurate, and economical method for detecting the location and
magnitude of the corrosion will lead to increased levels of safety for our civil
infrastructure, and may enable significant savings to the public by reducing
maintenance costs through early corrosion detection.
