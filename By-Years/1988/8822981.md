This dissertation research project will study the division of labor by sex in
communities in Sierra Leone affected by agricultural development programs. The
study will test the proposition that development is oriented towards males, and
that the projects provide resources for men to control while marginalizing women
in the economy. This project is important because African women are the main
producers in many areas, and development projects which ignore their
traditionally important role in the economy may tend to weaken the food
situation in this part of the world.
