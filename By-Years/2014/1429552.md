Knowing the stable isotopic composition of a globally important atmospheric gas
such as CO2 serves to provide useful 'fingerprint' information as to its source,
and subsequent transformation.

Recent progress in measuring CO2 isotopes has concentrated on using quantum-
cascade lasers (QCLS) together with multi-pass optical absorption cells. Such
approaches have reached a point where QCLS multi-pass systems are now starting
to match or better the capabilities of traditional magnetic sector mass
spectrometers. They exhibit comparable precisions approaching 0.01 per mil in
del 13C and del 18O, and with considerable advantages over the traditional
systems in terms of reliability, analytical cost, and ease of sample
preparation. These capabilities may have additional, yet to be developed
applications. The instrumentation to be acquired here will use a high precision
QCLS system for routine analysis of isotopic composition of CO2 in discrete air
and seawater samples, opening the door for broader application of the technology
to key environmental applications.
