X-ray crystallography of biological macromolecules is an increasingly important
tool to understand structure, function, and control. Developments in genetics,
data collection, and computer hardware have produced an unprecedented growth of
crystallographic studies. X-ray crystallography produces large amounts of data
and is entirely dependent upon the availability of powerful computers and
sophisticated algorithms for the interpretation of raw data. After
crystallization, data collection and phasing, a large variety of computational
procedures are required in order to solve and refine the structure. These
procedures include methods of phasing, density modification, chain tracing,
refinement, and correction of errors in structures. Recent publication of
partially erroneous structures has drawn everyone's attention to the
difficulties involved at these stages of the crystallographic structure
determination pathway. It is the goal of this proposal to develop a
comprehensive, machine-independent, and user-friendly program system for all
computational aspects of macromolecular crystallography. Previous experience
with the program X-PLOR will proved a framework for the proposed software
development. The specifications of the proposed software development are open to
discussion at a workshop that has been organized by the principal investigator
and that has been attended by 30 leading researchers in crystallography. The
propose software will significantly reduce the time required to obtain
structures and will increase the reliability of crystallographic structure
determination.
