This research project has an interdisciplinary character on the frontier between
physics and mathematics. The project investigates the phenomena of scaling and
universality in random matrices, which are central in many areas of modern
science. Improved understanding of these phenomena will have a significant
impact on both mathematical theory and its applications. The project aims to
develop new and powerful mathematical approaches involving methods from
different areas of mathematics including analysis, the theory of integrable
systems, probability theory, semiclassical asymptotics, and complex analysis.
The results of the project will have direct applications to combinatorial
aspects of quantum gravity, exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics,
spin systems on random surfaces, theory of critical phenomena and phase
transitions, and quantum chaos. Further applications include the theory of knots
and links and related problems in molecular biology, growth models, and
statistical data analysis. This research project is directed at fundamental
problems of the theory of random matrix models and statistical mechanics. The
project investigates different conjectures of universality of the scaling limits
of eigenvalue correlation functions and exactly solvable models of statistical
physics and hydrodynamics. This includes: (a) the development of the Riemann-
Hilbert approach to random normal matrix models with applications to Hele-Shaw
flows in hydrodynamics, Laplacian growth, and quantum Hall effect; (b) the
development of the Riemann-Hilbert approach to random matrix models with
external source, including the problems of phase transitions, critical
phenomena, and double scaling limits in these models; (c) the exact solution of
the six-vertex model with various boundary conditions in different phases; and
(d) the study of the phase separation in the six-vertex model.
