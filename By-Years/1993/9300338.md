The Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Boston
University has a particularly strong research program in the rapidly changing
field of signal processing and signal recognition. Faculty from different
academic and professional backgrounds combine their unique skills to form a
research area that has a unified, cohesive theme. Under the Research Experiences
for Undergraduates Site program, students will become involved in a variety of
projects related to signal processing and recognition. The projects include: the
study of hesitation and disfluency in spontaneous human speech as related to
automated speech understanding; a technique called "knowledge-based signal
processing"; and a project related to ionospheric plasma heating experiments.
