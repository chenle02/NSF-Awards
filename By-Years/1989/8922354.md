This is a project to extend the Lager CAD system with cells and tools for neural
network design. The extended system is being used to design several systems of
increasing sizes, the largest being a machine to recognize connected speech
after being trained for each speaker. The resulting machine is expected to run
much faster in the training phase than existing machines.
