This project is actively recruiting academically talented undergraduate and
graduate students with financial need to enter programs of study in statistics.
Through strong mentoring programs and the integration of research and education,
the project seeks to promote excellent academic performance, broad experiences
with and exposure to application of statistics, timely completion of degree,
informed career choices and fulfilling post-graduation placement. The project's
intellectual merit is further advanced through a new seminar course
"Opportunities in Statistics" that exposes scholars to statistical research and
career opportunities. Furthermore, students in the program are able to take on
interdisciplinary research experiences, internships and industrial traineeships
that are related to their academic and career goals. The project's broader
impacts are felt through the position of statistics as a field that is integral
to the quality of research in many scientific areas. In addition, by reaching
out to financially needy students the project is broadening the pool of US
citizens who can bring applications of statistics to bear on challenging science
and engineering problems confronting society. The project is also having a
significant financial impact on the S-STEM scholars selected and seeking to
increase the diversity of students in mathematical and statistical sciences.
