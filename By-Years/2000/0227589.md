The sensors used to measure neural activities are currently based on direct
attachment of the electrodes to the nerve or the nerve bundle. Although this
method has been very effective, there are serious limitations, most significant
is the intrusive nature of the process. For example, to use electrodes for
simulation or as a sensor to detect signals in the brain, it is necessary to
open the skull to attach the electrodes to the nerves. It is highly desirable to
develop a method that can be used with least intrusion in diagnostics and
therapeutic activities of the brain. The idea presented by the PI in this
exploratory proposal is to measure the nervous activities by inserting
electrodes in the blood capillaries adjacent to the nerve. The hypothesis is
that since the blood plasma and the extracellular fluid are in ionic and osmotic
equilibrium, the nervous activity signals propagate into the adjacent
capillaries and, therefore, can by detected with electrodes placed inside the
capillaries.
