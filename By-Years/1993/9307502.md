9307502 Koenig This research project aims to study the interplay between
competition and cooperation in a highly social species in which groups consist
of closely related individuals. Acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) live
in permanently territorial family groups of up to 12 individuals. Each group has
only a single nest at a time, and all group members aid in incubation and the
feeding of nestlings. The primary goal of this project is to use modern
molecular techniques (DNA fingerprinting) to determine parentage within groups
of different composition. The work continues study of a population consisting
entirely of color-marked birds followed since 1971 and will combine banding and
behavioral observation of the population with laboratory analyses. The results
will help to clarify why some animals live together, how kinship facilitates
group living, and the ways that competition is resolved in social species. The
results will consequently be of interest to all those studying sociality and
behavior, including anthropologists and sociologists as well as behavioral
biologists.
