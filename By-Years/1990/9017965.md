Combined analysis will continue with data collected from a trans- Atlantic
section at 11 Degrees North during March, 1989. Included are CTD profiles, water
samples for chemical properties, continuous near-surface currents from an ADCP,
and subsurface flow from SOFAR floats. Development of new techniques for
synthesizing data will provide a better way to describe circulation in the
Tropical Atlantic Ocean.
