This project will establish a Virtual Institute called LIFE (Linked Institutions
for Future Earth). This virtual institute aims to coordinate international
research built on sharing unique experimental facilities, theoretical strengths,
and field observations for advancing the quantitative, predictive understanding
of the Earth surface system and its response to change. The project will
establish LIFE as a hub of international exchange in earth surface
sustainability research, education, and public engagement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of LIFE is on understanding and quantifying the
vulnerability of the Earth surface system. This virtual institute would embrace
an interdisciplinary approach that brings projections of future climate and
human activities to bear on Earth surface vulnerability, from watersheds to
deltas through theme-based focused research campaigns with an emphasis on
actionable research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIFE will focus on seven major
interconnected programs: (1) researcher exchange, (2) shared and co-mentored
postdoctoral researchers, (3) international shared graduate degree programs, (4)
theme-based focused research (mainly experimental and theoretical) campaigns,
(5) international summer institutes for graduate students and young researchers,
(6) data/model sharing for actionable research, and (7) science-to-public
international exchange. The approach also includes disseminating science to
broader audiences by engaging the public on issues related to the sustainability
of future Earth, the role of research in preventing and adopting to change, and
the development of a forum for international exchange of science museum
exhibits. The project leverages resources in six countries: Uruguay, Chile,
Italy, France, UK, and US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a
Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's
Office of International Science and Engineering.
