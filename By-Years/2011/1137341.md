In Batsbi, a language of the Nakh group of the Nakh-Daghestanian language
family, markers of gender-number agreement can occur simultaneously in several
positions in a single verb form. Repetition of markers in this way has been
called extended exponence. Until recently, it was widely believed that
inflection, such as the gender-number agreement marker, was necessarily
restricted to the edges of words, and that no language had repeated marking of
agreement with a particular feature or set of features. However, such repetition
is found in several of the languages of the Nakh-Daghestanian family, as well as
in several in the Kiranti subgroup of Tibeto-Burman, and in other languages. The
repetition of gender- number encoding raises questions of typological
distribution (for example, do such patterns occur only in languages of certain
types?), diachronic origin (how and why do such patterns originate?), and
linguistic theory (how can we account for systems of this type?). The goals of
this research include (a) characterization of variation possible in the pattern
cross-linguistically, (b) a statement of constraints on the pattern, if any, and
(c) a description of the origins of these patterns in the languages studied. One
impact of this project will be in enhancing the status of the endangered
languages to be studied, thus encouraging speakers to preserve them. The project
provides support for linguistics and other academic fields in the Republic of
Azerbaijan and in Daghestan, Russia. Collecting texts in Archi and Khinalug will
lay the foundation for editing these texts in the future as a contribution to
the documentation of these endangered languages
