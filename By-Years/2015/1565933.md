The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program of the NSF Chemistry
Division supports the research of Professor Dean Tantillo in the Department of
Chemistry at The University of California-Davis. Professor Tantillo and his
students are using modern computational chemistry methods to explore new
principles governing chemical reactivity. The principles uncovered transform how
organic chemists predict mechanisms and product distributions for many reactions
that lead to complex molecules. In addition to the fundamental importance of the
mechanistic models uncovered through this research, the project is used to train
students from diverse backgrounds in multidisciplinary approaches to mechanistic
chemistry and expose them to careers that employ such techniques. In addition,
new methods for making applied computational chemistry accessible to blind and
visually impaired students are being developed as part of an effort to encourage
this group to pursue careers in STEM fields. The results of this research are
disseminated, in part, via an outreach program in partnership with a local
arboretum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances knowledge in mechanistic
organic chemistry through the construction of detailed mechanistic models for
carbocation reactivity. In particular, unusual potential energy surfaces for
carbocation rearrangements are characterized, non-statistical dynamic effects on
carbocation behavior are analyzed and predicted, and models of reactivity are
pushed through to the design and testing of new reactions. The specific goals of
this project are: (1) To elucidate general principles for controlling the
dynamical behavior of species involved in concerted reactions with multiple
asynchronous events (2) To design a reaction with a post-transition state
bifurcation and predict its product distribution ahead of laboratory
experiments. (3) To develop the theozyme dynamics approach into a tool for
understanding and designing catalysts that make use of relatively weak
noncovalent interactions.
