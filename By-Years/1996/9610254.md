This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the development of sequence-specific analyses of large DNA
molecules using single molecule detection. Professor Nie and his students at
Indiana University will use sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that have
been modified with fluorescent tags so that their binding to DNA can be
detected. The specific sequence sites at which this binding occurs will be
quantified using an integrated laser-induced fluorescence and tapping-mode
atomic force microscope that has been developed in the Professor Nie s
laboratory. This work will benefit several areas including the use of DNA
diagnostics, gene mapping, and fundamental studies of DNA replication,
transcription, and recombination. This project will develop a highly sensitive
and selective method for identifying DNA molecules that have specific sequences
of interest. Sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that have been tagged with a
fluorescent group will be detected using a new laser- induced detector combined
with an atomic force microscope. This work will have impact on several areas of
molecular genetics and DNA analyses.
