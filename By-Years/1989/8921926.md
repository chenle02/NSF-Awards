This is an ambitious proposal to conduct empirical and theoretical research on
social judgment in negotiation behavior. Despite the importance of negotiation,
substantial evidence suggests that negotiators frequently fail to attain
mutually beneficial outcomes. Inefficient negotiation processes reduce society's
resources and productivity, and increase society's conflicts and self-
destructiveness. The purpose of the proposed research is to examine why
negotiators often arrive at sub-optimal decision strategies. A theoretical
model, the Social Perception model, is presented that focuses on communication,
judgment accuracy, behavior, and outcomes. The major prediction from the model
is that the accuracy of negotiators' perceptions of the other party determines
negotiation outcomes. Moreover, inaccurate judgments may result from
insufficient information exchange, failure to attend to relevant information, or
failure to combine information to make a judgment about the other party's
interests. Four research studies are proposed to examine implications of the
model. The experiments promise to advance our understanding of negotiation, to
contribute to sounder theory, and to identify factors that will improve the
outcome of negotiation.
