The objective of this award is the development of decision-making mechanisms
that maximize system benefit and minimize the negative impact of manipulation by
agents that possess private information. Potential decreases in overall benefit
are motivated by differences in individual utility functions and are enabled by
individual control of information. The potential decrease, the "price of
deception," will be calculated as the worst case ratio of the expected system
utility of a mixed or pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game in which
players submit statements of private information, to the system utility
achievable by an omniscient impartial decision-maker. Preliminary research has
demonstrated that similar mechanisms can have greatly different prices of
deception. Existing procedures will be analyzed and new variations will be
developed for voting, ranking, matching or assigning members of one group to
members of another group, and facility location.

If successful, the results of this research will identify mechanisms for
infrastructure planning, matching, voting, and aggregation of individual
opinions that have a lesser price of deception, so that manipulation of private
information will less significantly reduce the overall quality of the outcome.
The primary goal of this work is to better optimize system-wide or public goals
through appropriate choices of decision mechanisms. Better mechanisms will help
improve the matching of organ donors to recipients, the assignment of medical
students to hospital internships, generation of ratings over the web, and
placement of public facilities, among other applications. This work will also
contribute to the basic algorithmic theory of games and competition.
