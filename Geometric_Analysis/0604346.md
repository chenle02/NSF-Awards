Abstract

Award: DMS-0604346 Principal Investigator: Aobing Li

Projects supported by this award emphasize conformally invariant partial
differential equations, including a fully nonlinear version of the Yamabe
problem that seeks a Riemannian metric with constant scalar curvature in a
prescribed conformal class, and a fully nonlinear version of the boundary Yamabe
problem. Some other directions of research include an extension of inequalities
of Trudinger-Wang on the Hessian measure, and a problem on the variational
nature of the symmetric curvature functional for manifolds that are not locally
conformally flat.

Euclidean geometry provides measurements of both lengths of lines and of angles
between pairs of lines, and much of modern geometry depends upon being able to
make both of those measurements locally. Geometers describe a change of
coordinates as "conformal" if it changes lengths but preserves angles (think of
stretching the plane by a uniform amount in all directions), and the study and
application of conformal transformations is an active area of research in
geometric analysis that depends upon and contributes to the development of
solution techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations.
