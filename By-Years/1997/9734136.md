CTS-9734136 Marr, David W. M. Colorado School of Mines Structure at small length
scale arises as the material microscopic components interact and assemble
themselves into mesoscopic-sized morphologies. This project will investigate the
link between molecular interactions and the properties of interfaces that
develop during morphology evolution. A combination of dense colloidal model
systems probed by new optical techniques that can manipulate such systems, and
statistical mechanical modeling methods will be applied. A new experimental
device will be constructed that uses a rapidly scanning optical trap to build
arbitrary optical potential wells. The technique of confocal microscopy which
can characterize, in situ, the relatively dense colloidal structures will be
developed. The study of nucleation in systems using nuclei of various structure
and the templated growth of colloidal crystals will be two areas of focus. The
education goal is to bring the physical insights obtained in this study to the
classroom at both undergraduate and graduate levels by developing new courses
and adding molecular level material to current coursework. In addition, new
pedagogical techniques including the World Wide Web, browsers used to access the
web, as well as state-of-the-art computer languages will be used to enhance the
educational environment. Understanding the link between microscopic interactions
in colloidal systems and macroscopic properties is an essential step in the
synthesis of new materials with specifically designed microscale morphologies.
