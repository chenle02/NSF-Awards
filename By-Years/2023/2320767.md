An award is made to Western Kentucky University (WKU) to obtain a fluorescence-
activated cell sorter (FACS) to enhance learning and research training
opportunities for the student community at a primarily undergraduate university.
It will enable the diverse, undergraduate population to gain hands-on skills
with using up-to-date technology in producing high quality research data.
Besides undergraduate and Masterâ€™s students, high school students from the Carol
Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science will participate in research
enabled by the FACS system. The use of this technology will enrich student
learning and research experience through acquisition of new research skills,
data analysis and communication of research through presentations at local,
regional, and national conferences. The acquisition of FACS will further promote
unique learning and research training opportunities and experiences for student
as well as provide faculty research opportunities at WKU and in the south-
central Kentucky region.

The cell sorting machine will enable students and researchers to use modern
technology to perform single cell analysis and gain insights of in-vivo
molecular changes during normal and stress-related conditions such as an
infection, cancer, sleep apnea, or exposure to chemicals. Thus, the award to
acquire FACS will favorably impact WKU faculty research in diverse fields
including microbiology, immunology, cancer biology, cell cycle progression,
toxicology, developmental biology, endocrinology, and neurobiology. It will lead
to better understanding of the molecular and signaling pathways for normal
functioning of the cells. The instrument will expand opportunities for student
involvement in research and enhance research at WKU. The FACS will be used in
immunology and cell biology laboratory courses to enable students who are not
working in research laboratories to learn the concepts and application of flow
cytometry and cell sorting which will build a systematic understanding from
acquisition and processing of samples to counting, sorting, and characterizing
diverse cell types.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
