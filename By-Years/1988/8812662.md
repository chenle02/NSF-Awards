The southwestern Native American costume and clothing collection at the School
of American Research is of national importance to anthropology. In order to make
these fragile and rare materials more accessible to researchers, the staff will
conduct a conservation survey of 650 objects and preserve those items damaged
from original use and past storage problems. The storage facility for the
collections will be upgraded by the purchase of new metal cabinets which will
allow the items to be stored flat, eliminating damage due to folding. The
improved storage and conservation measures will ensure that this important
anthropological collection will be preserved for future generations, while
providing access for researchers.
