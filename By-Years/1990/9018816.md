This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Augstin Jose Ros additional
flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and research in economics. This
award will strengthen minority research participation in economics. More
specifically, the grant will permit Ros to study the effects of the 1981/82
world recession on Brazilian Economic development. Ros will investigate the
overall effect the recession had on numerous macro and micro variables. Special
attention will be paid to Brazil's important substitution policy implemented in
the mid seventies. The import substitution policy of the mid seventies was
geared to make Brazil less dependent on imported basic inputs and capital goods.
This research investigates the net effect the recession had on these goals. The
grant permits Ros to investigate records at the Economic Development Bank of
Brazil.
