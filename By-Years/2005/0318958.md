This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
relational Bayesian modeling framework for automated discovery of tamporal and
spatial scale in ecological modeling. Scale resolution and cross-scale
articulation are key problems in scientific model development, especially for
complex ecosystem-scale and mixed human-natural systems modeling. Modeler's
facilities for automatic generation of aggregators and for clustering based on
hidden variables provide a natural and tractable basis for scale resolution and
cross-scale articulation for ecological modeling. The objective of this Phase I
project is to develop both fully automated and mixed-initiative scale discovery
methods. A mixed-initiative approach, in which intelligent computing is used to
assist humans to harness the vast amount of data at their disposal, will permit
investigator-driven development and exploration of the multiple, simultaneous
hypotheses necessary to describe complex ecosystem behaviors. The immediate
commercial application of this project is in the area of ecological modeling.
However, the core technology may find additional uses in biomedical research,
epidemiology and commerce.
