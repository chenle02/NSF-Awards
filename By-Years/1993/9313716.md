9313716 Johnson Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale
convective systems (MCSs), have been identified as producers of most of the
rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the Spring, Summer and Fall.
Under prior NSF support, the Principal Investigator has exploited data sets from
previously held field experiments to further understanding of MCSs and their
interactions with the atmospheric boundary layer. He will continue these
investigations using both numerical models and observational case studies. The
Principal Investigator will focus on processes which initiate, maintain and
modulate mesoscale convection as well as the coupling between convection and the
atmospheric boundary layer. Specific meteorological phenomena to be studied
include wake lows, mid-level mesoscale vortices and heat/moisture budgets in and
near mountainous terrain. If successful, this research will lead to better
understanding of MCSs which may lead to better predictions of timing, location
and amount of rainfall as well as severe weather. ***
