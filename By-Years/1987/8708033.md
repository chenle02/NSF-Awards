The PI will carry out laboratory studies of fundamental fluid mechanical
processes which have important geophysical applications. He will carry out a
laboratory study of the Rayleigh-Taylor class of instability in several
geometries relevant to volcanism at mid-ocean ridges. This will examine the
validity of recently proposed models of the segmentation observed at mid-ocean
ridges. He will also investigate a novel in- stability of magma flow which is
due to the strong variation of magma viscosity with temperature. He will
illustrate this instability in laboratory analogues of both fissure and lava
flows and quantify the length and time scales over which it develops.
