&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and
Communications (PerCom) is a high quality conference sponsored by IEEE Computer
Society's Technical Committee on Computer Communications (TCCC) and Technical
Committee on Distributed Computing (TCDP). Since the beginning of the conference
in 2003, it has established as a premier meeting on this topic and has become
extremely competitive with acceptance rate below 20%. The submission has been
steadily on the rise which shows the interests and level of research activity in
the community. So far PerCom was held in North America and Europe, and this is
the first time it's being organized in Asia and was held in North America as
well as in Europe. It is expecting about 300 will attend this year in Galveston.
The corporate sponsor has also been increasing
annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE PerCom is a high quality conference and the
premier technical forum dedicated to addressing the key challenges in pervasive
computing and networking, including wireless, mobile, mesh and sensor networks,
middleware, pervasive services and pervasive applications. This year the number
of submissions in response to the CfP was over 240; from which about 30 papers
will be accepted (60% of them long papers, 40% short papers) by the Technical
Program Committee for presentation at the conference. The proceedings will be an
IEEE publication. As in the past, selected (extended) papers will be invited for
publication in a special issue of Elsevier?s Pervasive and Mobile Computing
(PMC) journal. In addition to the main program, 10 satellite workshops are
closely associated with PerCom (PerCom?s registration includes registration to
all workshops so attendees can ?mix-and-match? presentations). An additional
100+ peer-reviewed, high-quality papers will be presented under the covers of
these workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support will enable US-based
graduate students to attend and present their research results in this important
IEEE conference.&lt;br/&gt;
