accomplishments and research needs in wind engineering in the United States, and
on the possible United States-Japan joint research opportunities. This will be
one of the few wind engineering research papers presented at this meeting. The
P.I. will also participate in the Annual Meeting of the Japanese Association for
Wind Engineering which will be followed by a meeting of the International Wind
Engineering Forum (IWEF). He will represent well the wind engineering community
interests because he is a known expert in this field and because he has had a
long association with Japanese researchers. ***
