This award will support a cooperative research project in biology between
Professor Burney J. Le Boeuf, University of California at Santa Cruz, and
Professor Yasuhiko Naito, National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo, and
colleagues from their respective institutions. The scientists will study diving
behavior and foraging ecology of northern elephant seals, Mirounga
angustirostris. Specifically they will study: 1) the development of diving in
pups and juveniles, 2) measurement of swim velocity rates and feeding rates
during diving, 3) location of foraging and routes taken at sea, 4) foraging
energetics, and 5) the effect of weather variables on the free-ranging dive
pattern. Diving performance will be studied by attaching diving instruments
(time-depth recorders, swim velocity meters, radio transmitters) to seals at Ano
Nuevo, California, before they go to sea. The U.S. and Japanese researchers
bring complementary strengths to this project and Professor Naito's
specifically-designed instruments will be critical to its success. The diving
pattern of northern elephant seals--characterized by prolonged, continuous, and
deep diving--is distinctive even among diving mammals. Recent findings are
challenging long held interpretations of diving performance. These seals dive
deeper than other marine mammals (maximum depth of 1250 m), spend brief periods
on the surface between dives (less than 3 minutes), and dive continuously for
3-8 months at sea. This collaborative study will clarify diving adaptations in
pelagic seals. The findings will have important implications for how seals
partition oxygen stores during foraging, manage anaerobic metabolites, and cope
with compression effects. The results of the study will have practical
applications to fisheries biology and marine mammal management, and will have
broad implications for foraging ecology, understanding the diving adaptations of
aquatic vertebrates, and studying diving behavior and physiology.
