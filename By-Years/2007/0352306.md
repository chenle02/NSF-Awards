Funds are provided for a geodynamic modeling study of associations between
magmatism and extension on rifted continental margins. The research will focus
on understanding the tectonomagmatic history of the crust in the ocean-continent
transition zone and the transition from continental rifting to steady state
seafloor spreading. Preliminary modeling by the PI suggest that intra-
lithospheric processes may be a key to understanding the differences between
volcanic rifted margins and non-volcanic rifted margins and the formation of
crust at the ocean-continent transition. Proposed research will extend the study
in three stages: development of a series of dynamic models of lithospheric
extension; development of a quasi-dynamic modeling technique in which simple
shear is approximated kinematically; and the application of the models of
lithospheric deformation to define an upper boundary condition to be applied to
a series of models that investigate convection and melting processes in the
asthenosphere. Data from the Iberian and Grand Banks conjugate margins will be
use to constrain the models.
