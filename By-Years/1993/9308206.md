This project is in the area of unit commitment and hydrothermal scheduling.
These problems are complicated because of their large size, mixed (integer and
real) variables, nonlinearity, and uncertainty. A new algorithm will be
developed. The thermal and hydro subproblems are handled differently. For the
thermal subproblem, the unit commitment part will be solved using Lagrange
relation to avoid the dimensionality problem, while the calculation of thermal
generation is solved analytically. The hydro subproblem will be further
decomposed into a number of independent subproblems, and will be solved in
parallel by using constraint relaxed differential dynamic programming. There are
many advantages claimed for this approach. If successful, the method will not
only yield substantial economic benefits, but will also advance the state of the
art in the field of large-scale optimization.
