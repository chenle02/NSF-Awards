The University of North Dakota is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation
of infrastructural utilities and laboratory case work, in its chemistry
building, Abbott Hall. The renovations are necessary to permit undergraduate and
graduate students to conduct their experiments in an environment that has
adequate ventilation and support systems. In the original design of the
building, it was anticipated that fumes could be withdrawn from the bench tops
in laboratories by using small desk top hoods to remove vapors. This arrangement
failed to remove sufficient vapors from the laboratories over the years and has
reduced the types of experiments that can be performed in the building. To
correct the problem, 30 fume hoods, including base cabinets and connections to
water, electric, ventilation, and other piped gases and fluids will be
installed. Accessible hoods, meeting ADA requirements, will be placed in the
renovated laboratories. Improved facilities will provide a safe and pleasant
research training environment, assisting the Chemistry Department in its
recruitment efforts to attract new students.
