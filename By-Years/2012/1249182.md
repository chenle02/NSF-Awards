Funds are provided to develop understanding of the mechanisms and magnitude of
heat transport upward from the Atlantic Water (AW) in the eastern (&gt;30oE)
Eurasian Basin (EB), to the point where accurate projections can be made for
varying lateral input of AW under different scenarios of large-scale climate
variability. Specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;O1. To evaluate and improve
parameterizations of heat and salt fluxes due to double-diffusive convection
(DDC) including the sensitivity of DDC heat fluxes to added velocity shear
(e.g., mean flow, tides);&lt;br/&gt;O2. To map the spatial distribution of DDC
parameters using all available eastern Arctic microstructure, Ice-Tethered
Profiler (ITP) and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data for 2007 and
2009;&lt;br/&gt;O3. To estimate the spatial distribution of velocity shear using
a 3D baroclinic, coupled ocean/sea-ice model including tide
forcing;&lt;br/&gt;O4. To evaluate the relative roles of turbulent mixing and
DDC processes in shaping EB upward fluxes;&lt;br/&gt;O5. To estimate impact of
DDC and feedbacks with stratification and shear on the hydrographic structure of
the EB (via modeling); and&lt;br/&gt;O6. To estimate the lateral intrusive heat
fluxes, assessing their role in ventilating the ocean interior.&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs propose advanced analyses of a suite of existing hydrographic data with fine
vertical resolution ? microstructure, CTD, ITP and MacLane moored profilers ?
taking advantage of the unique EB dataset collected over the recent decade by
the international community. A high-resolution 3D regional ocean model with
active sea ice will be used to quantify upper ocean shear from mean flow, eddies
and tides, and provide a tool for investigating sensitivity of modeled fluxes to
parameterizations of DDC, shear-induced turbulence, and DDC/shear coupling.
