This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rockefeller University for the
renovation and repair of the Protein Sequencing Facility which houses protein
chemistry and bipolymer research, research training, and research services that
are integral to the research of over 100 Rockefeller University investigators in
biochemistry and in cell and molecular biology. This building was constructed in
1930 and last renovated in 1982. The ARFMP grant of $275,000 and $424,461
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by (a) consolidating into one location the
activities of protein sequencing, peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis, and
amino acid analysis; and (b) installing the necessary utilities so that a
hydrofluoric acid hood and cleavage apparatus and an Applied Biosystems peptide
synthesizer can be operated. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for supplying vital research
services to an excellent faculty widely known for the significance of their
biological research and for the training of quality graduate and postdoctoral
students.
