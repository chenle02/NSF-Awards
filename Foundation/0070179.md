Pillay plans to carry out research on stable and simple theories, especially the
structure of supersimple fields, on differential fields and their Galois groups,
and on groups over o- minimal structures.

Simple theories are a class of first order theories, including both stable
theories and typically the theories of ifgeneric structuresll. Their models
support a notion of ioindependencel. which specialises to ioalgebraic freenessli
in the case of algebraically closed fields. The study of simple theories has
thrown up some new ideas in model theory involving generalized notions of
definability and Galois theory. Pillay plans to investigate several open
questions in both the general theory and fine structure theory. Pseudo
algebraically closed fields with small Galois group are examples of supersimple
fields. Pillay will investigate the reverse problem: is a supersimple field
pseudoalgebraically closed, namely does every irreducible variety over F have an
F- rational point.

Differential rings and fields are objects developed as part of the algebraic
study of differential equations. The model theoretic study of such rings and
fields, using tools of stability theory, has had an impact in differential
algebraic geometry as well as diophantine geometry. Pillay will investigate
inverse problems with respect to differential Galois theory, as well as the fine
structure of solutions of certain algebraic differential equations (those of
Painleve).

The category of groups definable in an o-minimal structure resembles the
category of real Lie groups. The relationship is very tight in the case of
ifsemisimplel. groups. Pillay will try to extend this to wider classes of groups
(abelian, definably compact, definable subgroups of algebraic groups).
