&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to
hold a grantees meeting on July 8-9, 2009 focused on the potential of cyber-
physical systems and their impact on our lives. The event, ?Cyber-Physical
Systems ? Leading the Way to a Smarter, Safer Future for Anyone, Anywhere,
Anytime?, This is a two-day event: the first day will take place at the National
Science Foundation and will be dedicated to a dry-run session; the second day of
the CPS event will take place at Capitol Hill and will include a luncheon with
the members of the Senate followed by demonstrations and poster presentations of
research work related to CPS. The invited audience includes 25 members of the
Senate Commerce Committee and their staffs. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The
demonstration and posters will showcase state-of-the-art and innovative research
projects describing the potential benefits of CPS to the society, while
highlighting the research challenges that need to be address in order to realize
the CPS vision. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Grantees meeting will provide an
opportunity to showcase the current accomplishments in the CPS to some of the
senior senators, members of the Senate Commerce Committee and their staffs and
to the NSF staff. The workshop will have participation from 12 institutions and
their post Docs, graduate students and undergraduate students. It also includes
participation and demonstration by the High school students. This will be a
great opportunity for them to interact with other participants and learn about
many exciting opportunities in the CPS area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
