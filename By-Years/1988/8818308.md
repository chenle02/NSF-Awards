The equatorial Pacific has been the object of several studies in the fields of
physical oceanography and marine geology. The region is known to have a strong
response to climate change over many different time scales. This includes
seasonal and interannual variations, late Pleistocene rhythmic changes
associated with orbital forcing and high latitude glaciation, and long-term
evolution of climate systems associated with changes in late Neogene oceanic
boundary conditions. A critical aspect of modern oceanographic research is to
deduce the timing and global relations of these oceanographic changes in the
eastern Pacific. This award will support a sedimentologic and paleoceanographic
study of the eastern equatorial Pacific using seismic reflection profiling and
shallow sediment coring. Sediments recovered will be analyzed for their
geochemical and paleontologic record. Isotope studies will be used to determine
age and history of sea surface conditions. Additionally, data to be acquired
will form the basis for recovering longer history of the region using cores
recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program.
