Efficient numerical algorithms play an increasingly important role in
computational sciences to make large scale computer simulations tractable.
Solution of very large sparse matrices has been one of the most time-consuming
parts of many large scale high performance computer simulation problems. One of
the important tasks in high performance scientific computing is to identify
which solver is suitable for what class of applications (sparse matrices), and
which sparse matrix can be solved by what solver. We will use the
techniques&lt;br/&gt;and ideas in knowledge discovery and data mining to extract
useful information and special features from unstructured sparse matrices and to
design appropriate strategies to match sparse matrices and
solvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this exploratory study is some
important preliminary data and database to demonstrate the feasibility of
building a software environment for high performance scientific computing
applications based on mining sparse matrices and extracting
features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
