9412208 Kezunovic The First International Conference on Digital Simulators for
Power System Transient Studies (ICDS) is being organized with an objective of
providing a forum for exchange of information among universities, research
organizations, manufactures, consultants and utility industry regarding
research, development, implementation and application of digital simulators in
the area of power system transient studies. Such a forum does not exist today as
a permanent event and very few technical meetings in the past were devoted to
this subject. The proposed conference will establish a permanent forum which may
be held every two years and will provide an opportunity for discussing state-of-
the-art issues in this important area of power system studies. ***
