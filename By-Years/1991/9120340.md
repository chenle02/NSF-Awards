This project is a renewal of research conducted under NSF Grant No. 89-13065,
the objective of which was to develop and evaluate reliable methods for
concentration and assay of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater.
Results of work conducted under that award have led to formulation of the
following objectives for the renewal period: Determination of the survival of
cell-associated HIV in wastewater after various stages of its treatment,
improvement of concentration and assay procedures, development and evaluation of
a device or procedure for concentration of the HIV in wastewater and field
studies to isolate indigenous HIV in raw and treated wastewater. The survival
characteristics of the HIV under environmental stresses have not been well-
established. While there is no present indication that the environmental media
have any role in spreading the virus from infected to non-infected individuals,
the virus has been shown to survive for significant periods of time in the
environment. The results of this research are expected to provide the basis for
any changes, if any are found to be needed, in the engineering design of
collection systems, treatment processes and systems for management of wastes
that are infected with the HIV to be responsive to its survival and potential
infectivity.
