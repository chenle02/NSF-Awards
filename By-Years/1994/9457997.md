9457997 Winey This research explores the interdependence of structure and
properties in complex systems, particularly systems involving copolymers. Using
a comprehensive approach involving synthesis, structure and properties, this
proposal addresses the fundamental questions of sequence distribution and non-
universality. With the inspiration of nature's remarkable protein engineering,
it will strive to develop the technological applications of copolymers and their
blends to their full capacity. %%% ***
