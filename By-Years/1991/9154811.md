This project is designed to reach rural middle school and high school science
teachers in Colorado through the use of a mobile science show followed by an
intensive summer workshop and networking activities. The Mobile Science Show
will bring workshops and demonstrations to more than four hundred (400) rural
teachers, from which fifty (50) will be selected to attend the two-week summer
workshop. The fifty teachers will form the core of a network for the future
sharing and dissemination of materials and ideas.
