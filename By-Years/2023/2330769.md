The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
revolutionize the current approach to decision-making processes in disease
treatment. The project will help transform how patients, their families, and
healthcare providers navigate the complex landscape of disease treatment
options. It aspires to empower these stakeholders with personalized, data-driven
treatment recommendations, considering a comprehensive set of individual patient
attributes and real-world variables such as the location, budget, and insurance
details. By making disease treatment more personalized and efficient, the
project is poised to significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce
healthcare costs. Furthermore, its commercial potential is substantial, given
the growing need for personalized healthcare solutions and the rise of
artificial intelligence-powered applications in healthcare.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of artificial intelligence-
powered platform that provides personalized disease treatment recommendations.
The innovation lies in leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to
analyze a wide array of patient-specific and disease-specific data, leading to
more accurate treatment suggestions tailored to each individual patient's unique
circumstances and features. The project aims to address the problem of
overwhelming and often confusing treatment options by providing clear, data-
backed suggestions via the developed platform. By doing so, it offers an
opportunity to enhance the treatment decision-making process and ultimately
improve the quality of patient care.
