Formal methods are a branch of computer science that seek to rigorously
characterize the behavior of computer software and hardware through mathematical
tools and techniques. Formal methods' tools have been rapidly gaining in scale
and maturity, but at the same time, digital applications themselves are reaching
a level of cost, complexity, and criticality that call out for even advanced
rigorous design methodologies supported by formal tools. The past few years have
seen rapidly growing adoption of formal tools in domains such as compilers,
operating systems, file systems, real-time systems, and cyber-human systems,
among others. This award organizes a Bootcamp on Formal Methods in the Field
(FMitF) with the objective of training students in the latest advances in the
applications of formal techniques in specific domains so that they can undertake
ambitious projects. The workshop is scheduled for the last week of May 2020,
immediately following the tenth Summer School on Formal Techniques (SSFT). The
FMitF Bootcamp aims to create a self-sustaining community of researchers at the
cutting-edge of the application of formal methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
FMitF Bootcamp creates a partnership between domain experts, formal methods
experts, and student researchers for developing high-impact, cutting-edge ideas
and applications in these individual domains. The FMitF bootcamp is an
opportunity for students to develop verified artifacts including algorithms,
libraries, infrastructure, and applications. These artifacts can seed more
ambitious research projects that take on the challenge of creating trustworthy
applications with clear and precise specifications. The SSFT has been received
enthusiastically by the participants, and helped develop a well-knit community
of young researchers. Co-locating the workshop with the SSFT makes it easier to
attract already trained students to the FMitF Bootcamp. The Bootcamp organizers
will seek to broaden participation by encouraging attendance from under-
represented groups in the computing domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
