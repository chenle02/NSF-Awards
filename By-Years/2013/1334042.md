The research objective of this award is to develop and implement first-order
trust-search methods for use in large-scale data-generated optimization
problems. Data-generated problems arise in applications such as signal and image
processing. These problems are especially difficult to solve since the data are
often high dimensional and are noisy, incomplete, and/or inexact. This research
will develop first-order quasi-Newton trust-search methods for solving large
data-generated problems. The methods to be used are trust-search methods, which
are hybridizations of the most fundamental types of methods for unconstrained
optimization: trust-region methods and line-search methods. Trust-search methods
seek to implement line-search strategies in combination with trust-region
theoretics to obtain more robust methods.

If successful, the results of this research will help scientists and engineers
solve optimization problems involving large volumes of corrupted data. In
today's world, scientific data are more abundant than ever before; moreover,
projects are already underway to produce even more data at a faster rate. To
keep pace, the emerging field of "big data" requires sophisticated, fast,
robust, and large-scale numerical algorithms. This research will use linear
algebra and optimization theory to develop software for processing and analyzing
very large data sets. In particular, the results of this research will help
solve important problems in image processing applications such as medical
imaging, low-light video surveillance, and nocturnal ecological activity
monitoring, where the generated data are not only very large but are very noisy.
The algorithms will be disseminated publically for use within and outside the
scientific community. Graduate students will be trained in scientific research
and programming through this research, and the participation of students from
under-represented backgrounds will be highly encouraged.
