Chipola College, Tallahassee Community College, and nonmetropolitan industry
leaders join with the Florida State University Information Use Management and
Policy Institute and School of Library and Information Studies to examine the
educational and career pathways of information technology (IT) technicians
supporting broadband deployment in communities in Northwest Florida. The mixed
methods research project investigates the region's broadband staffing needs to
identify the roles of broadband technicians, education needed to develop the
knowledge and skills to be successful in these roles, and the process to sustain
long-lasting partnerships between educational and industry stakeholders. The
pervasive nature of broadband indicates a need for IT/broadband workers who can
handle a broad range of issues associated with the needs of commerce and
communities in the region. In addition, the study conceptualizes and establishes
the use of the term, nonmetropolitan, to describe communities that are adjacent
to metro or urban areas and comprise a population of both rural and urban
residents. The study deliverables include 1) a gap analysis that supports
curriculum development; 2) creation of a network of nonmetropolitan stakeholders
that includes employers, industries, community institutions, and technician
educators; 3) an iterative curriculum/labor needs assessment that ensures depth
and breadth of findings; 4) multiple faculty/industry workshops that deliver
recommendations and solicit faculty/industry review of research findings; and 5)
an array of activities that supports broad dissemination of the findings to
inform local educators and industry, and engage all stakeholders in ongoing
discussion. The research study contributes to a growing, though limited body of
knowledge on the intersecting needs of IT technicians, educators, and employers
in broadband technologies.
