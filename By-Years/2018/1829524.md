Persistent memory technique is envisioned to revolutionize data center storage
systems. Its unpredictable performance, energy, and cost benefits can adversely
affect productivity, efficiency, and profit in data centers. Though promising,
this technical transition can fundamentally change the decades-long memory and
storage system design assumptions and introduce critical design challenges. For
example, new performance landscape can change the energy efficiency model of
data centers and break the existing load balance across various system
resources; traditional data reliability schemes can become suboptimal due to the
discrepant failure patterns and reliability issues of new memory technologies;
current applications and system software may not fully exploit the benefits
offered by persistent memory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on
enhancing the performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of data center
storage system by fully exploiting the potential of persistent memory. The
central approach is to rethink data center architecture design strategies and
memory/storage stack management, making them persistent memory aware. The
project devises fundamental techniques in efficiency modeling, load balancing of
critical system resources, and low-cost reliability guarantee across single
server memory/storage stack and distributed storage systems. The project also
enhances a set of key data center applications by leveraging persistent memory.
It is expected that research ideas developed in this project will enable
significantly improved access performance, energy efficiency, reliability, and
lifetime in data center memory and storage systems, taking a large step in
making our daily lives more productive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
