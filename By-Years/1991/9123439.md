This grant will support the improvement of the insect collections at Ohio
State, in conjunction with OSU's development of a "Museum of Biological
Diversity", a renovated facility to house its biological collections. The OSU
insect collection, with about 3.5 million specimens and over 2500 primary types,
is the 14th largest in North America and fifth largest among those at U.S.
universities. Geographic coverage is worldwide; taxonomic strengths are the
Homoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. The collection, now scattered
among five rooms, will be consolidated in the new facility in a climate
controlled area that is twice as large as the current collection area, thus
allowing for future growth. New cabinets will alleviate current crowding, allow
for expansion and will replace wooden cabinets, which are inadequate for housing
the collection or protecting it against pests. Institutional commitments include
provision of the new collection area and a promise to make a collection manager
position permanent after the expiration of the project. These collections are an
extremely important, international resource for systematic, biodiversity and
ecological studies on arthropods, and play a strong role in the training of
students in entomological research. This project will make the OSU collection
more accessible to the scientific community and further its use in research and
education on the biology of insects.
