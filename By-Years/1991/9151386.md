A cooperative effort involving Appalachian State University, Rollins College,
and Winston State University is under way that is introducing students and
faculty to the use of computer algebra systems. These systems are being used in
the revision of pre-calculus courses at all three institutions. A new laboratory
at Winston Salem State equipped with Macintosh computers is used to implement
these changes at that institution.
