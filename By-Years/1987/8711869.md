This award will provide partial travel support for participants in a symposium
on "The Earth as Transformed by Human Action" that will be held in October,
1987. The symposium will bring together 40 leading scholars in the environmental
sciences who will present original papers that document human effects on global
biospheric changes over the past 300 years. The materials presented at the
symposium will be disseminated through a scholarly volume based on the papers
and discussion and via other channels. This symposium will deepen our
understanding of the complex relationships between mankind and the physical
environment at global and large-region scales. It will also explore the social
processes and social-scientific theories relevant to those relationships.
