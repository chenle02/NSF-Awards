The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry
supports Professor Murray Johnston of the University of Delaware to investigate
chemical reactions in aerosol droplets that may contribute to formation of
organic particulate matter in the atmosphere. The main health impacts of air
pollution arise from ozone and particulate matter. This project studies how
water in airborne particles can assist formation of organic particulate matter
from volatile organic compounds in ways that are not readily predicted by
studying chemical reactions in bulk aqueous solution. This project also
contributes to the development of the scientific workforce through graduate
student training in an environment that encourages multidisciplinary innovation
and public outreach. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An aerosol flow reactor is used to
study chemical reactions on the surface of aqueous ammonium sulfate droplets
that combine two volatile monomer reactants to give a nonvolatile dimer product.
These reactions include aldehyde-aldehyde reactions to produce an aldol,
aldehyde-alcohol reaction to produce a hemiacetal, and alcohol-acid reaction to
produce an ester. The reactor system has the ability to precisely control
initial droplet size and composition including water content, ionic strength and
acidity. Systematic control of these variables provides insight into reaction
mechanisms. Intermediates and products of the reactions are characterized and,
where possible, quantified with a variety of online mass spectrometry methods.
These methods include elemental analysis with the nano aerosol mass
spectrometer, which gives a measure of droplet acidity based on the nitrogen-to-
sulfur mole ratio, and molecular analysis with droplet assisted ionization and
extractive electrospray ionization. Students supported by the project are
broadly trained in environmental chemistry, analytical chemistry and
nanoscience. They bring environmental topics to the attention of scientists and
non-scientists alike through various outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
