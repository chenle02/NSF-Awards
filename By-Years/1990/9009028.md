This project addresses issues in heteroepitaxy through research into MBE growth
and detailed characterization of epitaxial fluoride buffer films on silicon
substrates, and subsequent overgrowth with III-V materials (GaAs, InGaAs). The
aim is to understand how to tailor and control defects in the overlayers by
using such buffer films. A general goal of the project is to study heteroepitaxy
from the point of view of engineering ideal substrates for semiconductor
materials used in photonic and electronic applications.
