The proposal studies "Heegaard Floer homology," which is an invaraint for three-
and four-dimensional spaces constructed by the investigator in collaboration
with Zoltan Szabo. A variant of this construction, called "knot Floer homology",
can be used to study knotted curves in three-dimensional space. A three-
dimensional space can be built up out of smaller pieces which fit together along
their boundaries. A further aspect of the proposal deals with how to reconstruct
the Heegaard Floer homology of a three-dimensional space in terms of data
associated to its component pieces. This reconstruction procedure, entitled
"bordered Floer homology", is studied in collaboration with Robert Lipshitz and
Dylan Thurston. The proposal aims to further strengthen the bordered theory, and
explore its applications. A better understanding of these constructions will
lead to further applications of these new constructions to knot theory and the
topology of three- and four-dimensional spaces. Heegaard Floer homology brings
together tools from various mathematical disciplines, including symplectic
geometry, analysis, and homological algebra to study problems in knot theory and
low-dimensional topology, in a way which was partially inspired by modern
physics. As such, it lies at a fertile intellectual crossroads, bringing new
perspectives to neighboring subjects, and providing novel methods for attacking
old problems.

The proposal aims to study bordered Floer homology as a tool for studying
various versions of Heegaard Floer homology and knot Floer homology. Part of the
proposal will start by extending the bordered theory to include the full
(unspecialized) Heegaard Floer homology for three-manifolds with torus boundary.
In a different direction, bordered Floer homology will be extended to a tool for
studying and computing knot Floer homology. Applications of these structures
include a study of new concordance homomorphisms from knot Floer homology.
