The investigator studies influences of boolean functions using Gaussian Hilbert
spaces. The investigator is interested in particular in problems arising in the
theory of social choice, in hardness of approximation and in learning theory.
The investigator further studies a number of inference algorithms on graphical
models using techniques from probability and statistical physics in general and
the theory of Gibbs measures on trees in particular. These algorithms are used
for phylogenetic inference, for computing marginals in Markov random fields and
for solving satisfiability problems.

In the first topic the investigator studies questions like: ``How do we design a
reliable voting scheme? What is the effect of error in voting machines on the
outcome of a vote?''. The same mathematical questions are also important in
understanding theoretical questions arising in high-performance computing, in
particular the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately solving
``hard'' problems. In the second topic, the investigator is motivated by
questions on ancestral relationship that are central in modern biological and
medical research, and in problems of high-dimensional statistical inference that
play an important role in expert systems and data-mining.
