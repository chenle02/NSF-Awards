9633479 Bennett This award supports graduate student participation in the "
Hysteresis Modeling and Micromagnetism" to be held on May 20-22, 1996 at the
Ashburn, Virginia campus of George Washington University. Hysteresis is a
widespread phenomenon, studied most intensively in magnetism, but also found in
ferroelectricity, mechanical behavior including shape memory effects,
adsorption, and many other fields. This workshop will focus its main attention
on magnetic hysteresis, but some seminal work in nonmagnetic hysteresis will be
brought into the discussion by leading practitioners in these areas.
Micromagnetism is a theoretical formulation which permits the prediction of
domains and domain walls, and their movement in changing magnetic fields.
Micromagnetism is currently in a very high state of world-wide activities. This
workshop is unique in that it addresses not only the statistical modeling (i.e.
hysteresis), but the relationship between hysteresis and micromagnetism. ***
