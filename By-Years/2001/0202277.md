This is a proposal to prepare a planning grant for Tampa Bay regional center for
manufacturing. This Center involves educational material development, adaptation
and implementation from existing centers, and professional development for
educators. A new manufacturing program at Hillsborough Community College (HCC),
an emerging manufacturing technology program at St Petersburg College (SPC), and
an active industry focused Engineering College at the University of South
Florida (USF) form a strong academic foundation for the creation of this
regional center. Furthermore, the manufacturing companies also recognize the
urgent need to refocus manufacturing education in the region. Hence, the
planning grant time and funds are going to be directed to conducting job and
skill analysis, DACUMs, and fine tuning of results of the state-wide effort that
are currently underway to assure maximum coupling among these schools and the
manufacturing companies in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning grant funds
are also going to be used to shape the proposed center's activities. Besides
providing the needed synergy for academic and industrial partners focused on
manufacturing issues, the Center is also going to build a bridge between the
Associate of Science Degree at HCC in Manufacturing Technology and the B.S.
Engineering degree (manufacturing emphasis) offered at the Industrial
Engineering Department within USF's College of Engineering. In addition, the ATE
Center is going to serve as a greater Tampa Bay&lt;br/&gt;regional umbrella for
SPC's and HCC's Manufacturing Technology programs. The center is going to
support all the regional high schools and community colleges that have courses
or programs in manufacturing or related technology fields that should be
revitalized.&lt;br/&gt;
