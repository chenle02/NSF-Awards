The theory of holographic algorithms is expressed by the properties of
realizable signatures. The new algorithmic design principles initiated by Les
Valiant use these signatures to find efficient and unconventional algorithms for
a variety of counting problems. We have already developed a substantial theory
of symmetric signatures, which are particularly useful since they have clear
combinatorial meanings. However in order to understand the full power of
holographic algorithms we must understand realizable but unsymmetric signatures.
The theory of unsymmetric signatures is substantially more involved. We propose
to work toward a complete classification theorem of unsymmetric signatures based
on matchgates and Pfaffians.

The goal of this research in particular, and in computational complexity theory
in general, is to gain a fundamental understanding of the nature of efficient
computation. Holographic algorithms challenge our conception of what is
efficiently computable. This study will sharpen the boundary of what is and what
is not efficiently computable. The proof techniques developed may also be
broadly applicable in related areas of complexity theory. The classification
theorem for all realizable signatures (including symmetric as well as
unsymmetric signatures) will go a long way toward an understanding of what the
ultimate capabilities are with these unconventional holographic algorithms.
