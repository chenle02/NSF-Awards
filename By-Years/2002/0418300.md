The project will further develop and test improved representations of vegetation
processes, including the dynamics of vegetation change, within numerical models
of the earth system. The principal investigator will continue to collaborate
with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to
advance work on the interactive vegetation component as it progresses towards
becoming an integral part of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). A series
of simulations are planned starting with offline land-vegetation simulations,
coupled climate model-fixed vegetation simulations, multi-century pre-industrial
coupled simulation, a long mid-Holocene simulation, and a transient global
warming integration.

The issues raised in this project have application outside these purely modeling
efforts. The final product of this work will be a sophisticated representation
of terrestrial processes within the CCSM, and freely available to other users,
with important implications for our understanding of current and future climate
patterns and changes. Societal benefits from improved understanding of current
anthropogenic impacts are far-reaching.
