9453883 Thompson Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Georgia Tech Research
Institute, and Clark Atlanta University are creating a Multimedia In
Manufacturing Education (MIME) program dedicated to rapidly producing multimedia
courseware suitable for manufacturing education programs. The project taps into
the recent investment in educational technology infrastructure at Georgia Tech
to deliver world-class instruction. By linking this infrastructure with
evaluation programs and research into how to teach with these new media, this
program could help revolutionize manufacturing education, Emerging information
superhighways such as the Internet would allow rapid distribution of these
materials nationwide.
