Recognition of the importance of multiagent coordination has mounted over recent
years, to the degree that it has now assumed a genuine sense of urgency. In the
engineering literature, attempts have been made to address this issue in areas
as varied as multiuser information theory, the theory of distributed estimation
and detection, and decentralized control. Economists have also had a long
standing concern with these issues. Coordination of distributed means, desires
and information using market mechanisms is a central area of economic research.
Computer scientists working on distributed computing also have begun to address
coordination issues over the past decade. A glance at any popular science
magazine will reveal the increasingly distributed nature of information in
today's world and the timeliness of addressing this trend intelligently. In
particular, it is of considerable importance to combine ideas form such diverse
areas as engineering, economics and computational sciences, and fashion them
into a coherent theory of coordination. The proposed work on multiagent
coordination theory can be roughly classified as (i) establishing fundamental
bounds on the costs of enabling coordination, (ii) understanding the optimal
mechanisms of coordination, and (iii) investigation aggregation methods for
situations where large numbers of agents are involved in the coordination task.
