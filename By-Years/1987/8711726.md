The infrared computerized-axial-tomography scan (IR-CAT scan) can be used in
nondestructive testing to identify the presence and shape of cavities internal
to a body. The new methodologies to be developed during the course of the
proposed work will enable irregularly shaped cavities to be identified within
irregularly shaped bodies. With these new methodologies, IR-CAT scan can be
employed in new applications such as the optimum design of structure
configurations. The basic idea is to overspecify the thermal information at one
of the bounding surfaces of a solid and to use the excess information as input
to a numerical procedure which makes use of a temperature-field solution
technique called the boundary element method.
