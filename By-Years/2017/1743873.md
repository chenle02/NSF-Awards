A century ago Max Weber, a German historian and social scientist, gave a
celebrated lecture, entitled ?Science as a Vocation."  The lecture provided an
overview of the external conditions of scientific work?employment security and
circumstances, pay, competition, promotion opportunities--and examined the
personal experience of science and its human and societal meanings. With Weber's
work as a benchmark, this workshop examines stability and change in scientific
careers in order to summarize what is known, to identify areas where new
knowledge about work life and career are needed, and to use what we know to
suggest ways to attract, motivate, and arrange scientific work that ensure its
continued success.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conference participants
systematically and comparatively analyze science as a vocation today, to address
both its external conditions and internal meanings and rewards, in diverse
national contexts. They consider how the institutional dynamics of science
systems, changing modes of research support and performance, and evolving
science-society relationships change the shape, content, and attractiveness of
scientific careers within academe and outside.  Of concern are the direction and
dynamics of change, the potential policy and programmatic responses, and the
likelihood that emerging forms of scientific work life and career will meet the
challenges that lie ahead.
