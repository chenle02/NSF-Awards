Professor Robert L. Kuczkowski of the University of Michigan has received a
research award from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the National
Science Foundation to study small cluster molecules using long wavelength
radiation (similar to that found in ordinary microwave ovens). This work will
provide structural information and electrical properties on the cluster
molecules. An investigative program which examines the dipole moments, structure
and dynamics of weakly bound complexes of hard bases, and charge transfer
complexes will be carried out. Nuclear quadrupole coupling constants and high
temperature samples will also be investigated by means of Fourier Transform
Microwave spectroscopy, a field in which Professor Kuczkowski is a world
authority. He will continue his fruitful collaboration with Dr. Kurt Hillig,
also a member of the University of Michigan's Chemistry Department.
