9513164 Lange This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Prof. Andrew Lange of the California Institute of Technology and Prof.
Toshio Matsumoto of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS).
This project will facilitate the development of, and analysis of data from,
state-of-the-art instrumentation used to conduct astronomical observations at
infrared wavelengths from above the Earth's atmosphere. The studies will address
fundamental problems in astrophysics, including the diffuse infrared background
radiation and the nature of the dark matter in galactic halos. This proposal
brings together research scientists from Japan and the U.S. working in the area
of experimental astrophysics. The U.S. scientists will have the opportunity to
become familiar with research techniques and equipment at ISAS and at Nagoya
University. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in
its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international
collaboration. ***
