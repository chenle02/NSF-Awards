It is the purpose of this project to measure samples of aerosols within the
volcanic plume from Mt. Erebus and also over large areas of Antarctica to
determine if they are of common origin. The samples will be taken from LC-130
aircraft. Samples of aerosols will also be extracted by new cryogenic techniques
from existing ice cores to determine the distribution of the Mt. Erebus
effluents. The goal is to determine the effect of the volcano on the antarctic
climate, troposheric chemistry and ice crystallization processes.
