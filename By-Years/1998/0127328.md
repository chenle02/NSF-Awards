Computer Science (31) This project develops curriculum support materials for use
with undergraduate computer science majors to develop Java based handheld and
smart-card applications for the Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing (HUC) market.

Faculty and students are provided with HUC devices and developing prototype
tools to demonstrate their effective use in our curriculum. Evaluation and
assessment of the tools is done using student evaluations developed by a
behavioral psychologist and interviews conducted by an independent review board
of industry specialists. These tools are incorporated in two of our required and
three of our elective courses. The tools and modules developed will be
disseminated over the Internet via www.sourceforge.net, in a series of papers,
and through a forthcoming Prentice Hall textbook Java Micro Edition Programming.
