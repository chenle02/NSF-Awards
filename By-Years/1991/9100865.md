Recent research in econometrics and statistics has focused on many problems that
are of common interest to both disciplines. One that is especially noteworthy is
functional central limit theory and its manifold applications in statistical
theory, time series and microeconometrics. This project will foster the growing
interaction between professional statisticians and econometricians in this
general field. Building on current areas of strength at Yale University, five
members of the Economics and Statistics Departments will develop a series of
intensive workshops on functional limit theory and its applications: statistical
analyses of trending time series, cointegrated systems, long-run equilibria and
transient dynamics, semiparametrics, empirical processes for dependent variables
and possibly estimation via simulation methods, and structural change/change
point problems. The workshops will bring together small groups of researchers,
both well-established and new contributors, to review current progress and
explore future directions. The workshops will be supplemented by visits from
leading overseas researchers, who will give lecture series at the cutting edge
of their specialties on subject matter that is closely related to the workshop
themes.
