Neuropeptides are compounds in the nervous system that often modulate
physiological functions, and so act as hormones. The insect neuropeptide
allatotropin (AT) is synthesized by specific cells in the central and enteric
nervous systems, and is known to promote the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH),
but also has been implicated in other functions. Recently three other
allatotropin-like neuropeptides, ATL I, II and III have been discovered, encoded
by alternative splicing from AT gene expression. The mRNA for these splice
variants shows specificity in the tissue and the stage of development, and the
gene expression also appears to be under physiological control. This project
combines molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches to clarify when and
where the different mRNAs encocde the unique peptides. Results will provide
information on the mechanisms to precisely control the overall biological
response that results from the expression of a single neuropeptide gene that is
an important regulatory molecule in a model insect species. The scientific
impact will extend beyond insect neuroendocrinology to more general regulatory
physiology, and potentially to insect pest control. The infrastructure impact
includes cross-disciplinary postdoctoral training, which will be enhanced by the
collaborative team approach.
