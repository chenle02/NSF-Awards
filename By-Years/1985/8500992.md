This research deals with the creation of devices for use in an integrated
millimeter-wave receiver in the frequency range 30-100 GHz. Such a receiver is
potentially useful for short-range atmospheric communications where there are
large unassigned frequency bands. Interest in this area is increasing because
advances in gallium arsenide microfabrication have made it possible to build
millimeter wave devices in integrated form. The major problems to address
involve circuit design and circuit measurements. While the problems of circuit
design are relatively straightforward, the problems of circuit measurement are
much more difficult. Although there is instrumentation available, none has
proven to be adequate for research in this frequency range, particularly at the
higher end. Instead of coupling into the waveguide as is usually done, the
measurements are performed in an integrated circuit fashion right on the chip
itself or by coupling to other planar circuits.
