This project involves using a new characterization of blowup for the three-
dimensional Euler equations for an ideal fluid, in terms of the Riemannian
geometry of the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms (as originally
pioneered by Arnold). The criterion is that geodesics in this group, which
represent Lagrangian motions of fluids, fail to minimize length on ever-shorter
intervals as the blowup time is reached. This condition can be understood in
terms of positive blowup of the sectional curvature, as well as in terms of the
weak geometry of the space of volume-preserving maps. We propose to investigate
the geometry using three simpler approximate geometries in order to try to rule
out blowup geometrically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves studying
the Euler equations, which describe the motion of a fluid in three dimensions.
The problem of showing that these equations can be used to describe the fluid
forever, even if the motion becomes very turbulent, has been studied for
hundreds of years but remains unsolved. We propose a new approach which involves
viewing the fluid geometrically, as a shortest path in an infinite-dimensional
curved space (in much the same way that an airplane traces out a length-
minimizing path on the two-dimensional curved surface of the earth). Although
this geometric picture of a fluid has been known since the 1960s, only recently
has it been possible to relate turbulent motion to path length in this curved
space, and the project is to use this approach to help decide whether the
equations are always valid or whether they have to "blow up" when the fluid
motion gets too complicated.
