(Public Law 111-5).

This engineering education research award to the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign will employ researchers to investigate the learning mechanisms
and benefits to engineering education of popular and rapidly expanding
international service learning projects. These projects are believed to elicit
many of the competencies for future engineers described as essential by the
National Academy of Engineering and engineering education accreditation boards.
The results of this research will enable the development and dissemination of
research-based educational materials for project-centered service-learning
experiences for engineers. It will also lead to the discovery of models and
pedagogical approaches for incorporating key features of co-curricular
international project work into the mainstream of instruction and curriculum
reform. International projects may be a powerful means to provide preparation
for professional practice, developing knowledge and competencies in meaningful
contexts that are applicable for both domestic and international engineering
projects. The acquisition of these competencies will better prepare engineering
students to participate in a more globally competitive workforce.
