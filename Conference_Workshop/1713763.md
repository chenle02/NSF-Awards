This award provides funding for US participation in the "Computational Methods
and Function Theory 2017 Conference" that will be held at Lublin, Poland, 2017
during July 10-15, 2017.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of Geometric Function Theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians
have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early
career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded
by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.
The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at: http://cmft2017.umcs.lublin.pl/
