Plant hormones interact with genetic and environmental factors to regulate
every aspect of plant growth, development and physiology. Despite intense
effort, mechanisms of plant hormone actions are not well defined. This project
will examine the effects of plant hormones on plant plasma membrane ion channels
in an effort to define their mode of action. Patch voltage clamp, magnetic
resonance, and fluorescence techniques will be used to determine if models of
intracellular control based on calcium entry or internal calcium release can
account for the diverse effects of plant hormones. In particular, suspension
cell culture-derived protoplasts and isolated guard cell protoplasts of Vicia
faba will be examined to identify ion channels, to measure channel selectivity
and voltage dependence, and to test whether voltage changes may arise from the
action of electrogenic proton pumps, channel activation, or a combination of
pumps and channels. A specific model of stimulus-linked changes in guard cell
volume will be tested. The results of these studies should contribute
substantially to our understanding of basic mechanisms of action of plant
hormones.
