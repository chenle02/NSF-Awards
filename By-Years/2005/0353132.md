Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;We are addressing a major issue facing many
computer science students, i.e., that they are deficient in mathematics in
general and that they do not see the relevance of mathematics to computer
science, by integrating discrete mathematics into the first-year computer
science curriculum via CS-Complete examples. A CS-Complete example is a problem
that covers the topics of representation, problem solving, algorithms,
recursion, induction, and data structures. In order to further help with the
integration of discrete mathematics into the first year computer science
sequence, we are constructing software tools that provide students with an
enhanced integrated development environment for Java that enables them to
analyze their computer programs (in terms of their correctness and time
complexity) while they are creating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two
primary goals of this project. First, we are producing a useful software
development tool that enhances instruction in the introductory computer science
curriculum and is useful for practicing software developers as well. Second, we
are producing model first and second course syllabi that cover all of the core
topics of the Programming Fundamentals plus over 25% of the core topics of the
Discrete Structures, Algorithms and Complexity, and Software Engineering areas
of the Computing Curricula 2001 proposal for Computer Science.
