This workshop features senior scholars of color sharing their expertise on
recruiting and retaining faculty of color at the department level, the college
level, and the institutional level. The workshop has three tangible outcomes: 1)
To educate search committees on the best practices of recruiting and retaining
faculty of color. 2) To educate college leaders on why faculty of color leave,
and how to create campuses that welcome faculty of color, and 3) To identify
specific institutional changes college leaders may make to ensure the faculty
body reflects the student body. The workshop will be of interest to department
chairs, search committee chairs, and campus trustees. In order to maximize
attendance, the workshop is being held at the Annual Meeting of the American
Political Science Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
