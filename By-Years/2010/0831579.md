This collaborative project investigates a number of fundamental
&lt;br/&gt;problems that are very critical to wireless mesh network (WMN)
&lt;br/&gt;throughput optimization. Wireless mesh networking is believed to
&lt;br/&gt;be the most effective and efficient technology for the last-mile
&lt;br/&gt;data connection to the Internet. The proposed research targets
&lt;br/&gt;to solve the following challenges: 1) Throughput optimization in
&lt;br/&gt;MR-MC WMNs: the complexity of throughput-optimal scheduling,
&lt;br/&gt;real-time logical topology characterization and inference, the
&lt;br/&gt;joint exploitation of both rate diversity and channel diversity,
&lt;br/&gt;and game theory based throughput optimization. 2) Non information
&lt;br/&gt;theory based approaches to throughput optimization in multi-hop
&lt;br/&gt;MIMO-enabled WMNs: stochastically modeling different aspects of
&lt;br/&gt;the mesh network, constructing Network Utility Maximization
&lt;br/&gt;formulations, and applying Information Geometric Programming to
&lt;br/&gt;solve global optimization problems. 3) Biologically-inspired WMN
&lt;br/&gt;design for throughput optimizatio n. 4) A testbed to accomplish
&lt;br/&gt;experimental tasks to validate the effectiveness of the design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in nature multidisciplinary. It requires
the &lt;br/&gt;joint effort from computer science, electrical engineering,
&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, statistics, and biology, and therefore has the
&lt;br/&gt;potential to inspire revolutionary methodologies that could be
&lt;br/&gt;applied to many domains. In addition, the novelty of the proposed
&lt;br/&gt;research has strong impact on wireless research. Furthermore, the
&lt;br/&gt;success of this project is able to enhance the four universities?
&lt;br/&gt;ability to educate, through the multi-disciplinary research effort,
&lt;br/&gt;future scientists and engineers.
