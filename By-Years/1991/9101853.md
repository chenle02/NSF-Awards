A 32 node parallel processing computer will be used at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center to investigate a variety of problems in theoretical
elementary particle physics whose solution requires a high degree of
computational power. The problems will be tackled by replacing the continuum of
space and time by a discrete lattice of points. This approach will be used to
calculate quantities relating to the masses of the elementary particles and to
the behavior of these particles with respect to both the strong and the weak
nuclear forces. It is hoped that progress will be made on major questions that
cannot be addressed in any other way. Techniques for effectively carrying out
physics computations on highly- parallel processors will be developed.
