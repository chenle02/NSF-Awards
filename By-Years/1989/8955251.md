This project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, is an 18 month
project starting March 1, 1990. It is intended for 50 outstanding middle school
and high school (grades 7-9) teachers who have the responsibility for teaching
the first school physical science course. Funds will support: (1) the national
recruitment and selection of the participants, (2) an intensive four-week summer
course held on the campus of Princeton University which will include content
instruction and the development of teaching materials, (3) publication of the
most useful examples of the instructional materials prepared during the summer
program and (4) stipends for outreach activities by the participants during the
next academic year. A long-term goal of the project is to build a cadre of
experienced, knowledgeable teachers who will become educational leaders and
school resource agents. The National Science Foundation is a participant in a
larger project whose total budget is $3,029,590. NSF dollars in the amount of
$381,910 are therefore being matched approximately 8:1 with funds from other
sources.
