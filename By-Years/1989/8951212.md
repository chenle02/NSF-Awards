This project allows the chemistry department of Bemidji State University to
improve and modernize its advanced undergraduate laboratory instrumentation. The
goal of this project is to expose the advanced laboratory students to state of
the art instrumentation. The acquisition of an HPLC, a fraction collector, a
rotary evaporator, and a freeze dryer allows students in advanced organic lab to
isolate and identify biologically active compounds from plant sources. This
"chemistry project" is a one quarter long chemistry experiment where the
students learn advanced techniques in extractions, separations, bioassay
methodologies, and organic structure elucidation. The acquired instrumentation
is also used in biochemistry, immunology, and instrumental labs. The institution
is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
