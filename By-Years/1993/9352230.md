Improving Quantitative and Critical Thinking Skills in Introductory Biology
Students in an introductory biology course improve quantitative and critical
thinking skills by conducting laboratory exercises requiring increased use of
data collection, recording, analysis, and reporting. Microscopy laboratories
include exercises requiring measuring, counting and estimating. Electrophoresis
experiments separating DNA fragments are incorporated into the regular
laboratory schedule. Increased use of lab exercises focusing on cellular and
molecular biology provide students better opportunities to utilize the tools of
biology and connect biology with related disciplines (chemistry). Students work
in teams and utilize a collaborative learning methodology which extends to both
lecture and small group weekly sessions.
