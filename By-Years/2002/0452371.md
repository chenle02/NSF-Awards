Oregon Public Broadcasting is requesting funds to produce three one-hour
nationally broadcast television programs, a project website, community-centered
outreach coordinated by AAAS in 7 U.S. cities, a seminar discussion guide and a
series of 90-second programs as part of the "Earth &Sky" radio series. The
subject and purpose of the project is to attract public interest in
nanotechnology by examining the social, ethical, legal and environmental issuers
surrounding its application. The television programs will be produced by Fred
Friendly Seminars (FFS) and broadcast on PBS. Two science museums, Boston Museum
of Science and the South Carolina State Museum, and the University of
California, Berkeley, will host the FFS panels. The format of the Seminars is
designed to produce thought provoking and nuanced discussions of contemporary
issues. Collaborative partners in the project include AAAS, Lawrence Hall of
Science and ICAN Productions. The outreach initiative includes outreach to
"targeted stakeholders" in 7 US cities, four 90-second radio spots as part of
Earth & Sky, a project web site and a Seminar discussion guide. Inverness
Research Associates and Edu, Inc. will conduct both formative and summative
evaluation of the project components.
