This project is aimed to develop a model free variable selection method under
the framework of sufficient dimension reduction. With many advantages over more
traditional subset selection methods in linear models, regularization has been
introduced to model free framework. However, there are only a few results on the
consistency of variable selection and the efficiency of the estimation of the
dimension reduction subspace. This is partly due to the fact that regularization
is often applied to eigenvectors of candidate matrices instead of individual
predictors. The investigator proposes a penalized objective function with
adaptive shrinkages to select variables without rigid parametric or semi-
parametric model assumptions. The proposed new approach synthesizes the
progresses in two fronts of statistical research: regularization method in
linear models and sufficient dimension reduction in regression.

Selection of important factors can provide a better understanding and
interpretation of underlying scientific process, obtain numerically efficient
and consistent results, and improve accuracy of prediction whenever applicable.
It has become the focus of current research in areas for which data sets with
hundreds and thousands of variables are quite common. Examples include
bioinformatics, data mining, classification, and pattern recognition. With
limited knowledge of the underlying models, good model free methods for
selecting important variables are in high demand. This project will investigate
model free methods for the selection of key variables. The research findings are
expected to yield substantial gains in the efficiency of data management,
especially for high dimensional cases which have been the hallmark of
contemporary social, economic, and scientific data analysis.
