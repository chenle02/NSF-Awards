This program is supporting 21 science, mathematics and engineering student
scholars for each of their four years at the university. Program highlights
include a mathematics and science "boot camp," additional educational support
and strengthening of ties between Robert Morris University(RMU) and employers.
The boot camp precedes the start of the fall semester of students' freshman
year, helping scholars transition from high-school to university, preparing them
to handle challenging courses. Educational support includes a living-learning
environment, emphasis on effective study habits, time management and involvement
in campus life. Scholars have extensive access to the Career Center. The program
is also supporting academic success through seminars, field trips, internships,
research and cultural, outreach and social events. This program is helping the
university expand relationships with employers. RMU adds at least three new
employers each year to its partnerships, providing internships, research
projects, real-world problems, tours and job opportunities. The program is
increasing enrollment, recruitment, and retention of high-caliber students from
all groups including first-generation students, minorities and women.
