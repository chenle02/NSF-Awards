3 '-azido-2 ',3'-deoxyuridine (AZDU) has commercial potential as a therapeutic
agent in the treatment of AIDS. At the present time it is produced via a complex
expensive solution synthesis. The purpose of this Phase II SBIR research project
is to investigate the scale-up potential of a solid phase synthesis procedure
which has already been proven feasible in the laboratory under a Phase I grant.
The motivation includes substantial savings in production costs and an
environmentally benign process with minimal waste generation. The process for
the solid state synthesis progresses in four stages: 1. Activation of the
functionalized polymer support 2. Bonding of nucleoside to the resin 3.
Conversion to polymer-bound AZDU 4. Product removal by hydrolysis with
regeneration of the functionalized polymer Eventually production could be
largely automated. There is a potential that in lots of several kilograms, AZDU
can be produced by solid-phase technology for half of the cost required for the
solution method.
