0932724&lt;br/&gt;Graedel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, the long term
availability of "specialty metals" of great importance to society (e.g.,
hafnium, niobium, molybdenum, cobalt, tantalum, etc.) is essentially unknown.
Methodology for assessing the "criticality" of these materials will be used
together with extensive data on geology, product engineering, and other relevant
factors to evaluate the criticality of twelve metals central to modern
technology. This will provide a comprehensive analytical framework for assessing
the criticality of the specialty metals, as well as new guidance to product
designers and industry and government managers and policy makers. The results of
this research are anticipated to be immediately employable critical materials
information for sectors including corporate design engineers, international
trade analysts, industry institutes, and the National Defense Stockpile Center.
Additionally, the research project will train a dozen young scientists and
engineers in the assessment of the long-term sustainability of materials.
