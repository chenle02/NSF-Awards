The project represents the extension and development of a program of basic
research in statistical mechanics and the study of ordered states of matter,
phase transitions between these states, and related critical phenomena. A
variety of theoretical techniques will brought to bear including
phenomenological and scaling analyses, renormalization group calculations, Monte
Carlo simulations with the aid of a supercomputer facility, exact mathematical
solutions of model statistical mechanical systems, series expansions for
singular thermodynamic properties and their extrapolation.
