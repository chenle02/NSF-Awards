This award will provide funds to partially support 10 junior researchers and 5
invited speakers to participate in an international research workshop on
"Developments and Challenges in bump hunting, mixtures and measurement error
models" to be held in Cleveland, June 2-4, 2002. The workshop has multiple
purposes. It brings together statisticians and a collection of scientists from
different fields, yet all working towards similar scientific goals, to exchange
new techniques and explore merging ideas. The workshop provides a unique
opportunity for young statisticians to interact with leaders in these related
fields. It invites experts with a national reputation from astronomy, biology
and medicine, to discuss challenges to statistics, particularly in bump hunting,
mixture modeling, clustering and measurement error models.
