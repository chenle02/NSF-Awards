9971953 Wilkerson Wilkerson will continue his work with Dwyer on the extended
Steenrod problem of understanding spaces with properties at a prime similar to
those of the classifying spaces of connected compact Lie groups. He will also
work with Jeff Smith on homotopy automorphism groups of finite nilpotent
complexes and actions of finite groups on such complexes. In addition, he will
work with Jim Turner and Avramov on analogues of the Serre theorem that
establishes that non-trivial simply connected finite complexes have nontrivial
homotopy in an infinite number of dimensions. McClure will work with Jeff Smith
on higher centers of associative ring spectra. He will also investigate a large
class of spectral sequences that should admit chain-complex models that
facilitate calculation. A step in this project that should be interesting in its
own right is to show that certain homotopy categories of module spectra can be
modeled by chain complexes. Shipley will develop a new model for equivariant
stable homotopy theory; this will provide algebraic models for rational
equivariant stable homotopy theory over compact Lie groups. She will also study
(with Dwyer) a cobar spectral sequence and its convergence properties. With Rezk
and Schwede she will study a way to replace arbitrary model categories by
simplicial model categories. Smith will continue his work on using the theory of
model categories as a tool for the study of ring spectra and of commutative ring
spectra. In particular, he will study the homotopy theory of ring spectra over a
fixed ring R, the homotopy theory of coalgebras of R-bimodules, and the bar
construction. He will improve his theory of combinatorial model categories to
make it a more effective tool. In joint work with Adem he will study the
homotopy theory of group actions on homotopy products of spheres. As can be seen
from this summary, this project will involve research in many different
directions within homotopy theory. Several of the problems to be investigated
have been important for a long time (for example, the Steenrod problem and the
joint work of Smith and Adem go back to the 1960's), while others involve very
recent developments (especially the theory of strictly associative and
commutative ring spectra; Smith and Shipley were pioneers in this area, and
McClure's work makes heavy use of it). The joint work of McClure and Smith has
applications to mathematical physics, since it is closely related to recent work
of Kontsevich and Tamarkin on deformation quantization. ***
