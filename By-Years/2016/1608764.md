Most objects in nature are non-smooth; in other words, they have singularities.
Mathematics has had tremendous success in dealing with smooth objects--for
example, surfaces or more generally manifolds. In this project, the PI proposes
the study of calculus on singular spaces and in particular the study of maps
between such spaces that are optimal in the sense of minimizing energy. From
this, the PI will deduce properties of symmetries of such spaces that are of
interest in mathematics and applications. The project also has an education
component in which the PI plans to advise graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study several questions dealing with
harmonic maps between singular spaces. The main goal is to prove that, despite
the singularities of the ambient spaces, harmonic maps have sufficient
regularity so that geometric rigidity holds. Several applications to geometric
group theory, character varieties, measured foliations, and Teichmuller theory
will be pursued. These questions are a continuation of the PI's work on
geometric super rigidity via harmonic maps.
