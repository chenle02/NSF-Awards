This Research Planning grant is directed at preparing a proposal for studies of
Hadronization and Quark-Gluon Plasma in the Early Universe. Using the standard
model of the early universe as a working, semi-empirical theoretical basis, the
purpose of the research is to consider the implications of this model for the
epoch shortly after the initial explosion.
