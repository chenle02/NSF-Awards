9318193 Hogue-Angeletti We request funds toward the purchase of an instrument
for matrix-assisted laser desorption, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALD-TOF
MS) for a core laboratory with an established record of cooperation and
productivity. This instrument will enable a group of investigators at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine to determine protein and glycoprotein masses at
high sensitivity. In addition to routine analysis of protein samples to assess
molecular weight, purity, and to verify structures, the MALD-TOF mass
spectrometer will be used to: 1) identify proteins involved in the formation of
secretory granules and in protein sorting mechanisms; 2) study the processing of
processing enzymes; 3) identify proteins and peptides secreted by ependyma and
choroid plexus cells; 4) characterize the taxol binding site on microtubules; S)
study the mechanism of ATP- dependent proteases; 6) analysis of proteins rapidly
phosphorylated in tyrosine in response to colony stimulating factor-l.
