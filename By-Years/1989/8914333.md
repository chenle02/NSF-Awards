To date, studies on the evolution of cooperation have centered on interactions
between two individuals. The proposed work expands the study of the evolution of
cooperation to groups of any size, not just groups of size two. Two approaches
are used. 1. Mathematical models will allow predictions of the amount of
cooperation displayed in groups of various sizes. 2. A biological system which
involves anti-predator behavior groups will be used to test the mathematical
models. In some species of fish, a small group of individuals move away from the
school they belong to and cooperatively investigate potentially dangerous
predators. This system will allow manipulation of the costs and benefits
associated with being cooperative. Subsequent testing will show whether the
degree of cooperation predicted by mathematical models is, in fact, displayed in
nature.
