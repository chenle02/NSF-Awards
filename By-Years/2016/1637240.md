The motivation for the workshop is the realization on the part of many women
researchers in the speech science and technology fields that there seem to be
relatively few junior women researchers in the 'pipeline' to careers in speech.
This issue is addressed by providing a venue where students in speech science
and technology can present their work to each other and to senior women
researchers, and where senior women can describe their own research and career
experience to students and mentor them.

The workshop is intended for women undergraduate and masters students who are
currently working in speech science and technology. It is held at Interspeech
2016, featuring panel discussions with senior female speech science and
technology researchers, student poster presentations, and a mentoring session.
The workshop is designed to foster interest in research in the field of speech
technology in women at the undergraduate or masters level who have not yet
committed to getting a PhD in speech science or technology areas but who have
had some research experience in their college and universities on individual or
group projects in those areas.
