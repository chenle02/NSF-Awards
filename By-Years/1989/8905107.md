The research proposed here concerns sediment-hosted micron gold (SHMG)
deposits, which are the largest fossil hydrothermal systems in the Great Basin
(Fig. 1) and the most important sources of gold in the U.S. The project will
focus on determination of: 1) deposit-scale zoning, which could provide
information on the source of SHMG mineralizing fluids, as well as the
temperature, pressure and crustal depth at which they formed. 2) the age of
these deposits, which will clarify their relation to both magmatic heat and
water, and the tectonic evolution of the Great Basin. Most of the study will be
carried out on the newly discovered Post SHMG deposit, which extends to depths
of over 2500 ft. and contains large volumes of ore that have not been
overprinted by weathering and oxidation. Zoning studies will include
mineralogical, fluid inclusion and stable isotopic measurements. Radiometric age
measurements will use an experimental evacuated quartz tube/total degassing
40Ar-39Ar method to analyse less 1 mg of alteration mineral separates and these
ages will be checked by conventional 40Ar-39Ar age determinations on igneous and
alteration minerals in pre- and post-ore dikes, which bracket mineralization at
Post. Our results could yield a depth-zoning classification for SHMG deposits,
which could be used both in exploration and in regional tectonic studies.
