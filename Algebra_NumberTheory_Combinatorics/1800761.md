Over the last several decades, extremal combinatorics has become an increasingly
influential branch of mathematics, with results touching number theory,
analysis, and geometry. This project falls under extremal graph theory, and has
roots in classical results of Dirac, Hajnal, and Szemeredi. In addition, this
work has a significant intersection with computer science, because many
interesting algorithmic questions will be explored. Whenever possible, this work
will be done with graduate students, and may play an important role in their
professional development.

This project's main focus is on optimizing local conditions that force a
specific global structure in graphs, directed graphs, and other related
combinatorial objects. The research will make extensive use of probabilistic
methods, including the probabilistic absorbing technique of Rodl, Rucinski, and
Szemeredi, and the regularity method, which was invented by Abel prize winner
Endre Szemeredi, and has dramatically impacted numerous branches of mathematics
in fundamental ways that continue to be explored, even now, more than forty
years after its initial development. These techniques have allowed researchers
to tackle formerly inaccessible conjectures and have facilitated the creation of
many surprisingly general results. One of the goals of this project is to
participate in the further development of these powerful methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
