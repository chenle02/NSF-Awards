Recent observations on the "arrest of secretion response" (ASR) in yeast have
documented a novel form of intracellular signaling: the protein which initiates
the signal, although it is normally at the cell surface, must be trapped within
intracellular compartments in order to signal. This project will explore
molecular mechanisms which operate along this signaling pathway. In the ASR,
inhibition of transport along the secretory path in sec mutants relocates
proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), inhibits nuclear import and also
relocates nucleoplasmic proteins to the cytoplasm. Protein kinase C (Pkc1p) and
two of the transmembrane proteins of the Wsc family are required for these
events. They nevertheless do not require the Pkc1p MAP kinase cascade. Moreover,
Wsc proteins trapped along the secretory path are required for signaling, as
opposed to those which are normally at the plasma membrane. Thus, this work will
determine * Whether Pkc1p associates with Wsc proteins and whether such
association depends on whether an active ASR is occurring, * Whether
diacylglycerol is generated when the secretory path is inhibited, i.e. during
the ASR, * Whether a genetic screen can identify signaling intermediates which
are required, especially those which function downstream of Pkc1p.
