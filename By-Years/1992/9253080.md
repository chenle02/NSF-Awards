The purpose of this project is to collect examples of secondary school leaving
exam questions regularly given to advanced science and mathematics students in
10 countries planning to enter higher education. The exams will be analyzed to
develop knowledge about the coverage of science and mathematics topics required
of advanced students in other countries. Science and mathematics topics will be
classified into a framework to better inform those who are setting standards for
science and mathematics students in the United States about policies of testing
students in other developed countries. The analysis of the exam questions would
be made within the basic framework of an ongoing international assessment of
student achievement in science and mathematics - the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This study has developed a classification
system of mathematics and science that would be used to examine the exam
questions of other countries.
