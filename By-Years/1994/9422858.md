Abstract ATM-9422858 Ruddiman, William F. University of Virginia Title: Holocene
and Last-Glacial Burial Fluxes of Charcoal The burial flux of charcoal over
large spatial scales remains basically unknown, both today and in the historical
and geological past. Recent advances in charcoal analysis have opened up new
research opportunities, two of which are targeted in this project: (1) a
qualification of charcoal bupial rates in the context of global carbon
inventories, with an emphasis on establishing baseline late Holocene fluxes
prior to the fossil-fuel era; (2) an exploration of eolian charcoal as a
paleoclimatic indicator during the last 20,000 years, with particular attention
to its use in distinguishing changes in source-area moisture balances from
changes in wind strength. This award supports the following tasks: (1) an effort
to quantify burial fluxes of eolian charcoal during the late Holocene and last-
glacial maximum in ocean sediments downwind from the major continents; (2)
initial explorations of potentially large charcoal burial rates in a variety of
deposits along continental margins; and (3) initial investigation of lacustrine
sediments to test the applicability of the new charcoal analysis method and to
evaluate sedimentological complications.
