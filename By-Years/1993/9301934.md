The University of Hawaii will continue development of the Hawaii Undersea
Geophysical Observatory (HUGO). HUGO is envisioned as a long-term, deep-ocean
system of sensors, monitors and inter- connecting electro-optic cables located
1,000 meters deep, atop Loihi Volcano, 35 km southeast of the Island of Hawaii.
Design criteria accommodate a suite of acoustic, seismic, and other sensors that
will be connected to the fiber-optic backbone system and data transmitted ashore
and recorded in real time. With a full suite of sensors, HUGO will be able to
continuously monitor seismi- city, tilt, chemical emissions, ocean currents,
hydrothermal activity, and other parameters over long time periods. The project
will provide useful engineering information that will benefit subsequent
seafloor observatories and NSF-sponsored research projects in the future.
Scientific data will also be obtained about the Loihi Volcano itself. AT&amp;T
is donating a 35-km electro- optic cable and will lay the cable for the
University. The University of Hawaii is also providing cost-sharing.
