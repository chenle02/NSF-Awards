This project focuses on the experimental study of the conditional evolution of
quantum dynamic states and the development of quantum feedback. The project will
focus on cavity QED systems that couple a single mode of an optical cavity with
a collection of atoms. The conditional measurements are based on correlation
functions of three types: intensity-intensity, intensity-field, and a new one to
correlate transmitted intensity and fluorescence out of the cavity mode. Two new
approaches to quantum feedback will enable the researchers to expand the
parameter space and allow detuning and direct control of the field. The feedback
is initiated by the detection of a single photon, the smallest size of a quantum
fluctuation. This work will illuminate quantum statistical mechanics and the
nascent area of quantum information as the work focuses on a strongly coupled
system where the fluctuations are larger than the mean. The broader impact
involves education of both graduate and undergraduate students as well as
student exchanges with other international research groups.
