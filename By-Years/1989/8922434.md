The Principal Investigator will build a water sampler to be used to sample
waters from oceanic bore holes drilled during the Deep Sea Drilling Project and
the Ocean Drilling Program. The sampler will consist of 5 sampling units that
can be triggered by means of an electronic timing mechanism, thus enabling
sampling at 5 different depths during one logging run.
