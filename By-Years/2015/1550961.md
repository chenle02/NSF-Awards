This engineering education research project seeks to explore how pre-college
engineering programs affect those students who enroll into undergraduate
engineering degree programs. The project will use both qualitative and
quantitative methods, with the results from the qualitative component used to
develop a survey instrument. This instrument then can be used to understand the
impact such programs have at a national scale.

The broader significance and importance of this project will help engineering
administrators, instructors and designers of undergraduate and pre-college
curricula adapt to students' changing needs and abilities. Examining the
demographics of the participants will demonstrate who has access to or is taking
advantage of pre-college engineering programs, and if the effects of pre-college
engineering vary across different demographic groups. This project overlaps with
NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that
lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results
and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and
practices.
