Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) will award 20 scholarships a year
to academically talented students pursuing degrees in STEM fields. This project
will help academically talented and financially needy students to pursue their
career goals in STEM areas and will serve to facilitate a fundamental shift in
the perception of STEM programs and careers, especially in underrepresented
groups. The project team will collaborate with local and regional industry on
curriculum, skills, and certifications needed for employment and advancement,
and will have a positive impact on Massachusetts' ability to meet the rising
demands for highly skilled technical workers, especially those who hold
bachelor's degrees in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive approach
to the recruiting and retention of STEM Scholars will be developed in a focused
effort on eight majors at STCC. The success rate, as measured by enrollment,
increased diversity of the student population, retention, graduation, and job
placement will provide insight into successful methods of increasing the number
and diversity of students in the STEM pipeline. The program will be designed
with proven student support strategies such as peer-mentoring, tutoring, cohort
classes, and STEM faculty advising. The project team will leverage several
existing programs including a state-funded STEM Starter Academy, cohort classes,
Women in STEM club, and the Innovations (STEM-related) speaker series. Results
from the project will be presented at the national Achieving the Dream
Conference, through the STCC website, podcasts from the University of
Massachusetts Amherst, and in journals devoted to STCC education and at
conferences such as the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA) and the
Triangle Coalition for STEM Education.
