Funds are requested to purchase a motion analysis system to be used by
researchers in the areas of heat transfer, fluid mechanics, tribology, and
manufacturing.This system which is capable of taking up to 6,000 frames/second
with a total duration of 30 seconds will be a major improvement over existing
recording devices currently at the Technological Institute of Northwestern
University. This research equipment will greatly enhance the scientific quality
of the research and would allow the researchers to observe phenomena in detail
which is impossible without this system.
