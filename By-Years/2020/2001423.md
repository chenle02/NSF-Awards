This award will fund travel by six students to the Clinic on Dynamical
Approaches to Infectious Disease Data being held in Stellenbosch, South Africa.
The Clinic is designed for participants without substantial experience in
scientific computing or in mathematical modeling. Training focuses on how the
complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data
collection for addressing applied problems in infectious disease research. The
workshop focuses on training in both mathematical epidemiology and biomedical
epidemiology. Each tradition contributes its own distinct set of research
methodologies. The training focuses on using models to ask research questions
that are fully grounded in the participants? previous experiences. Participants
will learn how to identify which research questions can and cannot benefit from
development of a dynamical modeling program. By providing training in both
mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology, the students will be well
poised for future research in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
