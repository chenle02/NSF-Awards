9729976 Lees This grant provides three years of partial support for a computer
technician to supervise and administer the growing computer facilities in the
Department of Geology and Geophysics (G&amp;G) at Yale University. The matching
funds for this grant, awarded by the Instrument and Facilities (IF) Program of
the NSF Division of Earth Sciences, will be at a level of 50% from Yale
University. The computer technician will be responsible for maintaining hardware
compatibility, monitoring user disk use, backing up hard disks, creating new
accounts and supervising charges where appropriate, purchasing and installing
miscellaneous expendable supplies (printer paper, ink, toner, cables), and
introducing students and staff to the basics of Unix and other operating
systems. An important task for the administrator will be the security of the
Yale G&amp;G computer systems. He/she will be responsible for monitoring outside
entry into our systems, updating passwords for users and for root access, and
removing unneeded internet-access ports to the systems. The administrator will
also assist in acquiring and, in some cases developing, new graphics and
computational software to be used for research and education. Technical support
will immediately benefit a large group of productive and NSF funded researchers
in the geosciences for computational studies in tectonics, theoretical mineral
physics and chemical kinetics, seismic tomography, mantle dynamics and lower
atmospheric dynamics. ***
