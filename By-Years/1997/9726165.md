9726165 TUMMALA This award is to provide funding for the Packaging Engineering
Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology to collaborate with seven
national and international universities which are centers of excellence in the
topic of electronic packaging. The seven institutions bring expertise in four
major areas: 1) mixed signal design and test, 2) limits of flipchip packaging,
3) radio frequency and optoelectronics, and 4) thermal management. The seven
institutions are the Technical University of Berlin, University of Oregon,
University of Illinois, Tufts University, University of Puerto Rico, University
of Minnesota, and Lehigh University. The addition of these partner institutions
bring expertise and equipment and facilities which are unique and complement
those of the existing center. The Technical University of Berlin opens a door to
Europe. The impact on the educational experience of students involved with the
ERC likewise enhances the ability of the center to make a lasting contribution
to electronic packaging worldwide. The collaboration with the University of
Puerto Rico will have a positive impact on the education of minority engineering
graduates.
