The retina of the eye is the complex network of photoreceptor cells and nerve
cells that form the first stage of visual processing. This research conference
on the biology and chemistry of vision stresses the issue of how the genetics of
photoreceptor cells affect their development and cell death. Established
scientists as well as young investigators discuss these issues from a novel
integrative perspective, combining new research on molecular biology and
genetics of the photoreceptors with findings on retinal degeneration and
disease, to better understand how genetics of the photoreceptors can affect
function of the whole retina. These fundamental topics of this conference
receive support from NSF, as a partial contributor along with NIH and ONR,
because the conference will have an impact beyond simply retinal disease, to a
better understanding of basic processes in visual neuroscience.
