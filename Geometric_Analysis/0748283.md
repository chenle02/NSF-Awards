In this project the PI proposes to study discrete geometry, curvature flows, and
collapsing solutions to smooth geometric flows. The original motivation for this
work is the landmark work on Ricci flow that began with R. Hamilton and includes
the solution of the Poincare conjecture by G. Perelman. The PI proposes to work
on both combinatorial curvature flows on piecewise linear manifolds and discrete
approximations of Ricci flow and other smooth flows. In particular, the PI plans
to study discrete flows numerically, to develop visualization techniques for
abstract manifolds, to further develop the theory of discrete geometries in the
spirit of differential geometry, and to prove convergence of these geometries
and related geometric operators to the continuum. The PI also plans to study
geometric flows on generalizations of Riemannian manifolds, such as Riemannian
groupoids, in order to better understand those flows at singularities. The
experimental part of this proposal will be run by a laboratory of undergraduates
supervised by graduate students. The recent solution of the Poincare conjecture
by G. Perelman both stunned and invigorated the mathematics community. The PI
proposes to study similar techniques involving geometric flows in two settings:
(1) Discrete Geometries, which may be applied both to other types of geometric
questions and to mathematical modelling in a variety of settings, including
physics and computer graphics, and (2) Generalized Geometries, which may clarify
the implications of Perelman's results and how it may be applied to both
mathematical and physical applications. The hope is not only to solve geometric
problems, but develop techniques applicable to other areas of science and
engineering, both theoretically and computationally. In the process, the PI
plans to rely on the laboratory science model to form a group of graduate and
undergraduate students developing research tools and presentation tools. The PI
hopes to use these tools to communicate the excitement of modern geometry to
researchers, teachers, students, and the general public.
