Larsen DMS-1009653

The investigator studies the evolution of defects in materials (e.g., fracture,
damage, dislocation plasticity) using a progression of models from global
minimization-based quasi-statics to full dynamics. Global minimization models
are now well understood, but very little is understood in the more physically
realistic settings of local minimization-based and dynamic problems.
Specifically, existence is open for both cohesive and sharp-interface (Griffith)
dynamic fracture, and effective macro-scale models for local minimization-based
dislocation plasticity are unknown. The investigator seeks to make significant
progress on these and related problems.

The propagation of defects in materials is of obvious fundamental importance,
yet in the most physically realistic settings mathematical foundations and
analysis are lacking, leaving engineering models largely ad hoc. The
investigator works on developing mathematical support in these areas, leading to
improved models, better understanding of solutions, and improved (and justified)
algorithms for computing simulations.
