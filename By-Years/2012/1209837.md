This action funds David M. Hondula of the University of Virginia to conduct a
research project, entitled "Forecasting Human Mortality during Extreme Heat
Events" during the summer of 2012 at Queensland University of Technology in
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The host scientist is Adrian Barnett.

This research promises a forecasting framework to examine heat-health impacts on
humans that is largely absent from the field to date. Previous results establish
that human response to extreme heat varies over space and time, yet it remains
unknown whether the severity, location, and timing of heat-related deaths can be
reliably predicted and mitigated. Investigating the nature of local-scale heat-
related mortality presents a significant opportunity to enhance knowledge of the
geographic and temporal dimensions of adverse conditions on humans.

Broader impacts include of the potential to improve public health policy and
increase capacity to minimize health risks associated with extreme heat through
sharing research outcomes with a broad audience of stakeholders who can
implement improved mitigation, intervention, education, and communication. Other
broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
