Detachment faults are now known to occur along a large portion of the earth's
mid-ocean ridge system. This workshop, which is being run as an American
Geophysical Union Chapman Conference in Cyprus in May of 2010, will bring
together an international, interdisciplinary group of scientists to discuss
these important, yet little understood, features. It will focus on identifing
important gaps in our knowledge of detachment faults and their origin. Field
excursions at the Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus will allow participants to examine
in detail, in an easily accessible location, key features of these structures.
Empahsis will be on their tectonic significance, mechanisms of formation, and
association with fluid seeps that host unusual deep sea organisms. Broader
impacts of the work are strong in terms of training early career faculty,
graduate students, and postdoctoral resaerchers in the recognition,
characteristics, and impacts of these structures. Broad dissemination of
workshop results will be facilitated by the production of a volume of papers
that summarize the present state of knowledge and that identify important gaps
in knowledge of these important and prolific tectonic settings.
