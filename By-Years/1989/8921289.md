The objectives of this research are the electrochemical effects exerted on
atmospheric ice particles by aerosols and gases. Of primary interest are
compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur common in the troposphere. Their
effects can influence electrical atmospheric processes (thunderstorms). They
also leave their imprint on the paleoclimatic record conserved in glaciers and
polar ice caps. Laboratory measurements of solute partition between ice and
water will yield data on mechanisms by which environmental species are removed
from the atmosphere. Electrical measurements on laboratory-grown ice specimens
will relate impurity effects to diagnostic parameters that may be used in
quantifying electrical conduction and in analyzing ice-core logging curves. Of
special concern is the nature of surface conduction in ice and how it is
affected by specific impurities. The photochemical creation of surface carriers
will be probed by illumination of the sample with near-uv or visible light while
electrical measurements are in progress.//
