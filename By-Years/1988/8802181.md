This project is concerned with various problems in ring theory. The principal
investigator will investigate the Jacobian Conjecture using differential
operators, a general theory of lattices and cocompact lattices in the
automorphism groups of simplicial trees, and an elaboration of Asamura's theorem
in algebras with polynomial fibres. In conjunction with a postdoctoral
associate, the principal investigator will work on a structure theory for groups
acting freely on R-trees.
