In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Joseph M. Fox of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Delaware will design synthetic catalysts that
derive stereoselectivity from their larger secondary structure. In particular,
he will study conformationally flexible chiral bimetallic rhodium complexes that
adopt distinct secondary structures, referred to as the 'chiral crown'
conformation. He will develop a diverse family of catalysts in which the crown
conformation is enforced, and illustrate how these catalysts can be used to
promote novel reactivity. His group will design new types of mixed ligand chiral
crown complexes, and use these complexes to catalyze asymmetric CH
functionalization reactions of indoles and pyrroles. He will also use these
complexes to catalyze reactions of alkynes with diazoesters to give chiral
butenolides via sequential ring expansion/sigmatropic rearrangement cascades.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have broad impact through the
creation of new catalysts and patterns of reactivity that will have impact
across academia and pharmaceutical research. This program will also be
integrated with Undergraduate and Graduate education/training initiatives. This
award will continue to support research opportunities for a diverse group of
scientists, and will create research opportunities for undergraduate students
for the span of the award. This award will also provide funding for high school
students to participate in research experiences in his laboratory.
