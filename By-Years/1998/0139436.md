The proposal is to continue a well-established and successful Summer program
that provides undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement of
working in a premier science laboratory. The goal of the program is to recruit
students from the physical sciences with the hope they will be stimulated to the
point of pursuing a research career in the Earth Sciences. Recruitment of
underrepresented minorities and women is emphasized. Students in this program
will work with faculty members of the Mineral Physics Institute (MPI) on
projects that probe the physical and chemical properties of materials with a
particular emphasis on the use of high pressure. Working closely with members of
the MPI, students will pursue their own projects and discuss their progress
during weekly seminar sessions. During the program, students will have the
opportunity to visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated with the
MPI.
