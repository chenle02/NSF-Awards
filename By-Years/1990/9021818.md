This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Grinnell College for the repair and
renovation of the wing of Bowen Hall of Science which houses the research and
research training activities of the Chemistry Department. This wing was
constructed in 1952 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant
of $250,000 and $305,238 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by (a)
redesigning the research laboratories to make more efficient use of space,
substantially increasing both hood and bench space; (b) providing the stockroom
with adequate ventilation and flammable solvent storage; and (c) redesigning the
instrument room to more optimally house modern electronic instrumentation. This
award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of quality
undergraduate students in a department in which the faculty and their students
publish their work regularly in top journals and which has produced a large
number of chemists over the years.
