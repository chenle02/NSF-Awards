The research is focussed on the fundamental aspects of membrane fabrication
process. Two powerful electron microscopy techniques will be employed to examine
the micromorphology of solvent-cast membranes and the results are to be compared
with theoretical predicitons. The results of the research should provide a basic
understanding for future development of membrane fabrication techniques.
