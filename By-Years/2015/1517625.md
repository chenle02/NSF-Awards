Telomerase is an enzyme complex that copies the DNA at the very ends of
chromosomes and also protects the DNA from degradation. Without telomerase,
chromosomes would get shorter every time they were copied (i.e. at every cell
division). This project will investigate the structure, function, and dynamics
of proteins in telomerase that are essential for its correct function. The
project will advance understanding of cell aging and provide interdisciplinary
training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in structural biology
and biophysics. Encouragement to women and minorities to pursue careers in
science will be pursued through outreach to high schools, by mentoring
undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in research, and through the
UCLA CityLab program.

Telomerase is an RNA-protein complex (RNP) that functions as a specialized
reverse transcriptase to extend the 3' ends of linear chromosomes and is a
critical determinant of cellular aging and stem cell renewal. This research
project will investigate the structure and function of telomerase accessory
proteins in Tetrahymena using an integrative structural biology approach that
combines NMR, X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and biochemical
methods. The proposed structural studies will integrate existing information on
telomerase and telomere binding proteins and provide new insights into assembly
and interactions of the telomerase holoenzyme. The unified approach to
structural biology used in this project will be applicable to the study of other
protein complexes and RNPs.
