The objective of this MRI-R2 project is to add device fabrication capabilities
to the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology campus for organic electronics
and energy-related nanoscience research and education. The approach is the
acquisition of a thin-film deposition glovebox system, which will be the
principal instrument for material synthesis and device fabrication in organic
electronic and photovoltaic research.

Intellectual Merit: The requested thin-film deposition system and accessories
will provide infrastructure for researchers to conduct cutting-edge research
projects in the area of organic electronics and energy-related nanoscience. The
system will enable researchers to fabricate devices such as organic transistors,
hybrid or dye-sensitized solar cells, plasmonic material based nanophotonics,
and sensors. With the fabrication capabilities of the system, collaborative
efforts from students and faculty across different disciplines will reveal new
scientific insights in the field of electronic and photovoltaic materials and
devices, and lead to development of innovative device structures and
technologies for future organic electronics and solar cells.
