In this project, investigators will carry out measurements and analysis of
nutrient data on a hydrographic line along 10 deg North latitude across the
Pacific. This effort will help to complete a modern comprehensive survey of the
North Pacific with high precision hydrographic and geochemical data, provide
additional constraints on the computations of meridional transport across the
equator, and assist in estimating the large-scale average primary production in
the tropical Pacific.
