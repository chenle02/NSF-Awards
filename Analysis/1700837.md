The field of dynamical systems originated from differential equations and
celestial mechanics. It studies the long run behavior of a system subject to
laws of motion. So far, systems with strong chaotic properties have been well
understood. These results provide applications to other areas of mathematics as
well as to many areas of sciences such as physics, mechanics, computer science,
and biology. In many systems of interest however, only weak chaotic behaviors
can be observed. The goal of this project is to develop new tools to study such
systems; and then apply these results to study other areas of mathematics, such
as number theory and representation theory.

There is a growing interest in recent years for irreducible higher rank
algebraic actions. Many examples of these actions exhibit a remarkable array of
rigidity properties. These examples possess strong chaotic properties. This
project aims at providing rigidity examples with less chaotic behaviors. This
project will study smooth rigidity of a broad class of algebraic actions,
especially for the actions completely absent of hyperbolicity, like parabolic
actions. Current tools fail to be applied to treat these actions. The main
research theme in this project is to develop a method that combines classical
KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) approach with representation theory to study the
rigidity behavior of a broad class of algebraic actions. The new method will
afford the first local rigidity examples for parabolic actions; and has the
potential to establish local rigidity for partially hyperbolic actions whose
geometric properties are distinctly different from existing examples.
