From June 3-7, 2013, the international conference ``Ergodic Theory with
Connections to Arithmetic" will be held at the University of Crete in Heraklion,
Greece. In the last ten years, ergodic theory has developed and spread into new
directions. New applications of ergodic theory have developed, techniques have
been imported to the subject, and multiple connections have been developed with
other areas of mathematics. Particularly strong connections with combinatorics
and number theory have been developed, leading to an explosion of activity. In
addition to focusing on recent developments and new open problems, the meeting
will bring together mathematicians that use ergodic theory to solve problems in
combinatorics and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support
participation in the conference for mathematicians based in the United States.
It is expected that most world experts in ergodic theory with a combinatorial or
number theoretic flavor will be present at this conference, as well as numerous
more junior Israeli and European participants. As such, it represents a unique
opportunity to make new connections and progress in ergodic theory. It will be
of substantial benefit to the US participants in terms of stimulating
international collaboration and enhancing the advancement of US mathematics.
Graduate students, junior faculty, and underrepresented groups in mathematics
who do not have access to other travel funds will be given priority for funding.
