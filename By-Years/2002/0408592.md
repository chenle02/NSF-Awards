The Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM) model is extended to
include ionospheric measurements from the incoherent scatter radar chain and to
include neutral wind measurements from a variety of regularly operating Fabry-
Perot Interferometer sites. Following data assimilation using Kalman filtering
techniques pioneered by tropospheric modelers, the GAIM model is supplied to the
NSF Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM) as an
ionosphere/plasmasphere component of their predictive, physics based sun-to-
earth Space Weather model. A particular application of this model will describe
the propagation of geomagnetic storm effects from high latitudes to low
latitudes.
