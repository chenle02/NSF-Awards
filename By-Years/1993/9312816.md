This award provides partial support for the Gull Lake Nuclear Physics Conference
on Giant Resonances to be held August 17 - 21, 1993 at the Kellogg Biological
Research Center in Gull Lake, Michigan. The conference will convene all active
researchers, theorists and experimentalists, in order to present and discuss the
latest results and to stimulate and suggest future research. The requested funds
will support participants, who would make important and valuable contributions
to the conference, but who would not be able to participate without any
financial assistance.
