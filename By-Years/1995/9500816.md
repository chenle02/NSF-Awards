9500816 Wilcock This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will
develop and test a dissolved-oxygen seawater battery to power seafloor
instruments. Preliminary tests show that the corrosion of aluminum or magnesium
in seawater may provide a basis for a compact and economical power source for
long-term low-power experiments. A prototype seawater battery will be initially
tested in Puget Sound and subsequently on a 4-month deep-water test on the
Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Summer of 1995. If the tests
prove successful, similar batteries might have wide use both within the RIDGE
Program and in other fields of oceanography. A low-cost, high-energy battery
which could operate for long periods would play an important role in the
development of seafloor observatories and other long-term experiments. This work
will seek to demonstrate that dissolved oxygen seawater batteries have the
potential to satisfy this need.
