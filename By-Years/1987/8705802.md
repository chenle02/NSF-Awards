The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. The Medical Sciences Campus of
the University of Puerto Rico will use RIMI support for the acquisition of
research instrumentation in neurobiology. The instrumentation will broaden and
strengthen the institution's Institute of Neurobiology as a center for
meritorious research in the Caribbean region. The research capability of the
Institute will be especially enhanced in electrophysical and anatomical
procedures. The facility will serve the needs of local, regional, and visiting
scientists from around the world. The principal investigators has a commendable
record of publications in neurophysiology. The Foundation has supported this
project because the research and training needs of minority faculty and students
will be increased at the Institute of Neurobiology.
