Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powders and grains are used by the
thousands of tons in the processing of polymers, catalysts, pharmaceuticals and
building materials. Unfortunately, these materials exhibit unpredictable
transitions between flow and jamming. On the large scale, these transitions
manifest themselves in catastrophic slip events, causing the deaths of between
25 and 50 people annually in landslides in the US alone. On the small scale,
slip events are intimately associated with material irregularities, which are
far and away the dominant cause of rejections of manufactured ceramics. Recent
work has demonstrated for the first time that electrical signals can be measured
consistently and reproducibly as much as several seconds before any outward sign
of a slip event in a powder bed. In this project, the research team will
investigate the cause of these electrical precursors, establish what material
properties the precursors depend on, and establish the groundwork to determine
whether and when advance predictions of slip events can be made. This will
certainly lead to improved understanding of an entirely new phenomenon in
material science, and may conceivably have implications for earthquake and
landslide prediction as well as for improved quality control for tightly
regulated materials such as ceramics and
pharmaceuticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanism underlying electrical voltage
production in powder beds is not understood. The goal of this research is
therefore to analyze this mechanism in carefully targeted experiments. In
particular, questions that these experiments seek to answer are (1) what,
mechanistically, occurs at the granular level to cause a transfer of charge
leading to voltage production; (2) how do the electrical signals vary in space
and in time; and (3) what material properties do the voltage signals depend on?
The work that will be performed will be first to construct an experiment in
which local charge and stress distributions can be mapped in space and in time,
and second, to quantitatively evaluate how the voltage signals depend on
material properties such as hardness, size and cohesivity. Measurements will be
performed using electrostatic voltmeters arranged in a spatial array,
complemented by visualization techniques. These measurement methods rely on
existing and proven technologies, performed in unique ways designed to focus on
the mechanism of interest.&lt;br/&gt;
