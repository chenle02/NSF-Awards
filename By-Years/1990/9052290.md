Mankato State University is using a CCD camera system and associated computer
equipment to support photometric and astrometric applications. The camera is
being used with a new high-quality 20-inch astronomical telescope in a new
observatory building. This instrumentation is being used to teach students teh
applications of equipment and techiques used in astronomical research. Class
projects include subjects as fundamental and diverse as trigonometric parallax,
cluster color-magnitude diagrams, cluster luminosity functions, asteroid orbits
and galactic star counts. The University is matching the award with an equal
amount of funds.
