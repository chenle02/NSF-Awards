9320488 McCarthy This is a study of the reliability of mass media reports of
collective action events in Washington D.C., and the development of an expanded
data base to allow comprehensive social-scientific analysis of the biases in
media reporting. The project has five related aims: to add city permits and
media records of demonstrations from 1973 to the existing data set; to code the
content of all media traces for analyses of description bias; to expand the
analysis of media bias by developing multiple methods for comparing media
reports with systematic observations; to assess implications of the findings for
improving attempts to limit researcher bias; and to explore the possibilities of
studying the national and international diffusion of the National Park Service
permit system. %%% This research contributes to political sociology and to the
development of scientific methodology for studying public demonstrations and
their handling by the mass media. It therefore will greatly strengthen social-
scientific research on important aspects of democracy that lie outside the
system of parties and elections. Results will be of direct value for political
leaders who need to understand the meaning of public demonstrations and for
journalists who need to upgrade the accuracy of their reporting. ***
