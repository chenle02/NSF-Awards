This research is founded upon the Phase I work which proved that small
quantities of low cost proprietary catalysts were effective in achieving large
NOx reduction. The major objectives of the Phase I research plan were met or
exceeded, including proof of the catalytic activity of the materials to achieve
40% reductions of NOx in a laboratory reactor. A statistical experimental design
was used to develop empirical rate coefficients. This proposal extends the Phase
I work, proposing larger scale testing under commercially relevant catalyst
loadings and operating conditions. Particle size, catalyst aging, and the
effects of H2O, hydrocarbons, SOx, and other potential poisons will be
investigated. Phase II extends the operating scope to low temperatures (320 F to
550 F), as the Phase I work implied that the catalysts are active at
temperatures below 550 F (560 K). The catalysts are low cost, using materials
endemic to the U.S., and represent U.S. technology. The successful concept has
the potential to reduce NOx compliance and energy costs, resulting in economic
benefits to the U.S. power industry.
