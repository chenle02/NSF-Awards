The PI's recently discovered spontaneous, monodisperse, equilibrium vesicles in
many mixtures of anionic and cationic surfactants. In this program, they will
characterize experimentally and model theoretically the process of vesicle
formation in these systems. This work will uncover a rich new area of surfactant
phase behavior and suggest new formations for stable vesicles useful in
addressing theoretical and practical problems. They will use a combination of
experimental techniques including light, x-ray and neutron scattering,
fluorescent probes, rheological measurements, and electron microscopy.
Simultaneously they will approach the problem from two distinct and
complementary theoretical directions. This work is significant because the
properties of vesicles in these mixtures and the nature of the micelle- vesicle
and vesicle-liquid crystal transitions is of keen scientific interest and
considerable practical importance. This project has a broad scope and in order
to achieve these goals expeditiously they will collaborate with several
industrial and academic researchers.
