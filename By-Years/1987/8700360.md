This investigation will determine the distribution in ice cores of the
atmospheric oxidation products of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and will investigate
their use as chemical tracers for the biogenic component of atmospheric sulfate.
The distribution of these tracers and their relationship to non-sea salt sulfate
in ice cores will provide new information regarding the speciation of sulfur in
paleo-atmospheres and insight into the magnitude and variability of the biogenic
component of sulfur in the polar regions. This investigation will use ice cores
previously collected from both Greenland and Antarctica.
