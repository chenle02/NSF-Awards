9626780 Adams Hyperbolic 3-manifold theory has had a tremendous impact on the
field of low dimensional topology. Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one
after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques. There has been a
shift in the entire approach to low dimensional topology, as researchers now use
rigid geometric arguments to prove topological theorems. The investigators
intend to continue their research, both individually and jointly, on the theory
and computation of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Through a set of projects, many
relying heavily on their ability to compute examples on the computer, the
researchers plan to further the understanding of the connections between
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold
theory, and the traditional topological invariants in 3-manifold theory. A
sphere, a torus and a 2-holed torus are examples of topologically distinct
2-dimensional surfaces. For about 100 years mathematicians have known that the
only possible (finite) surfaces are the n-holed tori and a corresponding family
of nonorientable surfaces (e.g., the nonorientable surface corresponding to a
1-holed torus is a Klein bottle). In contrast, the topological possibilities for
a 3-dimensional space are vastly richer. The beautiful relationships among the
possible 3-dimensional spaces have been greatly clarified since 1978, when
William Thurston discovered that the best way to understand the topology of the
spaces was to give them shapes of constant curvature. The present project
continues to explore the relationships between the curvature and the topology.
Because the shapes can be computed by hand only in a very few cases, the project
also continues to develop and support computer software for creating the spaces
and studying their properties. This NSF funded software is freely available, and
it is used not only by mathematicians, but also by cosmologists seeking to model
the shape of the real universe, and by physicists modelling the behavior of
various dynamical systems. ***
