The project is a study of a class of stochastic processes used to model large
systems with many interacting "agents" (cells, individuals, components,
particles, plants). Typically the agents are located at the nodes of a network,
either a homogeneous, heterogeneous or random graph, and transmission of
``information'' (infection, rumor, traits, etc.) between agents is random but
obeys some simple local rule. Interest in processes of this type has been
spurred in recent years by the introduction of ``small world'' random graphs
used as models of the world wide web and the internet, and attempts to analyze
large social networks. There is now a rapidly growing research literature on
these new models, primarily outside of mathematics. An example of the type of
question considered in this literature is: given a particular network and
interaction mechanism, will a rumor or trait spread rapidly throughout the
network or will it quickly die out? A second, related question is: will a given
system relax into a quasi-equilibrium which maintains diversity for a very long
time. There are rigorous results available for such questions for some
``classic'' homogeneous lattice systems, but analyzing the newer more
heterogeneous models raises significant mathematical challenges. The research in
this project will identify key features of these models, i.e. features of the
network and of the interaction mechanism, which will determine their long-term
behavior, and develop rigorous mathematical methods to validate corresponding
predictions. The project will provide a rigorous foundation from which further
research can be based.

More generally, the project is concerned with how large stochastic systems based
on local rules develop over time. Systems studied will vary from a spatial model
for the evolution of genealogical traits in an infinite population located in
homogeneous (geographic) space, both continuous and discrete, to a variety of
stochastic models on heterogeneous random graphs. The proposed research will
develop rigorous mathematical methodologies for determining whether or not
predictions made based on heuristic or meanfield arguments are valid. The
research will make use of a range of mathematical techniques from branching
processes, interacting particle systems, percolation theory, finite Markov
chains, random walks, and random graphs. In particular the project will make use
of, and further extend, results on the behavior of rapidly mixing finite Markov
chains.
