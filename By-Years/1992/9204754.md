The principal investigator will experimentally study the chemical and physical
controls on melting within the Earth's continental crust. In addition to
answering a number of specific scientific questions, the results will be used to
constrain the stoichiometries of important melting reactions, and to determine
the physical conditions required of various metamorphic lithologies to generate
large mobile quantities of granitoid melts.
