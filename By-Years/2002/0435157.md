Proposal Number: 0435157&lt;br/&gt;PI: Injong Rhee &lt;br/&gt;Institution: North
Carolina State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Exploring the Design Space of Sensor
Networks Using Route-aware MAC Protocols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for wireless sensor networks are extremely
diverse, covering almost every walk of human life. Most existing work considers
wireless sensor network design to be an optimization problem - minimizing energy
consumption while maximizing some performance parameters. These studies
typically offer only a few design choices (sometimes only one) that provide
"better" optimization techniques for design of a few isolated network settings.
Because of diverse application requirements, designers will benefit immensely
from (sensor) network protocols that can provide a wide spectrum of design
choices, especially for very low energy budget applications. In this proposal,
the PIs describe an approach, Route-aware Media Access Control (RASMAC), that
can greatly diversify design choices by extending existing MAC layer protocols
to include an expressed tradeoff between energy and performance qualities.
RASMAC uses knowledge of routing paths to opportunistically turn off the radio
when a node is not on an active routing path. The research plans of the PIs
center on developing and evaluating new MAC and routing protocols that improve
the design choices offered by RASMAC and the performance modeling of these
protocols. A comprehensive evaluation plan of the developed protocols and their
performance models is planned that involve design and implementation of a
wildlife tracking system. This offers a valuable opportunity for collaboration
between computer scientists and biologists, which may produce critical advances
in the ability to protect endangered species in the future.&lt;br/&gt;
