This program has a three-pronged approach to the study of fundamental aspects of
quantum mechanics through experiments that rely on the manipulation of atoms. A
Sagnac atom interferometer is used as an atomic gyroscope to measure the Earth's
rotation rate; quantum mechanically induced temporal and spatial correlations
between pairs of identical atoms are studied in atomic fountains; and attempts
to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation through sympathetic cooling are underway.
