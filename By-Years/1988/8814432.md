They will prepare and characterize new solid-state inorganic compounds that as
laser crystals will provide greater efficiency, enhanced tuning capabilities,
and higher powers as compared with materials currently available. Crystals of
new borates and fluorides prepared specifically for substitutional doping with
the ions Ti(III), Cr(III), Cu(I), and/or Nd(III) provide unique materials for
spectroscopic characterization of luminescent phenomena and the determination of
laser gain. Through judicious selection of associated cations, compounds of high
crystallographic order with congruent melting points below 1670 K can be
realized. Compounds with such features could be easily grown as large laser
crystals with superb optical quality. Determination of coefficients of thermal
expansion for these materials by X-ray diffraction will provide information on
their thermal response when subject to high laser powers and elevated operating
temperatures. Refinement of atomic parameters from data collected at elevated
temperatures will provide details on the microscopic rearrangements occurring
with thermal stress. Through chemical synthesis, crystal growth, and detailed
characterization of new materials, it is likely that they will realize a new
generation of solid-state laser materials.
