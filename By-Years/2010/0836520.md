This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: The Nanotechnology Certificate Program at Georgia Tech, under the
direction of Dr. Sankar Nair, will establish the undergraduate Nanotechnology
Certificate Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT). The overall
goal of the proposed project is to innovatively impact nanotechnology education
at the undergraduate level. The Certificate curriculum will bridge the "pillars"
of nanotechnology-nanodevices/systems, nanoscale characterization, and
nanomaterials-in the context of both the "top down" and bottom up"
nanofabrication approaches, via a well-integrated program of hands-on laboratory
and classroom instructions. Concurrently, it will provide substantial expposure
to issues in nanotechnology practice and its potential societal impacts, through
an invited speaker program. Graduates of the program will thus be in an
advantageous position to formulate and implement nanotechnology-based solutions
as part of the science and technology workforce in industry, government, and
academia.
