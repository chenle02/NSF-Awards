The classical theory of error-correcting codes by Shannon and Hamming has
developed into a flourishing subject, and has been hugely influential in the
design of communication and storage systems. However, the more modern aspects of
error-correcting codes, including those relevant to complexity theory and
pseudorandomness, have lagged behind, and many challenges and problems are not
well understood. This project aims to remedy this situation by systematically
exploring what can be achieved in the realm of local-decoding, local-testing,
list-decoding and local list-decoding, and by exploring the implications of this
in complexity theory and pseudorandomness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
proposes to investigate new constructions of error-correcting codes supporting
sublinear-time error-detection, sublinear-time error-correction and efficient
list-decoding, as well as their applications in the areas of computational
complexity theory and pseudorandomness. The project builds upon several recent
advances made by the PI, such as the construction of new high rate error-
correcting codes allowing, for the first time, sublinear-time error-
correction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this project will
involve the mentoring and education of junior researchers who intend to pursue a
career in research, as well as the development and dissemination of new course
materials and broadly accessible presentations of the results of this
research.&lt;br/&gt;
