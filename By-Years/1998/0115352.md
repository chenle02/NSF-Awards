This project proposes a test of the application of well-established principles
of the Toyota Production System (TPS), or lean manufacturing, to health care
delivery. Transferability has been limited by the system's roots in
manufacturing, its reliance on manufacturing-based tools and metrics, and the
difficulty of defining comparable approaches and metrics for service settings.
Drawing on recent work suggesting actionable principles for the application of
the TPS, the project proposes to address the following questions: (1) Can the
principles of the TPS improve health care delivery? (2) If so, what
implementation strategies are more likely to lead to success? Based on answers
to these questions, the project will develop a user-friendly set of tools and
training materials to help health care institutions nationwide improve through
application of the principles of lean manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed
work will be carried out as a collaborative project between Community Medical
Center of Missoula, MT, and Montana State University. Using participant-
observation, journaling, products of redesign efforts, and interviews, the
researchers propose to explore cultural and psychological barriers to TPS in
healthcare, and assess the organizational strategies and the effectiveness of
tools and exercises used, as well as the progress of shifts in individuals and
groups required for TPS implementation. This project holds great promise for
significant and lasting theoretical and practical outcomes, both through
expanding knowledge of production methods in an important service industry and
deepening understanding of efficient design and management emphasizing quality
improvement. Potential practical benefits in improving the quality and
efficiency of health care delivery are very large.&lt;br/&gt;
