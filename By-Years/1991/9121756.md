The purpose of the proposal is to significantly enhance the quantity and quality
of our current data base of digital images of solar active regions and activity
by providing funds to purchase the recording equipment needed to save
approximately 5,500 images per day from the five full-time SOON observations
located around the world. We plan to install dual Exabyte 2.3 Gbyte tape drives
at the five sites and to archive approximately 1,100 selected images per day per
site. The purpose for this archival process is to make these invaluable data
available to the entire scientific community for detailed studies of flares and
active region evolution. The effort is intended to augment the infrastructure of
the solar physics community by providing an unprecedented continuous coverage of
the majority of solar active regions with high spatial resolution and moderate
temporal resolution. We believe that the creation of the proposed archival data
base of SOON images will form a major cornerstone of observations relating to
flare triggering, flare build-up and energetics as well as active region
evolution. This nearly continuous solar data set needs to be saved and placed
(in a convenient way) in the hands of the solar physics community and compared
with other data to provide new understandings of solar flares.
