The 1990 Aspen Winter Astrophysics Conference devotes one week to the Physics of
the Cosmic Microwave-Submillimeter Background. The Aspen Winter Conference
Series began in January, 1985 in recognition of the fact that there was no
winter conference series in the United States emphasizing a balances combination
of theoretical and experimental results. The series is modeled after the highly
successful French series known as the Recontre de Moriond, which has operated
for more than twenty years. Each Aspen Conference provides, for approximately 65
participants, six days of close interaction where detailed problems can be
discussed. This is the sixth year of Aspen Winter Conferences, which have proven
exciting and highly successful.
