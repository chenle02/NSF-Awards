9618684 Johnson Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale
convective systems (MCSs), have been identified as producers of most of the
rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the Spring, Summer and Fall.
Under prior NSF support, the Principal Investigator has exploited data sets from
previously held field experiments to further understanding of MCSs and their
interactions with the atmospheric boundary layer. He will continue these
investigations using both numerical models and observational case studies. The
Principal Investigator will focus on processes which initiate, maintain and
modulate mesoscale convection as well as the coupling between convection and the
atmospheric boundary layer. Specific objectives include: Determine the
climatology and initiation mechanisms for squall lines over the U.S.; 1. Extend
previous research on the evolution of MCSs and their surface pressure features
to other seasons; Continue studies of the characteristics of mesovortices. If
successful, this research will lead to better understanding of MCSs which may
lead to better predictions of timing, location and amount of rainfall as well as
severe weather. ***
