9625553 Spence This award provides support for the acquisition of an image plate
system for quantitative electron microscope imaging and diffraction. This
instrument is a new area detector system for electrons which currently does not
exist in the USA, and which provides important advantages for advanced electron
microscopy and diffraction. %%% This new systems will improve microanalysis of
many materials, including ferroelectrics, magnetics, semiconductors and
multilayers, materials important for use by the public, as well as industry. It
is the only system of its type in existence in the US.
