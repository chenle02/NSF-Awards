This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will address
several timely questions about the analysis and interpretation of observations
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, with particular emphasis on
upcoming observations of CMB polarization and design of CMB polarization
telescopes. Techniques will be developed for optimizing the design of future
instruments, with particular emphasis on interferometers, which have been less
well-studied than single-dish telescopes. Numerical methods for extracting the
weak but important B (magnetic field) component from a polarization map will be
developed. Finally, a detailed study will be performed of possible explanations
for several anomalies in the large-scale maps of CMB temperature anisotropy.
Broader impacts of this program include undergraduate student training in
research and participation in the Richmond Physics Olympics.
