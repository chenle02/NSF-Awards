This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
processes for high-resolution patterning of advanced functional materials by a
patented technique called molecular transfer lithography. The approach is to use
water-dissolvable templates of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which are replicated
from master surface topography, coated with functional materials that are
transferred to a substrate as an active component of the resulting nanopatterned
device. A range of functional materials are considered including dielectrics,
metal oxides, conductive inks, phosphors, ceramics, optical polymers,
nanoparticle-loaded composite materials, sol-gels, specialized resists,
monolayer and semi-permeable polymer films, and luminescent materials. In
combination with a platform equipment technology, these processes for functional
material patterning comprise a comprehensive nanolithography solution that
should enable nanomanufacturing of a broad range of novel devices.

The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to enable
the nanopatterning of various functional materials that previously were
difficult, not possible, or too costly to produce as high-resolution features
for integration in advanced devices. Lithography technology, approximately a $10
billion market opportunity, creates dense circuitry and related nanostructures
for high performance devices including semiconductors, displays, data storage,
solid state lighting, solar cells, and biological sensors. In this project, the
lithography procedure, which uses water-dissolvable templates and dry functional
materials, enables an environmentally-friendly approach to high-resolution
patterning, a foundational step in advanced manufacturing.
