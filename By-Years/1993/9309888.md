9309888 Yang A broad program of research in theoretical physics will include
work on fundamental issues in the foundations of quantum physics, on superstring
theory, investigations in quantum chromodynamics, including some involving
extensive use of computers, and studies of phenomena of enormous practical
application, such as materials exhibiting superconductivity at high
temperatures. Quantum physics is important for all descriptions of phenomena
which take place at short distances, while superstring theory offers the
exciting possibility of a unified description of all basic interactions. ***
