This research is aimed at understanding more fully the effects of strain fields
on the mechanisms of strengthening in two-phase materials. The program is
exploring coherency strain fields that develop in two-phase metal alloys during
aging. X- ray diffuse scattering is employed to determine the magnitude of the
strain fields. Transmission electron microscopy permits a correlation of
microstructure with the strain fields and hardness measurements. Tweed contrast
is examined using an extended theory for coherency fields.
