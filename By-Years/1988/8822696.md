Dr. John Beaman proposes to complete the preparation of a published inventory
(constructed from a microcomputer database) of the plant species on Mt. Kinabalu
in Borneo, Malaysia. Mt. Kinabalu may support the world's highest diversity of
plants per unit area, and there are many controversies surrounding the means by
which this extraordinary diversity arose and has persisted. Dr. Beaman has
completed the identification of more than 16,000 specimens and has developed a
microcomputer database for data on the specimens, their taxonomic identities,
and their geographic locations. The locality data provides the means by which
plant distributions can be analyzed relative to soil type, geology, and other
environmental factors. Dr. James Beach will devote 18 months to developing
research capabilities for the inventory using a Geographic Information System
(GIS) at Michigan State University. The proposed research has implications for
our understanding of the southeast Asian flora, for conservation efforts in the
region, and for general questions regarding plant ecology, diversity, and
evolution. Parallel development of the specimen database and GIS applications
will break new methodological ground for the botanical community as a whole.
