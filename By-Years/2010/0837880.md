AST-0507772&lt;br/&gt;Arav&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasar outflows impact the
evolution of super-massive black holes, their host galaxies, the surrounding
inter-galactic medium, and cluster cooling flows. This project will analyze
high-resolution spectroscopic data to measure the kinetic luminosity and
chemical abundances of observed quasar winds, which are the most crucial input
to these theoretical ideas. This involves three phases: 1) identifying and
observing targets that contain diagnostics for the total outflowing column
density and for the distance of the outflow from the central source, quantities
which are currently highly uncertain; 2) measuring reliable column densities,
often severely underestimated, using a new approach of global fitting to the
observed outflow troughs; 3) using these column densities in velocity-dependent
photoionization model grids, giving much improved densities, flow distances,
abundances, and thus kinetic
luminosities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary undergraduate research
opportunities exist in the project's need for data mining of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey quasar database. Animation movies of winds from active galactic
nuclei, created from the research, will be used in planetarium shows for the
general public, along with other audio-visual tools.
