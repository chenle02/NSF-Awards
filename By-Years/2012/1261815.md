The purpose of this effort is to support the delivery of the I-Corps curriculum
for the Q1FY13 cohorts; approximately 45 teams in total. The cornerstone of the
NSF I-Corps program is an intense immersion in a curriculum founded on customer
development and business model discovery platforms. Together these represent a
customer-centric process based on a hypothesis-driven approach to identify and
establish the viability of commercial opportunity. The I-Corps program seeks to
empower the I-Corps teams consisting of PIs, Mentors and Entrepreneurial Leads
with this knowledge through a 3-day workshop to be followed by 5 weeks of online
curriculum. At the end of the course, the teams will reconvene at a single
location for a lessons learned workshop. Through application of this grant,
NCIIA will coordinate and support the curriculum including but not limited to
all up-front logistics, registration, respondent questionnaires and online
activities.

The goal of an I-Corps project is to determine the commercial feasibility of
the technology derived from research that has been supported by NSF. The I-Corps
teams will learn how to evaluate commercial feasibility using a hypothesis-
testing approach akin to the scientific method to which they are accustomed.
Education is the primary component; participants will leave the program with an
expanded skill set that will serve them as they continue to pursue their
careers. In some cases, the teams will identify technology applications that
have the potential to make significant commercial impact and may start new
enterprises to pursue these opportunities. If the teams can successfully
commercialize their technologies, they will create value and contribute to the
economic prosperity of our nation. The effort described in this proposal will go
toward supporting the curriculum throughout the process.
