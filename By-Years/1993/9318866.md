This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University in the purchase
of a tunable IR laser source. This equipment will be used in the following areas
of research: (1) The Diode Probe Laser Technique; (2) Hot Atom Excitation of
Polyatomic Vibrational States; (3) Diode Laser Probing of Collisions between
High Energy and NO2 and Carbon Dioxide; (4) Kinematic Control of Reaction
Dynamics; (5) Mapping the Reaction Coordinate in Multichannel Polyatomic
Reactions; (6) Mapping the Reaction Coordinate in Polyatomic Reactions; (7)
Multiphoton IR excitation. A tunable infrared laser can provide important
information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive of molecules.
