Under this project, the Hierarchical Data Format(HDF) scientific data format,
which has been developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
will be extended to add the ability to use interfaces and libraries from another
popular file format, netCDF. This should enhance use of HDF and associated
scientific visualization tools in the atmospheric and aeronautic research
communities, and position HDF as one of only a very few data formats which are
used by all major data manipulation and visualization applications across all
the scientific and engineering disciplines supported by the NSF.
