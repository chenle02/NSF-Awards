This project is centered on problems in physics and partial differential
equations which have the common feature that nonlocal or nonconvex effects
produce a lack of compactness. The problems are divided into three categories:
Self-force problems in electro-magneto-elasticity, problems in viscoelasticity,
and problems in the theory of compensated compactness and weak continuity.
