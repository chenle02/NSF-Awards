A fundamental study to address the feasibility of rare earth doping of
semiconductors(III-V, Silicon, and SiGe) for light emitting devices will be
conducted. The approach is to introduce erbium in the form of moleclules of
erbium and another impurtiy(oxygen or nitrogen). This will be achieved by
control of growth chemistry and use of novel precursors, which are designed to
decompose in sucha a way as to form Er-O and Er-N radicals on the growth surface
and be incorporated in this form into the layer. Capture of carriers by the
impurity part of a dopant molecule followed by energy transfer to erbium is
expected to provide an efficent excitation route of intra-4f shell luminescence.
%%% This research will investigate a new method for obtaining light emission
from semiconductors. Potential benefits include the ability to provide novel
devices and optical interconnects in high performance electronic and photonic
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications.
