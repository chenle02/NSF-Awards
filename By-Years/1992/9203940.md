This awards supports the research of Professor R. Friedman to work in algebraic
geometry. He will continue to study the connections between the algebraic and
smooth properties of 4-manifolds. In particular, he will try to decide if every
complex surface diffeomorphic to a rational surface is itself rational and
whether one can characterize smoothly embedded 2-spheres of certain types lying
on a complex surface. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
