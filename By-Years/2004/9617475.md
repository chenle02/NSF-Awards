Professor Kenneth Shea, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
California, Irvine, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his
studies of the synthesis and reactions of strained molecules and polymers. Alkyl
boranes initiate the polymerization of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, resulting
in the formation of perfectly linear polymethylene with an extremely narrow
polydispersity index. Adjustment of the initial ratio of ylide to alkyl borane
permits control of the molecular weight of the resulting polymethylene, while
chemical transformations of the carbon-boron bonds of polyhomologated alkyl
boranes allow the introduction of a variety of terminal functionalities.
Extension of this polyhomologation chemistry to more complex alkyl borane
initiators affords access to novel polymethylene architectures, including star,
comb, and hyperbranched polymers. The chemistry may also be adapted to the
formation of block copolymers which covalently link polymethylene with the
incompatible polysiloxanes and polyethylene glycols. Development of control over
the formation and structures of polymers, macromolecules comprised of
chemically-linked repeating units derived from smaller molecules, is a central
issue in the scientifically and technologically vital area of polymer chemistry.
Professor Kenneth Shea exploits an unusual class of polymer-forming chemical
reactions, wherein individual carbon atoms are added to a growing polymer chain
one at a time. This chemistry affords synthetic access to a range of three-
dimensional polymer structures, including circular-, comb-, and star-shaped
materials, and will thereby permit the determination of the effects of such
unusual structural motifs on the intrinsic and bulk properties of polymeric
materials. Additional studies address the formation of block copolymers (two or
more distinct polymers chemically linked to one-another) in which the linked
polymers display drastically different properties. Unusual physical and chemical
properties are expected to arise from such unions, including the formation of
materials which can change their shapes and/or properties as a function of their
environment.
