ABSTRACT: 9319459, PI-Hallgren, "International Symposium on the Life Cycle of
Extratropical Cyclones: Bergen, Norway: June 27 - July 1, 1994" This award
provides travel support to allow a number of U.S. graduate students to attend
the International Symposium on the Life Cycle of Extratropical Cycles, an event
marking the 75th anniversary of the publication of the first scientific paper
dealing with the concept of extratropical frontal cyclones. The symposium will
be held in Bergen, Norway, the home of the so called Norwegian school of polar
front theory. The students will not only attend the sessions and, if
appropriate, present papers, but also assist in writing the summaries of the
sessions.
