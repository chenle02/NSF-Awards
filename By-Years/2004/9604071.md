IBN-9604071 Roberts Normal function of the gonads in mammals requires feedback
regulation by the brain and the pituitary gland. During the past 10 years, it
has been shown that a protein called activin is produced in the ovaries, testes,
and pituitary and that this protein is required for the normal functioning of
these reproductive organs. Dr. Roberts recently demonstrated that activin is
also produced in the brain and is localized in neural regions known to be
involved in the feedback regulation of the hormonal system involved in
reproductive functioning. She will now determine whether this activin protein
plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the reproductive axis at the level of
the brain. Utilizing anatomical techniques, Dr. Roberts will trace activin
producing neurons and to determine whether these activin neurons connect and
communicate with gonadotropin releasing hormone neurons (GnRH), an important
peptide hormone that regulates the release of estrogen and progesterone by the
ovary. She will also use isolated GnRH neurons in culture to directly test the
effects of activin on these reproductive neurons. The results from these studies
will determine whether activin modulates GnRH synthesis and release to help
maintain its homeostatic regulation. The new knowledge obtained from these
studies will form the basis for understanding the neuroendocrine role of activin
in the human reproductive system. This information is crucial for dissecting the
basic mechanisms by which the brain-pituitary-gonads work together to regulate
the timing of ovulation and thus, could be lead to a better understanding of
infertility and its treatment.
