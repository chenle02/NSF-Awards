This project is concerned with a class of mathematical objects called symplectic
resolutions. Symplectic resolutions are mathematical jewels; they possess a
wealth of interesting structures, which are of interest to mathematicians and
theoretical physicists working in different areas. As a result, new discoveries
about symplectic resolutions often have a wide impact across many parts of
mathematics and physics. As a mathematician working in an area called symplectic
geometry, the PI (along with collaborators) will study certain algebraic
structures associated to symplectic resolutions called Fukaya categories. The PI
also will mentor undergraduate and graduate students wishing to enter this area
of mathematics. To this end, the PI will write publicly available lecture notes
aimed at advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students.

Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds are a class of algebraic structures
defined via nonlinear analysis, by counting pseudoholomorphic curves with
appropriate Lagrangian boundary conditions. There are long-standing expectations
that Fukaya categories of symplectic resolutions should be related to structures
arising in representation theory. The PI intends to work on several questions in
this direction, using techniques from microlocal sheaf theory. Such techniques
have only recently become available thanks to the fundamental work of Ganatra--
Pardon--Shende, and the PI believes that they are particularly promising for
these types of questions. Along the way, the PI also plans to further develop
the foundations of microlocal sheaf theory, in particular the theory of perverse
microlocal sheaves.
