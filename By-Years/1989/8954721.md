A regional conference for scientists, mathematicians and engineers involved in
undergraduate education was held on April 19, 1989, in Columbia, South Carolina.
The conference was jointly hosted by Clemson University and the South Carolina
Commission on Higher Education. More than 100 representatives of institutions in
the Southeastern region consisting roughly of South Carolina, North Carolina,
Florida, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. The conference goals are two-fold: (1)
to provide an overview of National Science Foundation programs which support
curriculum development in science, engineering, and mathematics at the high
school and undergraduate levels and, (2) to provide educators an opportunity to
express their needs and concerns to the NSF program staff.
