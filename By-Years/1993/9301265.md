9301265 Kokini The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental
understanding of crack initiation and crack propagation in multilayer ceramic
coatings subjected to thermal loads. This will be accomplished by controlled
experiments where a beam specimen will be subjected to a laser beam and
analyzing the stresses and fracture behavior of the specimen. The effect of
material properties, layer architecture, microstructure and manufacturing
temperature will be studied in order to design ceramic coatings most resistant
to failure. ***
