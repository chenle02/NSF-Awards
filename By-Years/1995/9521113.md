9521113 Parmentier The Dynamics of Mid-Ocean Ridges Parmentier and Forsyth will
continue examining processes at mid- ocean ridges through computer modeling. The
models start with simple observations such as: ridges are broken into segments
of different length. The computer models use measured and estimated physical
properties of the mantle such as viscosity and temperature, and hypotheses about
how the mantle will behave to calculate what the length of the ridge segments
should be and what parameters affect this length. The results of the models can
point to features on the sea floor that can be measured that will confirm
alternate model outcomes. The work will lead to a better understanding of the
properties the mantle.
