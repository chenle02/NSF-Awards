The objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Peter A. Kollman
of the School of Pharmacy, University of California, San Francisco Center, and
Dr. Piotr Cieplak of the University of Warsaw, Poland, is to carry out
theoretical calculations to design peptide analogs that have the potential to be
excellent inhibitors of the proteins HIV protease, thermolysin and elastase. The
successful design of an inhibitor for this enzyme, should it prove of
therapeutic value, could be used against the AIDS virus. The same type of design
could be transferred to the inhibitor of other aspartyl proteases such as renin,
which would provide therapy against hypertension. Selective inhibition of serine
proteases such as human leucocyte elastase as a potential drug against emphysema
or other such degenerative diseases might be achieved using the same principles.
This project in biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
