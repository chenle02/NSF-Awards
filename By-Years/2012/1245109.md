This project uses mobile app development in required, inquiry-based general
education courses to increase the number of non-STEM and undeclared major
students who see technology as a career objective. Through this exposure as
technology creators rather than just as consumers, it is hoped that students
will develop an interest in pursuing more STEM courses and majors. The project
is developing a series of mobile app courses and is also training faculty on how
to include these concepts into a number of other general education courses.
While university freshmen, transfer students, and students at risk of leaving
the university are the primary audience for the courses, rising junior and
senior students at local high schools as well as students at Northern Virginia
Community College have access to the mobile app development courses through
Marymount's summer institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particular focus and
strength of the project is formal assessment of student: learning gains,
interest in technology, confidence with technology, and attention to increases
in the number of STEM majors at the university after introduction of the mobile
app development courses and concepts. The outcomes of this research could
contribute to a foundation for understanding the degree to which the engagement
with mobile app development affects students' interest, persistence, and
learning gains in STEM, computing, and IT majors and careers. In addition to
faculty training workshops, the project's progress and results are available
through the project website and at local, regional, and national conferences.
