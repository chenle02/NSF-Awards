9503217 Connell The objectives of this project are to measure the effects of
ground-dwelling vertebrates and mycorrhizal fungi on the seedlings and saplings
in the shaded understory of an Australian tropical rainforest. The investigators
will use field enclosure experiments, greenhouse growth experiments, and
quantitative surveys in the field to determine the role of animals and fungi in
the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests. These effects have
rarely been studied outside the new world tropics, and seldom tested
experimentally anywhere. Second, these effects will be studies with controlled
field experiments to test the suggestions from other studies that these animals
help maintain plant diversity in rainforests. This is important for wildlife
management and the conservation of biodiversity, because large vertebrates are
vulnerable to hunting and poaching in parks, and their numbers have been reduced
in many tropical rainforests, which could then lead to a decrease in the
diversity of trees, among other species, in these tropical forests.
