Due to the expressiveness of Extensible Markup Language (XML) as compared to
HTML, XML has become a standard format in data presentation for the web
applications. However, in content based retrieval, if the database content does
not match with the query conditions exactly, or if the query conditions are not
well presented, the system returns null answer. The user must reformulate and
resubmit the query for processing. Therefore, when the query conditions are not
known exactly (e.g. matching an image with a set of features or a document with
a set of key words), the user often specifies them in a general way to avoid a
null answer. The drawback of such an approach is that the system may return too
many and sometimes irrelevant answers. To remedy this problem, a systematic and
scalable knowledge based (derived from the XML data) relaxation methodology will
be developed to relax the query conditions (both in value and / or structure).
Further, the user can provide such relaxation control as the order of attributes
to be relaxed, relaxation level, the unrelaxable attribute list, number of
answers, etc. As a result, such technique provides a focused and controlled
relaxation, and thus yields more accurate and relevant answers.

In this proposal, the existing XML query language will be extended to support
query relaxation and relaxation control constructs, and techniques will be
developed to cluster similar data trees from XML data into a hierarchy to serve
as an index to guide relaxation.
