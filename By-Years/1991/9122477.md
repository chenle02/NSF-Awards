A common strategy in econometric analyses is to divide the variables of
interest into two types. The first type is that of a dependent variables whose
distribution in the population is to be explained in terms of variables of the
second type, the independent or explanatory variables. If the data to be
analyzed were randomly selected from the population of interest, then methods
exist for estimating the parameters of the conditional distribution of the
dependent variable given the explanatory variable. These estimators are
consistent, efficient and have other desirable properties. But some of the most
important properties do not hold if, as is frequently the case in applied
economics, the data are not random. This project develops estimation procedures
and specification tests that are both intuitive and computationally feasible for
nonrandom or partially random sampling procedures that are frequently
encountered in economic problems. These techniques are used to analyze partially
random data sets on Dutch labor market participation. This project addresses the
question of inference if the researcher has information on the parameters other
than a random dataset. Examples of sampling schemes studied by this project
include: 1) samples that are endogenously stratified; 2) additional information
on moments of the distribution of the dependent variables from aggregate
sources; and 3) datasets containing different sets of variables. The application
of these techniques to actual problems is used to show that they are feasible
and that they can lead to major efficient gains.
