This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Hands-On
Modules for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Courses," at Cornell University,
under the direction of Dr. Joel D. Brock is jointly funded by the Division of
Engineering Education and Centers in the Directorate for Engineering and the
Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences. The objective of this collaborative, interdisciplinary program,
jointly submitted by Cornell's School of Applied and Engineering Physics (AEP),
Department of Materials Science and Engineerin (MSE), and Center for Nanoscale
Systems (CNS), is to integrate nanoscale science and engineering into the
curricula taken by college freshmen studying science and/or engineering. The
program will have two components: 1) development of modules consisting of
"hands-on" experiences and complimentary lecture material that will be used to
modify and enhance an existing freshman level nanosicnece laboratory course; and
2) development of "video" presentations of both these new and several existing
modules for use as lecture demonstations in another existing freshman level
nanoscience lecture course. Both the modules and the videos will be used to
enhance CNS's Institue for Physics Teachers and its K-12 outreach program.
