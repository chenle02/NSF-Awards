Since 1991 NOAA/PMEL has monitored seismicity in the NE Pacific using Navy SOSUS
arrays, and since 1966 using an autonomous hydrophone array in the equatorial
Pacific. This project is an effort to use analyze these data to address
questions related to the first-order patterns in seismicity, stress transfer and
earthquake interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
