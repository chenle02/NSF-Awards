CBET-0827894&lt;br/&gt;Mathews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the
Chemical and Biological Separations Program supports work by Professor Alexander
P. Mathews of Kansas State University to investigate methods and mechanisms to
enhance gas-liquid mass transfer and reaction rates using nanoparticles and
nanoshells as shuttles. Nanoparticles and mesoporous nanoshells possess unique
properties such as high surface area and mobility, and these can be used to
advantage in changing bubble properties in gas-liquid mass transfer.
Nanoparticle sizes are in the range of hydrodynamic boundary layers, and can be
used to transport mass across the boundary layer. Moreover, adsorbent
nanoparticles can sorb solutes from the liquid phase and rapidly shuttle the
solutes to the gas phase. This process is expected to provide several fold
increase in mass transfer rates due to (1) a parallel liquid-solid-gas transfer
mechanism in addition to liquid-gas mass transfer, (2) increased bubble
residence time, and (3) cavitating bubbles and under ultrasonic fields. This
research will examine the mechanisms by which inert and adsorbent nanoparticles
will affect mass transfer rates in the transfer of dissolved organic
contaminants from water to the air phase in the presence and absence of
ultrasonic fields. Gas-liquid mass transfer processes are important in natural
and engineered systems. The application of knowledge gained from this work will
provide more efficient means of conducting mass transfer operations in drinking
water purification, multiphase reactions in the process industries, and in the
removal of volatile organic compounds from contaminated groundwaters and
wastewaters.
