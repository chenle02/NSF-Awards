9626685 Chow The proposed research is in the area of geometric evolution
equations: evolution of curves and surfaces by their curvature vectors,
conformal flows of Riemannian manifolds, and the Ricci flow for metrics are
among the topics to be pursued. The investigator will study Hamilton's Harnack
inequality for the Ricci flow and other Harnack inequalities for geometric
evolution equations with a view towards understanding the global behavior of
solutions of Ricci flow under various assumptions on the geometry of the
underlying manifold. Geometric flows arise in numerous applications. In computer
vision, curvature flows have been used to smooth images and enhance boundaries
(expanding flows have received a great deal attention lately in the field of
computer vision, where small bubbles are expanded to detect boundaries of
images); the Gauss curvature flow models the wearing of stones by water waves
and the process of making ball-bearings round by impacting at random angles.
Also, the Ricci flow has been applied to classification problems in Riemannian
geometry.
