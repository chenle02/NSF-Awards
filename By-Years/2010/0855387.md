nature is the strong interaction. A theory of this interaction, called quantum
chromodynamics or QCD, is well known and has successfully accounted for certain
experiments. This theory describes particles called quarks and gluons.
Unfortunately, the mathematical understanding of QCD is not good enough to
account for many other phenomena. In particular particle and nuclear physicists
would like to know what the theory predicts when particles and nuclei collide at
very high energies. Such collisions will be produced by the Large Hadron
Collider near Geneva. Another unsolved problem in the theory is to explain why
quarks are evidently trapped inside strongly-interacting particles - a
phenomenon known as quark confinement. Three new ideas for using QCD to
understand aspects of particle and nuclear physics are discussed in this
proposal. The first is an attempt to understanding high-energy scattering. The
second is to gain insight by studying the theory in two spacial dimensions
(instead of the real world of three spacial dimensions). The third idea is an
approach toward solving the problem of quark
confinement,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bernard M. Baruch College of the City
University of New York has one of the most ethnically-diverse undergraduate
populations in the United States. The PI would involve an undergraduate in some
computer studies and several Ph.D. students in other aspects of this work. With
the help of new faculty in the department, the funding of this proposal will
help to facilitate more mentoring and an improved curriculum for undergraduate
students.
