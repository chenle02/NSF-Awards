The Environmental Sciences Program of the University of Puerto Rico, RÃ­o Piedras
Campus (UPR-RP), in collaboration with state and federal environmental-related
agencies and non-governmental organizations in Puerto Rico, and two US
universities have partnered for the creation of the Geo-Internships Project.
This is a unique effort aimed at increasing the diversity in the geosciences by
exposing Environmental Sciences and Geography majors from UPR-RP to real-life
professional experiences that complement their academic development. This
project will allow students to develop semester-long projects in different work
settings at environmental-related institutions in Puerto Rico. These experiences
will be enriched through one-to-one mentoring with geoscience faculty and by
student participation in existing environmental seminar series and in peer
mentor training programs. Students will also be encouraged to apply to summer
research internships at The University of Vermont and at The University of
Colorado-Boulder. At the end of their Geo-Internships Project experience, about
30 undergraduate students are expected to have a more realistic view of their
potential as future geoscience professionals. Of these, those that continue on
to graduate studies in the geosciences will be tracked.
