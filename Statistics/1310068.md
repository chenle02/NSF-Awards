This project seeks to make important theoretical and methodological
contributions to several critical areas of nonparametric statistical inference
for high dimensional data. Specifically, this project concentrates on (i)
developing empirical likelihood methods for high dimensional data that, among
other applications, allows for simultaneous testing of a large number of
hypotheses with user-specified confidence levels even with a moderate sample
size; (ii) developing bootstrap methodology for high dimensional data for post-
variable selection inference; (iii) developing limit theory for studying first-
and higher- order asymptotic properties of statistical methods in high
dimensions; and (iv) investigating theoretical properties of the proposed and
existing resampling methods in high dimensions.

In recent years, high dimensional data appear routinely in many areas of
sciences (e.g., Molecular Genetics, Finance, Climate studies, brain mapping,
etc.) and in an ever increasing number of everyday activities (e.g., social
networking, internet browsing, etc.). This presents unique challenges for
information extraction, as traditional statistical methods do not perform well
in such "needle in a haystack" situations - where the relevant information is
confounded by the presence of a huge number of irrelevant variables. The
proposed research seeks to address this need directly by developing novel
statistical methods for high dimensional data without stringent assumptions on
the data structure.
