The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound
imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis
platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may
bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the
small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used
in a variety of settings, including doctorsâ€™ offices, physical therapy offices,
and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see
patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate
customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of
$1.7 billion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical
imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in
musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the
wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves
the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame
sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are
diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe
placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence
is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and
diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the
need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting
position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using
a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal
of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses
to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment
plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
