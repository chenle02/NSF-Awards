TITLE: Nanoscale Profiling of the Elastic and Viscoelastic Response
of&lt;br/&gt;Individual Carbon Nanotubes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The goal
of the proposed activity is the quantitative, nanoscale profiling of local
variations in the elastic and viscoelastic properties of multiwall nanotubes
(MWNTs). Ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) and heterodyne force microscopy (HFM)
will be utilized for the quantitative extraction and mapping of the reduced
Young's modulus and loss factor, respectively, along the axis of single tubes
grown via arc-discharge or chemical vapor deposition. Modulus extraction will
exploit the nonlinear interaction between a scanning probe tip and the nanotube
surface at ultrasonic vibrations (&gt; 10 MHz) to determine the MWNT contact
stiffness within a small (10nm x 10nm) area along the axis. The viscoelastic
imaging will utilize a heterodyne approach wherein ultrasonic vibrations are
applied to both the MWNT and the nanoprobe tip to produce a time-resolved
mechanical phase image for the MWNT viscoelastic response. Thermal studies (100K
to 600K) will also be undertaken for HFM nanotube profiling to investigate the
thermal evolution of visoelasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
