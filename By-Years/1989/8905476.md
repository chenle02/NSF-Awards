The human shoulder is a highly mobile structure whose function is to position
the hand almost anywhere within a nearly spherical range of motion. Many
features of this complex region in humans, including the function of certain
muscles, are shared with the living apes, as was previously demonstrated by this
investigator and others using electromyographic studies. The present proposal
describes a new set of functionally interpretable osteological features of the
scapula and humerus that have been suggested by the results of previous
electromyographic studies of shoulder muscle function among living apes and
humans. It follows in the tradition of S.L. Washburn who more than three decades
ago urged the use of experimental comparative anatomy to help answer questions
of human inheritance. Analysis of a new set of features in the skeleton of the
shoulder will further our understanding of the relationship between form and
function, as well as expand the collection of functional characters that may be
applied to the interpretation of human fossils. This will aid in our
understanding of this region of the body.
