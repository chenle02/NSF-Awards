Estimating production functions and other micro models is fraught with
statistical difficulties given existing estimating techniques, even in the case
of linear models. With nonlinear models, the reliability of existing techniques
is even less. This project will analyze a number of microeconometric models,
including single equation models, systems of equations and simultaneous equation
models, all with qualitative or limited dependent variables. The major goals are
to establish clear identification conditions, to establish consistency, and
asymptotic normality of the estimators. In addition, the finite sample
performance of the estimators will be investigated both by Monte Carlo studies
and by applying them to actual data. The purpose of this project is to develop a
semi-parametric method for the estimation of microeconometric models. This study
is important because the development of semi-parametric methods offers a way to
better estimate a large class of non-liner models. This estimation method should
find a variety of applications by economists interested in empirical research.
