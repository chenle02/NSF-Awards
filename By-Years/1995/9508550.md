SBR-9508550 This dissertation-improvement award will assist the Student's work
in a village in northern India, where she will combine ethnographic methods and
field measurement to investigate four sets of issues: (1) the relationships
between the spatial patterns of indigenous versus non-indigenous knowledge of
tree-management practices; (2) relationships between tree- management knowledge
and the socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of the immediate area;
(3) relationships between access to different sources of knowledge and gender
and socio-economic status; (4) the effect of communication with non-village
forest managers on the distribution of tree-management-knowledge application
among villagers; and (5) ways in which individuals and households resolve
discontinuities between knowledge received from different sources. The Student
will undertake a resource and ownership survey, and participant observation and
interviews to elicit tree-management knowledge and its sources. The Student will
analyze these data via structured qualitative and quantitative methods. This
case study should contribute to the scientific understanding of how practical
knowledge is diffused and used, and thereby should contribute to practical
attempts to diffuse "best-practice" techniques among local populations.
