This Presidential Young Investigator Award in the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program centers on the use of theoretical techniques to predict the
chemical behavior of adsorbates on metal and semiconductor surfaces. A unique
combination of both ab initio quantum chemistry methods, to determine the
fundamental potential energies of interaction, and classical molecular dynamics
methods, to simulate the progress of individual reaction steps, will be used to
address these problems. The research will focus on such systems as (i) bare
metal and main group clusters; (ii) atomic and molecular adsorbates on those
clusters; (iii) catalytic reactions including oxidation and hydrogenation of
hydrocarbons, ammonia synthesis and decomposition, and reduction of sulphur and
nitrogen oxides; and (iv) synthesis of electronic materials via chemical vapor
deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, and chemical etching. The ultimate goal of
these studies is to learn how to predict optimal reaction conditions for
development of new electronic materials and for the design of new catalysts.
