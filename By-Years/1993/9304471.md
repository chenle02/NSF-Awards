The subsurface flow regime within wetlands is well understood only in very few
locations, despite the large areal importance of peaty, water-saturated terrain
on Earth's surface and the hydrologically strategic location of wetlands in many
catchments. Ecologists have long attributed key aspects of peatland development
to the interactions of hydrology, chemical transport, and plant growth. Wetlands
can also play a critical, controlling role in the transport and fate of toxic
chemicals. The present project is focused on such a wetland, where a deep peat
deposit interacts with both a heavily contaminated river and a glacial outwash
aquifer containing a former municipal wellfield. In this setting the fundamental
processes of subsurface water transport through a peatland will be studied, with
a focus on peat characteristics at several spatial scales and the processes that
subsurface water flow and chemical transport. One working hypothesis is that,
due to heterogeneity on the scale of the peat formation, rates of both water and
pollutant movement through the wetland may significantly exceed the low rates
commonly attributed to peat formations. Accordingly, a variety of measurements
and tests will be conducted to define and assess the importance of these
heterogeneities. Investigative techniques will include head and hydraulic
conductivity measurements, a piezocone survey, aquifer stress/tracer tests,
chemical analyses of soil and groundwater, and speciation analysis and
sequential extractions of certain toxic metals.
