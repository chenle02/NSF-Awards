The major objective of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of
the evolutionary origins of morphological differences among tamarin species
(genus Saguinus). Tamarins are a highly diverse group of New World Monkeys
inhabiting Amazonia and the north coast of South America into Panama. They
display a wide range of cranial morphologies. Using previously gathered
information on patterns of inheritance of skull form and the phylogenetic
relationships among the species, the researchers will test a series of
hypotheses concerning the evolutionary origin of morphological differences in
this group. The studies will serve as a model for analyzing morphological
diversity in primate radiations. First, they will test the hypothesis that
cranial variability arose by random evolutionary processes, such as genetic
drift or randomly varying natural selection. If this hypothesis is not rejected,
it is possible that the diversity observed did not arise by special adaptation
to specific environments. Next they will use a well-resolved phylogenetic tree
to create a series of phylogenetically-independent contrasts among sister
groups. They will describe each of these contrasts using a two-group
discriminant function standardized with an estimate of the within-species
genetic covariance matrix. Each of these discriminant functions represents the
pattern of differences in natural selection required to produce the observed
morphological differences between related groups of tamarins. The results will
be interpreted using the principles of functional morphology. Specific a priori
hypotheses, such as selection on overall size as a source of evolutionary
morphological divergence, will also be tested.
