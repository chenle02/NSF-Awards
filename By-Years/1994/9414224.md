This award partially funds a conference covering topics in analytic number
theory organized by Professors Harold Diamond, Bruce Berndt, and Adolf
Hildebrand. This international conference will be held May 1994 at the
University of Illinois' Allerton Park Conference Center. The conference will
feature talks by world leaders in analytic number theory and include
presentations of the latest work of other mathematicians. The field of analytic
number theory applies the techniques of calculus to the discrete realm of the
whole numbers. Calculus was developed to aid the analysis of continuous
mathematical objects. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate
discrete objects is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic
number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
