This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Development Award supports
the effective integration of research, teaching and outreach. The research goals
are to characterize the surface corrosion products formed on bronze sculptures
using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. This
will provide a deeper understanding of the natural patination processes in
pristine and polluted environments and also lead to better preservation methods
for art conservators. The education and outreach goals also integrate chemistry
and art by developing a capstone course on community art conservation. This
course will allow science majors to apply what they have learned in their major
to a community challenge. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program supported
postdoctoral and professional development models that combined research
expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellows are
eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.
