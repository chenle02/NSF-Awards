Dr.Tamkun's research is focused on the genetic and molecular mechanisms
controlling the development of Drosophila melanogaster. This proposal concerns a
new homeotic gene, kismet, identified by virtue of its genetic interactions with
homeotic mutations. Genetic studies of the kismet locus have suggested that it
is a target, or encodes a cofactor, of the Antennapedia gene product. Dr.Tamkun
proposes to continue concurrent genetic and molecular analyses of kismet to
determine its precise role in the determination of segmental identities during
development. This will be accomplished through the use of germ-line and somatic
clonal analyses, the continued characterization of genetic interactions between
kismet and the homeotic loci of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes, and the
molecular cloning of kismet. Antibodies directed against the kismet protein will
be generated and used to determine its subcellular distribution. The spatial and
temporal expression of kismet during development will be followed using nucleic
acid and antibody probes. The effect of various homeotic mutations on the
expression of the kismet mRNA and protein will be examined to determine if this
locus is a target of homeotic gene regulation. %%% The determination of body
segment identity in fruit flies is an excellent system for studying the control
of pattern formation in multicellular organisms. Mutations in one class of genes
can result in the transformation of one body segment into the likeness of
another, such as the transformation of an antenna into a leg. This work will
further our understanding of how this class of genes functions.
