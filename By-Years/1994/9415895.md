This project involves the study of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) using
airglow imaging data. Gravity waves are important to the mesopause region for,
among other things, their effect on dynamics as well as a provision of a major
energy source for the region. This is a true CEDAR link coupling the troposphere
to the middle and upper atmosphere. AGWs, primarily generated in the
troposphere, propagate horizontally and vertically to the upper mesosphere and
lower thermosphere, causing perturbations to the atmospheric airglow layers.
These perturbations act as tracers of the AGWs as they provide a signature for
their horizontal wavelength, apparent phase speed, source directions, amplitude,
and related wave parameters. This project, a follow-up study to the ANLC/ALOHA
program, will continue the evolution of gravity wave exploration through
participation in the Starfire Optical Range Experiment, a measurement program at
Utah State University and the Bear Lake Observatory, and a study of the sources
of AGW through analysis of phase fronts from the all-sky data base.
