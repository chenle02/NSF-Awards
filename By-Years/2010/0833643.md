Tenth grade students in high schools in Nashville, Tennessee choose among four
to seven career academies. Despite a needs analysis that demonstrates the
several occupations in Nashville require a STEM background, the results of a
survey show that most students are choosing arts and communications career
academies rather than STEM-related ones. A comprehensive set of partners led by
Alignment Nashville, an organization that works out of the mayor's office to
connect community organizations to schools, provides an ITEST strategies project
to increase interest in STEM-related careers especially for 200 eighth grade
girls from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations and their teachers.
Using their existing knowledge and interest, students increase their
understanding of how their skills can be used in STEM-related careers by
creating 3D computer models, using tools such as AutoCAD and Alice. Students can
watch the construction of the model using the rapid prototyping facilities of
Tennessee Technical University via Internet. A four week summer camp at
Nashville State Community College, using the Ford PAS curriculum maintains the
students' interest and prepares them for the career academy. The mathematics and
science teachers of the targeted audience participate in professional
development activities to increase their ability to 3D modeling and connect
rapid prototyping to their content areas. Additionally, local college students
serving as Girl Scout Leaders in underserved areas of Nashville work with
students in the after school activities and summer camps and receive
professional development. The evaluation identifies strategies and tactics that
are effective in increasing the interest and understanding of the students and
teachers in STEM-related careers.
