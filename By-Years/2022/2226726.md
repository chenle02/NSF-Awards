This award supports student participation in the 2022 Network and Distributed
System Security (NDSS) Symposium held in person in San Diego CA in April 2022.
NDSS brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet
community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define
network and distributed system security. This grant enables career development
and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students.
Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for
our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the
opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security
researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships
that will serve them well during their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
