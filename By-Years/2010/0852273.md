This grant will fund approximately 50 US mathematical scientists to attend and
participate in the first PRIMA Pacific Rim Congress, to be held at the
University of New South Wales, Sydney, during July 6-10, 2009. The Congress will
include 11 plenary speakers highlighting the intense mathematical activities
throughout the region, and 14 special sessions on both core and applied areas. A
strong US presence is vital to strengthening ties and building collaborations
with researchers throughout the Pacific Rim. Participants in the Congress will
be able to exchange information about the latest advances in their research
areas, as well as plan future initiatives based on the contacts made during the
Congress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is explosive growth in the mathematical
sciences occurring in many parts of the Pacific Rim, but for reasons of distance
and culture it is often difficult for US scientists to learn about what is
happening, much less to directly participate. The PRIMA Congress is a unique
opportunity for US participants to become integrated into the vibrant and
interconnected mathematical community in the region, so vital to our economic
future. This is especially true for younger researchers and students, as well as
members of underrepresented groups, whose travel support is a main focus of this
proposal. Participation in the Congress may well be transformational for many,
opening up an entirely new range of scientific contacts and leading to further
regional activities such as summer schools and follow-up conferences as well as
smaller scale intensive collaborations. This can also have a profound impact on
the training of the next generation of leaders in the mathematical sciences, who
will operate in a global environment in which the Pacific Rim is playing an
increasingly important role&lt;br/&gt;
