In this EAGER proposal, Professor Ludmilla Aristilde of Cornell University uses
a novel combination of experimental tools adopted from two different fields,
molecular biology and molecular surface chemistry, with the aim of understanding
environmental chemistry . Specifically, the researchers seek to understand how
organic biomolecules react on mineral surfaces. This study is important to
understand how organic matter (carbon from leaves, stems, roots, etc.) is
recycled in the environment. This high risk project focuses on how carbon is
stored in soil on a fundamental level. Professor Aristilde is also developing a
new course offering, which includes laboratory modules, to introduce students
both to the study of surface chemistry of natural particles and to the
application of nanotechnologies to study these surfaces. She provides research
opportunities in her lab for undergraduate students, especially women and
underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, supported by
the Environmental Chemical Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Geobiology
and Low Temperature Geochemistry Programs, the mechanisms, stability, and fate
of mineral-associated soil organic matter is studied. This research has
implications on the global carbon cycle. The combination of the analytical
techniques is novel and represents a unique, interdisciplinary approach,
especially as the research tools are borrowed from different disciplines,
biology and molecular surface chemistry. An inexpensive approach for generating
high selectivity in the stable-isotope labeling profile of a complex organic
matrix using a biocatalytic platform is explored. This project uses bacterial
metabolism to achieve new molecular probes for organo-mineral and organo-organo
entities using stable isotope-enhanced multi-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance spectroscopy. This high-risk, high-reward project obtains selectivity
from dually isotopically-labeled versions of a complex organic matrix.
