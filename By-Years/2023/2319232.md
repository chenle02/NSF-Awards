This proposal requests funding to support a number of US-based students for
attending the 59th version of the annual IEEE International Symposium on
Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) with the intention of exposing them to the
discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in emerging issues in the
area of Circuits and Systems research. Participation in this symposium is
considered an important part of the graduate-school experience of students in
computer engineering, providing the opportunity to interact with senior
researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The support
will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would
otherwise not have the experience. This student-travel support will also
facilitate the development of promising graduate students and will indirectly
help train the workforce of the future in the key areas of computer engineering,
in general, and Semiconductor Microelectronics in particular. Participation of
women and members of underrepresented populations will be given due
consideration for receiving support through this grant.

The International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) for more than 50
years has been the premier conference where emerging trends and novel concepts
of Circuits and Systems research have been explored. The 2023 edition of this
conference will address key trends and challenges in these areas and includes
Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Tutorials, Panels, and
Special Sessions. The conference committee has set up adequate evaluation
criteria to select qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open
advertisement. While the requested funds will primarily be used for supporting
graduate students, the committee may also consider US-based undergraduate
applicants and post-docs in order to better reach a diverse population of
potential researchers in this field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
