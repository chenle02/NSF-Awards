This research continues a program of theoretical research focusing on studies
of processes influencing the composition of both the stratosphere and
troposphere. The objective is to enhance understanding of factors responsible
for the rapid changes taking place in the composition of the atmosphere. Studies
of the mid-latitude stratosphere using measurements from the shuttle-borne ATMOS
experiment, and other data sources, to test and improve current photochemical
models will be carried out. This work will also include the development of semi-
empirical models relating chemical and meteorological tracers, allowing
reconstruction of 3-dimensional tracer distributions in the stratosphere, with
applications to analyses of data obtained in recent aircraft missions to the
polar regions. Studies of the troposphere include development of a 2-dimensional
model, calibrated using our 3-dimensional tracer model, to investigate factors
responsible for present and past changes in the abundance of methane, carbon
monoxide and the oxides of nitrogen. The 3- dimensional model will be applied to
study seasonal deposition of nitrate to ice in Antarctica, and selected
investigations of photochemical and cloud processes in the planetary boundary
layer.
