Chemistry (12) This project is creating an interdisciplinary physical chemistry
laboratory curriculum in which static and dynamic fluorescence techniques play
an integral role. A spectrofluorometer and a laser-based fluorescence lifetime
spectrometer are being purchased to incorporate these techniques in various
laboratory courses. A biophysical chemistry class with an associated laboratory
is being created in which students apply physical chemistry concepts to
biological and pharmaceutical systems. Laser pulse-based experiments are also
being incorporated into the physical chemistry sequence and analytical chemistry
courses to expose majors to interdisciplinary topics involving macromolecules
using fluorescence techniques. Laboratory experiments taken from the research
literature that range in scope from an investigation of the thermodynamics of
beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to the measurement of fluorescent
lifetimes of biologically relevant inorganic complexes are being adapted and
implemented for use in the curriculum.
