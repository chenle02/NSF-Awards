This project addresses a number of basic questions concerning the low
temperature behavior of short-range spin glasses and other models of materials
with quenched disorder. Rigorous and heuristic mathematical methods will be
applied to analyze the conjectured presence of a phase transition; the
multiplicity, structure and organization of pure phases and ground states; the
effect of small magnetic fields; and non-equilibrium dynamics.

The purpose of this project is to develop mathematical techniques and results in
certain specific models of low temperature materials, known as spin glasses. The
importance of the project is that these techniques have potential application to
a wide range of problemsarising in areas such as theoretical computer science or
biology which combine issues of complexity and optimization. Examples of such
problems are optimal route scheduling of airlines and predicting the geometric
structure (and hence biological function) of proteins.
