The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, embedded in the ice cap at the South Pole, is
the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. The
recent addition of the DeepCore low energy extension allows IceCube to address
fundamental questions in particle physics through the observation of atmospheric
neutrinos at energies from 10 to 100 GeV. With this award the Penn State group
will continue to use DeepCore data to address fundamental questions of neutrino
physics, including testing whether the observed muon neutrino oscillations lead
to tau neutrino appearance, or whether extra, sterile neutrino flavors are
involved in neutrino oscillations. The Penn State group will also use IceCube
and DeepCore to facilitate searches for astrophysical neutrinos from
accelerators of cosmic rays. DeepCore will enhance IceCube's ability to identify
tau neutrino events at energies of around 1 PeV. Real-time searches for such
events can be used to identify astrophysical transient events associated with
cosmic ray acceleration. In addition, the group is studying the feasibility of
implementing an even more powerful atmospheric neutrino detector in the
Antarctic ice cap, known as PINGU, which might have the ability to probe the
neutrino mass hierarchy. This could provide extremely valuable input to
fundamental theories of particle physics beyond the Standard
Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The Penn State group
offers a summer professional development workshop for secondary school teachers,
which exposes them to forefront research in particle astrophysics. They have
developed a version of the workshop focused on giving the educators a hands-on
experience in operating state-of-the-art particle detectors, as well as on
simpler activities and materials which can be easily used in the high school
classroom. In addition, the group provides opportunities for young physicists at
all levels to become involved in particle astrophysics, with a particular
emphasis on encouraging participation among women and underrepresented groups.
