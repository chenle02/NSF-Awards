Title: Workshop: Theory and Modeling in Molecular Biophysics

This workshop will capture the most seminal ideas in molecular biophysics that
have emerged over the last 25 year period and to develop an outlook for the next
25 years. Theory and modeling are having a major impact in changing our
understanding of molecular biophysics. The quantity and quality of new data
being created cannot be understood and interpreted as in the past. Understanding
and modeling of all this information requires an interdisciplinary integration
with theoretical approaches stemming from the physical sciences. More
importantly, starting from modeling, one can begin to search for underlying
processes governing complex biological processes that have the potential to lead
to theories in biology.

This workshop will produce a document that should help the National Science
Foundation to guide science at the interface of the biological and physical
sciences and provide guidelines for continued support of transformative research
in this field over the next 25 years. The attendees include scientists in the
forefront of the field including members of underrepresented groups.
