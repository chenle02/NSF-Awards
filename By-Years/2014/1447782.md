Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to
perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge.
Diversity in relevant characteristics across groups contributes to better
deccisionmaking. Universities need to consider how best to retain excellent
faculty and promote development across demographic groups. Attrition from the
profession varies by demographic characteristics. One way to contribute to
diversification within the profession is to evaluate the applicability of
knowledge concerning what works in coalition building and what the outcomes
might be. This workshop will bring together scholars from different
universities, at different stages in their careers to build coalitions to deepen
intellectual engagement, develop intellectual cross-fertilization and
collaboration, and to build coalitions to support excellence in diversifying the
profession throughout careers.

By applying the scholarship on diversity within organizations, effective
coalition building, and outcomes in agendas, this workshop will contribute to
developing diversity across the career course in the field.
