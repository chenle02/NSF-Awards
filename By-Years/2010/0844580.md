Astrophysics is addressing many fundamental questions about the nature of the
universe through a series of ambitious wide-field optical and infrared imaging
surveys (e.g. studying the properties of dark matter and the nature of dark
energy). To accomplish these goals requires new methodologies for analyzing and
understanding petascale data sets (with the data being collected at a rate 1000x
greater than current surveys). This research focusses on exploring an emerging
paradigm for data intensive applications, map-reduce(using Hadoop for the
implementation of map-reduce), and how it scales to the analysis of astronomical
images. The work is addressing the efficiency of map-reduce for determining
spatial and temporal overlaps between terabyte scale imaging data sets when
compared to standard database techniques. We are delivering new algorithms for
indexing, accessing and analyzing astronomical images using map-reduce that can
balance the load between the compute nodes on distributed systems. We are also
delivering applications that will analyze the spatial distribution of star
formation within galaxies (combining large multispectral data sets) and for
identifying asteroids within a time series of data where the asteroid may be
below the detection threshold of any one image. This work will have a broad
range of applications to any data intensive field.
