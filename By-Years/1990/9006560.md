This research focuses on data analysis and theoretical modeling of solar
radiation in the high latitude Southern Hemisphere using measurements obtained
by NSF spectroradiometers located at Palmer Station, Antarctica and Ushuaia,
Argentina. The objectives are to define and quantify the physical mechanisms
responsible for observed variations in surface irradiance in the ultraviolet and
visible regions of the spectrum, with emphasis on the former. Variations to be
studied span time scales of hours, associated with fluctuations in cloudiness,
to several years, where changes can arise from differences in local cloudiness
and ozone levels from one year to the next. Special attention will focus on
ultraviolet radiation levels measured during the springtime ozone depletion over
Palmer Station and a search for any effects at the lower latitude of Ushuaia.
The results will provide a comprehensive description of the radiation
environments at Palmer Station and Ushuaia in the visible and biologically
relevant ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.
