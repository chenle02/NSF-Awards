The high speed digital waveform acquisition system requested in this proposal
will be used in the continuing support of a number of projects in the high
voltage/pulsed power laboratory. The main research interest of this laboratory
is the insulation and switching of high voltages for application in pulsed power
and power distribution environments. The specific projects in which these
digitizers will be used include investigations into surface flashover in vacuum,
surface flashover in compressed gases, breakdown and recovery of triggered
switching gaps, and conduction onset in solid state switching devices.
