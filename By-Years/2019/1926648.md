Quantum computers have emerged quickly and quantum supremacy is around the
corner. The quantum hardware is getting better but quantum software is lacking
behind. We need the same kinds of software tools that enable quick and reliable
programming of traditional computers. Indeed, for quantum computing to be
successful, we need an entire software stack of programming languages,
compilers, and verification tools. This award is made to hire a faculty member
who will spearhead multi-disciplinary research on building such a software stack
for quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCLA Computer Science department
includes three research groups that each will contribute to the effort
spearheaded by the new faculty member. The first group is focused on
cryptography and machine learning, the second on software systems, and the third
on design automation and customization. These areas will be key to building a
software stack for quantum computing. The goal is to integrate the new faculty
member into the department in a way that interfaces naturally with all three
groups. The broader context at UCLA is the Center for Quantum Science and
Engineering which is the focal point for research and education in quantum
science. The new faculty member will teach three courses on quantum computing
annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
