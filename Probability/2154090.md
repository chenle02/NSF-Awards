This project will investigate the effect of random noise on idealized models of
physical systems. The addition of random noise sometimes simplifies the analysis
of complex systems, but can also fundamentally modify their behavior and give
rise to unexpected phenomena. Both situations apply to the two classes of
systems studied in this project: so-called random polymer models, which describe
noisy, growing interfaces in condensed matter, and nonlinear differential
equations that are used to model quantum and classical waves. The project will
also use mathematical statistical physics more generally as a motivation to
train undergraduate and graduate students in probability theory, an essential
tool in modern computer science and artificial intelligence.

More specifically, the aim is to develop robust tools to estimate the
fluctuations of random polymers and related diffusion models, with the ultimate
goal of extending results obtained by exact algebraic methods to broader classes
of models where exact methods do not apply. Concerning nonlinear wave and
Schroedinger equations, the project will study the evolution of the distribution
of solutions for given random initial data, with special emphasis on extremal
situations like small nonlinearity or small dispersion.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
