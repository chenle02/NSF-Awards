9404622 Wood This project is to do the following: 1) carry out studies of the
hydroxide and bisulfide complexes of Pt and Pd from 0 to 90oC; 2) build and test
a hydrothermal apparatus required for the study of PGE mineral solubility at
temperatures from 300o to 600oC; 3) carry out preliminary experiments on the
simultaneous solubility of all six PGE metals in chloride solutions from 300o to
600oC. The thermodynamic data determined in this study are crucial to the direct
modelling of PGE transport during the formation of low-temperature hydrothermal
PGE deposits.
