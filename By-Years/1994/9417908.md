Johnson 9417908 The PIs will study how well various configurations of surface
displacement measurements can constrain estimates of subsurface fault slip, with
particular attention to the determination of coseismic fault motion. With the
burgeoning use of new techniques for surface displacement measurement-notably
GPS and more recently SAR interferometry-an investment in how best to conduct
these measurements in advance of anticipated earthquakes should pay off in a
better understanding of the earthquake process and of earth structure models
near these faults once the earthquakes occur. ****
