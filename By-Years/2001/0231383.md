This project is attempting to address the need for materials that help students
master a large body of factual material in anatomy and physiology in a manner
that emphasizes the development of problem-solving and other core scientific
competencies. The project aims to develop a prototype set of materials covering
the heart and cardiovascular system that incorporates hands-on experiences and
student-centered problem-solving tasks. The project seeks to serve as a model
for how to develop new curricula and low cost materials, and how to train
instructor in their use. A laboratory guide, instructor's manual and CD showing
how the model is used, are being written. The products will be evaluated both
with respect to their efficacy in training instructors and their impact on
student learning.
