This award will partially support the conference IAU Symposium 258, "The Ages of
Stars" to be held in Baltimore, MD, 13-17 October, 2008. Stellar ages play an
important role in a wide variety of astrophysical contexts, from following the
evolution of stars to constraining the process of planet formation to
disentangling the history and structure of the Milky Way. The recent
developments in theoretical models of stars and their physics (better reaction
rates, treatments of diffusion, inclusion of rotation effects, etc.) coupled
with new observational tests of ages such as white dwarf cooling sequences, and
the ever-increasing importance of understanding ages at the young end (i.e.,
star and planet formation), make now an ideal time for this conference. Towards
this end, several significant questions will be addressed during this meeting
and a number of astrophysical questions that can be answered once ages of single
or groups of stars can be estimated will be discussed. The support will be used
for travel costs of attendees (preferentially directed at US and early career
researchers), meeting infrastructure (projector rentals, poster display boards,
etc.), and disseminating the proceedings.
