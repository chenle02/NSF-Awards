This grant will support the construction and operation of a detector which will
study high energy photons or gamma rays. Measuring the energy of these particles
and determining their origin will help answer many outstanding questions in
astrophysics. This will help us to understand pulsars and the phenomena of gamma
rays bursts. No detector has yet made measurements of photons in the energy
range this detector will probe which means that it is possible that existing new
results will be obtained.
