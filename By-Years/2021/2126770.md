The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide homeowners with an affordable on-
site wastewater treatment solution. Hawaii’s coral reefs are under threat from
products of hundreds of thousands of onsite treatment systems across the state
seeping into the groundwater and eventually reaching the coastal ecosystem. The
proposed onsite wastewater treatment technology could will address this with
wide-ranging environmental benefits. The State of Hawaii has legislated the
replacement of residential cesspools by 2050 in order to reduce the pollution in
streams and the ocean. Unfortunately, upgrade costs are so high that 90% of
Hawaiian cesspool owners can’t afford the upgrade. The proposed technology can
reduce the cost of upgrades by 5-10x. While the initial application will be in
Hawaii, the technology will have national applicability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed system uses an algal bacterial biofilm to
passively aerate wastewater recirculated from a septic tank to conduct
nitrifying, denitrifying, and heterotrophic operations. Previous investigations
into abPBR use for onsite treatment have shown the capacity for high nutrient
and BOD removal, but only with active maintenance and pumped recirculation. This
project proposes a novel system with this performance but without high
maintenance or energy demands. A novel convection-based passive recirculation
process will be the primary focus of this study, with a focus on determining how
experimentally determined passive recirculation rates and internal temperatures
align with computational models, as well as standards for on-site residential
wastewater treatment systems. The project will also explore susceptibility to
and impact of disrupted recirculation due to gases coming out of
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
