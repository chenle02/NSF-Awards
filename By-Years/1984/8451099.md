Lasers exhibit a variety of dynamic outputs such as relaxation oscillations,
persistent oscillations, mode locking, Q switching, and chaotic behavior. This
time evolution encompasses synergetic behavior as well as a deterministic
dynamical approach to ergodic motion. Of particular importance are the
homogeneously broadened systems such as the optically pumped molecular lasers
and the ruby laser. These laser systems may be modeled by Lorenz equations in
the mean field limit and therefore offer the possibility of studying the
transition to chaos in optical systems where data acquisition is rapid and non-
intrusive. The route to chaos in the CH;i3F and CH;i3OH lasers will be studied
as well as the yet unresolved behavior of the ruby spiking instability. In
addition, the behavior of coupled cavities will be examined with emphasis on
diode laser systems for swept single mode operation.
