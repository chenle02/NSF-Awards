The function of the nervous systems depends on the signaling of nerve impulses
across the nerve cells at a structure called synapse. A group of molecules in
the membrane of the receiving post-synaptic nerve cells, the transmitter
receptors, are responsible for receiving the chemical signals from the pre-
synaptic nerve cells. The metabolism, mobility, and the distribution of these
receptors determine the efficiency and stability of the signaling at the
synapse. The purpose of the present project is to examine when the glutamate
receptors are synthesized in the developing nerve cells, how do they become
segregated into different regions of the cell membrane, how their distribution
at the synapse become concentrated as synapse matures, and whether the
concentrated distribution can be further modified by the use of the synapse. The
result from this study will help us to understand the role of transmitter
receptor dynamics in the synaptic functions as well as in the disease states,
during embryonic development and in adult life.
