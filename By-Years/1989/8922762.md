This project will make the first direct measurement of apparent attenuation
(inverse Q) on lower ocean crust and it will determine Q for specific
lithologies and structural features under in situ conditions. The PI's will
apply the spectral ratio technique to spectra computed on down-going waves
separated from seismograms recorded during a vertical seismic profile made at
Ocean Drilling Program Site 735. The apparent attenuation results can be used
directly in synthetic seismograms modeling of marine reflection and refraction
data allowing more realistic representation of arrival amplitudes, which are
critical in evaluating the details of crustal structure.
