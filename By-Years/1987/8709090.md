This research project will develop the theory and application of the primary and
secondary bifurcation of nonlinear oscillations of water waves in enclosed
rectangular basins using perturbation methods, bifurcation theory, and other
advanced mathematical techniques. The physical motivation is the "sloshing"
problem, a phenomena of tremendous practical importance in liquid transport in
trucks, rail cars, LNG &amp; oil sea tankers, satellites, etc. The results
indicate that explanation for the anomalous branches of solutions in the water
wave problem are generic and may occur in many physical systems under particular
symmetry conditions.
