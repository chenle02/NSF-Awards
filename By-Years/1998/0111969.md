This study focuses on the processes involved in the editing (memory) of past
&lt;br/&gt;decisions. Our goal is to contribute to decision theory while
expanding our &lt;br/&gt;collective understanding of how complex auditing
decisions are made. The &lt;br/&gt;study builds on a well-known body of
preceding work, notably Festinger's &lt;br/&gt;cognitive dissonance reduction
theory, Fischhoff's hindsight bias, and &lt;br/&gt;Svenson's differentiation and
consolidation theory. Festinger, for example, &lt;br/&gt;has shown that decision
makers actively reevaluate the" worth" of the &lt;br/&gt;rejected alternative
after a decision has been made--frequently to reduce the &lt;br/&gt;risk of
post-decision regret. We focus on both pre- and post-decision
&lt;br/&gt;attribute isolation and editing: on how expert and novice auditors
make sense &lt;br/&gt;of complex and risky judgment/decision tasks, and on how
feedback (or lack &lt;br/&gt;thereof) influences their memory of earlier
supportive and counter-indicative &lt;br/&gt;signal ratings. Both pre- and post-
decision sense-making (editing) processes &lt;br/&gt;are closely linked to both
effective and biased learning. We hypothesize &lt;br/&gt;that there are
significant differences in the type of data--qualitative vs.
&lt;br/&gt;quantitative and positive vs. negative-- that the professionals and
novices &lt;br/&gt;attend to. We also hypothesize that novices are more likely
to behave in &lt;br/&gt;accordance with established decision theory than their
professional &lt;br/&gt;counterparts; that domain knowledge gives rise to an
interesting and largely &lt;br/&gt;unexplored set of mitigating factors.
