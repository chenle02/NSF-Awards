9419393 Schmittmann Though there has been significant recent progress in the
understanding of the co-operative behavior of driven diffusive systems, a host
of new questions and surprising discoveries have also appeared. These puzzling
issues will be addressed, from readily achievable goals to long-term projects.
The former include (i) continued studies of uniformly and randomly driven
systems, focusing on global features of the phase diagram and detailed
properties like critical singularities, (ii) further exploration of multi-
species and multi-layer systems, and (iii) theoretical understanding of
interfacial instabilities and anomalous correlations. The latter is concerned
with some fundamental questions, e.g., methods for simulating quenched
impurities in finite systems with global currents, the existence of essential
singularities at first order transitions far from equilibrium, and the role of
detailed balance. %%% An exciting and rapidly expanding area in condensed matter
physics is the study of complex co-operative behavior in systems driven far from
equilibrium. Prominent examples include self-organized critically and driven
diffusive systems. Since non-equilibrium phenomena are abundant in nature, it is
clearly important that they be well understood, both in terms of theoretical
foundations and practical applications. A promising approach consists of
investigating simple models which retain the essential characteristics of these
systems. Using an interplay of computer simulations and analytic methods,
specific studies on such models is proposed, with a view to a wide range of
potential applications, e.g., gel electrophoresis, intercalation processes, flow
patterns of granular materials or traffic, flux creep in superconductors, biased
diffusion on surfaces, and the dynamics of fracture.
