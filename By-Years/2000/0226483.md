This NSDL Targeted Research project is studying the use of networked digital
resources by secondary school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) teachers as they seek and select quality materials and tailor them to fit
the learning environment of their classroom. Areas of interest
include:&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the use of digital resources for preparing
lessons and for incorporating materials directly into student projects; and
investigating types of software tools, lesson templates, and support that enable
teachers to integrate digital library resources into general classroom settings.
A combination of surveys, interviews, and observations are being employed, and
the results are informing a general framework for the identification of specific
services and tools for the broad audience of secondary school STEM teachers.
