The award will support Dr. Lang with "rapid response funding" to conduct some
preliminary studies of the coral- bleaching phenomenon recently affecting reefs
in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Lang will lead a collaborative
effort to (1) give a general assessment of the extent of the bleaching
phenomenon in the western tropical Atlantic in order to document the region wide
patterns of occurrence; (2) organize the repeated monitoring over a year period
of four specific (Venezuela, St. Croix USVI, Florida Keys, Bahamas) areas which
represent a range of reef types (on the basis of geography within the region,
proximity to continental influences, degree of reef development), (3) establish
a base of coral samples at the four sites for measuring the growth responses of
bleached and control coral colonies, (4) facilitate repetitive assessments in
additional regions that have ongoing programs (Bermuda, Panama, Puerto Rico,
Columbia, St. John USVI), and (5) conduct an analysis of transect and
environmental data with the assistance of Dr. Howard Lasker (SUNY Buffalo) and
Dr. Richard Dodge (Nova University).//
