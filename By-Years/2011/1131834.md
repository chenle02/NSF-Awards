Measurements of nitrogen and carbon isotopes from deep-sea sediments document
dramatic changes between the last ice age and the modern ocean. However, both
nitrogen and carbon isotopes are influenced by different physical and
biogeochemical processes, which makes their interpretation ambiguous. In this
research, a process-based coupled model of climate, ocean circulation and
biogeochemistry that includes carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be used in
conjunction with sediment data in order to reconstruct glacial nitrogen and
carbon cycles. The model will be amended with explicit iron cycling and global
databases of nitrogen and carbon isotopes from Last Glacial Maximum and modern
ocean sediments will be compiled. This approach allows testing of hypotheses
concerning changes in the total ocean nitrogen inventory, polar nutrient
consumption due to iron fertilization and their effects on atmospheric CO2
concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project continues collaboration
between a climate modeler and a paleoceanographer from Oregon State University
and international collaboration with a Canadian investigator from McGill
University. Funding supports a graduate student, a summer workshop for 30 K-12
teachers from all parts of Oregon and a summer research experience for an
undergraduate student at Oregon State University. In addition, the researchers
will actively participate in both the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison
Project (PMIP) and in the new Paleo Carbon Modeling Intercomparison Project
(PCMIP), efforts that evaluate the skill of climate models under paleoclimate
conditions and improve understanding of past climate changes.
