The Community College is located on the Lac Courtes Oreilles Reservation of
rural Northern Wisconsin. The College population is 95% Native American, of
which 70% are women. Due to the isolation of the Northern Wisconsin woodlands
and the limited resources of the students, the College has become the focal
point of educational services within the area. Prefiously science courses were
taught with a minimum of laboratory work. Instuctors prepared demonstrations for
students to view in the local high school laboratory which is not equipped for
scientific investigation beyond the secondary curriculum. The new laboratory
equipment is providing the means to begin to explore Biology and Chemistry
beyond the post-secondary level. Furthermore, Native American students are being
given the opportunity to research scientific concepts at the experimental level
which is consistent with Native American learning styles. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
