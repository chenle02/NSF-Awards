9702263 Swenson Phase diagram models are created for bulk metallic glass forming
systems and technologically important metallic glass -forming systems are
thermodynamically modeled. The initial work is on a well-characterized, good
glass- forming ternary system, Al-Cu-Zr, and an Al-base amorphous alloy system,
Al- Ce-Ni. Phase diagram information (primarily isotherms and liquidus surfaces)
is determined using classical metallurgical techniques, such as isothermal phase
diagram sample preparation, differential thermal analysis, and differential
scanning calorimetry. The constituent binary systems are modeled, followed by
the ternary systems. These data are used to predict the optimum glass- forming
composition regions of the system, and the results are compared with
experimental bulk metallic glass samples fabricated by melt spinning or piston
forging and data that in the literature. Differential scanning calorimetry is
used to determine the glass transition temperatures of the amorphous alloys and
to measure thermodynamic properties of the glass, such as heat capacity, that
may be used to improve the thermodynamic model itself. A laboratory course
entitled "Applied Thermodynamics of Materials" is integrated with current
efforts to bring more modern, real world applications into the classroom. This
course presents a series of laboratory exercises involving the four main classes
of materials: metals, ceramics, electronic materials, and polymers. %%% The
thermodynamic models that will be developed in the grant can be used to optimize
the glass formability of metallic systems, as well as to derive more
quantitative rules for creating improved glass forming alloys. ***
