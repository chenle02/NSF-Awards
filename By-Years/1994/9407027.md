9407027 Pinto Specimens of Trichogramma at the University of California at
Riverside presently mounted in Hoyer's will be transferred to Canada balsam
mounts. Limited materials now in alcohol or gelatin capsules will also be
mounted in Canada balsam. That will make this highly valuable collection of
parasitoids amenable to study.
