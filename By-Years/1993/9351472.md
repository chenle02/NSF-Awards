An expanded calculus program is being offered which utilizes a sequence of
courses integrating lectures with computer lab experience. The laboratory is
dedicated solely to mathematics computer exploration, incorporating
technological advances and a focus on concepts over calculation. The computer
lab setting is used to reinforce concepts discussed in the classroom, and to
enable students to discover calculus in a hands-on experience.
