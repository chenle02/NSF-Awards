This grant provides partial support for a symposium on Ethics and the Future of
Chemistry, to be held in conjunction with the joint meeting of the American
Chemical Society and the Chemical Institute of Canada in Toronto in June 1988.
The symposium is composed of two half-day sessions. The first, "Chemical Ethics
and Public Perception: Do Chemists' Transgressions Warrant Serious Concern?"
will examine the extent of cheating or error in chemistry and public responses
to the dangers it perceives. The second half-day, "Ethics and Chemical
Education: Preparing Students to Resolve Ethical Dilemmas," will discuss
implicit and explicit approaches to teaching of values and ethics to chemistry
students. Speakers will be chemists, philosophers and journalists. The sessions
will devote time to discussion of case studies and ethical dilemmas by the
speakers and the audience. NSF funds will support travel and publicity and
taping expenses for the symposium. Broader coverage, through Chemical and
Engineering News, science journals and newsletters, and other reports and
publications, is also planned.
