A scanning tunnelling microscope for use in ultrahigh vacuum is being
constructed. This will be combined with equipment already purchased to provide
an ultrahigh vacuum system that contains scanning tunnelling microscopy, Auger
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, high-resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy, and sample preparation capability. The system will be used to
study the structures of surfaces formed from copper and silicon (used for the
synthesis of methylchlorosilanes); the chemical vapor deposition of tungsten
onto silicon; initial stages of the surface oxidation of aluminum, nickel, and
iron; and the structures, growth mechanisms, and thermal stabilities of metal
monolayers on metal substrates.
