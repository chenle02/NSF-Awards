The National Gardening Association will be offering a four-year program of
professional development for elementary teachers interested in inquiry-centered
teaching using plants in the classroom. This program will provide three-week
summer workshops and follow-up support to leadership teams of teachers, school
administrators, and community partners from 16 urban sites. These teams will
become experts in the use of GrowLab, an instructional program developed with
NSF support by the National Gardening Association, and Fast Plants, another NSF-
supported instructional program, developed at the University of Wisconsin.
Private businesses and informal learning centers such as botanical gardens and
horticultural clubs will provide content support to teachers. The teams of
participating teachers will offer professional development opportunities to
other teachers in their region, and act as advocates for inquiry-centered
teaching in elementary classrooms. More than 360 teachers, administrators, and
community partners will be reached directly or indirectly by this program of
leadership development. A national network and newsletter will also disseminate
news of this project. Cost sharing represents 50% of the NSF contribution.
