A three-year program is proposed involving development of the IT-techniques
necessary to make the most efficient bandwidth and science use of the available
observation time at Arecibo Observatory (AO) by flexibly accelerating the data
processing. The proposed IT-approach will be tested via two high-impact science
test/demonstration cases to be conducted at AO. The first involves simultaneous
high-range/time resolution dual-beam incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations
of the 50-600 km ionosphere and a simultaneous search-using the same data
stream-for heliocentric orbital objects above the atmosphere. The second will
search the data-stream for meteors and completely reduce the highly complex
meteor data to geophysical parameters in real-time while also processing the
same data-stream for ionosphere D-region spectra. These science goals will be
pursued while processing for interference and satellite-returns, providing
appropriate real-time display, and archiving both original and processed data.
The proposed approach will allow full use of off-the-shelf technological
advancements such ad the wide-bandwidth/large-dynamic-range IF-sampling
receivers developed for cell-phone base-stations and cheap but powerful general-
purpose desktop/single-board computers. This hardware plus proposed algorithm
development will permit assimilation of the real-time data at the full rate thus
flexibly enabling optimal interference processing, real-time data display, and
multi-mode parallel-outcome scientific processing. The proposed development of
this flexible data-processing environment would not only prove useful to the
geophysical radar community but would also provide the same environment for
wide-bandwidth/multi-frequency radio astronomy observations at AO. This approach
would also broadly-impact other geophysical radar and radio astronomy facilities
by enabling simple adoption of this proposed low-cost general-purpose data
processing/interpretations environment.&lt;br/&gt;
