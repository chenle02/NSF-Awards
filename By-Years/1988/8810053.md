Much of the received economic analysis is concerned with markets characterized
by centralized trading. In such markets the trades are carried out at openly
announced prices and all traders have access to the same trading opportunities.
In many important markets, however, the trading process is decentralized --
prices are quoted and transactions are concluded in private meetings among
agents. This study develops a rigorous theory for this second type of market. It
will involve construction and investigation of formal models of dynamic markets
in which transactions are concluded in pairwise meetings between agents, and
where agents are asymmetrically informed about the values of underlying
parameters which will affect their eventual payoffs. This new theory of
decentralized markets and asymmetric information is used to investigate the
following questions: (1) How and to what extent is agents' information
aggregated and transmitted via the trading process? (2) How is the allocation of
resources affected by the underlying distribution of information transmission by
the market? (3) Under what circumstances can the familiar paradigm of Rational
Expectations Equilibrium (REE) be used to approximate the behavior of such
markets? The significance of this research is that it will start to close a gap
that exists in our understanding of markets. Although some important markets are
characterized by decentralized trading, e.g., real estate markets and labor
markets, to date practically the entire literature on markets with asymmetric
information has been concerned with markets characterized by centralized
trading. Preliminary work suggests that decentralized markets behave differently
than centralized markets.
