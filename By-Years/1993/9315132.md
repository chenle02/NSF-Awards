9315132 Ginter This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Marshall Ginter, Institute for Physical Science and
Technology, University of Maryland, and Professor Kojun Yamashita, Department of
Physics, Nagoya University. The joint research involves the development of next
generation soft x-ray (SXR) optical components and systems needed for such
critical areas as SXR projection lithography, third-generation synchrotron
radiation research, space platform telescopes and spectrometers, lithographic
production of micro-machine parts, microscopy, and nonsynchrotron radiation SXR
light sources. The project also involves Professor Howard Milchberg, University
of Maryland, Professor John McNeil, University of New Mexico, and Japanese
scientists at Tokyo University, Osaka University, and Tohoku University. The
research deals with various problems associated with (1) optical and physical
properties of new SXR optical materials (multilayers, etc.), (2) properties of
new SXR optical devices (imaging and projection system, microscopes, telescopes,
etc.), (3) evaluation and testing of SXR optical elements (aspheric surface
figure, roughness, etc.), and (4) improvement to intense laboratory (non-
synchrotron) SXR light sources. The U.S. and Japanese investigators' work is
complementary and the joint research will provide a unique opportunity for
mutually beneficial research. ***
