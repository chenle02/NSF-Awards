The goal of this research is to provide a better understanding of nucleation
processes, and to allow us to make accurate quantitative predictions. The
research will be in three somewhat different but complementary fields of
investigation: ion induced nucleation, nucleation of metal vapors, and
homogeneous nucleation. The P. I. has developed a new method for measuring the
ion induced nucleation rate in which all the important variables
(supersaturation, temperature, and ion density) are accurately known and all can
be readily changed. Initial measurements on n-nonane and 1-hexanol will be
repeated to decrease their uncertainty, optimize conditions and extend them to a
wider range of supersaturations and to several temperatures. Studies of more
complex substances such as those with quadropole moments or high
polarizabilities (e.g. CS2, CC14) will also be made. A second major focus will
be the homogenous nucleation of metal vapors. Metals in their dilute vapor state
are nonmetallic, resulting in a cluster size dependence of the nonmetal
transition. Nucleation studies of metals not only will enable one to study this
phenomena at temperatures far below the critical temperature (and thus at
temperatures where the change in density is essentially discontinuous), but also
will test the validity of nucleation theories on a class of substances very
different from any studied until now. The focus will be a joint effort of this
research group and a research group at Phillips University in Marburg, Germany
headed by Prof. F. Hensel and Dr. H. Uchtmann. A third focus will be continued
efforts on understanding homogeneous nucleation processes. This will include
studies on various substances over a wide range of rates, 10-6 to 101 nuclei
cm-3 s-1. Phase change form vapor to the liquid phase by nucleation plays a key
role in a wide variety.
