;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will support Dr. Milton W. Cole of the
Pennsylvania State University Park in collaboration with Dr. Susana Hernandez of
the University of Buenos Aires. The research aim is to predict the behavior of
fluids in confined geometries. These include films, carbon nanotubes and porous
media. The emphasis will be on quantum fluids but some attention will be given
to classical fluids as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will
bring together successful research groups with the U.S. side contributing their
expertise in forces and statistical mechanics associated with physically
absorbed film, while the Argentina side will contribute their expertise in many-
body theory to treat quantum films, clusters, and their
excitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
