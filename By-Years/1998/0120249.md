Xavier University of Louisiana is using a planning grant to develop a research
project aimed at understanding more about African American female students who
are drawn to and succeed in computer sciences. The research plan is to
characterize students in this group who are interested in computing sciences,
find the motivating factors of success, and classify the views they have of the
profession. Based on this research, undergraduate programs could be shaped to
increase the numbers of African American females entering undergraduate
computing sciences and encourage those in the field of study to continue through
graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xavier is developing partnerships with
other HBCUs and universities to collaborate in the future project, develop
corporate partners, develop graduate school partners (in particular those
experience with research procedures and women's issues), establish an advisory
board, and obtain definitions of roles and cooperative agreements.&lt;br/&gt;
