9204041 Watts In this project, four principal investigators with support from
five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and vorticity budgets,
and zonal volume and heat transport variability in the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC) south of Tasmania, Australia. A mix of moored current meters,
seafloor electric field recorders, and inverted echo sounders will be used in
collaboration with similar resources from scientists in Hobart, Tasmania. in
this component, the PI will oversee the construction and deployment of Inverted
Echo Sounders for measuring the first and second baroclinic modes of motion in
the ACC. ***
