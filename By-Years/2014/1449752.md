This project focuses on research instrumentation, training, and policy
implementation. The project consists of three major activities: 1) a summit of
relevant, high-level federal administrators, university leaders and others to
examine problems in and solutions for achieving compliance with Title IX, 2) an
online Title IX toolkit with technical assistance as well as a new research
instrumentation for collecting and analyzing intra-university data, and 3) the
development and dissemination of a set of Title IX best practices based on the
case study of effective implementation of Title IX in California. These
activities have the potential to advance desired societal outcomes related to
compliance with Title IX and a reduction in female STEM attrition, especially
for early career female scientists and engineers.
