Funds are provided to support a benthic-focused measurements program in the
northern Bering Sea that extends and expands a twenty-year effort in that
region. The northern benthic biological communities are known to provide food
resources for benthic-feeding apex predators that include gray whales, bearded
seals, walruses, and diving sea-ducks, all of which are used by subsistence-
based communities along the Bering Sea coast. Previous work indicates that
climate warming may change the present benthic-dominated northern Bering Sea
ecosystem to one that is more pelagic and similar to the southern Bering Sea
food web. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators will document
benthic infaunal community composition and biomass as a means to determine key
indicator species that should be monitored to evaluate climate change impacts on
the Bering Sea ecosystem. In addition, they will undertake analyses of sediment
indicators of status and trends in ecosystem health, including sediment grain
size, oxygen demand, chlorophyll inventories, organic carbon content and stable
carbon isotope ratios of sediment organic carbon, and inventories of
atmospherically-derived, particle-reactive radionuclides (7Be) and clay-
associated radionuclides (137Cs). All of these can be used as ecosystem
indicators of recent particle deposition, sediment processing, and the overall
fertility of overlying waters. They will integrate these new data with the
extensive record for the region. These data will help interpret data collected
by collaborators, with other funding, concerning marine mammals. It will also
serve a important constraints on the models being developed for the region, both
within the BEST and BSIERP programs.&lt;br/&gt;
