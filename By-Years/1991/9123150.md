9123150 Kundu This project will determine the frequency of maximum correlation
of the solar microwave flux with the total solar irradiance, and to obtain
statistical evidence regarding the sources of the correlation. The goals are to
overcome some of the failure of the 2800 MHz microwave flux to provide adequate
proxy data for irradiance measurements, and to use the additional information in
multi-frequency data to reveal the physical reasons for the presence or absence
of certain correlations. Using the solar flux data at 1000, 2000, 3750 and 9400
MHz from Toyokawa Observatory, along with the 2800 MHz flux data from Ottawa,
the PI will correlate the microwave observations with irradiance measurements
obtained by The Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) aboard the
Solar Maximum Mission (SMM). The project will model the microwave flux spectrum
in the 1000-9400 MHz range in order to extract its principal (sunspot, coronal
and chromospheric) components. Using the known associations of these spectral
components with optical observations, the PI will obtain their relative
normalizations so that the components may be identified from the microwave
measurements alone. Finally, the PI will obtain the optimum functional
relationships by which the microwave flux spectrum can be used as a proxy for
solar irradiance. ***
