The equipment that we are requesting will aid us in evaluation of processed
semiconductor material. A high performance mask-aligner is requested to support
research in microwave plasma etching of sub- micron structures and microwave
plasma thin-film deposition of oxides and diamond. The aligner is necessary to
allow our microwave etching work to proceed into the sub-micron feature size
regime.
