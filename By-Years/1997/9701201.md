Non-technical Abstract IBN-9701201 PI: Bradbury, Jack; Danzger, Marc UC San
Diego Title: "Dissertation Research: Causes and consequences of asymmetric sound
fields in animal communication" Studies of acoustically mediated mate choice,
including previous studies of the sage grouse, have concentrated on the role of
spectral and temporal signal composition as predictors of mating success. Using
a technique that we developed for the study of acoustic radiation, researchers
have identified another acoustic trait that almost certainly has strong fitness
consequences. Preliminary results of pilot data taken last spring reveal starkly
asymmetric and directional sound radiation fields unlike any previously observed
in a vertebrate. These results also strongly suggest that male sage grouse have
a novel and remarkable mechanism to control this directionality. The research
proposed here is designed to further elucidate the mechanism of sage grouse
vocalization radiation and pattern manipulation in the context of male sage
grouse mating success. .
