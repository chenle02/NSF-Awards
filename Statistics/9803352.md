This project involves research in computed tomography, generalized Shannon
sampling theory, and applications of sampling theory in tomography. Computed
tomography is an imaging technique which reconstructs a density function from a
large number of its line integrals. Ordinary tomography is not local:
reconstruction at a point requires integrals over lines far from that point. For
a number of applications it is highly desirable if only integrals over lines
intersecting some region of interest need to be used ("region-of-interest
tomography"). A special case is local tomography where the region of interest
may be arbitrarily small. Local tomographic reconstructions recover some but not
all properties of the original density function. Sampling theorems provide exact
interpolation formulas for bandlimited functions and play a fundamental role in
signal processing. In tomography sampling theorems are used to identify
efficient data collection schemes allowing for maximum resolution in the
reconstructed image, as well as for error analysis of reconstruction algorithms.
If, as is the case in tomography and other applications, sampling theorems are
applied to non-bandlimited functions, interpolation is no longer exact and a so-
called aliasing error occurs. The usefulness of sampling theorems for such
functions depends on the availability of good estimates for this error.

The goals of this project are development and numerical analysis of high-
resolution reconstruction algorithms and development of a software package for
region-of-interest tomography including local tomography; investigation of
optimal sampling in three-dimensional local tomography; derivation of new error
estimates for the aliasing error; and exploration of a generalization of the
sampling concept in the framework of locally compact abelian groups which
provides a unified view of diverse applications such as non-equidistant
sampling, numerical integration, multisensor deconvolution, and filter banks.
