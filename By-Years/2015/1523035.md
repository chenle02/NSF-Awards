The recipients will organize a two-day workshop to bring together principal
investigators, senior personnel, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from
2013 and 2014 Coastal SEES cohorts to interact and exchange ideas with each
other and external experts. The intention of the workshop overall is to provide
a venue to exchanging information and ideas regarding current
Coastal&lt;br/&gt;SEES projects, as well as discuss and identify new
collaborations for future work, enhance interdisciplinary collaboration in
coastal sustainability research, and identify gaps and challenges for addressing
coastal sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal SEES projects are
especially complex in that each project involves typically multiple science
disciplines and/or engineering, as well as some component that focuses on the
human dimension of the sustainability problem. In addition, most projects
identify a pathway through which scientific progress can be translated to
practical outcomes, such as more informed decision making. The need for a
principal investigators meeting to exchange ideas and best practices for dealing
with this complexity was anticipated in the program solicitation, which
instructed the investigators to plan to attend such a meeting. This award covers
very modest costs for the organization and logistics of the meeting.
