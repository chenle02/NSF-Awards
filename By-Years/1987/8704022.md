Isolation of a Receptor for a Fungal-Wall-Derived Elicitor of Phytoalexins: The
long term goal of the research described in this proposal is the isolation and
characterization of a hepta-B-glucoside receptor from soybean tissue. Fungal-
derived B-glucans of the type from which the hepta-B-glucoside was isolated are
active as inducers or enhancers of a variety of defense mechanisms in both
plants and animals. No receptor for oligosaccharide(s) of this type has been
isolated from any source. The only biologically active B-glucan fragment that
has been purified to homogeneity and structurally characterized is a hepta-B-
glucoside that is active at nanomolar concentrations in stimulating phytoalexin
(antibiotic) accumulation in soybean tissue. The specific goals for the initial
period of funding are to identify the most suitable soybean tissue from which to
isolate the receptor for the active hepta-B-glucoside elicitor, to prepare
various derivatives of the hepta-B-glucoside elicitor and to compare their
biological activity with that of the native elicitor. These derivatives will be
used to prepare (i) radiolabeled elicitor for ligand-binding studies, (ii)
photo-affinity labeling reagents for receptor localization and identification
studies, and (iii) affinity chromatography matrices for receptor purification.
Time permitting, the elicitor derivatives will be used to initiate studies to
identify putative receptors in plant extracts. Phytoalexin accumulation is
believed to play an important role in plant disease resistance and also is an
excellent model system for studying the regulation of gene expression in plants.
Purification of the hepta-B-glucoside receptor is necessary before studies can
be undertaken to identify the role the receptor(s) play in the signal pathway
that results in altered gene expression leading to phytoalexin accumulation in
affected plant cells. The research should increase our understanding of how
plants perceive invasive microorganisms and how the recognition leads to
activation of specific plant defenses.
