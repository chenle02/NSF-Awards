An electronic network based at Washington State University which will link high
school chemistry teachers in the Northwest is the focus of this project.
Specific features include a Bulletin Board which will disseminate information on
meetings, workshops, conferences, publications, safety information, etc., and a
conferencing capability through which network members can discuss bulletin board
items, exchange ideas, and promote activities such as a Demonstration of the
Month. The network will be designed as a Wide Area Network reaching isolated and
underprepared teachers, and will have the capability of itself being linked to a
larger electronic network such as NSFNet for future networking of the teachers
with scientists and teachers outside the region.
