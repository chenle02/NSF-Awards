Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under
Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Program recommends an award of $91,780 for the purchase of the
following:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) SEAL 408 accessory equipment $60,218
&lt;br/&gt;2) Science system IT upgrades $31,562 &lt;br/&gt; $91,780
