9361386 Stormon This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program
serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III
is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This Phase I project studies the feasibility of using a
programm able content-addressable memory as an efficient hardware implementation
of data compression/decompression. The project concentrates on the loss less
compression techniques essential for network applications.***
