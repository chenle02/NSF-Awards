This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and Belgian
scientists in the area of development and characterization of conjugated
polymers. The U.S. investigators are Drs. A.J. Heeger and Fred Wudl, University
of California, Santa Barbara. The Belgian collaborator is Professor Jean-Luc
Bredas, University of Mons. The joint project will focus on the following three
topics: 1) development and characterization of new polymer materials with small
band gaps (2) evaluation of the electronic properties of soluble conducting
polymers and (3) the role of charged nonlinear excitations (solitons, polarons
and bipolarons) in the nonlinear optical properties of conjugated polymers. The
investigators have a history of successful collaboration, based on their
complementary expertise. Dr. Bredas has a background in quantum chemistry and
has made outstanding contributions to the theory of quasi-one- dimensional
solids and in particular to conducting polymers. The U.S. researchers have
carried out leading experimental investigations in the area of highly conducting
organic solids. The results of the proposed project will contribute to increased
understanding of this important area of materials research, which has many
potential industrial applications.
