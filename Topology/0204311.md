The monumental work of W. Thurston has shown the fundamental importance of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds within the study of 3- manifolds. The proposer plans to
work on a hard open problem in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to
attempt to strengthen connections between number theory and the study of
invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The hard open question is the problem of
finding the closed hyperbolic 3-manifold of minimum volume. The proposer,
working jointly with D. Gabai and P. Milley, and in consultation with N.
Thurston, has a computer-based scheme to attack this problem. The computational
aspects of the approach are interesting in their own right. The connection
between number theory/algebraic K-theory and invariants of hyperbolic
3-manifolds is well-known, but a new approach to understanding it is proposed.
Specifically, a new method for computing the Chern-Simons invariant of a
hyperbolic 3-manifold might lead to interesting properties of the dilogarithm
function.

Almost 200 years ago, J. Bolyai, C. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky revolutionized
mathematics by claiming that a legitimate geometry could be constructed by
taking the five classical postulates of Euclid and negating the fifth postulate
(the parallel postulate). Further, they theorized that this new and mysterious
non-Euclidean geometry (now called "hyperbolic geometry") would have important
applications. Their theorizing has been borne out: hyperbolic geometry is
vitally important in the modern study of geometry. For example, hyperbolic
geometry turns out to be much more important than Euclidean geometry in the
study of "3-dimensional manifolds" (our 3-dimensional Universe is an example of
a 3-dimensional manifold). As another example, it is quite possible that our
Universe adheres to the laws of non-Euclidean geometry rather than the laws of
Euclidean geometry. The proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai and P. Milley,
and in consultation with N. Thurston, plans to work on a computer-based approach
to solving one of the hardest and most fundamental problems about hyperbolic
3-manifolds: finding the smallest one. In addition, the proposer will try to
strengthen the already existing connection between hyperbolic 3-manifolds and
number theory. The history of mathematics has borne out the importance of
finding strong connections between (supposedly) disparate areas of mathematics.
