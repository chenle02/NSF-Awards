9707195 Ho This project aims to use variable low temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy operating under ultrahigh vacuum conditions to induce and view
directly the dissociation and formation of chemical bonds with atomic resolution
of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. Chemistry is reduced to studying single
molecules in isolation, including the structure and reactivity of individual
bonds in a molecule, and as other molecules are brought to the isolated molecule
one at a time. The overall complexity encountered in an ensemble of many
interacting molecules will be removed and added in a controlled way. %%% This
investigation will provide important advances in our understanding of chemical
and biological systems. The study of the intrinsic properties of single
molecules (isolated from intermolecular or collective or environmental effects)
and their controlled interactions and reactions with other molecules is relevant
to the advancement of emerging technologies such as those based on electronic
and optical nanostructured materials. ***
