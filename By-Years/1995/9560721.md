This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a design/feasibility
study of accelerating focusing Rectangular Cavity Periodic Structures and
Rectangular Cavity Biperiodic Structures (RCBS)to determine their applicability
for commercial uses. Those applications range from Race Track Microtrons (RTM)
to electron positron linear colliders as well as for microwave power devices. A
70 MeV compact RTM will be used as a practical test bed to first reduce concepts
ideas to practice. A biperiodic on axis coupled rectangular accelerating
structure with circular beam holes will be explored. This provides a significant
simplification in RTM construction. This RCBS also has a higher effective shunt
impedance than previous structures and quadrupole like focusing so it is an
accelerating focusing system which, if proved in simulation and hardware, can
also be used to good effect in linacs and linear colliders. Recent efforts in
particle accelerator design have focused on improving existing accelerating
structures, searching for more compact structures, and developing structures
with better electrodynamic characteristics. Commercial applications of
rectangular cavity structures are apparent for (1) electron-positron linear
colliders, (2) electron LINear ACcelerators, (3) mobile Race Track Microtrons,
and (4) power microwave devices.
