1511216 (Narayanaswamy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel laser-based, accurate
technique is proposed for measuring temperature in fuel burning devices, such as
within an engine. The technique is of significance as precise knowledge of the
temperature help design more energy-efficient devices with the potential to
reduce pollutant emissions. The research will involve graduate students, while
the outreach efforts will benefit K-12 education, especially in STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By adding
a tracer amount of inert gas krypton to the combustion flow field, the PI
proposes to develop a non-intrusive spectroscopic thermometry technique that has
advantages over the other laser-based techniques developed so far. First and
foremost, it does not require prior information about local chemical
composition, as it is the dual fluorescence excitation of the argon species,
rather than other reactive or intermediate species, that determines the local
temperature. Second the proposed technique provides excellent temperature
sensitivity across the combustion regime. Finally, it can be matured into a
superior ground testing tool in large-scale facilities. A dual excitation
fluorescence imaging leverages the Doppler and collisional broadening of the
absorption spectrum to determine the temperature.
