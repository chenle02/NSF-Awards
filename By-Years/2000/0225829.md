The project is extending work on isotopic fractionation of nitrous oxide and
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for the purpose of elucidating the budgets and
the processes that contribute to the sources and sinks of these greenhouse
gases. A combination of two- and three-dimensional models are being applied to
relate the observed atmospheric isotopic fractionations to various biospheric
processes that will help constrain the values of their sources and sinks. This
work is contributing to the understanding of two atmospheric trace gases that
are likely to play a major role in future climate change.
