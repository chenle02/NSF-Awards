9614060 Mead Reliability assessment of semiconductor diode laser devices will be
important for qualification of device performance over extended periods and in
challenging environmental settings. Contemporary methods of estimating device
reliability are typically limited to empirical formulas such as the Arrhenius
expression. These methods are often vendor specific and do not provide
significant insight into environmental factors that most affect longevity and
reliable operation of over long periods. This research will investigate a method
for non-destructively assessing degradation of diode laser facets using the
optical spectra of the device and phonon spectra in the region of interest. ***
