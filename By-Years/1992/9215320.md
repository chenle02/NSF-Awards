This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. During the tenure of this forty-month
continuing grant, Professor Jorgenson and his students will carry out research
in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with specific thrusts in three areas.
First, two-dimensional separations protocols involving hybrid liquid
chromatography - cze techniques will be explored; second, new post-column
reaction/fluorescence detection protocols will be developed to expand the
versatility of cze-based analytical techniques; and third, a new approach to
high resolution cze which utilizes electroosmotically counterbalanced
electrophoresis (ECE) will be developed and refined. This project builds upon
research carried out by Professor Jorgenson and his students under NSF grant
CHE-8912926. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of this project will
provide strongly enabling analytical tools that will be applicable to a broad
spectrum of chemical, environmental, and biological problems.
