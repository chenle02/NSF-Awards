A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and
research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their
students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for
research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a
community and generational appreciation for the role of science and mathematics
in workforce preparation and addressing quality-of-life issues. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the degree-granting
capacity of a TCU, bringing upper division STEM educational opportunities within
reach (geographically, socially, and financially) for residents of the Turtle
Mountain Reservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turtle Mountain Community College
(TMCC) will develop an accredited BS in environmental science to its slate of
educational offerings, and will include the recruitment of veterans and K-12
students by inclusion in outreach and research, thereby increasing the interest
in and appreciation of STEM as a career option in a rural, economically
disadvantaged region. Increasing the number of STEM faculty will significantly
increase the level and volume of research that can be conducted at or by the
college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
