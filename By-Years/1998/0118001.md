Summary: This proposal requests support to test new observations indicating that
the current model for deep water circulation patterns and structure derived from
studies of the last glacial maximum are not typical of most Pleistocene glacial
intervals. Preliminary results suggest that, in contrast to the established
conveyor belt model, Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Norwegian Sea Overflow Water
(NSOW) continued to form albeit with different d13C signatures during many
Pleistocene glacials. The concept will be tested by developing multiproxy data
sets forming depth transects of the North Atlantic at three time intervals to
map conditions at different depths and between sediment drift sites (path of
NSOW) and non-sediment drift sites (path of LSW). &lt;br/&gt;
