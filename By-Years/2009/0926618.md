The research objective of this project is for the development of novel numerical
techniques to solve computationally hard mathematical problems in combinatorial
optimization that have relevant applications in network design, compressed
sensing, sensor networks and biology. The developed techniques will be used to
increase the scalability of problems solved in these research areas.
Specifically, the research will develop innovative techniques to produce a
specific but vital decomposition structure, branch decompositions, for
mathematical structures called matroids and symmetric submodular set functions
that are used to mathematically model these problems. To this end, the developed
techniques will be compared with other exact algorithms in the literature to
validate and assess the computational efficacy of the
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If successful, the results will increase the
scalability and efficiency of solving the problems of interest. Applications of
these problems are in fields seeing increased demand for services. In addition,
the results can be used to solve other related computationally hard problems in
combinatorial optimization that have a wide range of applications apart from the
aforementioned applications. Thus, the results will advance the knowledge base
in combinatorial optimization and offer new effective techniques for solving
large-scale problems in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
