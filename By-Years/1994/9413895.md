The Academic Research Infrastructure Program will fund a new up-to-date X-ray
Diffraction Facility for X-ray structure analysis in the areas of materials
synthesis, biochemistry, and inorganic and polymer chemistry. The facility,
consisting a dedicated single crystal instrument and a
polymers/materials/general diffraction instrument, will provide new capabliities
at U. Florida not presently available including: 1) a cooling system for single
crystal data collection, 2) a high temperature sample holder for fluid samples,
3) a Charge-Coupled-Device area detector system optimized for single crystal
diffraction, 4) a high sensitivity gas filled area detector optimized for
diffraction of polymers, fibers, and thin films, 5) a user facility for small
angle scattering and a staging area for synchrotron studies, 6) software and
hardware for full structure determination of molecules containing up to 350 non-
hydrogen atoms. The facility will be employed for the study of non-equilibrium
processes in order-disorder alloys, real time crystallization in metals, domaain
structures in incommensurate materials; correlating structure to membrane
permeability and enzymatic cleavage of small peptides; catalysts for olefin
metathesis and polymerization; induced layer ordering in polymer thin films;
synthesis of tungsten nitrene complexes; electrohemical synthesis of highly
ordered polyheterocycles; synthesis of metallaaromatics and complexes of tropyne
and cyclooctatrienyne; study of reversible crosslinks in polymers; determination
of structure of new pentanary alloys of semiconductors; study of high-oxidation
state organic conductors and superconductors and iorganic extended lattice
monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett films. New X-ray instrumentation, including
modern state of the art area detectors and software and hardware for structural
determination of complex structures, will be employed in a variety of areas for
the study of the structure of new materials, the study of biochemical systems,
and the study of a va riety of inoganic and polymer chemistry systems.
