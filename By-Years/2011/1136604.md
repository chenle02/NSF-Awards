The more than 16,000 recognized species of annelid worms exhibit immense
morphological diversity and include such distinct groups as fireworms,
earthworms, bloodworms, and leeches. As sediment feeders, scavengers, and
predators, annelids occupy terrestrial and aquatic habitats worldwide and are
the most abundant fauna (larger than 1 millimeter) in the deep sea, Earth's most
extensive habitat. Annelids have economic importance as bait, pests, invasive
species (e.g., oyster borers) and ecosystem engineers. Nonetheless, many
fundamental questions about annelids remain unresolved because knowledge of
their diversity and evolutionary history is lacking. To fill this gap, this
international project will assemble the annelid family tree using a large-scale,
multi-tiered approach. The oldest relationships will be examined with high-
throughput DNA genome sequencing techniques. Recent relationships will be
resolved with multi-gene DNA approaches and a community-based sequencing service
that will examine approximately 3000 species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of
the few segmented phyla, annelids are integral to understanding animal
evolution. This project has significant interdisciplinary implications in fields
such as developmental biology, paleontology, marine biology, physiology and
evolution. Specimens, data, and educational resources will be publicly
available. Extensive human resource development includes training more than 25
undergraduates, 5 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral researchers at four
institutions, and recruitment of underrepresented groups. K-12 outreach will
foster broad scientific participation.
