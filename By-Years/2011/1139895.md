This project supports an international symposium to promote the participation of
women and girls in science, including participants from countries that do not
have significant collaborative activities with the US, developing countries in
Africa and the Middle East, as well as countries that seek to advance women's
roles in STEM research. Participants will gain skills, establish virtual
networks, and bring back knowledge to their communities that will in turn
increase future collaborative opportunities for US scientists.
