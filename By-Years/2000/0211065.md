The objective of this research by Professor Terrence J. Collins at Carnegie-
Mellon University, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Oganometallic Chemistry Program, is to develop tetraamidomacrocyclic iron(III)
complexes (TAML activators) in conjunction with hydrogen peroxide to destroy
chemical and biological warfare agents on contaminated surfaces. These agents
include organophosphorous ester nerve gases such as, such as Sarin and VX,
mustard (alkylating) compounds and biological agents including bacteria, virus,
and toxins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
supports the development of a widely-applicable decontaminating process to
eliminate various chemical and biological warfare agents including viruses and
bacteria, such as anthrax, that have been or may be used in
terrorism.&lt;br/&gt;
