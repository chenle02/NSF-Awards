9319601 Lee Humans can learn complex movement skills that involve coordination
of the entire body. This project will study three aspects of how the brain
learns to coordinate a complex action that requires standing human subjects to
pull accurately on a handle without losing balance. The horizontal body motions
of individuals skilled at this motion resemble those of an inverted pendulum
controlled by an elastic cord and a pulley. First it will be determined how
subjects learn this pendulum - like coordination and if the pendulum model fits
vertical body motion as well. Second, it will be determined whether the
stiffness of the body (like the elasticity of the cord) decreases with learning,
and if so, whether decreased stiffness is due to lower simultaneous activation
of agonist and antagonist muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Third, it will be
determined if the number of independently - moving joints increases with
learning, and how the brain alters muscle activity patterns to mediate changes
in joint movement. The results of this study will provide a basis of later
studies of the brain structures that contribute to the learning of coordination.
