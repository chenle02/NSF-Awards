9309805 Holekamp Drs. Holekamp and Smale will continue their field study of
behavioral development in free- living spotted hyenas. Their goals are (1) to
initiate study of the hormonal correlates of aggressive and sexual behaviors in
this species as these change at puberty and during adult breeding cycles, and
(2) to evaluate effects of social rank on reproduction. The animals being
studied are members of one large hyena clan in the Masai Mara National Reserve,
Kenya. Age, sex, kin relations, and social status are known for all clan
members, and detailed social histories are known for all cubs and subadults
currently present in the population. Using observational study, radio telemetry,
and laboratory analyses of hormone levels in various biological fluids produced
by the study animals, Drs. Holekamp and Smale will collect longitudinal
behavioral and hormonal data from both pubertal and adult animals. Endocrine and
behavioral data will be used together to test hypotheses about mechanisms by
which social rank influences reproductive performance. While the study of
reproduction is being initiated, observational and telemetric data-collection
will also continue germane to understanding both male dispersal and reproductive
success in both sexes. This research project will generate useful information in
at least four ways: It will (1) contribute importantly to elucidation of
carnivore reproductive biology, (2) provide detailed data on behavioral
development and reproductive endocrinology of animals experiencing the full
complexity of their natural habitat, (3) enhance understanding of the
relationship between hormones and aggressive behavior in female mammals, and (4)
yield valuable comparative data revealing how physiological, developmental,
functional, and phylogenetic factors interact to shape mammalian social
behavior.
