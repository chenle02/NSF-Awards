Conjugated polymers are strongly absorbing and highly reflecting throughout the
infrared when doped to their conducting form. Conducting polymers are,
therefore, ideal for use as infrared polarizers. A novel method to fabricate
mechanically robust composite polymer films, oriented by tensile drawing and
containing a desired fraction of doped conjugated polymers, for use as
polarizers in the mid- and far infrared. UNIAX will fabricate uniform, thin,
aligned films by gel-processing conducting polymer composites to produce stable,
doped films with polarization rejection ratio suitable for spectroscopic work.
During Phase I, the infrared-optical density and the infrared- dichroism of the
oriented polyethylene/conducting polymer blends will be independently controlled
and characterized, and the stability of the resulting infrared polarizers will
be tested.
