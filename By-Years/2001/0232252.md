This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
innovative, grid-free, numerical models of two-phase, particulate,
incompressible turbulent flows. The intent is to provide a high fidelity model
for the simulation and analysis of numerous environmental and industrial flow
applications wherein particulate motion is a critical feature. Among the
potential benefits are more accurate and timely predictions of health hazards
and abatement strategies for the late-time dynamics of toxic particulates or
contaminant clouds arising from routine, accidental or purposeful chemical and
biological releases. This work will be applicable to the dynamics of pollutants
in the atmosphere, particulate flows in liquids, two-phase turbulent mixing and
particulate dispersion, among others. &lt;br/&gt; This revolutionary technology
will expand its potential computational fluid dynamics (CFD) market share by
extending its capabilities to treat complex flows which are of great importance
to including: aircraft manufacturing, automobile manufacturing and power
generation. &lt;br/&gt;
