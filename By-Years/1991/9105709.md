The principal investigator will develop laser and ion microprobe techniques for
microanalysis of stable isotope ratios. He will apply these to micron-scale
zoning in high grade metamorphic rocks. Principle goals of the study are to
document the extent of isotopic zonation in metamorphic rocks and to elucidate
the causes of such heterogeneity. Such work will have significant impact on
theories regarding the movement of fluid in the Earth's crust, as well as
granulite genesis, geothermometry, and cooling/uplift history.
