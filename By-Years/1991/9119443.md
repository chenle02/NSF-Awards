Tekalp Artifacts due to involuntary patient motion have been a major source of
image degradation in 2-D and 3-D Fourier Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for
many years. These artifacts, often called "ghosts," manifest themselves as a
series of repeated and blurred versions of some features in the patient. Most of
the contemporary methods which account for motion effects require additional
hardware or instrumentation to monitor the patient motion. This research is
examining novel signal/image processing methods for the detection and correction
of motion artifacts in MRI by means of postprocessing of the motion-corrupted
raw MR data. The research entails modeling (mathematically) the data acquisition
process in the presence of arbitrary patient motion, the development of
signal/image enhancement algorithms based on the resulting model, and their
verification with controlled MRI experiments as well as clinical MRI data. A
major advantage of the proposed methods is that they can be implemented in
software and do not require any additional hardware installation to existing
systems.
