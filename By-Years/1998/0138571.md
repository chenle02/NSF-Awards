The Morton Arboretum has received a grant from the National Science Foundation
to modernize its Herbarium. The grant will provide for installation of a new
compactor shelving system, thereby providing greater accessibility and use of
the collections by scientists and public users. The 155,000+ specimens of
vascular plants are currently housed in 116 cabinets that are filled to
capacity. A backlog of another 7,500 plants is stored in boxes. Approximately
4,500 specimens are added to the Herbarium annually. The new system will
guarantee long-term accessibility and improved care of the specimens and will
increase the Herbarium's storage capacity by more than 50%.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased pressure is being placed on the Herbarium to
make specimens and herbarium data available owing to 1) greater use by
botanists, conservation scientists, land stewards, and students and 2) continued
and extensive vouchering of specimens resulting from Arboretum research in
taxonomy, conservation, and arboriculture. To provide greater use of and access
to these collections and to responsibly curate them, a modernized herbarium is
critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major plant collections housed in the Herbarium
include: plants of the Chicago region's globally significant ecosystems, rare
plants of the Midwest, plants of the greater Yellowstone area, several important
historical collections, and a fine collection of lichens and basidiomycetes. The
Morton Arboretum's Herbarium is the third largest of any arboretum in North
America. This significance has resulted in a major National Leadership Grant
from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to the
Arboretum to develop a digital herbarium (www.vPlants.org) that includes Chicago
regional flora housed at The Morton Arboretum, the Field Museum of Natural
History, and the Chicago Botanic Garden. The award from NSF will complement that
from IMLS, resulting in a premier botanical resource in the mid-continent US.
