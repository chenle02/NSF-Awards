9512284 Collins This is an award to provide support for purchase of analytical
equipment to be used in support of Clarkson University's environmental
engineering program. The research equipment obtained through this award will
provide enhanced analytical capability to five investigators who are conducting
research on long-term environmental effects on land to which sludges derived
from treatment of domestic wastewater are applied, dynamic fluid- particle
interactions on contaminant phase partitioning in aqueous systems, incineration
of Kraft process pulp and paper- making sludges, thermal desorption for
remediation of "manufactured" gas plant sites, metabolism of trichlorethylene in
suspended growth bioreactors, and entrapment and dissolution of nonaqueous phase
liquids in heterogeneous media. The proposal leading to this award was submitted
in response to the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation Development and
Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 94-156, Academic Research Infrastructure Program.
Results of this award are expected to improve the accessibility of modern
research instrumentation for use by this institution's faculty in conducting
research on important topics of environmental significance and in educating
students. ***
