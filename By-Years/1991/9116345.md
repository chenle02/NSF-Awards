This award provides modest funding for the continuation of the series of
midwestern regional conferences focusing on developments in the theory of
partial differential equations. The meetings, which began in 1977, are held at
various institutions, growing in size from 60 faculty and graduate students to
over 100 in 1990. The conferences last two days, featuring two distinguished
speakers from outside the area with approximately six other talks interspersed.
The recommendation to renew support is based first on the exceptional strength
of U.S. research in partial differential equations concentrated in the midwest
as well as on the opportunity the meetings provide to young investigators in
developing experience and acquaintances in this thriving area at little cost.
Indeed, except for travel costs for the outside speakers, all of the funds will
be used to help defray expenses for graduate students and postdoctoral
associates.//
