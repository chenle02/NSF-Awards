9304937 Livingston The yeast RAD52 gene plays a central role in chromosome
maintenance. Its importance is illustrated by the severe defects mutant cells
have in repairing damaged DNA, recombining chromosomes, and in completing
melotic division. The role of the protein product has not been defined. This
project is examining the genetics of RAD52. The study begins with the
characterization of temperature-sensitive alleles, which we have isolated,
having defects in either DNA repair or chromosome recombination. These mutants
are then used to find extragenic suppressors. Such suppressors will identify
other genes whose products interact with Rad52p, the protein product of RAD52.
The temperature-sensitive alleles, as well as a truncation allele which is able
to sporulate, are next used to study the role of Rad52p in meiosis. Molecular
studies include an examination of protein-protein interactions: between Rad52p
polypeptide selected through a fusion library of yeast proteins. Another
molecular study includes the examination of the extent with which the
temperature-sensitive and other recombination-proficient RAD52 mutants resect
double strand breaks in vivo. %%% This research is concerned with two processes
important to all organisms: genetic recombination and repair of DNA. ***
