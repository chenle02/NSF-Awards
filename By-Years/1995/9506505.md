9506505 Yates This research looks to extend the application of power control in
mobile cellular communications to multihop CDMA packet radio networks. Using
soft interference constraints derived from signal to interference ratio
measurements, distributed power control algorithms will be studied which adapt
to changes in the radio link quality, actively regulate the network topology,
achieve desired end-to-end throughput objectives, and integrate power control
and multihop routing. ***
