the US Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) which is part of the world-wide MAB
Program. Overall, MAB promotes the study of the interrelationships of the
Earth's human and natural systems. MAB has an integrated, interdisciplinary,
problem-focused research approach. The mission of the US MAB Program is to
foster harmonious relationships between humans and the biosphere through
domestic and international cooperation and interdisciplinary research,
education, biosphere reserves, and information exchange. A National Committee
established in 1974 by the Department of State and composed of representatives
from supporting federal agencies and state and private institutions guides the
development of the national research, education, and training activities.
