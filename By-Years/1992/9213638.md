This award provides one-half the funds necessary for the acquisition of
equipment to automate the sample preparation at the University of Arizona
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) facility. The University of Arizona is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The University of Arizona AMS
facility is the principal U.S. laboratory for the analysis of radiocarbon at
very low concentration or in very small samples available to the research
community in the geosciences, anthropology, and archaeology. The equipment
upgrade is intended to increase the capability of the facility to analyze
samples from 1500 per year (current capacity) to approximately 2500 per year.
