9707426 Bridgham The aims of this research are to investigate interactions
between plant community composition, whole-ecosystem C budgets, and energy
balance in northern peatlands. The central hypothesis of the research is that
climate forcing of heat loading and water table depth will determine plant
community and ecosystem structure, which in turn will have a feedback effect on
the energy budget of the system. The research plan involves a continuation of
ongoing research in a unique series of whole-system microcosm experiments that
include manipulations of temperature and water regimes. Processes to measured
include the major carbon, water and energy fluxes, which will be incorporated
into an ecosystem simulation model. Understanding the feedbacks and interactions
among the processes to be studied are a high priority not only in the arena of
global change but also in the broader arena of biodiversity/community structure
effects on ecosystem functions. The site of the research is in northern
Minnesota.
