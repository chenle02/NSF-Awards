Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a programming methodology designed for solving
combinatorial search problems, where the goal is to find a solution among a
finite but very large number of possibilities. Such problems are common in
science and technology. In safety-critical applications of ASP it is important
to have a higher level of confidence in the correctness of software than can be
achieved by merely applying it to many test cases; mathematical methods must be
used to prove with complete certainty that the program finds the correct answer
in every possible case. This project develops such mathematical
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early days of ASP, the input languages of
answer set solvers had a simple semantics based on the concept of a stable
model. But many constructs added over the years to the language of ASP because
programmers found them useful cannot be explained in terms of stable models in
the sense of the original definition of that concept or its straightforward
generalizations. Manuals written by the designers of answer set solvers explain
the meaning of these programming constructs using examples and informal comments
that appeal to the user's intuition, without references to any precise
semantics. The first goal of this project is to characterize the semantics of
ASP in a mathematically precise way using an extension of stable models to
logical formulas with infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. Second, this
semantics is used for verifying the correctness of ASP programs and optimization
methods. The broader impacts of this work include collaboration with other
research groups for dissemination, validation and adoption of the research
results, and integration of the research into graduate education.
