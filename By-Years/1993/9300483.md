Detailed design, initiated in Phase I, of a laboratory prototype of a fully
automatic, fiber-fed astronomical spectrograph will be completed during this
Phase II effort. The spectrograph will then be fabricated and laboratory
experiments will be conducted with it to determine if the system performs as
predicted during the Phase I study, and which of several key components work
best. Based on the results of these laboratory experiments, the laboratory
prototype will be appropriately modified, and the spectrograph will be evaluated
via fully automated spectrographic observations of stars as part of ongoing
scientific research programs of several typical research astronomers.
