This project will address the question of how phytoplankton may impact on the
thermal structure and circulation of the upper ocean, and its subsequent effect
on the Earth's climate via the absorption of solar radiation and modification of
the surface albedo. The approach employs radiative-transfer models, mixed layer
and radiative-convective models, ocean and climate general circulation models,
and satellite imagery of phytoplankton chlorophyllous pigments. Forcing by
phytoplankton will be specified using satellite-derived chlorophyll
concentrations derived from existing bio-optical algorithms. The experiments are
expected to lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms generating sea
surface temperatures and their influence on the
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to result in an improved
understanding of predicting climate change due to carbon dioxide. One graduate
student will be supported.
