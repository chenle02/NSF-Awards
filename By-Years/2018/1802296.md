This award is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded
by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. A species' ability to
withstand sudden changes in the environment is limited by internal and external
factors. In this project, researchers from the US and India, using zebrafish as
a model, join forces to identify the specific mechanisms by which populations
undergo rapid shifts in behavior. This in an integrated project as the research
team will conduct an ecological and genomic survey of Indian fish in the wild,
and then transport fish to laboratories in the US for detailed tests of sensory
ability. In addition, new statistical methods will be developed to predict the
impact of genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms on the ability of
zebrafish to adapt to sudden change. The results are expected to yield insight
into the relative importance of genomic, physiological, and habitat constraints.
Statistical and software tools to predict the impact of pollution and climate
change on the survival of key organisms will be disseminated broadly to other
researchers via the internet. The research will also increase basic knowledge on
the behavior and ecology of zebrafish, a model organism used commonly in
biomedical research. The collaborative team includes a third-grade teacher who
will use internet videoconferencing to add an international component to
classroom exercises based on this research.
