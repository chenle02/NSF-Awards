The objective of the proposed workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating
information and sharing ideas about the frontiers of Food Safety research,
education, and technology transfer. The workshop will discuss the current state-
of-the-art and future potential of Food Safety Technology, analyze the gaps
between the future potential and the present reality, and identify what needs to
be done in the areas of research, education, and technology transfer in order to
close the gaps. This workshop will be a two-day event on October 29-30, 2014 in
Alexandria, Virginia. The workshop will cover four themes: 1) Processes, 2).
Global Trends, 3). Packaging, and 4). Supply Network Risk Management. Each
speaker, who is an expert on the presentation topic, will introduce the state-
of-the-art of a specific topic area as well as present his/her views on the
future directions and needs in that area. This workshop will have up to 75
participants, including the speakers and moderators to be invited and other
stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The ideas presented by the
speakers and generated from the discussion sessions will be summarized in the
final project report. This report will be delivered to all workshop participants
and relevant funding agencies as well as disseminated widely to industry,
government, and academic stakeholders.
