This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic Ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will conduct numerical experiments with a three-dimensional ocean
model. Numerical experiments will help guide planning for initiating field
research and hydrographic surveys. Data gathered during the first field season
will be used to validate the model. When model and observed currents are in
agreement, the model will begin to integrate the physical and biological
components to evaluate heat and carbon budgets associated with the polynya.
