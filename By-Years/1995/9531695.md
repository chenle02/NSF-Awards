Support for two specific data analysis investigations is requested. The first
is an investigation of dayside aurora and associated measurements of
magnetopause locations obtained from simultaneous ground based and satellite
measurements. They expect to be able to distinguish between magnetopause motions
which result from changes in dynamic pressure and those due to flux erosion and
hypothesize that dayside auroral motions are associated only with the latter.
The second is a large statistcal investigation of a large database of
magnetopause crossings to extablish the relationship between changes in
magnetopause location and substorm activity.
