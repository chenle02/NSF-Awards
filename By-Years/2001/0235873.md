With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Monica Macaulay and Ms. Marianne
Milligan will conduct three years of research on Menominee, an endangered
Algonquian language spoken in northeastern Wisconsin. They will create and
publish a set of bilingual dictionaries. These will be derived from a computer
database with grammatical notes, morphological analysis, and cultural
information on Menominee. Because much of this information is unnecessary and
even potentially distracting for some audiences, the database will be coded in
such a way that several different dictionaries can be produced from it. At least
three will be produced: one serving child learners, one serving language
teachers and adult learners, and one serving scholars interested in the complete
analysis of the entries. Each format will be produced in both printed and
electronic form. The electronic versions will offer versatility unavailable in
the printed versions. But because some audiences do not have access to
computers, printed versions of the dictionaries are necessary, especially for
the classroom.

This project will contribute significantly to scholarly work on Algonquian
languages and, at the same time, provide the Menominee tribe with a much-needed
tool for preserving their highly endangered language. There is currently no
satisfactory dictionary resource available for language learners, teachers, and
scholars interested in Menominee and historical or comparative research on other
Algonquian languages. Thus, development of dictionaries for different audiences
is urgently needed. The flexibility of the database will maximize the usefulness
of this project, enabling the production of dictionaries for different levels
and types of users.
