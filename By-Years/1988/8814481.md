This award will enable Dr. Reginald G. Golledge of the University of California,
Santa Barbara to conduct research in Australia for six weeks. Dr. Golledge will
collaborate with Professor Donald Parkes of the Institute of Behavioral Sciences
at the University of Newcastle on the development and production of "talking
maps", for use by people with impaired vision, and to establish a program of
experimental research on the problem of navigating without sight. The Australian
group has considerable expertise in the area of "talking maps", and is pursuing
related projects in the fields of navigation without sight. This award will
facilitate the completion of some aspects of collaborative research aimed at
finding replacements for maps based on the sense of touch, and on development of
methods to actually produce a "talking map."
