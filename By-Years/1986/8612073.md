The goal of the research is to use mathematical programming techniques to obtain
a better understanding of the general problem of separation of several
multicomponent sources into several multicomponent product streams which may (or
may not) have all the components of the feed streams. The approach is to
generate a superstructure that contains all possible separation sequences
imbedded into, formulating the resulting optimization problem as a nonlinear
programming problem (NLP) and solving that NLP by some standard algorithm. The
solution to this NLP yields the separation tasks to be used, the order in which
these tasks occur and the corresponding flow rates and compositions of the inter
- connecting streams. Routines will be investigated that will incorporate heat
integration into these algorithms. Because utility costs are very high for
distillation columns, the economic advantages of heat integration can
substantially affect the cost of the product. Heat integration of two or more
distillation columns is possible because there exist more than one heat source
(overhead vapor and bottoms product) and heat sink (feed and recycle streams
through the reboiler).
