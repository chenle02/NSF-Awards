Mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering,
electronic engineering and software engineering. Mechatronics serves the
purposes of controlling advanced hybrid systems and has been associated with
many different areas, encompassing manufacturing, motion control, robotics,
intelligent control, system integration, vibration and noise control, automotive
systems, automation technology, modeling and design, energy management systems
and micro devices. To sum up its purpose and value, Mechatronics promotes and
fosters innovation through integration. The Engineering of Engineering
Technicians (E2T) at VWCC addresses the student deficiencies entering this
growing interdisciplinary engineering technology field by building synergy
between industry, community college faculty, and secondary career and technical
education (CTE) entities to streamline a career pathway in Mechatronics. The
project has three major goals: 1) to implement industry driven project based
learning (PBL) modules created by secondary and post-secondary faculty in the
summer institute; 2) to enhance project based activities for students by
expanding summer Mechatronics and pre-engineering camps, the annual Technology
Summit, and STEM Career Exploration events for underrepresented student
populations; and 3) to increase the Regional Academy in Advanced Technology
enrollment of underrepresented populations. An additional project objective is
to enhance the ability of secondary technical education and pre engineering
teachers to implement PBLs that ultimately lead to elevated proficiency in
problem analysis, self-directed learning and solution based learning in the
classroom with particular focus to recruit students from underrepresented
populations into the Mechatronics field.
