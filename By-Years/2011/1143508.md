This award provides initial funding for a 3D High Definition (HD) video
documentary about an international group of earth scientists engaged in an
investigation of the processes responsible for central Mongolia's unusually
active uplifting terrain (the Hangay Dome) and its consequences for regional
climate patterns and ecosystems (EAR -1009702). The Hangay Dome in central
Mongolia provides an excellent and accessible laboratory to investigate these
processes and determine the degree to which mantle upwelling, mafic
underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have been important
agents in its uplift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project as a whole will
be the focus of a feature-length documentary film (Mongolia 3D) aimed at Earth-
science education and public outreach. Primary and interpreted project data will
be available on the web for use in classrooms at various levels. The 3D video
format is a new immersive television medium that has emerged from the highly
successful 3D feature film format, and Mongolia 3D will be among the pioneering
documentary productions fully produced, from inception to delivery, in
3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award will support pre-production planning
and research and 3D filming of the geologists' first field season doing
fieldwork in Mongolia in the summer of 2011. This footage will be an integral
part of the envisioned 3D documentary; the PIs will capture the exciting
beginning phase of a major scientific field project which holds great promise to
make significant advancements in our understanding of an important process of
continental evolution.
