The purpose of this grant is to provide funding for the International Workshop
on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) to be held July 16-22, 2016 on the
campus of Washington University in St. Louis. IWOTA is an annual conference that
has been held throughout the world and it returns to the United States for the
first time since 2008. IWOTA brings together mathematicians from around the
world in both pure and applied areas (related to the field of operator theory)
for the purposes of collaborating, sharing new research, and educating graduate
students and early career researchers. IWOTA 2016 makes a special effort to
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through its
selection of speakers and its designation as a conference conducted "in
cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics." The funds for this
grant will be used to support the travel of main speakers as well as graduate
students and early career researchers.

IWOTA has two main scientific goals. First, it serves as a meeting place for
mathematicians in the field of operator theory. Many of the main speakers of the
conference are experts in operator theory with recent innovations to share with
the broader community. The conference has numerous special sessions to allow
subgroups within operator theory (such as free analysis/probability, applied
harmonic analysis, and systems and function theory) to collaborate. Second,
IWOTA has always had the goal of increasing the interaction of pure operator
theorists, applied mathematicians, and engineers. IWOTA 2016 intends to continue
this tradition through its main speakers and special sessions.
