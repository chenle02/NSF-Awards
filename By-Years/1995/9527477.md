9527477 Prabhu This research is funded as an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory
Research). The objective of the project is to enhance the design, development,
and implementation of a computer-aided nonlinear discriminant for pattern
recognition. The approach will employ techniques from algebraic geometry and
dynamic systems. Discriminant design uses a database of feature vectors and
partitions the feature space into disjoint regions corresponding to different
classes of patterns. Based on the methodology, an algorithm will be developed
and implemented. The performance of the algorithm will be benchmarked through a
series of tests problems in weather forecasting and production systems for which
quick pattern recognition and control are required. To rapidly recognize and act
on objects, especially in situations involving automatic assembly and part
sortation, are essential qualities for the design and implementation of
effective automated production systems. The technique, apart from its nonlinear
discriminant nature, is expected to yield some improvement in both speed and
accuracy in pattern recognition in general. The development of fast algorithms
capable of processing large amounts of data in very short time and with high
accuracy is essential for large scale adoption of automatic pattern recognition
techniques in a host of applications. The outcome of this research has the
potential to advance the state-of-the-art in this critical field.
