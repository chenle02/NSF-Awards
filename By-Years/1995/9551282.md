This project supports the purchase of an HPLC with a diode-array detector (DAD).
Further, the instrument must have the capability of doing the following
experiments: quantitative deconvolution of overlapping chromatographic peaks,
second derivative spectroscopy, spectral library searches, diode and
multichannel averaging, peptide mapping, microbore separations and post-column
reaction detection. This instrument is an integral part of new experiments being
incorporated into analytical, instrumental, organic, biochemistry, molecular
biology, advanced synthesis, and undergraduate research. New bioanalytical and
environmental labs in analytical chemistry introduce students to modern HPLC
separation techniques and spectroscopic methods and encourage them to understand
the fundamentals of chemical interactions (mobile-stationary phase) and
multichannel devices (DAD). Fundamental principles are reinforced in upper-
division laboratory courses. For example, students in biochemistry perform a
tryptic digestion of a reduced protein, separation of the peptide fragments by
RP-HPLC, and identification of coenzyme carrying peptide fragments by their UV
spectra. The HPLC-DAD is also being used for undergraduate research projects
involving kinetics and mechanisms of micellar-enhanced photochemical reactions
and photoinitiated peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence. This instrumentation is
having a broad impact on chemistry and biology students and is becoming an
integral part of a new macromolecular characterization/isolation laboratory.
