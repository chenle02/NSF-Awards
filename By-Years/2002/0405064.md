The measurement of the low-frequency attenuation behavior of polycrystalline
olivine aggregates, of olivine-orthopyroxene aggregates and of olivine-based
partial melts will be pursued. Specifically, the polycrystalline materials,
which will have carefully engineered microstructures, will be subjected to
dynamic ("sub-resonant", oscillatory loading) and quasistatic (constant loading,
i.e., creep) so as to evaluate the attenuation behavior as functions of (i)
temperature (1150 to 1350 degC), (ii) frequency (2x10e-4 to 1 Hz), (iii) phase
volume fraction and morphology (phase percolation and phase separation/layering
in the solid state; melt segregation beyond the grain scale in partial melts),
and (iv) dislocation-creep sub-microstructure. The study/characterization of
microstructural effects (engineered into these specimens so as to mimic
deformation-induced microstructures) on seismic-frequency absorption is one key
to applying seismic data to infer deformation behavior in active tectonic
terranes.
