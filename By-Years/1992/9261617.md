AstroPower proposes the growth and development of a (GaP)1- x(ZnS)x-based
material. It is the purpose of the proposed work to explore for solid solution
compositions of (GaP)1-x(ZnS)x that are amphoteric and characterized by direct
bandgaps greater than 2.6 eV, and to demonstrate epitaxial growth techniques
which have manufacturing scale potential. This type of material with bandgap in
excess of 2.6 eV can be employed in blue light-emitting diodes, and in UV
detectors capable of superior performance compared to silicon, in high
temperature, high radiation environments such as in earth orbit and particle
accelerators. For a blue LED, the suc- cessful development of this material
system is expected to lead to luminous intensities of 80 to 300 mcd compared to
the 20 mcd of currently available SiC LEDs.
