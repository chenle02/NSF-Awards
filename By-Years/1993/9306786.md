This Career Advancement Award will allow the PI to do a combined experimental
and theoretical study of the various viscoelastic and non-Newtonian effects of
synovial fluid on joints. It will give the PI the opportunity to extend her area
of expertise in constitutive modeling of biological fluids into the analysis of
synovial fluids for joint lubrication. The results of this study will provide
new methods to study lubrication properties of joints and may lead to the
development of biological substitutes for pathological lubrication fluids.
