9360932 Black Intelligent Fiber Optic systems provide a new sensing approach for
smart structure applications. This integrated structure exploits novel
combination of mutually compatible and complementary known technologies: (a)
dual-mode fibers, (b) fiber Bragg gratings, and (c) lattice sensor arrays. Both
broadband and tunable narrowband optical sources are applicable. a two-sensor
array prototype will be constructed and evaluated for sensitivity, dynamic
range, linearity, reliability and installation options.
