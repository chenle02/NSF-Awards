ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0241921&lt;br/&gt;Paulraj, Arogyaswami&lt;br/&gt;Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-time (multiple antenna) techniques offer a
variety of leverages to improve wireless systems performance. These include
diversity, spatial multiplexing and interference reduction. Wireless standards
bodies are incorporating space-time techniques into new standards. However, many
existing wireless systems such as GSM and IS-95 rely on a single transmit and
receive antenna (SISO) and therefore cannot benefit from space-time technology.
This proposal aims to develop a novel approach that brings many of the benefits
of space-time technology to SISO wireless by introducing an intermediate node
with multiple receive and multiple transmit antennas. We characterize a SISO
link with an intermediate node as a SI(MM)SO link. In such links, there is also
the possibility of a SISO link bypass to the SI(MM)SO link.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1.
Characterizing Shannon channel capacity of SI(MM)SO channels with bypass.
&lt;br/&gt;2. Space-time processing schemes at the intermediate node.
&lt;br/&gt;3. Extensions of the SI(MM)SO idea to MIMO channels. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;While theoretical work is the primary goal of this proposal,
experimental support is available and can help measure real SI(MM)SO channels.
