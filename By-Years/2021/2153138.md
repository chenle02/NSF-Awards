The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project benefitd the 70 million people struggling with
gait disorders in the US. Gait analysis monitors how individuals walk to predict
or prevent injuries and track rehabilitation progress. Due to the potentially
high equipment costs, space requirements, and required technical expertise to
collect and interpret results, detailed gait analyses are limited to a few
centers and mainly used for surgical decision-making. This project uses
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for gait analysis at roughly 70% less than typical
costs, as well as offering reduced set-up time and improved workflow
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will address the existing
technological and commercial barriers that make gait analysis an exclusive
clinical tool restricted to only 300 gait labs across the country. This project
will develop a cost-effective markerless motion 3D-tracking system. Technical
activities include: (1) increase the motion database to a diverse population,
including children and patients with mobility impairments; (2) improve the
computer vision algorithms to account for multiple individuals within the camera
systemâ€™s field of view; (3) integrate EMG and Force Plates; (4) implement
skeletal geometry estimation from computed tomography; (5) develop a self-
calibration system that can operate with HD low cost cameras; and (5) improve
accuracy and usability substantially to reduce the expertise required for
computational gait analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
