The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum spans many orders of magnitude in
frequency, with sources ranging from stellar-mass compact objects to
supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) at the centers of distant galaxies. GW
astronomy is a key component of one of NSF’s 10 big ideas (“windows on the
Universe”), which aims to combine electromagnetic, GW, and neutrino observations
to study astrophysical phenomena. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) probe the low-
frequency portion of the GW spectrum (f ∼ 1 − 100 nHz), which is inaccessible to
either ground-based or space-based interferometers. The purpose of this award is
to support the development of techniques to detect GWs from individual SMBBHs
with PTAs. . This award will also support the development of a planetarium show
to share PTA science with the public, and a GW activity for undergraduate
students that will act as an introduction to astrophysics research.

This award will support the development of robust frequentist detection
techniques for individual SMBBHs, which will complement existing Bayesian
methods. The group will also investigate ways of optimizing PTAs to detect GWs
from individual SMBBHs. These advances will improve the ability to detect GWs
from individual SMBBHs with PTAs and enable multi-messenger astrophysics of
SMBBHs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
