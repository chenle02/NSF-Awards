Techniques for handling non-stationarity in signals and images have been
explored in different areas; wavelet analysis in applied mathematics, multi-rate
filter bank techniques in digital signal processing and multi-resolution
analysis in computer vision. Recent developments have indicated the connection
between these various techniques. A goal of this work is to make a thorough
exploration of the connections between these three areas and present a unified
view of existing problems, techniques and applications. Further, design of new
regular wavelets, examination of associated computational structures and a study
of the complexity of the wavelet transform are also pursued. Finally, design of
non-separable multi-dimensional wavelets, new wavelet- based-sampling methods
and application to image coding are attempted.
