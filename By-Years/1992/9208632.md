In large and evolving software systems, tools such as compilers, testers, and
debuggers require that static information be maintained and updated. Data flow
analysis algorithms, which gather facts about use and definition of data in
programs, are a major source of this information. Incremental update algorithms,
which only calculate information affected by the program changes, avoiding total
recalculation, efficiently provide consistent documentation for a large,
evolving software system. In previous research, implementation of incremental
analysis for C systems has been hampered by the imprecision of the known
techniques for determining pointer-induced aliases. This research aims at
developing more precise interprocedural analyses of C systems, based on the
conditional analysis approach of our pointer aliasing approximation algorithm.
Specifically, it is planned to: o optimize the interprocedural pointer aliasing
approximation algorithm, o develop a new, interprocedural modification side
effect analysis algorithm for C-like languages and design other flow sensitive
data flow analyses (e.g., interprocedural reaching definitions, static program
slicing), o build a second prototype incremental MOD analyzer for C systems and
profile its performance on actual C systems, and o study issues involved in
scaling up for programming-in-the-large.
