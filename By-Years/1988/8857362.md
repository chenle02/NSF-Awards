The main thrust of this research is to study three dimensional algebraic
varieties (threefolds). The Principal Investigator's past work will be continued
on questions on algebraic fibre spaces together with the applications to the
classification of threefolds. The current work also concerns the structure of
birational mappings between threefolds, especially the codimension-two algebraic
surgerys called "flips" and "flops" which are now understood to be a central
feature of birational maps in dimension three. A potential application of all of
this is to produce a geometrically meaningful compactification of moduli spaces
of surfaces via the study of the fibration of the threefold obtained from a one-
parameter family of surfaces, especially curvature properties of that fibration.
