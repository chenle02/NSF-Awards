Physical systems tend towards equilibrium. Mechanical systems achieve a state of
lowest energy by giving off energy to the environment. Likewise, local
disturbances in a thermodynamic system, such as temperature fluctuations in a
room, tend to even out; i.e., the system relaxes towards a thermal equilibrium.
However, there are instances where due to external influences, systems do not
tend towards an equilibrium. A famous example is a piece of metal that is heated
on one end and cooled at the other. In this case, the system does not relax into
equilibrium but remains in a steady state as heat flows from the hot to the cold
end. The objective of this proposal is to describe these states in terms of
various mathematical models ranging from basic optimization problems to large
systems of interacting agents. We will consider optimization problems that are
important in mathematics or ubiquitous in descriptions of physical phenomena,
such as superconductivity. Our goal is to answer questions such as: How fast
does a large system equilibrate or tend towards a steady state? What are the
properties of these equilibria? If a system has some underlying symmetry, do
equilibria have the same symmetry? The fascinating aspect of this research area
is that problems run the gamut from ones that can be solved using standard
methods to those that need considerable ingenuity for their solution. These
characteristics also make it an ideal training ground for graduate students.

The analysis of systems out of equilibrium is still a wide open field; e.g., the
interaction of a physical system with heat baths is not well understood. Such
systems do not tend towards equilibrium but instead towards a non-equilibrium
steady state (NESS). The PI proposes to examine such phenomena within the frame
work of master equations. One of the research goals is to find Lyapunov
functions that allow to control the approach towards an NESS. The investigation
of such systems often leads to variational problems for the gap as well as for
the entropy production, and their solution requires functional inequalities. It
is important to prove these inequalities in their sharp form and to know all
functions for which there is equality. One direction of research is to
investigate such inequalities using flows which is the idea of Lyapunov
functions in reverse. This method has been successful in some highly non-trivial
cases and it is expected that it will deliver not only sharp inequalities but
also additional correction terms. The Polaron model which describes an electron
interacting with the vibrations of a crystal, fits into this framework as well.
This is one of the simplest examples of a quantum field theory. The strong
coupling limit of the energy is well understood and it is proposed to study the
more subtle problem, namely the strong coupling limit of the electron density.
