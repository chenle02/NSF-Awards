The control of cellular behaviors such as cell migration, axon guidance and
synaptogenesis is critical to nervous system development. To understand the
molecular basis for this control, it is essential to identify the molecules that
are involved. Proteoglycans comprise a class of glycoproteins long suspected to
play key roles in the morphogenetic behaviors of cells. Evidence that
proteoglycans are particularly important to neural development is considerable,
but largely either indirect or circumstantial. Advances in this area have been
slow because proteoglycan fractionation and analysis have traditionally been
difficult. Recently, however, these methods have been improved considerably,
making it possible to obtain tools with which to assess the functions of nervous
system proteoglycans directly. As a first step toward this end, proteoglycans
will be isolated from developing neural tissue (fetal rat brain, cultured
neurons) and characterized by the size of their protein cores, the class of
glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins of the nervous system. Monoclonal antibodies
reacting with some of these proteoglycans will be identified. As a result, it
will be possible to identify particular proteoglycans whose temporal expression,
spatial distribution, or binding specificities are consistent with particular
roles in neural development.
