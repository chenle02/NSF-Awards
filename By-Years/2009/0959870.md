This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of&lt;br/&gt;2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition
of Data Intensive Supercomputer (DISC) at the University of Buffalo. The
supercomputer provides transformative computing and data processing capability
to approximately 250 immediate users involved in a wide range of innovative
research and education activities. The substantial compute power, large memory,
and fast storage is utilized to advance the immediate scientific goals of over
45 research groups throughout the Nation. The spectrum of research enabled by
DISC can be classified into three broad themes: (i) data intensive computing,
clustering, and datamining; (ii) simulation analytics, and (iii) the novel real-
time simulation by data analytics. A vibrant multidisciplinary community is
built around the new supercomputing infrastructure. Classes, tutorials, and
workshops utilizing the new system are designed to engage undergraduates,
graduates, postdoctoral fellows, scientists, and faculty within the local
western New York area and nationally. The project team has a long history of
successfully administering educational and outreach programs centered around
high-performance computing. Many existing educational programs are impacted by
this acquisition including: the Buffalo-area Engineering Awareness for
Minorities (BEAM) enrichment program, the Eric Pitman Annual Summer Workshop in
Computational Science, and Buffalo's "Mayor's Next Generation Scientists
Program." Results from the studies enabled by the new equipment are disseminated
by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and
through publication in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;
