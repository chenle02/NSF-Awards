This Services project is developing a suite of "best practices" documents and
resources to foster reusability and interoperability of NSDL holdings. Making
NSDL content easier to use in multiple settings (reuse) and more capable of
being used by common authoring tools and delivery environments
(interoperability), increases its impact and value. But reusable, interoperable
content has different design requirements than traditional Web content. This
project is synthesizing and disseminating the body of research and practice that
has built up in this domain in order to foster its application. Major objectives
include: creating and disseminating general NSDL guidelines and recommended
practices for designing reusable content and using existing tools to do so;
creating and disseminating specialized versions of these guidelines and
practices tailored to the methods used and issues faced by the ENC, MERLOT and
MathDL user communities; conducting workshops on content reuse and
interoperability; and developing recommendations for how collections can expose
reusable content in searches. All resources produced by this project are
applicable to the entire educational community.
