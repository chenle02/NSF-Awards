9412639 Famouri The objectives of the proposed research are to develop a
mathematical and computer simulated model for permanent magnet brushless DC
machines, which have been targeted for use in electric vehicles and hybrid
electric vehicles. Issues such as geometric complexities, configuration,
armature reaction effects and nonlinear characteristics of the ferromagnetic
materials will be addressed in the development of the model. The approach will
be a nonlinear mathematical modeling. It is anticipated that the magnetic filed
will be solved by use of finite-element techniques. Once an algorithm is
developed to obtain the model, the accuracy of the model will be evaluated and
compared with actual machines. The development methodologies are expected to
extend beyond the model of permanent magnet DC motors to models of the other
electric machines and electrical systems. ***
