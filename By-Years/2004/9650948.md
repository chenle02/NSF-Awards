The equipment requested will be used to support revision in quantitative and
instrumental analysis for chemistry courses leading to certificates and
associate degrees in Environmental Technology and also for students transferring
to four-year institutions. The addition of atomic absorption spectrometry and
UV-visible spectrometry close the gap between Brookhaven College's current
instrumentation and instruments found in modern industrial laboratories. The new
instruments will better prepare students for typical, work-related tasks in
environmental sampling and measurements. The instrumentation will be used in
both analytical and general chemistry courses.
