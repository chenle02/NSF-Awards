Old Dominion University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in applied physics and engineering for 22 students entering the 9th,
10th, and 11th grades. This summer year program will provide enrichment and
hands- on experiences to enhance participants' knowledge of applied physics and
engineering, involve students in group research projects, offer participants the
opportunity to explore careers in several disciplines involving substantial
applications of physics, and foster meaningful interactions between participants
and scientists/engineers working in these fields. The project will provide
support and understanding to participants, offer general guidance in career
planning, and help participants assess their potential for success in applied
physics, engineering, and related fields.
