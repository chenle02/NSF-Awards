This project is in the area of the Materials Chemistry Initiative. An
integrated, interdisciplinary research program will be pursued involving: (1)
the synthesis of molecular and polymeric precursors to silicon nitride and
carbide, (2) the application of these precursors to the preparation of ceramic
materials, and (3) the analysis of the microstructure and properties of the
ceramic end products to determine the dependence on processing variables.
Various routes to organosilicon ring systems and ring-chain polymers will be
investigated in pursuit of precursors to Silicon nitride and Silicon Carbide.
The pyrolysis chemistry of these compounds will be studied to establish design
parameters for the preparation of precursors which will yield the ceramic end
product in the desired final form in high yield and purity. This will include
the use of volatile compounds for chemical vapor deposition as well as oligomers
and polymers of low volatility for the preparation of high purity powders of
controlled morphology, as sintering aids and for direct pyrolysis to monolithic
ceramics.
