A two-day workshop is being held at the University of Idaho facility in McCall,
Idaho in October, 2003 to identify the cyberinfrastructural needs of the
structural geology community. The goals of the workshop are to: (1) identify the
database needs and analysis tools required by modern structural geologists, (2)
outline a vision for the architecture of a structural geology
cyberinfrastructure and its relation to existing or planned cyberinfrastructural
initiatives in the earth sciences, (3) initiate a discussion on data standards,
required metadata, and information formats for databases, and (4) develop a
strategy for community involvement and implementation of the
cyberinfrastructure. Participants consist of about 25 structural geologists
representing a wide range of expertise. Many of the participants have experience
in database development, information management, and the application of data
analysis tools. The findings of the workshop are being presented to the
structural geology community at the National Meeting of the Geological Society
of America. The final report will be published in GSA Today and will be
presented to the National Science Foundation together with recommendations for
implementation of the structural geology cyberinfrastructure.
