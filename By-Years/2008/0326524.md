AST-0326524&lt;br/&gt;Williams&lt;br/&gt;Traditional tools for handling and
analyzing large data sets are inadequate to address the growth in volume and
complexity of modern scientific data. The ability to mine new discoveries out of
an ever-increasing amount of data requires the creation and application of new
techniques and algorithms for data analysis. "This project will develop a novel
Grid-technology based system as a prototype research environment for astronomy
with massive and complex data sets. While astronomy is a particular science
discipline in which the [investigators] have expertise, the problems they are
solving are common to most sciences. This knowledge extraction system will be
built with a new IT paradigm: it will be a library of distributed Grid Services
controlled by a workflow system, compliant with the emerging standards of cyber-
infrastructure...The system will become a part of the NSF National Virtual
Observatory, substantially benefiting that project and the astronomical
community in general."&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
