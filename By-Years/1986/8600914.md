A less expensive and nonlabor intensive public water supply facility is an
attractive marketable product. In this research a small compact slow sand filter
configuration for treating drinking water from springs or other surface water
supplies is investigated. The project objectives are: (1) determine effect of
sand size and configuration; (2) determine potential effectiveness of filters in
removing viruses; (3) determine the effect of filtration rate on treatment; and
(4) determine the treatment effectiveness by using turbidity, total coliform,
standard plate count, Giardia cysts, and some viruses as the indicating
parameters.
