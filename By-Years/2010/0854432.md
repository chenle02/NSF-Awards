University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Total positivity: connections with algebra,
topology, and statistical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will explore three related projects in total
positivity, cluster algebras, and statistical mechanics. The first project seeks
to develop and apply combinatorial tools to the study of totally positive
varieties; in particular, to understand their topology. The second project is to
understand cluster algebras, focusing in particular on the longstanding
positivity conjecture. The third project is the study of combinatorial models in
statistical mechanics, especially the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP).
Recent work of the PI has linked the ASEP to total positivity on the
Grassmannian; it seems that this is just the beginning of a complete
combinatorial understanding of the ASEP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is
driven by the philosophy that combinatorics is often a "shadow" of deep
mathematical phenomena. Understanding discrete (or finite) structures can
provide clues as to the bigger picture and help to unravel relations between
disparate areas of mathematics. The PI plans to apply this philosophy to
problems from total positivity, cluster algebras, and statistical mechanics. One
object of study, the asymmetric exclusion process, is a model for traffic flow
and protein synthesis, and as such, this project could have widespread
applications beyond pure mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
