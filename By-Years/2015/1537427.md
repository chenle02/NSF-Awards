The transition to a grid where an increasing portion of our energy comes from
wind and solar energy is requiring that the grid operators develop a planning
process that can handle a much higher level of uncertainty than is encountered
today. Current tools have been criticized as ad-hoc procedures that consist of
optimizing around a deterministic forecast, leaving the grid vulnerable to
unexpected variations. Proposed "stochastic models" are much harder to solve,
and grid operators still struggle to solve their existing deterministic models.
Existing industry practice, while ad-hoc, actually represents a simple example
of a powerful class of policies called "parametric cost function
approximations." that has received virtually no attention from the academic
literature. This research builds on the core strategy in use today, but blends
the capabilities of existing commercial optimization solvers for deterministic
models with the power of machine learning algorithms. The work will formalize
existing industry practice, providing an implementable path to handling
uncertainty which will provide a way for grid operators to naturally handle the
steady increase in energy from wind and solar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
proposes an algorithmic strategy that represents a fundamental departure from
the field of stochastic programming, which handles uncertainty through the
solution of stochastic look-ahead policies where the future is represented using
a set of sampled realizations (scenarios). This research introduces a new class
of policies called parametric cost function approximations. These are
parametrically modified deterministic optimization problems which are optimized
to minimize cost and risk, just as any machine learning model is optimized to
fit data. This strategy blends the power of high-dimensional statistical
learning with math programming and stochastic gradient methods, which form the
basis of a feedback learning algorithm for identifying the best objective
function to achieve the objectives of the ISO. Both offline and online versions
of the algorithm will be developed, so policies can be tuned in a simulator
(offline) but then continually adapted in production (online).
