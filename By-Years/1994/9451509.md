9451509 Jones The Departments of Geology and Chemistry propose to introduce
modern methods of X-ray diffraction into undergraduate laboratory courses, and
to increase the use of diffractometry in student research. In order to
accomplish these goals, funds are sought to upgrade and computer-interface an
X-ray diffractometer. Hands-on use of the diffractometer will be introduced in
the Geology curriculum with the Mineralogy course. In Lithology, Sedimentology,
Geomorphology, and Glacial Geology, students will use the diffractometer to
solve specific problems. X-ray Mineralogy students will learn to operate the
equipment independently and use the full range of software to solve a variety of
problems. In the Chemistry curriculum, hands-on use of the diffractometer will
be introduced in Physical Chemistry. In Instrumental Analysis, students will
conduct experiments designed to illustrate how X-ray diffraction is used for
quality control. Inorganic Chemistry students will make extensive use of
diffractometry in order to characterize solid state compounds. Geology and
chemistry students will be able to do independent research projects that
previously would have been impossible. The project will have significant impact
because about 220 students per year (compared to about 25 at present) will be
introduced to computer-interfaced X-ray diffractometry and its many practical
uses.
