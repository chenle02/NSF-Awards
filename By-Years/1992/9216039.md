Experiments using a novel and innovative technique for mapping specific
photoreceptor activities in the cerebral cortex are designed to provide answers
to crucial questions about the way in which color information is processed at
the highest levels of the visual pathway. These studies should help to resolve a
long outstanding problem in human vision and pioneer a fairly straightforward
technique for the study of most other visual systems that use color information
in guiding behavior. This is the first such attempt to use cone photoreceptor-
isolating stimuli to map activity in the primary visual cortex using the
metabolic marker, 2- deoxyglucose and promises to be a very powerful new
addition to understanding cortical mechanisms of color perception.
