Proposal Title: Surfaces in knot exteriors: The Lopez Conjecture.

Principal Investigator: Dr. William H. Jaco

Abstract: This project involves a Special Semester at Stanford University and
The American Institute of Mathematics bringing together a team of four senior
investigators, two postdoctoral fellows and two advanced graduate students for
an intense and collaborative study of essential surfaces in knot exteriors. Two
of the senior investigators have been working on a program over the past two
decades to detect certain knots by properties of essential surfaces in the knot
exterior. Their methods have been very successful in identifying such properties
but do not lead to methods that will enable one to realize such knots. The other
two senior investigators have in the last three years developed new methods for
realizing knots having interesting properties. This project will bring these two
methods together to address one of the most outstanding problems in this area of
mathematical research.

Low-dimensional topology brings together many areas of mathematical research and
provides a common ground for interaction and advance across all of mathematics.
It provides a natural geometric model of most physical phenomena. Research in
this area is making significant contribution to computational geometry and
topology and complexity theory. It has consequences in physics, computer
visualization and medical modeling.
