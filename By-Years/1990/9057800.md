With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Chris Doe will continue his work on the development of the
nervous system in the fruitfly, >Drosophila>. Dr. Doe has already been involved
in ground breaking work on the molecular mechanisms controlling the
determination and inter>actions of developing neurons. The proposed research
aims to discover and study genes that control the unique biochemical and
morphological characteristics of specific identified neurons. Drosophila is the
ideal species with which to do this kind of study because it is amenable to
sophisticated genetic/molecularstrategies that allow the rapid isolation and
sequencing ofimportant genes. In addition, Dr. Doe's background makes it certain
that he will be able to successfully carry out such a program. It is now
becoming clear that developmental control genes characterized in Drosophila have
homologous relatives with similar functions in vertebrates. Thus, the genes
discovered by Dr. Doe will have important implications for general
develop>mental control mechanisms. This award will facilitate the establishment
of a very promising research program by a gifted and dedicated young scientist.
