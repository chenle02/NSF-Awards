Marine aquaculture represents a growing industry and as this industry grows the
potential for pollution by wastes associated with fish culture and fish
processing increases. There is a significant amount of biological waste arising
from undigested feed and other fish waste as well as non-edible parts of the
final product. Because these wastes are of a biological nature, they may have
some uses in aquaculture and agriculture as feed additives or fertilizers. This
research is directed toward developing techniques to separate and collect both
fish culture wastes and fish processing wastes produced by a fish culture
system. The usefulness of the waste as a feed ingredient in fish feed, and as
fertilizer for salt tolerant agriculture plants, will be tested.
