To enhance our understanding of dispute transformation and the civil litigation
system more generally, systematic study of civil jury verdicts is needed. Much
criticism of the civil justice system is based on presumptions about the nature
and causes of patterns of jury verdicts, especially the sizes of awards in
particular types of cases such as medical malpractice cases and products
liability cases. By devising and evaluating, both cross-sectionally and
longitudinally, a multivariate ecological model using data from 48 counties in
ll states for the early 1980s, Drs. Andrews and Daniels' empirical study
develops an explanation of patterns of actual outcomes in medical malpractice
jury cases through the aggregate analysis of awards. Their contribution to
understanding what decisions are made by juries and why is important beyond the
numbers of jury cases because jury verdicts are very influential in determining
the outcomes of the majority of civil lawsuits handled through more informal
processes.
