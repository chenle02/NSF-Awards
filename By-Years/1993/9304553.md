9304553 Houston This research is a continuation of the search for a mechanism
for deep earthquakes, one of the most important unresolved problems in
geophysics. The work proposed here includes the assembly and analysis of
broadband displacement waveforms of about 150 large deep earthquakes that
occurred during 1987-1992. Events from 1982- 1986 showed a decrease in rise
times of the P wave with earthquake origin depth. This is one of the few
characteristics that shows a correlation with depth. The results will be used to
test proposed mechanisms for deep earthquakes including phase transformations in
the subducting slab. The results will also be compared with finite-difference
modeling of the slab structure on waveforms and stress orientations from the
Harvard CMT catalog. Integration of seismological and mineral physics results
will further the evaluation of hypotheses of slab structure and deep earthquake
generation. ***
