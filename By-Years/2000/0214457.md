The Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is a new multi-
university, multi-disciplinary Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC). The vision for the center is to provide integrated solutions to
logistics problems, through modeling, analysis and intelligent-systems
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four universities involved in this
proposal, the University of Arkansas, serving as the lead institution, the
University of Oklahoma, the University of Louisville, and Oklahoma State
University are assuming a leadership role in engineering logistics research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of CELDi will address (1) value-adding
processes that create time and place utility (transportation, material handling,
and distribution), (2) value-sustaining processes that prolong useful life
(maintenance, repair, and rework), and (3) value-recovering processes that
conserve scarce resources and enhance societal goodwill (returns, refurbishment,
and recycling).&lt;br/&gt;
