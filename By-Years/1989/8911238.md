Cells in most tissues are interconnected by cell-cell channels which allow the
passage of electrolytes and small molecules from cell to cell. Aggregates of
these channels are contained in the clustered intramembranous particles of gap
junctions. The objective of this research project is to understand the process
of formation of cell-cell channels. This problem is addressed by making use of
the expression of functional cell-cell channels in paired oocytes from cloned
gap junction cDNA. Oocytes accumulate a pool of precursors that increases with
time after gap junction specific mRNA injection. Cell-cell channels form rapidly
from this pool when oocytes are paired. This cell-cell channel assay will allow
to identify determinants of channel formation at the macroscopic level. In
combination with site directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides it should
yield information about molecular domains involved in the formation process.
Information gathered from the proposed experiments may facilitate development of
specific blockers of gap junction formation. Such blockers do presently not
exist, they are however desirable for studies of the biological role of gap
junctions.
