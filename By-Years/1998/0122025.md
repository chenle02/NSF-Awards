Abstract EEC-0122025 Taylor

This project is in partnership between the ERC for Computer-Integrated Surgical
Systems and Technology (CISST) at the Johns Hopkins University and the ERC for
Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (CenSSIS) at the Northeastern University.
The common objective of the two collaborating groups is to develop core imaging
and computer technologies to assist the physician in the treatment of the
diseases of human eye. The two teams will address the problem of integrating a
variety of medical images into a common description in the form of a
quantitative anatomical atlas of the eye. The research is expected to deliver an
interventional tool to the correct area on the retina, in a manner that
maximizes the dosage to the region of interest and minimizes the dosage to
healthy areas. The expertise of steady hand robotics of the Johns Hopkins
University will be combined with the expertise in subsurface sensing and imaging
of the Northeastern University.
