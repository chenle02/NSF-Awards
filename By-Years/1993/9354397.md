9354397 Carlson The recent sharp decline in the number of freshmen planning
engineering careers has exacerbated the long-standing problem of attrition in
engineering education. Responding to this problem, the project continues the
development of a new introductory electronics laboratory, entitled Introduction
to Engineering Electronics, that motivates freshmen for further study of
engineering. The course focuses on electronics for motivation, since all
branches of engineering use electronic instrumentation. Distinctive course
features include an emphasis on interactive learning and hands-on experiences
that stimulate curiosity, build confidence, and demonstrate the relevance and
rewards of engineering work. The project has four major objectives: (1)
assessing the motivational effectiveness of the course; (2) refining the content
and structure based on student response; (3) preparing a guidebook and
laboratory manual for use at Rensselaer and for dissemination to other
interested institutions; and (4) developing a multimedia laboratory terminal. By
achieving these objectives the project addresses educational issues of national
significance -- motivation, retention, hands-on learning, and building student
confidence. ***y
