0933811&lt;br/&gt;Levander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of
research computing facilities in the Department of Earth Science at Rice
University. Funds will be used to purchase a Sun multi dual core CPU server w/
32 Gb of RAM and 3 TB RAID mass store as well as augmentation of and access to
clock cycles on a centralized University grid machine. The latter Rice system is
termed SUGaR (Shared University Grid @ Rice) and currently houses 1280 CPUs.
Support from this grant will buy 128 additional CPUs, 96 Gb RAM and 12 Tb of
RAID storage for SUGaR. The buy in will also allow PIs to access any unused
cycles on SUGaR, for which the University provides central support for system
administration, power and conditioning. Five PIs and an additional six Rice
faculty will benefit from the proposed enhanced computational power for
numerically intensive research in geodynamics, seismology, hydrology and
physical volcanology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
