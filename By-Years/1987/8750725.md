This project will integrate existing computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-
integrated manufacturing (CIM) facilities with a multiple local area network
resulting in an innovative undergraduate interdisciplinary laboratory. The
laboratory will use the new Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) to control a
hybrid electronics manufacturing facility. Both electrical and mechanical
engineering laboratories will provide the student experiences in the
interrelationships among engineering theory, the laboratory, design and
manufacturing.
