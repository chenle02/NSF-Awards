9410196 Koelling The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental
understanding of a newly developed injection molding process known as gas-
assisted injection molding. The prototype problem consists of the motion of a
long gas bubble through a tube filled with a viscoelastic liquid. Since many
fluids used in industrial processes are viscoelastic, the principal focus will
be on the effect of rheology on the bubble penetration and fluid motion near the
bubble front. This work is experimental in nature and uses advanced fluid
mechanical and rheological techniques. A video imaging system will be used to
provide information about the entire flow field and the fraction of liquid
deposited in the tube wall will be measured. ***
