This project's goal is the determination of the correlation between cam
manufacturing technique and subsequent wear damage and cam follower performance
after run-in (break-in or wear-in). It is primarily an experimental study with a
goal of generating an analytical predictive model of cam run-in wear. Cams are
used extensively in production and consumer machinery. Much research has been
done on cam design methods but much less on cam manufacture. Cams are expensive
to make and more research in this area is desirable as a step to optimizing cam
manufacturing methods.
