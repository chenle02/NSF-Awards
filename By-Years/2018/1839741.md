Weather in the tropics is known to importantly affect weather at higher
latitudes, including over the continental United States. This project will
improve understanding of two prominent types of tropical weather patterns, known
as convectively coupled Kelvin waves and the Madden Julian Oscillation.
Addressing this issue will help to answer several longstanding scientific
questions, such as why does rainfall associated with the Madden Julian
Oscillation tend to be confined almost exclusively to the Indo-Pacific sector of
the tropics? This new knowledge will help to bolster efforts by the broader
scientific community aimed at improving models for predicting weather and
climate, as a tangible benefit to society. The project will also provide
training to a postdoctoral scientist and mentoring of undergraduate students
from underrepresented groups, thereby helping to broaden the demographics and
skills of the future workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project
will use numerical models in conjunction with observations to investigate how
and why these disturbances are both seen to be strongly modulated by the local
basic state (or environment) in which they are embedded. The project will also
investigate the structures and mechanisms of an apparently distinct class of
convectively coupled Kelvin waves, whose existence and propagation depend
crucially on forcing of the tropics by midlatitude weather
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
