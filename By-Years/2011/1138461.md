Northwestern University proposes to develop computational thinking (CT)
activities that can be embedded throughout existing high school STEM curricula.
The approach casts a wide net, introducing a diverse range of students
(including those from traditionally underrepresented groups) to CT skills
through STEM courses that they are already taking. The intent is that students
understand that computing is more than programming, it is a vital skill set that
pervades modern STEM fields. In addition to the embedded CT activities, the
project will develop a full-year course that explores the use of computational
methods across a range of disciplines including math, physics, chemistry,
biology, and earth/environmental science. This project builds on existing
partnerships with local schools and teachers and on an NSF GK12 program, Reach
for the Stars, that pairs graduate students in CS/STEM disciplines with local
middle and high school teachers to develop CT activities based on the graduate
students' research. The current proposal will use this rich set of initial CT
activities as a starting point for developing 60 refined CT activities that can
be embedded in traditional STEM courses. Two summer professional development
workshops and ongoing Saturday sessions will be used to train a team of 30 pilot
teachers to test the CT activities in their STEM classrooms. These professional
development resources will then be revised for larger-scale replication of our
CT curriculum. Evaluation studies will document the CT learning and attitudinal
gains for both teachers and students and provide initial evidence on the success
of our embedded CT approach.
