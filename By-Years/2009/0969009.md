Aschbacher will focus on two projects. First, he has begun a program to simplify
parts of the classification of the finite simple groups, by working in the
category of saturated 2-fusion systems. In particular Aschbacher hopes to obtain
a new proof of the classification of simple groups of component type; this
represents roughly half of the classification of the finite simple groups. A
byproduct of this effort would be classifications of certain classes of fusion
systems, perhaps including all simple saturated 2-fusion systems. Second,
Aschbacher has begun a program to describe the subposet of the lattice of
subgroups of a classical group consisting of the overgroups of certain important
subgroups, such as quadratic subgroups and some tori. As an application,
Aschbacher and J. Shareshian seek to prove there exist finite lattices which are
not intervals in the subgroup lattice of any finite
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the work would lead to a new proof of
one of the most important results in twentieth century mathematics, the
classification of the finite simple groups, and to strong new results on the
subgroup structure of the simple groups, the main tool for applying the
classification. The simple groups are the building blocks of finite group
theory, and finite groups are the mathematical tool with which one studies the
symmetry of finite objects.
