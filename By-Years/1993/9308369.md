9308369 Hastie The project will examine the effects of monetary incentives on
the performance of cognitive tasks. The nature of the incentive contingencies
will be varied to create an experimental design to compare the effect of large
and small monetary payoffs in piece rate, variable ratio, quota, and tournament
incentive schemes, including flat rate payment. While some prior research has
studied these schemes, work tasks have not been standardized, so that it is
difficult to obtain a true assessment of each incentive scheme. By standardizing
the task, it should be possible to obtain more precise measurement of the effect
of incentive on the detailed worker behavior. A comparative evaluation and
integration cognitive theory and models inspired by utility theory will be
conducted. ***
