In this project the investigators will study experimentally the dynamic
evolution of prepared quantum states using a newly-developed wave-particle
correlator. In a cavity QED system, where optically pumped atoms interact with a
single mode of a driven high finesse optical cavity, the conditional field
measured by the wave-particle correlator will allow the reconstruction of the
evolution of the quantum state. The conditional measurements will be coupled to
quantum feedback control to find ways to stabilize the quantum state. A new
study of the development of time asymmetries in correlation functions by looking
at the relationship between correlations and measurement back action will also
be undertaken.
