The purchase of the proposed Intensified Reticon Camera will make available to
this research group a new versatility: 2- dimensional images will be collected
at repetition rates up to 500Hz. Depending on the quantity of interest,
scattering or fluorescence signals will reveal the time history of such two-
dimensional events as flame front structure (fractals), turbulence mapping and
soot formation. The increase of sensitivity over existing equipment will allow a
much finer time resolution in the study of such phenomena. A better
understanding of the multidimensional history of combustion features will get us
closer to devices where the energy release will occur optimally, in terms of
efficiency, absence of pollution emissions and an ability to burn low grade
fuels. Funding of $25,000 is recommended, to be cost shared by an additional
$25,000 from Pennsylvania State University.
