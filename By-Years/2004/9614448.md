9614448 Xie This research is for collaborative research between Columbia and
Texas A&M Universities on the failure processes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone
(NMSZ) of the Central U.S. through characterization of microearthquake
clustering. Earlier analysis is to be extended to clustered events throughout
the NMSZ. Most clusters are located near the kink in the central segment, or
near the junctions of that segment with other major segments. The
spatial/temporal clusters occur over a range of depths of 4 to 9 km, display
both strike and reverse slip focal mechanisms, and are located both near and
away from the segment junctions and the kink. The goal is to provide the best
physical model for the clustering and give additional insight into 1) the
relation of the static stress drops of the larger ruptures to focal depths,
focal mechanisms, and locations near or away from the junctions, 2) the mode of
interactions among major fault segments in the NMSZ, such as triggering of
ruptures by seismic or aseismic preslip along intersecting fault segments, and
3) the role of fluid involvement in faulting processes. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
