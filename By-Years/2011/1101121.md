This project will provide currently uncollectable&lt;br/&gt;temporal
contamination measurements of hydrocarbons in response to the
Deepwater&lt;br/&gt;Horizon oil spill. The US EPA measures an array of
hydrocarbons, providing feedback&lt;br/&gt;to residents after a seven day delay.
These compounds, known together as BTEX&lt;br/&gt;(benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, and total xylenes), greatly increase the overall&lt;br/&gt;potency
of petroleum, amplifying the effect of small contamination levels.
