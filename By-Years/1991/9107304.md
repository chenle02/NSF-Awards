The amount of variability which is expressed and available for selection to act
upon may depend on the environment. This study will use a common annual plant,
pals jewelweed (>Impatiens> >pallida>), to test the effect of the environment on
the expression of genetic variance and the intensity of natural selection.
Populations of jewelweed from hillside and floodplain environments will be
reciprocally transplanted, allowing quantification of effect of the environment
on selection and genetic variability. Populations exposed to 'alien' (vis.a.vis,
'home') environments may express larger amount of genetic variability as well as
greater selection, thus allowing more rapid evolution. On the other hand, if
populations are unable to adapt to a new environment, they are more likely to
become extinct. Being able to predict the evolutionary response of populations
is particularly crucial now as species are facing rapid environmental changes at
the global and regional level.
