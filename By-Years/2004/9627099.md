With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Smith of the
University of Notre Dame is investigating the chemistry of organoboronic acids
with regard to carbohydrate isomerization, membrane transport, drug delivery,
and as anion receptors. The major focus of the investigation is to facilitate
the conversion of glucose to fructose by using boronic acids that are highly
selective. Additional efforts are directed at concentration enhancement through
the use of membrane transport complexes that are highly selective for fructose.
New classes of organoboronic acid derivatives are being investigated for their
ability to selectively facilitate the isomerization of glucose to fructose.
Further, these boronic acid derivatives are being investigated as reagents for
selective membrane transport of fructose, as reagents for the analysis of
catecholamines, as drug delivery vehicles, and anion receptors in Lewis acid
catalysis reactions.
