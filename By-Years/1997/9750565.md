This project is developing a curriculum for the introductory cellular and
molecular biology course for majors in biological sciences, as well as
integrating computers and promoting computer literacy. Computers are providing a
common design thread for the laboratory exercises, allowing students to use
spreadsheets for data analyses, conduct multimedia simulations, search
databases, access World Wide Web resources, and collect and analyze data for
these experiments. A computer laboratory of 13 workstations is allowing for the
modernization of the laboratory experiments and providing a research-oriented
environment that enhances learning of biology and stimulates students to remain
in this field. Key laboratory equipment is being purchased to allow computer
acquisition of data in molecular biology, energy metabolism, and microscope
imaging experiments. This course is serving as a model for other large
introductory cell biology courses for majors. *
