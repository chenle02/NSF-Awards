This project involves a novel approach to the representation of sub-grid scale
physics based on the assumption that there is self-similarity between the
unresolved scales and the finest scales resolved. Computational geometry
techniques will be used to represent structures seen in the resolved scales;
optimization techniques will be used to quantify the relation between similar
structures at different scales; finally self-similarity will be used to
extrapolate these structures to unresolved scales. The techniques developed will
be tested by applying them to two classes of dynamical simulations. The first is
airflow over rough terrain and the second is groundwater transport in complex
porous media. The work is a collaboration between mathematicians and scientists
working in the area of environmental fluid mechanics. It will offer
interdisciplinary research training, bridging mathematics, computational science
and geophysical fluid flow, to graduate students.
