Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&amp;M University for the
summers of 2003-2006. Gary A. Sulikowski is the site's program director. Twelve
faculty members from the chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to ten
students, who will each participate in a ten-week program. Students from non-Ph.
D. institutions will be targeted for participation in the program. Research
projects will feature biological chemistry, environmental chemistry and
materials chemistry. The program will have weekly meetings and a career
development day to provide information on career opportunities in modern
chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
