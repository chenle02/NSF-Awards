This research is focused on obtaining a deeper understanding of the role of
teams and team leadership in the improvement of quality within organizations.
The objectives of the research are to provide a systematic description of team
leadership and its role in team development and effectiveness, and to develop an
interdisciplinary methodology that will assist in transformations to quality
organizations. The research design involves the disciplines of anthropology,
computer education and cognitive systems,computer science, engineering
technology, management, and psychology. The interdisciplinary research group
willinvestigate teams and team leadership at several organizational levels
(i.e., the organization as a whole,the team itself, and the individual within
the team), and will examine factors that influence teams, including the culture
of the organization and the belief and behavior patterns that relate to this
culture. The outcomes of the research are expected to include an
interdisciplinary model of team leadership, knowledge about team formation and
maturation processes, knowledge about technical professional work processes,
tools to assist in transformations to quality organizations, and a basis for
identifying and educating team leaders. Companies participating in this study
