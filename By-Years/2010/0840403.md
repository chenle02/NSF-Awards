West Nile virus re-emerges annually in urban settings across the United States
in a predictable cycle of accelerating mosquito-bird transmission known as
amplification. When the virus amplifies sufficiently in birds and mosquitoes, it
spills over into humans. This project will focus on a persistent hot spot of
viral amplification and human disease in suburban Chicago. The project will
determine how fine-scale ecological processes spark local transmission foci, and
how these foci ultimately coalesce into larger patterns of amplification. By
combining field studies of birds and mosquitoes with molecular studies of the
virus and geographic analyses of fine-scale landscape characteristics, the study
will elucidate the fundamental ecological drivers of West Nile virus
transmission, amplification, and evolution in urban settings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West Nile virus is responsible for recurring illness in
humans and wildlife. By determining how ecological factors in the urban
environment facilitate viral transmission, this study will provide information
that will improve both human public health and wildlife conservation. Moreover,
new and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases threaten urban populations
throughout the USA and the world. Information on West Nile virus from this study
will help predict and prevent the emergence of similar diseases in urban
environments across the USA and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;
