In this project, Dr. Garaud and her collaborators will expand their modeling to
include analysis of transport layered convection, with the goal of solving long-
standing problems, such as understanding why Saturn radiates more energy than
predicted by models, and why Uranus and Neptune give off much less than
expected. They will also test whether incorporating helium gradients can improve
the thermal evolution models of Saturn and Jupiter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has broader impacts in that it will train students in interdisciplinary
scientific research, and produce results that are applicable in fields outside
of astronomy, including applied mathematics and global oceanic mixing.
