9424110 Cotter Ten women will undertake field and laboratory research to
determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west- central
Minnesota. The students will work on related projects using till analysis to
determine the origin and glacial history of three problematic deposits.
Additionally, paleoenvironmental studies of lacustrine deposits will be expanded
to include micropaleontological, palynological and geochemical investigations. A
field trip to the Canadian Rockies will illustrate active glacial processes. The
culmination of the program, the "Friends of UMM REU" conference, provides the
opportunity for the women to present results and discuss ideas with experts in
the field. Facilities at UMM offer the opportunity to develop collegial ties
with other undergraduate researchers, and to serve as mentors, instructors, and
role models for underrepresented high school students involved in the research
projects. The unique opportunity to work in a scientific community where
underrepresented groups constitute a majority will break down traditional
barriers and aid in maturation of the students as scientists.
