This research is on biomedical pCO2 sensors based on advanced fiber optic
technology. Research will focus on the development of a pCO2 analysis system
that performs real-time, in-vivo, continuous monitoring of pCO2 in physiological
concentration ranges. Specifically, efforts will be directed toward the
optimization of the choice of polymer/dye matrices to achieve desired response
time, reliability, stability, selectivity, and aging. A goal is to preserve
small sensor size by covalently binding the sensor chemistry directly to the
fiber sensor tip. A successful sensor should have significant medical
applications.
