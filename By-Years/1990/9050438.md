The physics department is introducing a course, Mathematical and Computational
Methods for Scientists and in addition is incorporating advanced symbolic
computation, numerical analysis, and simulation in other physics courses. Using
the symbolic package Mathematica and Macintosh IIci computers connected to an
existing network, students are able to explore physical situations which are
otherwise too complex. The project is producing courseware using Mathematica
which will be useful to other physics departments as well. The college is
matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
