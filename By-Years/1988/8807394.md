The PI proposes to study the local structure and magnetic properties of rare
earth amorphous alloys over a range of temperature from approximately .05K to
room temperature or above, principally using the Mossbauer effect. The original
experiments will be extended to other non-magnetic metal constituents such as
aluminum and gallium, and then to the more complicated amorphous systems with
the magnetic transition metals, which are of technological interest. As a
microscopic probe yielding angular information about the arrangements of ions
and magnetic information about individual rare earth ions, the Mossbauer effect
is well suited for such studies. Experiments over the range of temperature
proposed here will yield information about crystalline electric field
parameters, exchange fields, and distributions of these, to be compared to
various models of amorphous structure such as dense-random-packing-of- hard-
spheres or random network models. These results are anticipated to make a
significant contribution to the developing field of amorphous structure and
magnetism. The proposed research is also expected to have a major impact on the
educational environment of the Physics Department at Franklin and Marshall
College by continuing the increased amount of active experimental research on
campus, and by continuing the collaboration with Stanford University and
contacts with the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University.
