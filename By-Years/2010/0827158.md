Nicole N. Alexander and Alan S. Kolok Proposal # 0827158 Title: Student travel
to the International Congress on the Biology of Fishes.

The purpose of this project is to provide graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows support for travel to the VIIIth International Congress on the Biology
of Fishes, to be held in Portland, Oregon from July 28-August 1, 2008. The
Congress is international in scope and is expected to draw approximately 300
prominent fish physiologists from around the globe. Travel funds will be offered
to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on a competitive basis, with
special consideration being given to US citizens from underrepresented
populations. For the awardees, attendance at the meeting will provide them with
an opportunity to present independent research, learn about the latest
international scientific developments within the field of fish physiology and
network with colleagues and potential mentors.
