1153140/Fountain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an investigation into
the feasibility of using high-resolution satellite stereo imagery in combination
with historic topographic maps to estimate volume change of alpine glaciers
around the perimeter of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The contribution of glacier
mass loss in Antarctica (exclusive of the ice sheet) is not well known. However,
modeling suggests that it accounts for the 39% gap between observed and
estimated sea level rise from the world-wide melting of glaciers and ice caps.
The combination of recent advances in satellite resolution (sub-meter) and newly
available photogrammetric software that can construct digital elevation models
without ground control points potentially provides a cost-effective approach for
evaluating glacier volume change in remote regions. The fundamental idea is to
subtract the current topography (digital elevation model) based on satellite
imagery from the topography based on historic maps thus providing changes in
elevation and consequently glacier volume. Uncertainty is derived from on the
apparent elevation differences of bedrock exposures. If successful, this
application will be a powerful tool to quantitatively estimate ice mass loss in
remote regions around Antarctica and significantly increase the accuracy of
estimated glacier contributions to sea level rise. Several challenges are posed
by this approach that justifies the EAGER program: 1) typically cloudy weather
in many areas along the Antarctic coast that precludes imagery acquisition; 2)
construction of DEMs of sufficient accuracy to detect change; and 3)
availability of accurate historic topographic maps.
