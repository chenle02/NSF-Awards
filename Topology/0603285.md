Abstract

Award: DMS-06032852 Principal Investigator: David Gabai, Zoltan Szabo

This grant will support a Topology conference held at Princeton University on
December 10, 2005. This meeting will bring together a wide range of
mathematicians for an intense day of lectures by four very distinguished
researchers. Topics will include minimal surfaces, string topology, topological
field theory and Floer homology and link theory.

The funds will enable the conference organizers to support graduate students,
new Ph. D.'s , underrepresented groups and others without funding.
