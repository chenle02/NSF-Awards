ABSTRACT

16 July 2009 Proposal Number: 0917851 Institution: San Jose State University,
MLML PI: S. Lamerdin Co-PI: K. Coale

The proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the San Jose
State University, MLML for use aboard the R/V POINT SUR; namely an electronic
charting system with monitor, a new Rescue/Operations boat and motor, an
inflatable dive boat, and new Personal Flotation Devises (PFD?s). All items will
either enhance safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.

Broader Impacts: The R/V POINT SUR supports federally funded scientific
research in the Pacific Northwest in order to expand human knowledge of the
ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved
through the State?s Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and
Education program (CI-CORE) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program
(ACT), real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events. The POINT SUR is scheduled to complete over 130 NSF sponsored days in
2009.
