9351403 Hall The project will purchase visible spectrophotometers for use in the
freshman course as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT- IR) spectrometer for
the freshman and sophomore organic course. This equipment will allow a major
upgrade in the chemistry offering at this two year college. This is part of a
continuing effort, begun in 1989 to upgrade the chemistry curriculum and has
included the introduction of microscale experiments which will be enhanced by
the proposed instrumentation. ***
