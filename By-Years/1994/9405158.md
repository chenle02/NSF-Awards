9405158 Miner The University of Oklahoma Department of Mathematics hopes to
purchase a graphic workstation from Silicon Graphics, Inc., and a 486 PC to
serve as a terminal. The equipment would be used to help visualize the geometry
of complex hyperbolic space and its boundary. In particular, we hope to use
interactive three dimensional graphics to develop intuition for a wide array of
problems concerning groups actions and fundamental domains, arc curvature, curve
evolution, and quasiconformal mapping in the often surprising and relatively
unexplored geometry of complex hyperbolic space.
