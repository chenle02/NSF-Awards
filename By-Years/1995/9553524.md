9553524 Wang This proposal seeks support for a three week, residential Young
Scholars project in Engineering for thirty students entering the eleventh or
twelfth grades from Kentucky and the neighboring states. Students will engage in
a series of engineering activities including hands-on computer graphics mini-
research projects, job shadowing and field trips. These activities are designed
to provide an integrated orientation to four areas of engineering including
chemical and materials, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering. During
the fall semester following the summer activity, students will complete a
supervised, individualized project and will be expected to return to the campus
for follow-up activities during Engineering Week.
