This NIRT proposal focuses on a new method for building multi-component nano-
systems out of diverse types of nano-devices. In this method colloidal magnetic
particles will be used as carriers that can deliver different nano-devices to
different locations within the system. Magnetic fields generated using tiny
magnets will be employed to direct the process of assembly of the colloidal
magnetic particles. The new method will be called MAGDA as an abbreviation for
MAGnetically Driven Assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;While magnetic forces can be weaker than surface forces and
chemical binding, they are sufficiently strong and do offer several important
advantages in the process of assembly of heterogeneous nano-
systems.&lt;br/&gt;1) Magnetic forces have a much longer range of action than
chemical and surface forces. &lt;br/&gt;2) Unlike electrostatic fields, magnetic
fields of colloidal particles are not screened by ions in solutions and are
largely independent of the fluid being employed. &lt;br/&gt;3) Magnetic fields
do not interfere with the biological, chemical or electronic functions of
biomolecules, inorganic molecules and/or live cells.&lt;br/&gt;4) Nonlinearity
of ferromagnetic materials used to control the assembly process can be exploited
to obtain repulsive as well as attractive forces, while magnetic memory can be
used for nonvolatile operation. This will be critical in the proposed
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will deal with fundamental
issues related to scaling of critical dimensions down to 100 nm and below,
developing fabrication methods needed to construct various tools for MAGDA
processes, developing computationally efficient numerical models of the assembly
process and demonstrating applications of MAGDA to fabrication of bio-
sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will
have a significant educational impact. It will involve undergraduate students in
developing educational web site on the subject of self-assembly. The
investigators will develop courses related to self-assembly that can be used as
a part of general nanotechnology education effort and as a part of Drexel
University/University of Pennsylvania joint IGERT program on nanotechnology. The
researchers involved will also organize seminars and workshops on topics that
are closely related to the subject of this research. The results of the research
will be employed to make exciting presentations to attract high-school students
and under-represented minorities into higher education in general and into
nanotechnology area in particular.&lt;br/&gt;
