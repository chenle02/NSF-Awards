This research will develop and study a narrative-based programming environment
for Quest Atlantis (QA) to enhance technological fluency and creativity in
schools and after-school centers across the globe. QA is a highly successful
multiuser virtual environment being used by teachers with over 20,000 children
worldwide to support meaningful content learning. Following a systems approach
to creativity, this project will develop a narrative-based programming
environment from which students can develop original transactive stories for
peers. Using the design toolkit to develop personalized projects, students will
learn fundamental computer science programming concepts and skills as they
develop story-algorithms while pursuing creative and open-ended aims such as
designing virtual space narratives. Supporting students in structuring
interactive narratives with innovative programming tools represents a
substantial contribution to computer science education. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead to the development of new technologies to
support human creativity. Elementary and middle school children age 10-15 will
learn fundamental computer science programming concepts and skills, such as
control structures, variables, functions, and debugging as they develop story-
algorithms while pursuing creative and open-ended aims such as designing a
virtual space with narratives of their own choosing. Many of the mechanisms for
creating these interactive stories, the user base to support wide-scale impact,
and the multi-user virtual engine already exist. This research will develop the
narrative scaffolding, the pedagogical resources, and the user interface to
place these tools in the hands of the user. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The new Quest
Atlantis Programming Narrative Toolkit will be made available to all current QA
users and will be promoted to the fast growing user-base to maximize public
distribution. In addition, the research will contribute to wider awareness in
the research community of two important principles. First, employing narrative
to stimulate creative work is a valuable and broadly applicable method. Second,
creativity is best framed within an active social network. This project
characterizes the children's activity in terms uniquely suited to the new
millennium: collaborative, distributed, negotiated, and critical. Indeed, the
social dimension involves not simply the presentation or publication of the
interactive products, but the critical reception and discussion around the work,
contributing to the legitimacy and caliber of the work and, in turn, to the
community and their engagement in practices relating to computer programming and
interactive narrative composition.&lt;br/&gt;
