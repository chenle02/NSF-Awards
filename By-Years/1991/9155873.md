Text and materials for a freshman/sophomore-level geometry course are being
developed. The course will stress descriptive geometry (draping three-
dimensional objects, understanding perspective), tiling and polyhedra (symmetry,
strip patterns, wallpaper groups, space filling shapes), curvature, Euler
characteristic, geometry and the creative arts, exploring geometry through the
method of guided discovery. It will be designed to meet the needs of prospective
elementary and secondary school teachers.The project builds on work begun with
the help of the Exxon Foundation. It includes participation by instructors at a
variety of colleges with whom Cornell has established ties. The project goal is
to produce, field test and commercially publish nineteen units of text, and
course materials.
