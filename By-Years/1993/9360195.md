9360195 Jiang Porous inorganic membranes can be used at high temperatures, and
have high fluxes, mechanical strength and chemical stability. Today's
commercially available inorganic membranes have large pores (&gt;40 A), a wide
pore size distribution and are ideally suited for removing high molecular weight
components from a liquid stream (ultrafiltration). However, because these
membranes operate on Knudsen diffusion, their separation coefficients are far
too low for use in gas separations. On the other hand, zeolite membranes have
much smaller pores and a well defined pore size distribution. since they
separate molecules by molecular sieving, they offer very high selectivity.
Unfortunately, while the potential of zeolite membranes has long been
recognized, there is still no suitable processing method by which either dense
free standing or supported membranes can be made. In Phase I, TDA will prepare
ASM-5 zeolite film on Si)2 and Al2O3 substrates using a novel synthetic method,
and then characterize the chemical composition, morphology, thermal stability
and ion-exchange ability of the resulting films. ***
