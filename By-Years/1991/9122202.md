The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a technology development
project to improve the operating capabilities of Seasoar -- a widely used
undulating towed vehicle that is used for making sustained measurements of
physical, optical and other parameters in the upper 300-400 meters of the ocean
at speeds of 8 knots. This SGER project will develop a set of engineering
parameters to describe and evaluate the hydrodynamics and control of the towed
vehicle in order to make its performance more reliable and predictable in a
variety of sea states and scientific payload configurations. Design
specifications and software will be made freely available to other groups using
the Seasoar. As research interests become more focussed upon the spatial
structure in the upper ocean, a sustained interest in using the Seasoar is
anticipated.
