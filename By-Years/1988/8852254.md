This project supports the engineering technology program at this institution by
enhancing the instrumentation laboratory. Previously existing CAD equipment is
linked to compatible pneumatic and hydraulic test equipment so that students
experience state-of-the-art industrial instrumentation and feedback control
systems. The lab improvement is achieved through the acquisition of Festo
Pneumatic and Hydraulic trainer packages; FESTO Programmable Controller; and
NIDA Rotating Machinery and Synchro/Servo training packages. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
