Research will focus on the role a nest's temperature and moisture has on egg
development in the striped plateau lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, in Arizona. This
field study will provide the first data on environmental conditions in natural
nests for any lizard and should yield fundamental insight into the importance of
the nest environment for successful development and hatching. Data on nesting
and egg survival is critical to understanding a species behavior, reproduction,
and life history. Such knowledge can improve husbandry procedures used for
raising reptiles in captivity, an important consideration with the increasing
number of threatened and endangered species.
