This is a Career Advancement Award (CAA) of the Research Opportunities for
Women Initiative (ROW) that is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division. This will provide Dr. Audrey
Miller, who has had a long career, primarily in teaching, with the resources,
personnel and time to develop a research program. This research explores the
synthetic utility of aminomethane-sulfonic acids, hydrazinoiminomethanesulfonic
acids, aminoiminoacetoninitriles and hydrazinoiminoacetonitriles. The
nucleophilic substitution reactions of these classes of compounds will be
studied with 1) hydroxylamine, 2) a variety of enamines and 3) functionalized
carbanions. The proper choice of reagents will permit the synthesis of a wide
variety of 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-membered heterocyclic ring systems. These may
contain multiple heteroatoms (N,S,0).
