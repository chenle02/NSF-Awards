Almost every object one sees is visually incomplete in the sense that at least
part of it is hidden from view by its own visible surfaces and/or by those of
closer objects. This project will study how people's visual systems accomplish
this task. The research will employ the "primed matching paradigm", in which
people match two figures, as quickly as possible, for physical identity shortly
after seeing an initial "priming" display that depicts a figure partly hidden
from view. The pattern of response times to different shapes in this task can
then be used to infer how people have completed the image of the hidden object
in the priming display. The results should be useful in answering questions
about the process of visual completion and in constraining theories about how
that process unfolds in time. Such questions include the following: (1) How long
does the completion process take? (2) How "completely" are objects completed?
(3) Are the texture and color of the object completed as well as its shape? (4)
What factors influence the way that shapes are completed? This methodology can
be extended to questions concerning other important problems of visual
perception, such as how people see depth in scenes and how they perceive the
transparency of objects.
