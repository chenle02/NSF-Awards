9314013 Kelemen In this project the PIs will extend their experiment of focusing
of a melt flowing through a dissolving porous medium. Their experiments will
include salt (sugar), water, glass balls, and they will heat these from the
bottom. They wish to investigate the conditions under which flow focusing occurs
in the absence of deviatoric stress. In their design water (variably saturated
with salts) will be allowed to run through a flat interface with a column of
glass balls+salt balls. They will also develop numerical models to simulate the
experiments and scale them to the upper mantle conditions. A graduate student at
MIT will mainly do this for her dissertation. The project will be coordinated
between the PIs, the student thesis advisor, and Marc Speigelman (LDEO). ***
