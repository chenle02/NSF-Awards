This project concerns research at the crossroads of representation theory,
algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. The principle of symmetry has
played a crucial role in mathematics since Galois's study of roots of
polynomials, and in physics since Einsteinâ€™s development of special relativity.
Over the past 50 years, new instances of the very idea of symmetry have been
discovered: supersymmetry, and later quantum symmetry, expressed in the form of
the quantum groups. Representation theory comes into the picture as the way to
understand the notion of quantum symmetry, but the very idea of quantum symmetry
and its geometric origins remain elusive. ALong these lines, this project
concerns the study on systems of linear differential equations of one complex
variable, with algebraic coefficients and arbitrary singularities. One of the
main objects of study is the space of solutions of such differential equations
(and their generalizations), Stokes data, reflecting asymptotic properties of
solutions. The PI will investigate quantization of these moduli spaces and its
connections with representation theory and theoretical physics. Quantum geometry
of moduli spaces of Stokes data provides a new geometric approach to quantum
symmetries. It embeds quantum groups and their key properties into a much more
general and geometric framework of the quantized moduli spaces of Stokes data.
This project will provide training and research opportunities for graduate
students in this area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI
will study the quantum geometry of various moduli spaces, using the theory
cluster Poisson varieties as the main tool, and applications to algebraic
geometry, representation Theory, and mathematical physics. In addition, the PI
will study classical and quantum polylogarithms and quantum Hodge field theory.
The main priorities of the project are the following: a) To give a comprehensive
treatment of the cluster structure of moduli spaces of meromorphic connections
with possibly irregular singularities on Riemann surfaces and apply the results
to quantization of these moduli spaces. b) To develop cluster quantization at
roots of unity with applications to representations of DeConcini-Kac quantum
groups and invariants of threefolds. c) To develop the theory of quantum
multiple polylogarithms, providing a quantum deformation of the periods of the
pro-unipotent completion of the motivic fundamental group of the punctured
projective line. d) To further develop quantum Hodge field
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
