****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed research is to
obtain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted roles that disorder can play
in complex materials. Arguably the most exciting and challenging regimes are the
ones in which quantum fluctuations play a significant role. Disordered spin
dimer compounds fall in to this general class of material, providing, at least
in principle, well-controlled access to specific problems of interest, including
Bose glass behavior, random singlet formation, and ordered states that arise as
a consequence of quenched disorder. The proposed research will focus on the
effects of disorder in this class of material, about which relatively little is
known, and from which one can hope to glean important insights relevant to the
broader class of quantum materials. Various chemical substitutions can be used
to create different types and strengths of disorder in a variety of archetypal
compounds, the effects of which will be studied via measurements of the low
temperature thermodynamic properties as a function of the chemical composition.
Single crystals of the materials studied will be grown in the PIs laboratory.
The award will support the education and activities of a graduate student in
these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Disorder of one form or another is remarkably common in
many advanced materials of technological importance, including high-temperature
superconductors and materials exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance. Whether the
disorder is an irrelevant distraction, that simply accompanies, for example,
charge doping, or whether it plays a more central role in determining the
associated phase diagrams of these materials is a matter of ongoing research and
debate. Given the prevalence of disorder in these complex and incompletely
understood materials, it is important to understand its effects in simpler and
better controlled model systems. It is the purpose of this program to study
disordered magnets in regimes which have not previously been extensively
explored, with the broad aim of developing a deeper understanding of the effects
of disorder in the broad class of quantum materials. The project involves both
low temperature measurements, and also an extensive crystal growth effort. This
crystal growth program has a broader impact by serving the larger condensed
matter community via external collaborations, ensuring the wide availability of
contemporary materials for the US condensed matter community, and addressing the
perceived need for increased emphasis on materials synthesis within the US. The
award will support the education of a graduate student in these technologically
important areas.
