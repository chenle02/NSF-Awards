A Biotechnology Laboratory Specialist Program has been implemented at Shoreline
Community College. New equipment (DNA electrophoresis equipment, DNA sequencing
equipment, and protein electrophoresis equipment with associated power supplies,
DNA sequencing software with necessary computer capability) is used in two
sophomore-level biotechnology courses; Molecular Genetics and Recombinant DNA
Techniques. Tissue culture equipment (laminar flow hoods, inverted microscopes,
and liquid nitrogen storage containers) augments a third sophomore level course;
Tissue Culture Techniques. A Biotechnology Advisory Committee, composed of
representatives from academia and industry, act as consultants for the program.
