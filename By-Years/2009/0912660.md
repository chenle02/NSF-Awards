This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop and
commercialize a powerful new diagnostic assay platform for quantitative analysis
of plasma from human blood using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The platform
will form the basis for generating novel high-throughput diagnostic assays
requiring minimal sample handling and processing that can be performed in an
hour on a single drop of blood. Output is in the form of a melting curve, or
thermogram. Each thermogram provides a highly sensitive and specific signature
for a variety of disease states including various cancers, auto-immune and
infectious diseases. Thermograms establish a powerful new vista from which to
view plasma diagnostics and provide an excellent complement to more traditional
plasma diagnostic methods (electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) that separate
plasma/serum proteins based on their mass and charge.

The broader impacts of this research stem from the multiplicity of applications
provided by the platform to be developed. These applications include: (1) Early
stage disease detection, (2) Distinction between different stages of disease,
remission and relapse (disease progression), (3) Assessing effects of
therapeutic regimens and therapeutic monitoring, and (4) Identification of
therapeutic targets for drug development (i.e. biomarker discovery). The
universal platform provided by the plasma thermogram technology allows for the
capability of detecting, diagnosing and monitoring a variety of very important
diseases with high, unmet medical needs. This provides a multi-billion dollar
opportunity for the commercialized plasma thermogram technology platform and
diagnostic assays.
