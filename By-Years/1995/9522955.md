9522955 Rogers A critical facet of the U.S. Global Change Research Program is
its explicit effort to improve communications among scientists conducting global
change research and the decision makers in both the public and private sectors
who value and use such the results of scientific research. One of the most
important settings for this type of exchange have been the annual global change
conferences sponsored by the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan
(ERIM). This award provides partial support to cover publication costs of this
year's conference proceedings, the title of which is "Understanding Earth:
Retrospectives and Visions." As has been true of past ERIM conferences, this
year's gathering will bring together scientists and decision makers to examine
new knowledge and critical issues related to global change. Previous conferences
have been well attended, and the proceedings have become valuable statements of
the "current state of understanding." The conference will be held in Washington,
D.C. in early April. Because of the valuable role that the ERIM conference plays
in fostering dialogue among scientists and decision makers in both the private
and public sectors, NSF has provided support in the past. Publication of the
proceedings will provide a tangible record of conference publications and
discussions, thereby enhancing the value of the conference for those in
attendance and for others.
