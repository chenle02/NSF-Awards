9504002 Gottlieb New spectral multi-domain methods for unsteady hyperbolic
problems in complex geometries will be developed further and implemented on
scalable parallel computer architectures. These schemes are based on the use of
a penalty term for enforcing the boundary/patching conditions and the schemes
may proven asymptotically stable. A new approach to spectral methods will allow
for unstructured grids in the individual subdomains. Combining these two novel
approaches will result in an algorithm with full geometric flexibility.
