Exploratory experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of
developing large-scale cultivation methods for producing "lymphokine activated
killer cells" (LAKs). Recent clinical trials have shown that these types of
cells have strong anti-tumor activity. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI)
treatments for cancer involve the administration of such cells to aptients to
induce tumor regression. One ACI method involves the extrocorporeal treatment of
a patient's own lymphocytes obtained by leukapheresis with the lymphokine
interleukin-2. These cells are then reinfused back into the patient. Additional
interleukin-2 is also administered to the patient. A series of experiments will
be conducted to find alternative methods for activating lymphocytes, to scale-up
methods for producing LAKs, and to manipulate cell-culturing conditions.
