In the modern, evolving workplace there exists a need to support workers in
adapting to novel demands and opportunities. Traditionally, human judgments are
characterized by weighted strategies where tradeoffs between decision criteria
are made. For example, college admissions committees consider multiple facets of
an applicant and, often, a poor grade point average can be compensated by a
superior entrance exam score. However, on occasions in which time stress or high
workload exists, human judgments are typically rule-based where factors are not
weighted. For instance, an air traffic controller is likely to diagnose
potential problems in high workload situations based on a few salient cues.

This research will add to the growing body of knowledge concerning the way in
which a decision environment influences the strategy used by decision makers.
While characterizations such as weighted and rule-based strategies have been
deduced from a multitude of experimental studies, no framework exists to model
and predict shifts in judgment strategy in individual decision makers. The
central theme of this research is to create a mathematical framework to model
the shift from a weighted to a rule-based strategy, and vice versa, in work
environments where workload and stress levels vary. This research will build
upon existing work to create a model which infers judgment rules from human
data. Multiple experiments will be conducted to compare the performances of the
rule-based model with a commonly-used weighted model under varying workload and
time stress situations. It is hypothesized that increasing workload and time
stress will promote a systematic shift from weighted to rule-based strategies.
This work will make a valuable contribution toward understanding decision making
in complex, dynamic environments. One potential implication of this research is
the design of an aiding mechanism that adapts to the needs of the user based on
conditions of dynamic work environments.
