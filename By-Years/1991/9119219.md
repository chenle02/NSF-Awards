This award funds continuing development and operation of a unique facility, the
University of Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner. This device digitizes, at high
speed, pairs of plates, such as those of the Palomar Sky Survey, permitting
sophisticated func- tions such as astrometry, photometry, and pattern
recognition. In the next three years, digitization of the first Palomar Sky
survey will be completed and made available, on line, to the astronomical
community, and work will be started on the second Palomar survey, providing
important comparison data.
