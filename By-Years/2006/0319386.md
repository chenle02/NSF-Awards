This small business innovative research Phase I project proposes a new method
for electro-optic&lt;br/&gt;control of light on planar waveguides. Currently,
electro-optic control of light on silica-on-silicon&lt;br/&gt;planar optical
waveguides is by the thermo-optic effect, which is slow, consumes high power and
exhibits a small effect. The new method provides unprecedented levels of optical
phase delay, requires low power and moderate voltages, and exhibits response
times under 10 microseconds. The method can be used to steer beams, tune
waveguide gratings and control coupling between channels, thus enabling a new
class of integrated electro-optic devices on silicon substrates. The Phase I
project will demonstrate a large electro-optic modulation index and demonstrate
a waveguide beamsteer with 10 degrees of steering capability within the
waveguide. It will also explore methods of manufacturing integrated optical
circuits using this technology. Phase II will design and build an integrated
optic such as a waveguide Fourier transform spectrometer, barcode scanner, or
CD/DVD pickup with dynamic tracking and
focusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications of this technology
include waveguide spectrometers for chemical sensing, identification of solvents
and plastics, and mobile emissions monitoring. Other commercial applications
include barcode scanners, CD/DVD optical pickups, free-space optical
communications, beamsteering for angle-multiplex holographic data storage, and
optical interconnects for computer backplanes.&lt;br/&gt;
