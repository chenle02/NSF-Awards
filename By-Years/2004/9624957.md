Wavelet based numerical techniques are becoming important in many areas of
science and engineering because they provide powerful analytic and algorithmic
tools. This project consists of a broadly based program of fundamental and
applied research directed at advancing the state of the art of wavelet based
numerical modeling, computation, and analysis tools. This program is centered
around three fundamental components: 1) Second generation wavelets; 2)
hierarchical geometry descriptions; 3) construction of robust and scalable
algorithms for the numerical solution of potential problems over 3D domain. This
research will go hand in hand with educational initiatives which aim to move
insights from research directly into the relevant practice of students and
external engineers and researchers.
