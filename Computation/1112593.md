The objective of this work is to investigate four fundamentally new ideas, with
high potential impact, for improving accuracy and efficiency in fluid flow
simulations. Each of these ideas is a fundamentally new approach to well-known
challenges in flow simulation, is built from a solid mathematical foundation,
and is motivated by the idea that more physically accurate models and numerical
methods will produce more accurate results. The main ideas proposed for study
are 1) development of the new velocity-vorticity-helicity formulation of the
Navier-Stokes equations, 2) investigation of numerical methods for improving
mass conservation in finite element methods that approximate velocity with
piecewise continuous elements, 3) development of enhanced physics based schemes
for flow problems that enforce discrete conservation laws in addition to energy
(e.g. helicity in Navier-Stokes, cross-helicity in magnetohydrodynamics), 4)
improving numerical methods for approximate deconvolution models of turbulence.

Simulating incompressible viscous fluid flow is an important subtask in most
every engineering application involving the flow of water, oil, and/or most
other liquids. The ability to accurately and efficiently simulate these flows
leads to improved engineering designs, improves turn-around time for designs,
and also significant cost savings when testing is done on a computer model
instead of a physical model. However, modern computational methods for
performing these simulations remain unreliable on many problems of interest.
This project will improve the state-of-the-art methods by developing/improving
methods with a solid mathematical foundation, better enforcing the physical
fidelity in simulations (i.e. avoiding non-physical solutions), and improving
efficiency in the simulation techniques. Furthermore, the models and methods
developed herein will have the potential to make an impact on the related
systems of equations that govern atmospheric flow, oceanic flow, and climate
modeling. Broader impacts for this project includes training of graduate and
undergraduate students in this field of research, the writing of a book on
models for fluid simulation, and outreach to high school students.
