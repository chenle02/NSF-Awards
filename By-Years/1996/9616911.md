ABSTRACT DBI-9616911 Ruddle This award provides support for a small workshop to
consider the implications of changes underway in institutions of higher learning
of all types, especially as they have implications for research and education in
the biological sciences. These changes reflect changes in the relationship of
government and academic institutions and, in turn, changes in the perceptions of
the institutions and their faculty as they view of their own roles in society.
Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the impetus for change
comes from lack of growth in support for faculty research by Federal agencies,
increased emphasis on teaching by the largest institutions, and changing
patterns of employment among graduates. The effects of these changes on
institutional policy and practice, and their implications for Federal agencies
that fund research and education in the biological sciences will be explored.
