Computer models of wind flow around and across terrain are important for topics
such as weather forecasting, wind energy, and air pollution. Unfortunately,
these models still struggle in complex terrain. To address these problems, a
group of US scientists is planning on joining an existing European wind energy
study in order to collect a reference data set with a set of instruments that
will provide unprecedented views of the flow over two parallel hills in
Portugal. This data set will likely be used in modeling studies for decades to
come. This award provides funding for the planning activities to enhance the US
contribution to the campaign.

The Perdigao Field Experiment will take place in 2017 in Portugal, mainly funded
by a consortium of European countries interested in wind energy resource
planning. The US component of the project would bring additional instrumentation
and a more basic science focus on microscale meteorology in complex terrain. The
award that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document
and serves as the scientific basis for the campaign. Individual science
proposals will be reviewed separately.
