This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
verifying the correctness of hardware/software computer designs. The project
involves the research groups of Ganesh C. Gopalakrishnan at the University of
Utah and Dominique Mery of the University Henri Poincare in Nancy, France. The
US research program addresses the development of formal methods tailored for
industrial-scale designs. These efforts are aimed at the development of formal
verification methods. The French research program on formal methods applied to
concurrent systems, temporal logic and b-tools complements the ongoing research
of the US group. The project will advance understanding of the application of
formal verification methods to computer design.
