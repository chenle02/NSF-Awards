Because insects have exoskeletons, they must molt in order to increase in the
size. There are dramatic ontogenetic fluctuations in grasshopper jumping ability
as animals molt and reproduce. Insects that walk or run may also experience molt
related changes in locomotor performance. This study will investigate how the
kinetics, kinematics, and energetics of locomotion change over ontogeny in the
cockroach Blaberus discoidalis. These changes will be related to the effect of
the molt cycle on properties of the muscle and cuticle, and computer models and
simulations will be used to explore how alterations in the rates of such
developmental changes could affect the dynamics of ontogenetic locomotor
performance. This work will therefore integrate physiology, the material
properties of skeletal elements, and the locomotor performance of intact animals
to provide tests of the functional importance of musculoskeletal design and
provide data on how locomotion is affected by the molt cycle. This will
represent the first such data ever collected on any pedestrian arthropod.
