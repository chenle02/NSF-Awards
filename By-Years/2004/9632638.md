This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology
student from Harvard University. The project is to study how an Islamic society
in Indonesia interprets outside influences for the local community members in
general, and how local Islamic identity is formed in light of local commitments
towards both modernization and tradition. Using ethnographic techniques of
participant observation, a survey of 100 households in each community, and
videotaping of ceremonies and social occasions that will then be used to
question people about meanings, the student will study two local communities and
three activities: a religious festival, a religious drama, wedding ceremonies.
The specific hypothesis to be tested is that attitudes of local Islamic
leadership towards modernity, local ethnic traditions, and religious piety will
exert a powerful influence on local responses to national-level pressures to
blend with a national identity. This project will contribute to advancing
knowledge concerning ethnicity and will offer insights into how local practices
are shaped by religious institutions and how this is related to perceptions of
ethnic identity. The project will advance our understanding of how Islam factors
into the everyday practices of Indonesians, and contribute to the nation's
expertise about this important area of South Asia.
