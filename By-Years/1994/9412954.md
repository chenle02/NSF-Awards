9412954 Brown Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the connection
of Rio Grande University to the Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which
is the NSF mid-level network that serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of
OARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between
institutions, including those outside the state. OARnet will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the six universities a 56
thousand bit per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million
bits per second) National Backbone network. The university needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
