9302379 Bluestein The purpose of the proposed research is to improve the
physical understanding of the processes responsible for the formation and
evolution of serve convective storms. Special attention will be given to
tornadic supercells initiated near the dryline and to the development of
analysis techniques using data from an airborne Doppler radar and from a surface
mesonetwork. The objectives will be met in large part through the analysis of
data from a NOAA P 3 airborne Doppler radar, from a PAM surface mesonetwork, and
from mobile CLASS soundings collected during the cooperative Oklahoma Profiler
Studies (COPS 91) experiment held during the spring of 1991. There will also be
analysis of data from the new Oklahoma Mesonet, dual Doppler radar data from a
1981 field program conducted by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL),
mobile soundings, wind Profiler data, and visual documentation of storm
features. ***
