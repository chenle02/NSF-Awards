Moduli theory concerns itself with understanding all possible shapes the space
can have. For example, if one takes a rectangle and identifies opposite edges,
one obtains a cylinder, and further identifying the remaining edges gives what
mathematicians call a torus - the surface of a donut. Starting with rectangles
of different shapes one ends up with different tori. Furthermore, one can also
do similar identifications starting with parallelograms, to get more tori. It
can be proven that the such tori are intrinsically different - if one lives on
the surface of a torus and cannot see the whole surface from far away, one can
still distinguish the kind of parallelogram that was used to build the torus.
The moduli space of tori is then the set of all possible shapes of tori that are
intrinsically different. Amazingly enough this "set of shapes" itself is a nice
geometric object. This project deals with posing problems of similar type: of
classifying some geometric objects, together with some further information on
them, and of studying the resulting moduli spaces.

The project aims to understand better the geometry of various compact moduli
spaces. Together with various collaborators, the PI will construct a modular
compactification of the moduli space of complex curves together with a
differential with prescribed multiplicities of zeroes, compactifying the so-
called strata - phase spaces in Teichmuller dynamics. Real-normalized
meromorphic differentials will be applied to bound the number of cusps of plane
curves of a given degree. The project also will investigate the birational
geometry and homology of various compactifications of the moduli spaces of cubic
threefolds. Lastly the project will continue the investigations on homology and
higher dimensional cycles on moduli spaces of abelian varieties.
