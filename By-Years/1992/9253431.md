This proposal focuses on the experiences of emerging women scientists. It charts
recent developments in Duke University's efforts to address the
underrepresentation of women in science and it proposes a model project to open
conversations about the mentor-student relationship. The design of the model
project is based on a series of discussions among women scientists (faculty and
graduate students) and between these scientists and this project's
investigators. Advanced graduate students in science report to us that they
confront mentoring practices and interpersonal behaviors which discourage their
advancement. They argue that these practices and behaviors are seldom described
or discussed openly among colleagues and so continue to influence women
students' sense of their professional abilities and opportunities, even in the
most well meaning of departments. Our goal is to initiate conversations within
the science community about issues related to the education of women as
scientists, in order to identify and define the daily obstacles encountered by
graduate women in science, sensitize faculty advisers/mentors to these
obstacles, discuss faculty advisers' and mentors' concerns about their
interactions with graduate women, introduce emerging women scientists to the
perspectives that inform diverse mentoring approaches and styles, and develop an
approach to evaluating the educational environment for women.
