To improve the effectiveness of drug discovery, there is a critical need for
real-time physiological assays that are capable of measuring 3D living tissues
responding to drugs. This project plans to establish a small and robust platform
that can be placed in pharmaceutical R&D laboratories for peer testing and
evaluation. Biodynamic imaging may enable discovery of new dynamic processes
within tissues initiated by applied drugs and will establish the physiological-
molecular mechanism-of-action connection that has been so elusive in drug
discovery. Biodynamic imaging provides a physiological phenotypic profile that
complements molecular target-based drug discovery. Once the connection between
biodynamics and cellular function has been established, biodynamic imaging will
become the tool of preference for investigations of tissue-based functional
mechanisms.

This project has the potential to lay the foundation for biodynamic imaging to
become a new imaging tool with a broad array of future biomedical applications.
These potential applications include the discovery of new drug candidates with
lower side effects and lower costs to consumers, the selection of cancer
chemotherapy specifically tuned to the patient to improve outcomes and patient
quality of life, and improvement in the success rate of in vitro fertilization
to reduce health-care costs and remove medical complications of multiple births.
Because biodynamic imaging is a general imaging technique that accesses a
universal property of living tissue, it can become a workhorse laboratory tool
placed in virtually every life sciences laboratory.
