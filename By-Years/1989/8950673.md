Shared computer resources among the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer
Science, and Mathematics are providing students with an important simulated
laboratory environment. Thirty-five computer workstations are being utilized in
a teaching laboratory to provide students with hands-on experience which for
reasons of cost, safety, or ethics cannot always be provided in traditional
undergraduate laboratory settings. A science computing laboratory also provides
students with opportunities for self-directed experimentation and learning. The
shared resources enhance the curriculum of both science majors as well as
introductory courses of non-science majors. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
