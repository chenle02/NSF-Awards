This project provides core operational support to enable the ongoing work of
START International to develop comprehensive science capacity development
programs, projects and actions in Africa and Asia. Support for START serves to
advance the strategic aims the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) with
respect to the US Government’s commitment to supporting stronger scientific
capacities in low and middle-income countries. START is able to accomplish this
through USGCRP's core support of its operations that allows the organization to
seek broader support for projects and other activities from other governments,
private foundations, and multilateral bodies. Core support for START is critical
for advancing the organization’s mission to cultivate, inspire and connect
emerging science leaders in Africa and Asia to work with societal partners in
creating a more sustainable and equitable future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will enable START to create new programs and partnerships that provide
comprehensive capacity development in Africa and Asia through skill-building,
scientific leadership, and experiential learning. START’s work primarily targets
early-career researchers and sustainability professionals who engage with global
change science in the areas of adaptation, climate finance, renewable energy,
human health and climate, and urban resilience among other themes. In the period
covered by this project, START will continue to build on its collaborations with
Future Earth and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), and in doing so
bring START's knowledge and expertise to these collaborations, such as through a
collaboration with the WCRP in developing new actions in Africa related to the
emerging Regional Information for Society project, and with Future Earth related
to skill building for transdisciplinary research and science
leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
