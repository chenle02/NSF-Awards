The PIs have recently developed an econometric model to examine the impact of
space weather on the wholesale price of electricity. They have worked with the
"PJM" power pool in eastern North America, incorporating Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.
Previous results have indicated the presence of space weather effects on the
price of electricity. In fact, these results show that the real-time price is
affected by even moderate geomagnetic storms and that the estimated average
impact is a nontrivial 4.5 percent of the real-time PJM price. This new proposal
seeks to refine the original estimate using local magnetometer data as a measure
of space weather, as opposed to the Dst index that had been exploited
previously. The PIs also want to examine the space weather impact on other power
grids, including "NordPool" (the power grid for Sweden, Finland, Norway, and
Denmark), the California Power Pool, and others.
