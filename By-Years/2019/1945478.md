Many phenomena in mathematics and mathematical physics are described by systems
of polynomial equations. The set of solutions of such a system of equations can
have a very complicated and interesting shape. Typically the equations involve
numbers which are regarded as “parameters.” The problem of determining how the
geometric properties of the set of solutions change as one varies these
parameters is called a “moduli problem,” and moduli problems are important to
many subjects in algebra and geometry. This project will introduce a new
approach to studying moduli problems, as well as applications of this new
approach to several open problems inspired by high energy theoretical physics.
The PI will work towards the training of students in this research field,
through research projects with undergraduate students, mentoring of graduate
students, and lectures aimed to k-12 students. One of the PI's goals is to build
connections with industry where machine learning is involved.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the Principal Investigator will use recent
developments in the theory of algebraic stacks and derived algebraic geometry to
develop a general approach to moduli problems in algebraic geometry. The PI’s
recent work on extending the methods and results of geometric invariant theory
to arbitrary moduli problems has led to a relatively complete framework for
constructing moduli spaces and for breaking large moduli problems into pieces
which are easier to study. This project investigates some extensions of the
foundational aspects of this work, as well as applications to several problems
in enumerative geometry. The project also proposes applications to studying
derived categories of coherent sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
