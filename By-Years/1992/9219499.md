Topographic uplift is a common feature of collisional tectonic zone, however
the timing of uplift, rates and changes in rates of uplift are not well known
and their causes poorly understood. This project will use relatively newly
developed tectonic geomorphology tools to determine uplift patterns in the
Southern Alps of New Zealand, which are forming from active oblique collision
between the Australian and Pacific plates. The tectonic interaction produces
right-lateral and reverse slip across the Alpine fault, accompanied by
spectacular uplift. The project would investigate uplift by mountain front
pattern-discrimination approaches, examine faulted river terraces and moraines
to constrain the rate of slip in the late Quaternary, and study longitudinal
profiles of river terraces and channels within the western Southern Alps to seek
evidence of systematic knickpoint development and terrace divergence from the
modern channel. Results should provide a firmer neotectonic framework for
testing geodynamics of orogenesis.
