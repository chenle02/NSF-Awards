The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Large Dense Transportation Problems with Cost Values Given by a
Metric." Support of the project will assist a well trained, Hispanic
Mathematician to improve his research capability and to complete the planning
and development of a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if
successful, will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to
compete for MRI and other research support.
