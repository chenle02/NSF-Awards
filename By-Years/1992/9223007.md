This award is for support of a project to study the processes of debris
entrainment at the base of the Matanuska Glacier. Conventional theories of
sediment entrainment rely on pressure- induced melting and refreezing around
obstacles at the glacier sole. Evidence from preliminary work around the
glacier, however, suggest that ice and sediment is underplated to the glacier
base by a process of net freeze-on. Theoretical calculations for water flow in
subglacial conduits indicate that conditions necessary for freezing can only
exist where water flows uphill out of an overdeepening. A better understanding
of this process will shed light on the factors controlling glacier movement and
till genesis.
