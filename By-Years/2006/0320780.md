Abstract

The Fields Institute is running a workshop on Infinite Dimensional Lie Theory
and Its Applications, July 17-25, 2003. The workshop has been approved by the
Scientific Advisory Panel for funding of $25000 Canadian by the Fields
Institute. The funding from the NSF will support young American mathematicians
who wish to participate. The workshop is a follow up of one-term program on
``Infinite Dimensional Lie Theory and Its Applications'' taken place at the
Field Institute in the fall of 2000. The goal of the proposed conference is to
present some of the most important advances in Lie theory since the 2000
program. This will allow the vibrant North-American Lie community to build on
the momentum gained through the last program. There will be an instructional
component during the first three days (Thursday, July 17 through Saturday, July
19) featuring three series of lectures. These will be given by prominent people
covering topics of current interest. The conference is scheduled from Monday,
July 21 to Friday, July 25. It will feature invited lectures by seniors
lectures. In addition, all of the junior participants in the Fields 2000 Lie
Theory program will be invited to give 30 minutes presentations.

Infinite dimensional Lie algebras appear as symmetries of a wide class of
systems and objects. The theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras such as
Kac-Moody Lie algebras and vertex algebras have developed rapidly during the
last two decades. This development has various applications to many branches in
mathematics and physics such as integrable system, topology, geometry, number
theory, conformal field theory and string theory. An integral and important part
of the proposed conference is to provide opportunities for young mathematicians
to collaborate with leading experts in Lie theory, to learn the most important
development in the field, and to show off their accomplishments in front of the
international leaders in the area.
