This project will partially support the research visits of U.S. scholars in the
mathematical sciences to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES) in
Bures-sur-Yvette, France. This international institute is comparable to the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and, in addition to
support from the National Science Foundation, is supported in part by science
agencies in a number of other countries. Areas of research at the IHES include
algebraic geometry and number theory, group representations and invariants,
harmonic analysis, convex sets and analysis, geometry and topology, discrete
groups in relation with algebra, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and
ergodic theory, and general relativity and cosmology.
