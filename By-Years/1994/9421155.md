The study will address long-standing and sometimes contentious issues concerning
the federal government s ability to accurately project future supplies and
demands for scientific and engineering personnel with particular attention on
the doctoral-level workforce. The adequacy of the United States technical
workforce to meet the needs of federal programs (e.g., in defense, energy, space
and health research), as well as the broader needs of an open technological
economy, have been the focus of policy concerns by the federal government for
many decades. The situation has become even more confusing in recent years
because of the confluence of many contradictory trends that influence both
supplies and demands for such human resources (e.g., the end of the Cold War and
growing international economic competitiveness). This study will address the
need to improve our ability to make more accurate long-term projections of the
technical workforce and, perhaps as important, a need to develop better means
for integrating such information into public and private decision-making at all
levels of our society. A 12-member committee will be formed to carry out this
study over an 18-month period. The committee will be composed of a balanced
membership of individuals including labor-market economists, other social
scientists knowledgeable about the broader social implications of being able to
make (and use) effective long-range workforce projections, and public policy
representatives with experience in dealing with the needs of high-level policy
officials in the Congress and the executive branch
