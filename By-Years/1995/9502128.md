ABSTRACT Manglik U/ Cincinnati CTS-9502128 The research in this proposal will
aid in understanding the effect of non-Newtonian fluids (which includes most
fluids in the food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, chemical
processing and biomedical industries) on heat transfer due to convection in duct
flow and in pool boiling. The experimental work will be complemented by a
numerical study of flow through geometries of the type common to extended
surface heat exchangers. This work could affect the future design of heat
exchange equipment used in the industries mentioned above. The educational plan
will bring the research program directly into the classroom through introduction
of a senior elective course in Industrial Heat Exchange Engineering and Design
and the development of new experiments in the undergraduate heat transfer and
fluid mechanics laboratory. These will involve modern measurement methods such
as liquid crystal thermography, LDV, and contemporary flow measurement
techniques, as well as experiments that demonstrate heat transfer measurements
in contemporary applications such as plate-fin exchangers, heat recovery
systems, and micro-electronic cooling.
