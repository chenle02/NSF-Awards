This is an experimental and theoretical program on the statistical mechanics
and kinetics of microstructure evolution. The experimental approach developed
for creating and analyzing well-characterized microstructures from partially
solidified unary melts is extended to binary metallic alloys and organic
systems. A new statistical theory of phase coarsening based solely on self
similarity and global microstructure constraints is pursued. Thermal decay
measurements and quantitative stereology is employed to provide a definitive
link between the meanfield and lengthscale descriptions of evolving
microstructures.
