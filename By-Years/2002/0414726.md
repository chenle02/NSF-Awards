This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
to Professor Joseph Templeton at the University of North Carolina addresses new
approaches to catalytic stereoselective synthesis and C-H functionalization. One
method of promoting stereoselective intramolecular ligand reactions will be
delved by preparing complexes with terminal alkyne ligands adjacent to reactive
ligands. Since terminal alkyne C-H sites are particularly susceptible to attack,
metallacycles are plausible intermediates in new ligand transformations. A
second method is to capitalize on the analogy between four-electron donor alkyne
ligands and eta2-nitrile ligands by constructing coordination spheres that will
favor pi-coordination of nitriles, which promise to promote intramolecular
ligand reactions. Efforts to activate alkanes and arenes with platinum reagents
and saturated cycloalkane solvents under mild conditions will be continued with
B(C6F5)3 as the activating Lewis acid. The major broader impact is motivating
and training undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims toward more efficient and selective catalytic conversion of organic
molecules to useful products. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive
training in organic synthesis, catalysis development and spectroscopic
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
