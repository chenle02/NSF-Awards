Indiana University will establish a comprehensive program for training
elementary teachers in science which will include the following activities: (1)
revision of introductory science courses to emphasize conceptual understanding
and the application of computer technology; (2) the establishment of a "science
specialist" curriculum; (3) the development of an interdisciplinary science
capstone course for the science specialists; (4) the creation of a special
science methods course for the science specialists emphasizing computer
technology and new teaching approaches such as group learning, the learning
cycle, constructivism, and science misconceptions; (5) the establishment of a
program of Saturday Science Experiences for elementary children in the
community; (6) the development of computer-assisted lessons on mathematical
concepts in science; (7) training a network of mentor teachers in the local
community through a series of summer workshops; and (7) an inservice program for
all elementary teachers in the local school system. The cost- sharing by the
University and the local school system is $342,254, which is 27% of NSF's
