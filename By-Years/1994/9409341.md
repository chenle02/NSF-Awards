This project explores approaches for automatically restructuring code to
improve the performance of cache memories for scientific applications.
Specifically, the project examines experimentally the following techniques: (1)
loop optimization guided by a new performance metric that includes the effects
of cache performance and floating-point computation on execution speed, (2) the
enhancement of cache line replacement algorithms by using compiler generated
knowledge of future reference patterns, and (3) the use of compiler generated
cache hit and miss information by the instruction scheduler to hide latency on
architectures having non-blocking caches. Each of these methods is implemented
in an experimental compiler and evaluated on advanced microprocessors. The
success of the project represents a significant step towards achieving fully
automatic memory hierarchy management.
