This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at Cornell University at the Center for Nanoscale Systems in Information
Technologies, an NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC) established
in 2001. The program will support twelve students per year for research
opportunities in nanotechnology. The central emphasis of this program is on
providing each participant with a stimulating research experience and an
effective introduction to nanotechnology research. The program is also designed
to provide participants with new skills and resources to advance their research
capabilities through short courses on topics that are not addressed in the
standard undergraduate engineering and science curriculum. These will include
short workshops on technical writing and public speaking; and short course
lectures and hands-on experience with scanned probe instrumentation, metal
machining, electronics, lithography, and pattern-transfer. Students will be
recruited from throughout the United States for an opportunity to (1) experience
independent research; (2) develop practical skills for research activities; (3)
gain in-depth perspective on opportunities in nanotechnology and in
interdisciplinary science and engineering; (4) become a part of the
nanotechnology research community; and (5) recognize that effective reporting
and dissemination of results is an integral part of research. The targeted
undergraduate participants will be non-Cornell university students with a
particular focus on students from institutions that are not major research
institutions and students from population groups underrepresented in research
fields in engineering in the United States.
