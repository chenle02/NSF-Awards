In this research the principal investigator will pursue further the
representation theory of general linear groups. In particular, there is good
reason to suppose that new light can be shed on the classical theory of
representations in the describing characteristic by subsuming this theory as a
special case of the constructions of the principal investigator and his
coworker. The major goal of the proposed work is to investigate other classical
groups extending the techniques developed by the principal investigator in
previous work, with the aim of obtaining a classification of the simple
representations of these groups. For this, Hecke algebras associated with Weyl
groups have to be studied. In view of the key role of these algebras in the
whole field this might be of interest by itself, providing more detailed
information on Hecke algebras applicable to related topics.
