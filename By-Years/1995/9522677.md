Funds are requested to purchase a state-of-the-art 600 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer with triple- resonance and pulse-field gradient
accessories to be used by three major groups in the Department of Chemistry and
the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, and by several minor users in
the Department of Chemistry This instrument is needed to provide high-resolution
and high-sensitivity homo-nuclear multi-dimensional NMR capabilities for
carrying out many new NIH-funded research projects and several new directions
derived from existing NIH-funded projects. Theses include structural and
functional studies of signaling proteins, transcriptional regulation and DNA
repair by proteins, and structural immunology and virology, all of which rely on
successful determination of three-dimensional structures of biological
macromolecules in solution.
