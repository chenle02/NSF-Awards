This project addresses some broad issues in climate change uncertainties using a
2D Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM). In particular, the main
objectives are to (1) strengthen parametric representation in the current ISAM
framework, and (2) use the strengthened ISAM framework to evaluate the impact of
key feedback processes within the climate system involving atmospheric CO2,
global warming, the hydrological cycle, ocean circulation, the marine carbon
cycle, and their contribution to spatial and temporal changes in ocean carbon
uptake. A focus will be on the investigation of possible changes in the
Thermohaline Circulation (THC) and its impact on ocean biology, on the
distribution of temperature and tracers in the ocean, the evolution of the
atmospheric CO2 concentration, and atmospheric temperature change.

ISAM results will be compared with other 2-D and 3-D atmosphere-ocean general
circulation models

This research has the potential to increase knowledge and understanding of
physical processes that influence the concentration levels of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere. This is turn is important for assessing the role of human-
induced forcing on climate change, an important societal issue.
