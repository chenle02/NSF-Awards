9307689 Crawford The involvement of peroxidases in lignin depolymerization and
cellulose delignification, and their relationship to the activities of
cellulases, hemicellulases, and esterases during lignocellulose degradation, is
to be examined. Two hypotheses are to be tested: (1) peroxidases are essential
for actinomycete-mediated lignin depolymerization; and (2) peroxidase activity
is the rate-limiting step in lignin solubilization. If both these hypotheses are
true, then overexpressing peroxidases should enhance the lignin solubilizing
activity of the Streptomyces strains being investigated. ***
