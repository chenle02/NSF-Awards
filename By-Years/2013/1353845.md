Neurons sense information from the environment and transform it into adaptive
behaviors. This project will identify how identified neurons in the simplified
nervous system of a tractable experimental organism accomplish this feat. To
perform such transformations neurons must store information. Thus, a
complimentary goal of the project is to study the changes in neurons as they
form memories. To enhance the project's societal benefits, the investigators
will link the research to educational opportunities for undergraduates, with a
particular focus on Latino students. Undergraduate students will participate in
the research at Yale University and share their newly acquired knowledge with
the public through podcasts targeted for lay-audiences. Podcasts will be
transmitted via CienciaPR.org and radio stations, particularly, but not
exclusively, in Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this
project is to determine the role of specific neurons and specific synapses in
transforming thermal sensory information into thermotaxis behavior. The effort
is based on an interdisciplinary collaboration with Dr. Aravi Samuel lab at
Harvard University, and novel experimental paradigms that allow the team to
investigate sensory signal transduction in the experimental model organism C.
elegans. The research team will achieve the study aims by perturbing molecules
at synapses in specific cells, and then imaging neural activity as they quantify
the effects of synaptic disruption on thermotaxis behaviors. The expected
outcome is a comprehensive understanding of the role of specific synapses and
single cells in the processing of thermosensory information and the emergence of
thermotaxis behavior. In a broader sense, the project is expected to reveal new
principles of intercellular communication that are conserved across taxa, thus
advancing science's understanding of the link between behaviors and underlying
neural circuits.
