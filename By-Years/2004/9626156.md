This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research and education by Dr. Cynthia K. Schauer of the Chemistry
Department, University of North Carolina, on the synthesis of molecular clusters
containing transition metals. The synthetic strategy is to prepare molecular
`modules` that can be linked to form more complex structures. Emphasis will be
placed on understanding how changes in the `modules` affect the electronic
interactions between the components once they are assembled. Three types of
clusters will be synthesized: redox-active metal-bridged variable-length chains
based on iron-phosphide modules; metal inidene chains in which the chains are
singly or doubly bridged and differ in conjugation as a result of varying the
presence of P, As, or Sb; dendrimeric structures containing transition metals
with designed redox centers. This research expands the boundaries of rational
synthesis of extended inorganic molecular materials. Theoretical and
experimental approaches will be used to probe the electronic properties of these
materials and acquire fundamental information concerning their potential in
electronic applications.
