CBET-0824814&lt;br/&gt;Stephen D. Parker, Water Science and Technology Board
(WSTB) of the National&lt;br/&gt;Academies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is in partial support of the Water Science and
Technology Board (WSTB) of the National Academies for "core support". The WSTB
provides continuity in the conduct of the National Research Council's advisory
activities in water resources, in an attempt to assure that this vital area
receives attention appropriate to the role that water plays in furthering the
national interest. The funds would be used to provide continuing support for
operation and administration of the WSTB, including the cost of strategic
planning, program development, and the establishment of groups of experts who
would be convened to work on specific issue-oriented projects suggested by the
agencies or initiated by the Board.
