This study will: (1) complete analysis of seasonally collected samples and
piston cores, designed to document physical, biological, and chemical factors
controlling diagenetic reaction dominance and rates of reactions in shelf
facies, (2) utilize C1 and freon profiles to quantify diagenetic transport
mechanisms and mean salinity boundary conditions, (3) exploit the extensive
zones of Fe-mineral formation and transformation; (4) determine, in conjunction
with water column studies, the influence of extensive reduction of Fe-rich
lateritic debris in shelf bottom sediments on the transport of minor solutes
(e.g. U, Se, As) to the interior ocean; (5) document the geochemical and
associated benthic biological indicators of these environments likely to be
recorded in the rock record; and (6) examine and evaluate possible similarities
between the Amazon shelf and ancient environments of iron mineral deposition.
Multidisciplinary integration will be emphasized.
