The Alaska Community-based Monitoring (CBM) Best Practices Workshop will be held
April 1-2, 2014 in Anchorage, Alaska. This workshop will engage funders and
program managers of CBM projects and programs and community members engaged in
CBM, which involves dialogue and interaction between scientists and non-
scientists. The development of a viable model for planning, implementing, and
sustaining CBM throughout Alaska and in the Alaskan Arctic will provide the
means to ensure a diversity of people become engaged in science and that
scientific results are shared broadly with the communities affected by the
research. Because of the nature of Alaskans engaged in CBM, the workshop will
engage underrepresented minorities in science and technology. It will also
increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and
technology, and develop partnerships between academia and others. A major
potential benefit to the well being of individuals in society will be realized
by future contributions of CBM efforts to the detection significant
environmental changes that require community or societal responses to mitigate,
adapt to, or reverse. The funding requested would make it possible to offer the
workshop free of charge to participants, complete planning, invite and pay
travel costs for successful practitioners as speakers, pay facilities costs, and
use the results of the workshop to write a CBM Best Practices manual applicable
to Alaska and the Arctic.
