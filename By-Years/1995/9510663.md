9510663 Sieradzki This research examines issues related to the role of defect
interactions in determining thin metal film growth modes. The objective is to
learn how to manipulate growth parameters such that layer-by-layer growth
becomes the kinetically preferred growth mode. Growth mode mechanisms are
examined using combined experimental, simulation, and theoretical approaches.
Electrodeposition experiments are performed using in situ scanning tunneling
microscopy in order to observe the details of the growth mode transition at the
atomic level. Metal-on-metal heteroepitaxial systems studied include
silver/gold, copper/gold, and silver/copper. These systems permit a
determination of the role of misfit in the growth mode transition. The layer-by-
layer growth mode is extended into the multilayer regime by employing
modifications of the electrodeposition system. Monte Carlo simulations using
Embedded Atom Method potentials are performed to determine the effects of defect
interactions on adatom cluster diffusivities. %%% This research has important
materials implications since the layer-by-layer growth mode is desired for many
important engineering applications. ***
