The stabilization of cloned genes in microorganisms is extremely important for
productive recombinant cell processes. The goals of this proposal include
determining the extent and enhancement of amplification possible, the time-scale
and frequency on which it occurs, development and study of a model system for
intracellular protein production, determining the effects on the host strain,
stability studies, and population modeling. Yeast retrotransposons offer a
unique approach for obtaining large numbers of integrated cloned genes. The
results from the research should demonstrate the potential of this unique system
for the stable integrations of multiple cloned genes, a method, which in many
instances, should be superior to the more commonly utilized plasmid systems.
