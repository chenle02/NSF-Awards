A new laboratory course in Techniques for Cell Biology is being developed, using
cultured cells to teach techniques and prepare students for conducting research.
Students employ predesigned protocols to study the inner medullary collecting
duct cells of the rat kidney and selected immortal cell lines. They then conduct
independent research on the featured cell line type. Techniques taught include
basic cell culture, cell fractionation, molecular separation, and use of
immunological, radioactive, and fluorescent labeling. A CO2 incubator, laminar
flow bench, cryopreservation unit, and inverted microscope are used for cell
culture. A high speed centrifuge, fraction collector, and spectrophotometer are
used for cell fractionation and analysis of cell components. Equipment for
fluorescent microscopy and a scintillation counter allow identification of
specific cell components. The course extends the department's emphasis on first-
hand experience and independent research into the field of cell biology. The
college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
