This project will study many-body effects in strongly interacting electron
systems using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).
A major focus of the program will be the high-Tc superconductors. However, other
novel materials such as MgB2 and the C60 family of compounds will also be
investigated. Together, these materials represent a formidable challenge to
develop new theoretical concepts, and thus an opportunity for spectroscopic
experiments to play an important role in helping the development of theory. With
much improved energy and momentum resolution, ARPES is ideally suited for this
investigation due to its unique capability to measure key microscopic parameters
that often reveal deep insights. The project will also have broader scientific
and technological impact by training students and by developing high precision
scientific tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials in which the electrons interact
strongly with each other exhibit a number of novel and interesting phenomena,
including superconductivity at higher temperatures and a very large change in
the electrical conductivity when exposed to a magnetic field. It is possible
that some of these materials will prove to be of use to technology. This
individual investigator project will explore the universality and the diversity
of phenomena seen in materials with strongly interacting electrons.
Understanding these materials, and the phenomena they exhibit, has been a
formidable challenge. Using an advanced spectroscopic technique called angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this project seeks to increase our
understanding of the materials. This tool makes it is possible to gain insight
into microscopic processes occurring in these interesting materials. The
technique has proven useful in increasing our understanding of high temperature
superconductors. The project will also have broader impact by training students
and by developing high precision scientific tools.&lt;br/&gt;
