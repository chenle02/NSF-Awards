The principal investigator will study the degree to which ductile strain
increases bulk diffusion rates in olivine. Experiments will be performed in a
Griggs apparatus, and the resulting samples will be examined via electron
microscopy and with the electron microprobe. The results will be important to
structural geologists, geochemists, and metamorphic petrologists who deal with
kinetics and equilibrium in deformed rocks.
