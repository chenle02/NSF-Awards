This award, to be supported by the Office of International Sciences and
Engineering (OISE), will enable the participation of U.S. academic
oceanographers in a program development workshop between the US and Chile. The
central goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals for the US and
Chile who are experts on oceanographic research in the eastern South Pacific. It
is expected that this workshop will facilitate interactions between Chilean
scientists from academia, the Chilean Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic
Service (SHOA), and the National Oceanographic Committee, and US scientists from
the Naval Research Laboratory, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual
merit, the workshop will be provide an opportunity for coordination and
collaboration between U.S. and Chilean scientists that are interested in
oceanographic research aboard the new Chilean vessel, the Cabo de Hornos. In
addition, as U.S. scientists often coordinate with Chilean scientists on ocean
cruise activities in the Southern Ocean, Eastern Pacific, and Triple Junction
areas, this workshop will enable interested stakeholders to meet face to face to
set future priorities in science, logistics and ship facilities.
