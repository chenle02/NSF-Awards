Grau, Hector R U. of Colorado, Boulder This project will assess how tree species
diversity is affected by disturbances across a range of spatial scales, and how
disturbance regimes are related to elevational gradients in subtropical montane
forests in northwestern Argentina. It is hypothesized that in the higher montane
forest, low diversity is maintained by frequent fire. In the lower montane
forest, high diversity is promoted by the occurrence of small-scale treefall
gaps. Abrupt changes in diversity between the higher and lower montane forest
are believed to be caused by shifts in disturbance regimes that reflect the
influences of both the underlying physical environmental gradients and
vegetation responses to these gradients. Research methods will include
dendroecological records of disturbance regimes at a stand and landscape scale,
spatial and temporal patterns of tree recruitment in relation to bamboo cover,
stand-scale measures of diversity, and the use of remote sensing to map the
limit between lower and higher montane forests. The results will yield
information on how climatic change and anthropogenic changes in disturbance
regimes affect biodiversity.
