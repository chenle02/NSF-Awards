DMS-0072372 Jon Pitts Huai-Dong Cao

This award provides partial support for graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, junior faculty, and persons from under-represented groups to attend
the semi-annual Texas Geometry and Topology Conference. The conference is
designed to enhance the research and educational atmosphere of the community of
geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states. The conference
has three specific goals. First the conference is committed to bring researchers
of national and international stature to the area to discuss their research and
to interact with mathematicians from this geographic region. Second the
conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from
Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share
mathematics on a regular basis, which both stimulates individual research and
generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Third the conference
is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel
base. There will be six conferences over three years, hosted by major
universities in Texas: 2000-2001: Rice University (fall), Texas Christian
University (spring) 2001-2002: University of Texas (fall), Texas Tech University
(spring) 2002-2003: Texas A&M University (fall), University of Houston (spring)
In addition, two universities (University of Texas at Arlington, University of
Texas at Dallas) will assist in the conference at Texas Christian University.

The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since
its founding in 1989, a total of 23 times to date. The roster of mathematicians
who have participated in the conference includes many of the most influential
geometers and topologists in the world. Each conference specifically tailors its
program to reflect recent developments in important areas of geometry and
topology. Information about upcoming conferences as well as the mission and
history of the conference is always available at
