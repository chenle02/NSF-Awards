Forest regeneration is dependent on the successful growth of individual trees,
which are directly affected by soil nitrogen availability. Soil nitrogen is
heterogeneously distributed, both in terms of ammonium:nitrate ratio and total
quantity. Previous work has shown that black birch seedlings perform differently
when fed nitrate in comparison with ammonium, and that this response varies with
rate of nitrogen supplied and light level. Using a split pot design to create
patches of different ammonium to nitrate ration, the investigators will examine
whether black birch seedlings forage selectively for nitrate or ammonium in
soil. By using labelled 15NO3, they will test whether roots actually prefer to
acquire ammonium, and whether preference for a given form of nitrogen is
dependent upon the ratio of ammonium to nitrate in a patch, the rate of nitrogen
supply and light availability. Lastly, the investigators will examine whether
the ratio of total non-structural carbohydrates: free amino acids in the leaves
is a good predictor of whole plant partitioning of biomass.
