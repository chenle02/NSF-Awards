This project investigates the construction and maintenance of geometric
structures, as well as methods for efficiently searching in such structures.
This involves studying known computational geometry problems which are as yet
unsolved, new computational geometry problems dealing with the dynamic
maintenance of geometric structures, and new computational geometry problems
arising from applications in computer graphics and computer vision. The
algorithms developed are for sequential and parallel models of computation.
