Doctoral Dissertation Research: &lt;br/&gt;"The Great Pacific Garbage Patch as
Matter of Concern"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the production
and sharing of knowledge about plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean. It traces
how the material practices of science, activism, and education constitute the
Great Pacific Garbage Patch--the massive accumulation of waste floating between
California and Japan--as an environmental problem and public concern. The
methods of participant observation, interviews, and textual analysis will be
used to follow the transformation of plastic samples, and with them knowledge
about plastic pollution, as they move from expeditions at sea through
laboratories, offices, presentations and publications around the Pacific.
Particular attention is given to the impact of the March 2011 tsunami on plastic
pollution research and education, as debris from the event continues to test
existing scientific models, shift public concerns and contribute physically to
waste already at sea. The research will present findings so as to foster
cooperation between sceintists, activists and policy makers.
