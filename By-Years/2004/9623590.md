9623590 Fain Ice is important in a number of environments on the earth, in the
atmosphere, on other planets, and in space. The objective of this project is to
understand the interaction between ice surfaces and other solids in a controlled
environment at temperatures near the triple point. Dynamical measurements of the
normal and lateral forces exerted on scanning mechanical probes by the surface
of ice will be made as a function of temperature, atmosphere above the ice
surface, and electric potential between the probe and the ice. The fundamental
information obtained by such microscopic scale measurements will aid in
understanding macroscopic mechanical interactions between ice surfaces and other
solids. %%% Ice is important in a number of environments on the earth, in the
atmosphere, on other planets, and in space. The objective of this project is to
learn what happens when an ice surface comes into contact with a microscopic
solid probe in a controlled environment at temperatures near the triple point.
The probe could be a very sharp point or a very small diameter sphere; forces
exerted on the probe as it comes into contact with the surface will be measured
by deflecting a laser beam from a microscopic lever. The fundamental information
obtained by such measurements will aid in understanding large scale forces
between ice surfaces and other solids such as occur in the adhesion of ice to
obiects in a cold environment. ***
