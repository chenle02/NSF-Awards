This award will provide 73% of the cost of acquiring a noble gas mass
spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the Department of Marine
Chemistry and Geochemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The
Institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
equipment acquisition and installation. The new mass spectrometer system will
allow significant advances in the study of the geochemistry of noble gases in
the Earth's mantle, and in the application of cosmic ray surface exposure dating
in Quaternary geology. The mantle studies will focus on neon, argon, and xenon
isotope studies and will allow characterization of mantle sources of ocean
island and ocean ridge volcanism.
