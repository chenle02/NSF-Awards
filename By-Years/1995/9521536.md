This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This is a study of how economic development and competition for
resources affected the reactions to civil rights protests in the American South.
The study draws together theories of economic development and competition into a
comprehensive explanatory model. It combines county-level event data from 1954
to 1965 with data from government sources and selected case studies based on
local-level sources. %%% This study will add to our sociological understanding
of how economic factors affect community reactions to collective protest. More
generally, it will contribute to understanding the dynamics of protest and of
resistance to change. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of social scientists.
