The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding
mathematicians loosely connected to combinatorics, understood in the widest
sense. The meeting will give a chance to mathematicians from the Mid-South to
benefit not only from the lectures but also from personal contacts with the
speakers. The main speaker at the conference is one of the most distinguished
mathematicians today, Peter Lax of the Courant Institute in New York, the
recipient of the National Medal of Science in 1986, the Wolf Prize in 1987, and
the Abel Prize in 2005. Very accurately, he has been described as the most
versatile mathematician today. He started in pure mathematics, but his greatest
contributions have been to to the theory and application of partial differential
equations and to the computation of their solutions. In particular, he
constructed explicit solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic systems and identified
classes of especially well-behaved systems. Lax is also a wonderful expositor,
the author of several successful books, and a very approachable man. There will
be several other exciting speakers at the meeting; they have been chosen because
they are not only excellent mathematicians, but also wonderful expositors and
very approachable people. They include Vitaly Bergelson of Ohio State
University, who has made major contributions to ergodic theory, especially to
recurrence theory stemming from the work of Furstenberg inspired by Szemeredi's
theorem on arithmetic progressions; Yuval Peres from Microsoft Research and UC
Berkeley, one of the most notable people working on combinatorial aspects of
probability theory; Sasha Kostochka from the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, a very powerful mathematician who is carrying the torch for extremal
combinatorics; Ralph Faudree from the University of Memphis, one of the most
frequent collaborators of Paul Erdos, an expert on Ramsey-type problems;
Stephanie Gerke of ETH in Zurich, who has done beautiful work on the interface
of pure mathematics and computer science; Tom Trotter of Georgia Tech, one of
the founders of the modern theory of partially ordered sets; Boris Pittel from
Ohio State University, one of the best people working on probabilistic
combinatorics; and Mark Walters from the University of Cambridge, England, who
has proved much about random bootstrap percolation and random geometric graphs.
Andr'as Gy'arf'as from Budapest will give a special 'public' lecture aimed at a
very wide audience, including some of the best high school students from the
area. Unlike the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast, the Mid-South
cannot boast of many high-level mathematical conferences; the Contemporary
Combinatorics 2007 meeting in Memphis goes some way towards redressing the
balance. The formula whereby personal contacts between the lecturers and the
other participants is greatly encouraged was found to be very successful a year
ago, and this what we hope to do at the 2007 meeting as well. There is no doubt
that listening to lectures by Peter Lax, Vitaly Bergelson, Yuval Peres, and
others, and, especially, talking to them during the conference will be very
inspiring for young and established mathematicians alike. The NSF grant is
absolutely vital for the success of the meeting; most of it will be used to help
graduate students and senior mathematicians come to Memphis so that they can
benefit from the lectures and the personal contact with the speakers.
