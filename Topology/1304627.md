The large scales dimension theory is a part of coarse geometry, a relatively new
subject which studies large scale properties of metric spaces. It is a growing
discipline which has some analogy with the classical dimension theory which is a
part of topology, a science of small scales. Many invariants of the large scale
dimension theory such as the asymptotic dimension and the macroscopic dimension
proved to be useful in studying finitely generated groups and open Riemannian
manifolds. Thus, the large scale dimension appears in different areas of
mathematics such as topology of manifolds, group theory, differential geometry.
One of the main goals of this project is to prove the Gromov Conjecture about
manifolds with positive scalar curvature. Another application of this project is
a further development of a dimension theoretic approach to the Novikov Higher
Signature Conjecture.

The classical topology has a century long history and it is substantially
developed in all directions. It became a fundamental core part of mathematics.
Despite on abstractness it has many profound applications to virtually all
sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, etc.). The large scale version
of topology and in particular the large scale analogue of dimension theory has a
potential to grow in a discipline of similar weight and to bring numerous
application beyond the scope of Mathematics. Thus the ideas of coarse geometry
are already used in the large data mining. Clearly, a quantitative processing of
overwhelming flaws of data of different kind will be more and more on demand in
all activities of the mankind. Another area of application of dimension theory
which is addressed in this project is studying the complexity of robot motion
planning algorithms.
