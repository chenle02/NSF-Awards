The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) will host an international conference
on "Comparative analyses of ecosystems: patterns, mechanisms, and theories," on
20 April through 3 May, 1989. The subject of this conference will be
quantitative analyses of important ecosystem phenomena across systems. The goals
of the conference are: i) to encourage the application of comparative techniques
to develop and test theories in ecosystem ecology, ii) to address methodological
and philosophical difficulties in using a comparative approach, iii) to expose
workers in one ecological subdiscipline to potentially useful ideas, data, and
methods from other subdisciplines, and iv) to explore the potential and the
limitations of cross- ecosystem comparisons. Approximately 45 ecologists from
around the world will attend this conference. As in the previous two Cary
Conferences, the emphasis of this meeting will be on discussion and critical
examination of fundamental ideas in ecology. Speakers and other participants
will be challenged to extend their thinking beyond the day-to-day limits of
their own research fields. Such open and critical evaluation will help to
stimulate the ecological community, and will encourage the integration of ideas
and development of new research. The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that
an award be made in support of the third Cary Conference.
