9417759 Cowan Brittle shear zones are common features in many tectonic settings,
yet in spite of the importance of brittle shear zones and the probability that
slip along some of them was seismogenic, there is as yet no unifying kinematic
model relating the mesoscopic fabrics of the fault rocks within them to the
strain paths or flow types characterizing shear zone deformation. This project
will combine field data with extensive modeling to help develop and test the
hypothesis that general coaxial shear is the predominant flow type as it is in
ductile shear zones. Results are expected to improve the ability to interpret
and kinematically analyze fabrics in brittle shear zones.
