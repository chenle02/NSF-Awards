Abstract

Award: DMS-0072182 Principal Investigator: Kefeng Liu

My project will focus on the understanding of the geometry and topology of
mirror symmetry, in particular the aspect of counting curves in projective
manifolds. More precisely there are three outstanding and closely related
problems that I would like to work on and hope to solve. The first is to prove
the most general mirror principle for counting rational curves in any projective
manifold and its Calabi-Yau submanifolds; the second is to understand the
geometry and algebra of the local mirror symmetry, in particular, of the
surprising role played by the elliptic curves appeared in our computation by
applying mirror principle; the third is to develop a mirror principle for
counting curves of higher genus in projective manifolds. I hope to solve these
problems by further extending the techniques we developed to prove the mirror
principle for balloon manifolds. These three problems are the different aspects
of a single problem: to prove and understand the mirror principle in its most
general form.

Superstring theory, one of the most ambitious theory in sciences, is proposed
for the grand unification of the laws of the nature. Based on this theory,
string theorists have made many remarkable mathematical conjectures. Mirror
symmetry is among one of them. The proofs of these conjectures will not only
give beautiful mathematical results, but also help gain confidence in the
physical theory. The mirror principle we developed has partially verified some
of these conjectures. It has many interesting mathematical consequences and is
remarkably compatible with the physical theory.
