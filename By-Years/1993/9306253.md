9306253 Williams This project explores how atomic bonding across interfaces is
affected by elemental bonding. The specific technique used is charge-transfer
imaging, a new microanalytical tool developed under prior NSF research. The
electron energy-loss spectrum is sensitive to the bonding state. This is
measured as a function of segregation phenomenon and compared to theoretical
models. Changes in the spectra due to charge transfer effects are imaged
directly and compared to conventional electron images of the defect structure
and compositional maps of the segregant distribution. The images have sub-
nanometer resolution by using the latest advances in electron energy-loss
spectrometry in the field emission gun electron microscope. Metal systems under
study include nickel aluminide with boron addition to improve toughness and
copper with bismuth impurity, known to cause brittleness. %%% For the first time
it may be possible to verify theories that purport to explain phenomena
associated with grain boundary segregation. The data are valuable input to
advanced computer simulations used in theoretical descriptions of bonding across
interfaces. ***
