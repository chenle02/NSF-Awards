Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The PIs request funding to acquire single and
multi-collector ICP-MS instrumentation, complemented by a solid-state laser-
ablation sample introduction system. The proposed instrumentation will serve
research efforts covering four academic units at the institution: geological
sciences, chemistry and biochemistry, marine science, and public health. These
research efforts include investigations into solid earth geochemistry including:
mantle geochemistry, subduction magmatism, and U-Pb detrital-zircon
geochronology; paleoceanography and paleoclimatology: past ocean circulation and
sediment provenance, climate proxy development (Si isotopes), and proxy
validation; climate change research: iron fertilization, classification of
bloom-forming phytoplankton, and upper ocean particle formation and export; and
phase partitioning, transport, and biological uptake of nano-materials in
environmental systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed instrumentation will be incorporated into a suite of education efforts,
including inclusion in undergraduate and graduate courses, informal training of
undergraduates and graduates as part of research efforts, inclusion in summer
programs, including the TRIO Programs Upward Bound (focusing on economically
disadvantaged students without a family history of college attendance) and the
SPRI program (mentoring high school students in faculty labs). The proposed
instrumentation will also support the research efforts of two new hires,
including one early career scientist. Cross-institution collaborative efforts
with the University of Georgia, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and
Skidaway Institute of Oceanography would also be enabled should the proposed
instrumentation be acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
