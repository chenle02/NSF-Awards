Machine Learning (ML) promises a way to build adaptive systems while avoiding
tedious and tenuous pre-programming; however, ML techniques are not designed for
input from naive users, remaining by and large a tool built by experts for
experts. This project reframes the ML research question by considering systems
that are meant to learn from everyday people, asking: "how can machines take
better advantage of the input that an everyday person is able to provide?" To
this end, project activities include the following: (1) Building a suite of
short computer games that involve training interactive characters, spanning a
wide variety of ML algorithms and a wide variety of interaction domains and (2)
deploying these games on a website, and collecting data on the success of
various techniques in learning from the average person on the
web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is for this interactive learning agents
website to yield a broad and principled understanding of human interaction with
ML systems. The success of this research agenda will have a significant impact,
leading to the development of interactive machines that assist us with the large
and small tasks of our daily lives. Results have the potential to provide a
framework for any designer who wishes to incorporate learning and adaptation
into an end-user application. Further, the research promises to bridge the
Machine Learning and Human-Comptuer Interaction research communities, creating a
mutually beneficial partnership.
