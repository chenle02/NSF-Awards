What are the dynamics underlying the decisionmaking and compliance patterns of
taxpayers? What accounts for how individuals go about making choices and
handling legal procedures and rules? Limitations on available data for taxpayer
research have hampered theory development and testing on such issues. A major
objective of Dr. Carroll's research is to examine a new source of information
about taxpayer behavior that is close to the behavior itself and the thoughts of
taxpayers. His study employs intensive process-tracing techniques (interviews,
diaries, and verbal protocols) to provide systematic detail about subjective
perceptions and the cognitive processes involved in translating perceptions into
behavior. From these basic but unique data on taxpayer perceptions, values, and
strategies, adaptive models of taxpayer compliance can be developed that
integrate both self-interest and normative factors. Dr. Carroll's research
capitalizes on the unique research opportunity provided by one of the most
significant changes ever introduced in income tax law. The attention to
taxpaying necessitated by the 1986 Tax Reform Act makes it extremely likely that
taxpayers will surface and reconsider subjective perceptions and decision
strategies that are unusually routine. The development of decision models of
taxpaying will contribute generally to the explication of theory in compliance
and decision research and specifically to our understanding of taxpayer
compliance and its sensitivity to policy options.
