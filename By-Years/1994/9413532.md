9413532 Conery This award is for the purchase of a parallel computer to do
research in Problem Specific Programming Environments (PSPE). These environments
will be built to use domain specific information in order to aid the scientist
developing application programs for that area. The three PSPEs to be
experimented with on this parallel computer are: Computation of the electronic
structure of superconductors; simulation of mutations over generations; and
constraint-based computations in molecular evolution. All of these domains are
computation intensive needing the power of a parallel computer. ***
