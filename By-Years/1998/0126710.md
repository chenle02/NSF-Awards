Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;Reflecting the importance of lasers in scientific
research, medical practice, and numerous current and emerging technologies,
leading chemistry programs have incorporated laser experiments into their
advanced laboratory courses. We are introducing laser experiments at several
levels of the Chemistry Department curriculum in a project that is central to
our goal of moving the curriculum toward a "research model" in which students
work with research-grade instrumentation, design experiments through guided
inquiry, and interpret their results within the context of primary research
literature. The experiments we are implementing are adapted from the Journal of
Chemical Education and from primary chemistry research literature and are
modified from procedures tested at other institutions. We are enhancing a
Spectroscopy Laboratory course with the innovative goals of: (1) having students
work with a versatile set of laser equipment to recognize how the capabilities
and limitations of sources and detectors affect experimental design, and (2)
designing two research-based experimental modules which address bio-inorganic
photoinduced electron transfer and nonlinear optics using the appropriate
spectroscopy tools. A second adaptation incorporates fluorescence lifetime and
laser photochemical kinetic measurements into an Introductory Chemistry
Laboratory and supplements our outreach efforts with secondary school chemistry
programs. This project supports a trend in our department of increasing interest
in student-faculty collaborative research. With new chemistry facilities to
support instrumentation and new faculty members with expertise in spectroscopy,
this is an ideal time to introduce laser spectroscopy experiments into our
program.
