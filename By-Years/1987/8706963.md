Eastern Maine is composed of large fault-bounded lithotectonic blocks, some of
which may be exotic terranes with respect to North America, however neither the
allochthoneity nor age of accretion of these blocks has been firmly established.
The principal goals of this project are to compare two pre-Silurian tracts (St.
Croix and Miramichi) now separated by faults and Siluro-Devonian cover, to
establish whether they are exotic or were formed in the same ocean basin, and to
study a possible terrane-separating fault to establish timing of accretion.
Results will be applicable in reevaluation of the Paleozoic tectonics of
northern New England.
