The CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law on August 9, 2022, envisions new
opportunities in accelerating progress in key technology areas, translating
science and technology into solutions to societyâ€™s major challenges, and
fostering partnerships with the private sector to enable this progress. This
vision for the future encourages federal agencies such as NSF to take bold steps
and experiment with new approaches for creating an ecosystem of partnerships and
collaborations for use-inspired and translational research.

This workshop will convene a strategic set of corporate science and technology
leaders, as well as NSF leadership representatives, to identify effective
strategies as well as nontraditional approaches to enhance the next generation
of public-private partnership models. Through co-investing in research,
companies and federal agencies such as NSF can complement traditional R&D
investments, leverage and expand available funding to achieve research goals,
broaden engagement with new research partners, and fill the workforce pipeline.
The workshop will take place in Spring 2023 in the Washington, DC, region and
will be followed by a virtual event in June 2023 to broadly disseminate
findings.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
