The PI will carry out a series of laboratory experiments on thermal convection
in two superposed fluid layers with different densities and viscosities. The
density and viscosity of the working fluid will be controlled by varying the
concentrations respectively of salt and cellulose (Natrosol) in aqueous
solution. The most important advantage of this technique is that the density and
viscosity can be varied independently, which was not possible in previous
experimental studies. The primary goals of the experiments are (1) to determine
the conditions under which thermal and mechanical coupling between the layers
occurs,a nd (2) to derive scaling laws for quantities (e.g., Nusselt number and
mixing rate) which describes the global evolution of the system.
