The authors propose a conference on assessment in mathematics education to be
held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at the University of
California, Berkeley, during the month of March, 2004. Participants will be
drawn from the mathematics research community, together with researchers in
mathematics education, psychometricians and school and district education
personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sessions at the conference will assume various
formats, from individual presentations to panel discussion to small group
discussion. A volume of proceedings will be generated and disseminated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposal are to examine a variety of
issues connected with assessment in mathematics education, including the effect
of assessment on curriculum and instruction, issues of ethics and equity and
questions of tools and methods for assessment. An important outcome of the
project will be the identification of research questions and directions for
development of new assessment tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
