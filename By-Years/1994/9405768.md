9405768 Lange This award will support experiments to measure the denisty and
compressibility of hydrous silicate liquids between 900- 1600 oC and 1-20 kbars.
Measurements will be performed on NaAlSi3O8, KAlSi3O8, and rhyolitic liquids
containing 1-10% H2O and will be based on the floating and sinking of ultra-
pure crystalline graphite buoyancy markers. The experiments outlined will allow
direct determination of the partial molar volume of water in silicate melts as a
function of temperature and pressure.
