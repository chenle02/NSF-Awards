This NSF award funds new research analyzing how networks affect economic
behavior. The researchers collect a unique dataset that includes detailed
network and demographic data on individuals in 75 villages in South India.
Forty-three of these villages participated in a microlending project, and the
data includes information on the social networks in all of the villages before
and after the introduction of microlending. The research team uses the data to
test hypotheses about whether and how a social network changes when the
participants do not need to rely on informal social borrowing/lending
relationships because formal microloans are available. The team will also
conduct three other studies. They will trace the information and diffusion of
advice across the network, they will study how the social network affects the
success of a program designed to use peer influence to encourage saving, and
they want to study the role of peer networks in decisions to default on formal
loans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the creation of a unique
data set that is useful for researchers across the social sciences who are
interested in how to model and analyze social networks. Graduate students and
undergraduates are involved in the project. Finally, microfinance has been
lauded as a new solution to problems facing poor people in developing countries.
However, recent evidence makes it clear that social networks play a key role in
the success or failure of microlending programs. Understanding this role is key
for the design of new microlending policies and products.
