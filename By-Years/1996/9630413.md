9630413 Yu The objective of this research is to elucidate the role of subunit IV
(Mr=14,384) in the cytochrome bc1 complex from a photosynthetic bacterium
Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro reconstitution of
mutant subunit IV with the three-subunit core complex, and physical, chemical
characterizations of reconstituted complex will be employed to identify (1) the
tryptophan residue(s) of subunit IV essential for interaction with the three-
subunit core complex; (2) the domains in subunit IV interacting with cytochrome
b and with iron-sulfur protein; and (3) the amino acid residues required for
stabilizing the structure of the cytochrome bc1 complex. The success of this
project will increase our understanding of the structure-function and mechanism
of this photosynthetic bacterial bc1 complex in particular and energy
transduction in the cytochrome bc1 complex in general. A better understanding of
energy transduction mechanisms in the photosynthetic apparatus will lead to
increase the efficiency of photosynthesis and thus increases the renewable
energy sources. %%% Photosynthesis is the process of conversion of light energy
into chemical energy for use in biosynthesis. Some bacteria as well as plants
have this ability. One component of the bacterial photosynthetic pathway is the
cytochrome bc1 complex. Subunit IV is one component of this complex which has no
obvious role in oxidation-reduction reactions. The goal of this project is to
elucidate the interactions and role of this subunit within the three-subunit
core complex. The experiments proposed will enhance our understanding of energy
transduction mechanisms in the photosynthetic apparatus with a long-range goal
of increasing the efficiency of this process. ***
