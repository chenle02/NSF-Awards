Mitchener proposes to study stochastic processes and dynamical systems that
model language learning and change, supported by statistical analysis of
manuscript and corpus data. The proposed models are designed to account for
variability in speech in ways that most existing models do not. Some of the
proposed models are deterministic, and represent the distribution of speech
patterns in a population as probability density functions governed by Banach-
space-valued differential equations. Other proposed models are stochastic, based
on discrete Markov chains and stochastic differential equations. The Markov
chain models are the most detailed, including simulated learning algorithms
based on Bayesian statistics. The PI plans to develop perfect sampling
algorithms to determine the mixing behavior of these Markov chains, which should
give some insight into linguistic questions of how typical the set of existing
human languages is with respect to the set of all possible human languages. The
stochastic differential equation models represent the simplification of the
Markov chain simulations to an infinite population and continuous time. For all
of these models, the PI plans to run computer simulations and prove theorems
about their behavior using tools from dynamical systems theory, functional
analysis, and probability. The research will first address the simple case of
unstructured, well mixed populations, then add social structure, and then delay
dynamics as a model of literacy. The PI plans to find hypotheses under which the
delay dynamics give rise to well posed problems. The PI is collaborating with
linguist Misha Becker at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to
develop realistic models of human language learning and to test these models
against linguistic data.

Mitchener proposes to study mathematical models of language learning and
change. Most existing models assume an idealized form of speech. For example,
each person might have just one way of stating a given meaning. In contrast,
true speech is variable. The same person can convey the same meaning by using a
variety of word orders, for example: John gave Fred a book. John gave a book to
Fred. Fred was given a book by John. As an improvement upon models that assume
idealized speech, the proposed models account for language variability in two
ways. Some of them represent each speaker's utterances with a list of random
choices among the alternatives. The others are not explicitly random, but
instead keep track of how often a speaker prefers the possible options for
expressing a meaning. In a model with idealized speech, learning takes place
when a speaker chooses one alternative from a list. Under a variable speech
model, learning is much more complicated because each speaker must learn which
of many
