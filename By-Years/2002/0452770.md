An electrical network consisting only of resistors has a definite current
response to voltages applied at designated terminals. The current response at
these designated terminals can be measured once the voltages are applied. The
inverse problems that will be studied are those in which the response is known
and the resistances and/or topology of the network are not known but desired.
Planar and non-planar networks will be studied. In addition, similar problems
involving directed networks and the Schrodinger equation will be studied.
Relations to continuous inverse problems and infinite networks will be
investigated. Eight undergraduates per summer will work on these problems.
