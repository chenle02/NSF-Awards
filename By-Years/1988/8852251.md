The undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum is being enhanced by
incorporating state-of-the-art atomic absorption/flame emission instrumentation
into the laboratory courses at the lower level for both majors (quantitative
analysis) and non-majors (introduction to analytical chemistry). At the same
time, this project is facilitating instruction of majors in the upper division
courses in instrumental methods and undergraduate research. The
spectrophotometer affords a number of capabilities not previously available to
students in these courses, for example, flameless atomization, background
correction, data storage, editing and reporting, and software control. This is
providing a wide variety of student experiences, from fundamental to complex to
emphasize both function and application. The grantee is matching the award from
non-Federal sources.
