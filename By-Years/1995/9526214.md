9526214 Mehrl We propose prototype development of versatile two-dimensional VLSI
heterodyne detection arrays. Such devices would find wide application in many
optical architectures that employ temporal/spatiotemporal modulation techniques,
such as acousto- optic signal processing, two-dimensional real time image
processing, and swept-carrier time domain memories. Upon successful completion
of prototypes, a simple, yet powerful and flexible two-dimensional image
processing technique will be demonstrated. This technique, using spatiotemporal
modulation of the image, coupled with heterodyne detection, is particularly well
suited for two-dimensional image edge-detection and edge- enhancement
operations, and offers continuously variable spatial resolution. ***
