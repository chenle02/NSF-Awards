The principal goals of this project are: 1) to determine the various
3-dimensional structures adopted by chromosomes at different points in the cell
cycle; 2) to work out the physico chemical basis underlying their stability; and
3) to show how these satisfy the functional requirements of cell division,
recombination, gene expression and replication. Dr. Widom has developed a new
kind of X-ray "area" detector which shows significantly improved resolution.
This will be used to obtain diffraction patterns from semi-oriented samples of
chromosomes in various stages of folding, from which structural information may
be deduced. He will also use yeast genetics to identify proteins (and their
genes) that are necessary for the final stages of chromosomal folding, for cell
division and recombination.***//
