This project enables the PI, an applied mathematician and numerical analyst, to
spend a year in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at Penn
State, immerse himself in the full research and educational activities of the
MSE department, and conduct a joint research with his hosts on numerical
simulation of materials microstructural evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
microstructural evolution will be modeled by using a continuum field approach
which results in a set of well-posed partial differential equations that can be
rigorously analyzed. Efficient and accurate numerical schemes/software for
solving these equations will be developed, validated and applied to a number of
challenging problems of current interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
not only expand the awareness and use of important mathematical advances and
state-of-the-art numerical methods/software which have the potential to make
significant impact on the materials science, result in improved models and
numerical schemes which will contribute to a better understanding of the complex
process of microstructural evolution, and provide new fundamental, practical
insights which can provide US industry with a competitive edge, but also set up
the stage for a lasting&lt;br/&gt;collaboration in a broader scale between the
Math and MSE departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly
supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the
Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;
