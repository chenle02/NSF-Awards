This research will address several major questions related to the large-scale
distribution of galaxies, in particular by measuring the fluctuation spectrum of
the galaxy distribution on very large scales, which overlap with measurements of
the Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations. A promising technique introduced a
few years ago has been turned into a practical tool, which provides optimal
weighting of the data for each individual mode of the power spectrum, and has so
far successfully provided very tight constraints on cosmological parameters. The
current project may even detect the existence of baryon bumps, which enable
measurement of the angular diameter distance relation, and constrain the
equation of state of the dark energy. This study will enhance the effectiveness
of the SkyServer, a web site constantly in use by high schools and the general
public, and will further promote collaboration with the Hands-On Universe
project, where students can do follow-up observations, or look up properties of
something interesting seen in an observation.
