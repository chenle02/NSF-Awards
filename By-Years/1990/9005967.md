In this research supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Alan H. Cowley of the University of Texas at Austin will
investigate three areas of main group element chemistry: (a) elements in
unusually low oxidation state, (b) elements with unusually low coordination
number, and (c) polymeric materials incorporating main group elements. The first
two areas are expected to generate new chemical compounds with unusual
reactivities and properties. The polymers generated in the third project would
likewise be new materials with interesting and potentially useful properties.
New ligands will be developed that will have supplemental coordination capacity
and be designed to stabilize main group elements in low oxidation state, such as
phosphorus(+1), arsenic(+1), antimony(+1), bismuth(+1), gallium(+1) and
aluminum(+1). In the second area, syntheses of analogues of transition metal
alkylidenes and alkylidynes will be attempted with group 14 (for example,
silicon and germanium) and 15 (for example, phosphorus and arsenic) elements
replacing the multiply bonded carbon to produce compounds with transition metal
to main group element multiple bonds. The targeted transition metals to be
employed are molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, nio- bium, zirconium and hafnium.
These compounds will then be ex- amined for reactivities similar to the
transition metal alkylidenes and alkylidynes, which include polymerization
reactions.
