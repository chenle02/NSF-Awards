9321572 Hanken This proposal outlines a series of descriptive and experimental
studies that examine the hormonal mediation of embryonic development in direct-
developing anurans. Precocious activity of the thyroid axis is frequently cited
as the mechanism underlying direct development, but this has never been fully
examined. To test this hypothesis, initial appearance and subsequent development
of the thyroid axis in a direct-developing frog will be compared to the patterns
observed in metamorphosing frogs. The role of thyroid hormones (TH) in mediating
direct development will also be evaluated experimentally by manipulating
endogenous hormone levels. Methods include histology (to document thyroid gland
and median eminence formation), radioimmunoassay (to determine TH levels through
embryonic development), immunocytochemistry (to examine the ontogeny of
thyrotropic cells and TH receptor expression), and hormone manipulation (to
experimentally examine the roles of TH in direct development). Analyses will
focus on embryos of the direct developing frog Eleutherodactylus coqui
(Leptodactylidae) derived from an established breeding colony. For comparative
purposes, analyses will also include several metamorphosing species, including
Leptodactylus albilabris (Leptodactylidae), Bombina orientalis (Discoglossidae),
and Xenopus laevis (Pipidae). Results will contribute to our understanding of
the endocrine mediation of direct development in amphibians. They also will
provide new information on the mechanistic basis underlying life-history
evolution. In addition, this study will examine maternal provisioning of
hormones in early embryogenesis and development, a process relevant to
understanding early development in all classes of vertebrates. ***
