Thistle 9314150 More than 70% of marine benthic invertebrates have planktonic
larvae that disperse through the water column before returning to the sea bed to
settle and develop into adults. An increasing body of evidence suggests that for
many benthic species dispersal and settlement are largely passive processes of
fluid-borne transport. The coastal ocean exhibits a unique set of physical
transport phenomena that includes mean currents, tidal currents, and wave-
induced currents. To gain a better understanding of the effect that fluid
transport has on dispersal and settlement in the coastal ocean. This research
program will develop a model of passive larval transport along a vertical plane.
The effects of tides, waves, and mean currents will be examined individually and
in combination. ***
