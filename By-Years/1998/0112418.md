Indirect Genetic Effects of Parental Care Behavior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claudia
M. Rauter and Charles W. Fox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous studies have shown
that parental care can affect expression of traits in offspring. From the point
of view of offspring, parental care is an environmental factor like food or air
temperature. For the parents, however, parental care is a trait like any other
trait; it is determined by parental genes and the environment to which the
parent is exposed. Through their effects on the offspring environment, both
parental genes and the parental environment can affect offspring traits such as
growth and developmental time. These effects of parental genes and environment
on trait expression in offspring are called indirect genetic effects and
indirect environmental effects, respectively. The indirect genetic effects are
of special interest, because they can influence rate and direction of response
of traits to natural selection.&lt;br/&gt;This study will investigate how
parental care affects trait evolution. The specific objectives are to 1)
determine the amount of variation in progeny traits that is due to indirect
genetic effects in an insect species with parental care, 2) investigate whether
the influence of indirect genetic effects depends on the developmental stage in
which the trait is expressed as has been observed in many mammals, and 3)
examine the relative influence of indirect genetic effects in individuals reared
with and without parental care.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will
significantly increase our understanding of trait evolution in animals with
parental care. The comparison between an insect with parental care with mammals
and birds will give us insights about the generality of the evolutionary models
including parental effects. These models have been developed primarily based on
observations in domesticated mammals. The comparison of parental effects in
animals reared with and without parental care will provide invaluable
information about how parental care affects trait evolution.&lt;br/&gt;
