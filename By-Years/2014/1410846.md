Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics
program of the Division of Materials Research supports Boston University with a
project to explore new approach to induce superconductivity in a material using
a recently developed proximity technique. Superconductivity, a state of matter
in which electrons carry electricity without friction, occurs when a material is
cooled below a certain critical temperature. Superconducting states, with
relatively "high" transition temperatures (just above that of liquid nitrogen),
can be induced by changing the chemistry of a series of magnetic materials.
However, this involves changing multiple parameters simultaneously, complicating
the analysis. This project follows an alternative approach which is to induce
superconductivity via "proximity", namely placing a superconductor in excellent
contact with a non-superconducting (normal) material, where the interface and
normal state properties can be tuned. The project explores the various aspects
of the normal materials that control the emergence of the proximity induced
superconducting state. This will enable systematic studies and provide a
platform for pursuing the elusive Majorana fermions. To achieve this students of
all levels, high school to postdoctoral trainees, will learn a variety of
technical (device fabrication and characterization) to professional skills
(training, project management). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project is to generate new states of matter, while
pushing the boundaries of our knowledge on the coupling of order parameters and
topology. This will be achieved using a new mechanical bonding technique
developed by the principal investigator, which opens the door to creating and
manipulating unconventional superconductivity in semiconductors, semimetals and
topological insulators. These new platforms will be explored using a combination
of optical and transport techniques to address fundamental questions and
technical challenges such as: What are the optimum conditions for observing a
high Tc superconducting proximity effect? How do band structure, carrier density
and topology affect the emergence of superconductivity? How is the symmetry of
the superconducting order parameter affected by the host material? Particular
focus will be given to the high temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+y) in
combination with MoS2, Bi2Te2Se, and Graphite/Graphene. Trainees at all levels
will be involved in the fabrication of devices and the analysis of
optical/differential conductance data, to learn a variety of analysis, device
fabrication and characterization techniques, as well as professional skills.
