The Women in Engineering Advocates Network (WEPAN) is a national organization
that provides access for women to careers in engineering by increasing the
number of women enrolling and successfully completing degrees in engineering at
both the undergraduate and graduate levels. WEPAN provides technical assistance
to educational institutions desiring to initiate or expand Women in Engineering
Programs. WEPAN is involved in: 1) providing technical assistance to aid and
encourage engineering schools in establishing or expanding Women in Engineering
Programs; 2) establishing executive committees in each of the three regions
(western, midwestern, and eastern United States) to facilitate training for
institutions and to establish partnerships between educational institutions and
industries; 3) conducting regional training seminars; 4) furthering development
of the National Evaluation of Women in Engineering Programs; and 5) continuing
to provide leadership to the national WEPAN organization.
