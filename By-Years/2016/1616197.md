This research project concerns fundamental mathematical questions in fracture
mechanics, an area of importance in materials and structural engineering.
Despite substantial recent progress in mathematical analysis of models for
fracture and crack propagation, nucleation and propagation of material defects
in general, and fracture in particular, remain poorly understood, yet their
accurate prediction is of great importance in many materials science
applications. This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for
addressing some of the major challenges in this area. These include showing
existence of solutions to classes of mathematical models for fracture evolution,
improving dynamic fracture models, and analyzing properties of dynamic fracture
solutions, with a particular emphasis on exploring crack branching and its
consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Showing existence of quasi-static cohesive
fracture evolutions, showing existence for mathematical models of dynamic
fracture, and establishing qualitative properties of dynamic fracture solutions
are major challenges in the mathematical analysis of fracture mechanics. The
methods that have been used to show existence for quasi-static Griffith
evolutions are now known to fail for cohesive fracture. The main difficulty
arises from the delicate role that history plays in the definition of these
solutions. This project will continue the development of new methods for
analyzing this and other quasi-static problems, based on higher order energy
approximations using history at only a finite number of prior times. Dynamic
Griffith fracture is also very delicate, due to complex interactions between
elastic singularities and the (a priori unknown) evolving crack set. New methods
based on blow-up techniques will be developed for analyzing these evolutions.
