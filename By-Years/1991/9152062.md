The development of the laboratory for System Noise in Electronic Design makes
use of some excellent advances in instrument technology to help undergraduate
students learn about the practical considerations of system noise, both as it
affects their design, and as generated by their design. These considerations of
Electromagnetic Compatibility between the electronics and the system are often
overlooked and seldom taught, but nearly always of real concern. Three specific
areas are covered in this project: the influence of a reference (ground) shift
due to switching current in an inductive reference; the susceptibility of
electronics to additive/modulating spurious signals; and the conducted
interference generated by switching electronics. In all cases the students
observe the effects and means of reduction of the noise through practical
experiments in the laboratory.
