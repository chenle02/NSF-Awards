This award will provide funding for a workshop to honor and memorialize
Professor Rob Kling, the father of the field of Social Informatics. He conducted
over 30 years of systematic and analytic research about IT and social life. The
DST program funded the first workshop on Social Informatics in 1997 at Indiana
University. Rob Kling was the PI and then director of the Center for Social
Informatics. This award will allow for a systematic collection of the research
in this area of the Digital Society and Technology (DST) Program. The workshop
will highlight, critically examine and consolidate the works of Rob Kling and
extend that work by providing an opportunity for other scholars to contribute
their work on social informatics, thereby perpetuating the field. The broader
impacts stem from the profound and yet practical view of IT and social life put
forth by Kling and others working in the field of social informatics as
intertwined socio-technical networks of people, institutions, practices and
technological artifacts. Such a conceptualization leads to insights related to
the challenges of IT design, use and implications from a human perspective. The
workshop will also celebrate Kling's life and scholarly contributions.
