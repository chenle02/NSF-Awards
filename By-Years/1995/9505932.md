Pacific cables and add 3 new ones to study the deep electrical structure of the
earth, improve our understanding of the ocean's response to wind forcing, space
physics, and the dynamo mechanism in the earth's core, as well as investigate
the mid-mantle electrical structure of the Pacific basin. ***
