The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Mitchio Okumura of
California Institute of Technology in his continuing studies on anionic cluster
solvation. Specifically, he uses vibrational predissociation spectroscopy to
study the structure of various anions hydrated with `n` molecules of water, as a
function of n. Apparently, experimental studies on cationic hydrate clusters and
anions clustered with rare gases indicate that solvation shells form and the ion
is in the interior. Theoretical work on halide anionic hydrate clusters suggest,
on the other hand, that the ion is bound to the surface of clustered water
molecules, and as the cluster size increases, a transition from surface- to
interior-solvation occurs. Okumura will focus on the hydrogen stretching region;
the frequency shifts and linewidths in this region should yield insight on
hydrogen bonding both between ion and solvent molecules and among solvent
molecules. In addition, two photon (infrared-infrared double resonance
predissociation or infrared-ultraviolet vibrationally assisted photodetachment)
spectroscopy will be brought to bear on those clusters that are more strongly
bound. Finally, cluster solvation of acids implicated in stratospheric aerosol
chemistry will be investigated. An ab initio theoretical effort will be carried
out to aid in determining cluster geometries. While the aim of this work is to
investigate ion-solvent interactions at a fundamental level, a second motivation
is to elucidate solvation processes and ionic reaction mechanisms of relevance
to atmospheric chemistry. Many of the systems that will be investigated play
central roles in heterogeneous reactions occuring in the stratosphere and
troposphere. Adducts of these ionic hydrates with atmospheric species such as
nitric acid and hydrochloric acid may serve as models of intermediates in the
adsorption and ionic dissociation on atmospheric aerosols.
