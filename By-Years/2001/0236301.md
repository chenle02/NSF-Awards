Continued support for the infrastructure, management and operations of the
Electromagnetic Studies of the Continents (EMSOC) national instrument facility
will be provided though this grant. This facility provides a pool of
magnetotelluric (MT) instruments to support NSF-funded research. The MT
measurements provide estimates of the electrical conductivity of the Earth, a
property that is sensitive to the presence and interconnectedness of geothermal
fluids, molten rock, metallic ore minerals, and graphite. MT data offers a
unique an important additional basis for understanding continental history,
magma genesis and rock failure. Currently, the Universities of Washington, Utah,
California at Riverside and San Diego, Wisconsin at Madison, the Colorado School
of Mines, San Diego State University, Arizona State University, and Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution are members of the EMSOC Consortium. Membership is
open to U.S. institutions, and the instruments are available to all academic and
government users. See vortex.ucr.edu/emsoc/index.html for more details. ***
