This project funds a two-week summer workshop providing scientific background
and knowledge needed to integrate into the curriculum issues relating to
hazardous materials. The program will consist of lectures, discussions, and
laboratory work, as well as field trips to a petroleum facility, a geothermal
steam field, a regional sewage and water purification plant, an air and water
quality testing facility, an agricultural experimental station, and a recycling
plant. The workshop during the first summer will recruit 30 secondary teachers
of biology from the San Francisco Bay area. During the second summer, 30
secondary life and physical science teachers will be eligible to attend. During
the third summer secondary Mentor Teachers from throughout Central California
will be invited to attend. The activities during the subsequent academic year
will consist of three one-day workshops and visits to the classrooms of the
individual participants. In addition to the content material and the support
provided by the university faculty and mentor teachers, appropriate curriculum
materials will be developed.
