An international group of historians of science and science educators will
organize and conduct a conference at Florida State University which will also
involve pre-college science teachers, science administrators, and educational
policy makers. The conference will explore ways in which inclusion of elements
of the history and philosophy of science in science teaching at all levels can
contribute to the preparation of future science teachers, curriculum
development, enhancement of the skills of practising science teachers, and
contribute to the development of a more scientifically literate society. Several
distinguished scholars in the field will prepare papers for advance distribution
and other participants will make presentations at the conference. All conference
proceedings will be published and disseminated broadly and a variety of follow-
up activities will be encouraged. Cost sharing by Florida State University will
total 9.9% of the National Science Foundation funding.
