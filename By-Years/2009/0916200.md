Modern machine learning is limited in its ability to use diverse information
during training. This project is developing algorithms in the SVM family that
allow extra information to be used effectively during training, with the
understanding that this extra information will not be available during actual
operation. Examples of extra information include structural homologies between
proteins in a system designed to predict structure from amino acid sequences;
and values for a financial time series between the time where a prediction is
made and the time of the value being predicted. Preliminary testing has shown
that such extra information can dramatically reduce prediction error in the
learned system compared with current generation machine learning methods that
cannot use this extra information.

This project encompasses analytic research to establish performance bounds on
our new algorithms, and to explore the relationships of this work to human
learning. The project also includes experimental work, including construction of
novel training and testing datasets; software implementation of the algorithms;
and training, testing and analysis of experimental results. Areas of application
include handwritten character recognition; 3-D protein structure prediction;
non-linear time series prediction, for example of financial time series; and
prediction of likelihood of hospital readmittance for elderly patients. This
project aims to give greater insight into the nature of learning, whether in
humans or machines, and seeks to formally take into account data that is today
seen as only peripheral to the learning task, and impossible for current machine
learning algorithms to use.

The project will produce technical articles, a book, and teaching materials
explaining this research. In addition the project will produce sharable software
that implements the best version of the algorithm devised during the life of the
project.
