9529383 Shoureshi The "NSF/NIST/EPRI workshop on New Directions in Intelligent
Systems" to be held at the NIST facilities located in Gaithersburg, MD, from
June 10 to June 12, 1996 brings together leading industrial representatives,
scientists and engineers who have made pioneering contributions in the general
areas of dynamic system analysis, measurement, and control of smart engineering
systems. In particular, the industrial leaders focus their discussions and
presentations on identifying the future needs in the areas of intelligent
systems, including their architecture and their components such as computers,
controls, sensors and actuators. The researchers from the academe and the
national laboratories analyze the needs of the industry and define research
directions which would enable the industry to meet the challenges of the 21st
century. The support for the workshop is provided by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in
addition to the National Science Foundation (NSF).***
