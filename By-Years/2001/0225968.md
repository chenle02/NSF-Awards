PHY-0225968&lt;br/&gt;Lebowitz&lt;br/&gt;The Internation Conference on
Theoretical Physics (TH-2002) is being organized for July 22-27, 2002 in Paris,
France. This award will help support the travel of young scientists,
particularly graduate students and postdocs,to this conference. A portion of the
award will also support visits by young scientists to theoretical centers within
Europe for the purpose of establishing new collaboration with scientists they
might not otherwise encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
