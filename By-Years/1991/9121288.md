This project involves a detailed study of several metals which are well known to
have an electronic structure characterized by a Fermi surface. The technique
employed is high-resolution photo-emission spectroscopy with synchrotron
radiation sources. The immediate objective is to determine the (presently
unknown) photoemission lineshape in these materials. This information will
potentially be valuable in the interpretation of photoemission data for high
temperature superconductor materials. This may help clarify the Fermi-surface
characteristics of these materials.
