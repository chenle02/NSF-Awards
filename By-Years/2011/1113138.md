This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish an
aquaculture facility to breed and maintain laboratory reared populations of
cephalopods. Marine Biomedical Technologies (MBT) is uniquely prepared to
overcome the obstacles involved in successfully raising large laboratory
populations of healthy cephalopods, and make these animals available to
researchers and educators. The specific objectives are to establish laboratory
breeding colonies of three species of cuttlefish and one species of squid,
evaluate the effectiveness of visual cues placed in breeding tanks to induce
early reproductive behavior in cuttlefish and squid, and to investigate the
effects of an administered hormone precursor supplement on fecundity, individual
growth, and mating frequency of cuttlefish and squid.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research are to create the availability
of a critical resource to ensure that research involving cephalopods can be
conducted, can be accomplished faster, at less cost, with greater reliability,
and to the direct benefit of society. In conjunction with Colleges and
Universities, MBT will provide a fertile training ground to educate state-of-the
art environmental scientists that will have a working knowledge of alternative
model species, their husbandry, and the bench methods necessary to address
environmental health questions through the application of such models. Finally,
establishing a facility to breed and maintain captive stocks of cephalopods will
result in a reduction of harvested animals from the natural environment. This
will directly help in maintaining the stability and health of the marine
ecosystem.
