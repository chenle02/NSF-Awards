The general subject area of this research is optimization theory and
mathematical programming in particular. The overall objectives of the research
are to advance the scientific understanding of the underlying properties of such
problems, to develop effective computational methods for solving various classes
of mathematical programming problems, and to propose ways in which the knowledge
acquired can be implemented for the benefit of science and society. The methods
employed in this project will include mathematical analysis, development and
experimental testing of computer software for numerical solution of real-world
problems. Mathematical programming is concerned with finding the best solution
to problems with many variables and many constraints on such variables.
Practical applications of such problems are found in virtually every branch of
science and technology. The goal of the research is to extend the scope of
mathematical programming methods and to make them more effective by enlarging
the size of problems that can be handled, increasing the speed with which the
computing is done, and improving the usefulness of the answers obtained.
