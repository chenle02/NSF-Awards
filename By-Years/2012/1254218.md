A rapid acceleration in both volume and complexity of public domain and
scientific data presents new and exciting challenges. This project aims to
develop a theoretical framework for structured learning of distribution spaces
and study tools for identifying and utilizing probabilistic structure in high-
dimensional large volume data. This project lies within the intersection of
multiple disciplines: signal processing, pattern recognition, machine learning,
probability and statistics, and thus will foster collaboration among these
disciplines. The application of the proposed framework to data-driven medical
diagnosis and ecological research will further the impact of this project beyond
the realm of computational data analysis. Additionally, this research sets a
goal to enrich the quality of education for both undergraduate and graduate
students, through exciting integration of research, application, and new
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research framework consists of
geometrically-constrained probabilistic modeling and efficient optimization
approaches for inference of multiple instance data. The project sets forth the
following tasks i) confidence-constrained joint estimation of multiple discrete
probability models, ii) joint learning of multiple distribution based
geometrically-constrained maximum-entropy models, and iii) direct application of
the developed framework to the analysis of clinical flow cytometry data for
medical diagnosis and in-situ bioacoustics data for ecological research.
