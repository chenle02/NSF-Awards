A group of investigators with related interest in the synthesis, immunogenicity
and conformation of middle-sized peptide fragments and small proteins propose to
install a circular dichroism spectrometer (dichrograph) with controlling
computer. No instrument for measuring circular dichroism spectra is currently
available in the Wistar Institute or at the University of Pennsylvania. The
dichrograph will permit a quick spectroscopic characterization of a large number
of peptides synthesized for immunological studies, and as models for protein
folding intermediates. It will provide information on the secondary structure
and conformational flexibility in solution of the synthetic fragments. The
instrument will make it possible to study the correlation conformational changes
of immunogenic peptides as well as conformational changes due to post-
translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation and phosphorylation). Other
applications include measurement of protein denaturation curves in order to
determine the effect of mutation on protein stability, and conformational
studies on peptide models of protein folding intermediates in cytochrome C and
ubiquitin.
