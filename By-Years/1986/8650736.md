High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and computer-linked enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) will be used by students in the Microbiology
program at the University of California at Long Beach in preparation for
laboratory technician positions in molecular biology, industrial, and
environmental microbiology. HPLC will introduce students to time-efficient steps
in the separation and detection of specific cellular components used in
microbial identification. Applications of HPLC in microbiology will be presented
in laboratory exercises in different upper-division elective courses offered by
the Microbiology Department. ELISA instrumentation will introduce third- year
students in the required course of Immunology and Serology to automated, time-
efficient steps in the quantitation of specific proteins on the microbial cell
surface using the specificity of antibody- dependent immunoassays. Students will
become familiar with the application of computers to microbiological
instrumentation and data analysis. Experience with this equipment in the
teaching laboratory exercises will prepare B.S. candidates in microbiology for
positions in commercial laboratories where these techniques are currently in
use. This new instrumentation will produce a major updating of this B.S.-level
technician preparatory program.
