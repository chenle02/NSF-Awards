This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish a method
to quantitatively predict the level of micromixing and mass transport in single-
phase and multiphase fluid systems that are generated by a novel low-frequency
acoustic technology. The primary Phase I objective is to demonstrate the
feasibility for development of a theoretical understanding of the governing
mechanisms for the transformation of high-intensity, low-frequency, acoustic
energy radiation into useful work for mixing and mass transport applications in
multi-phase fluids. A secondary, but essential, objective will be to develop the
transfer functions coupling the acoustic transducer to the radiated acoustic
energy in the fluid. The models will be accompanied by experiment methods that
will correlate classical micromixing amd mass transport techniques with acoustic
field experiment data. The proposed work will result in establishing a
fundamental understanding of the governing mechanisms for acoustically-driven,
single-phase and multiphase fluid processes, as well as fluid-particle
interactions. The analytical models are essential for exploitation of the
industrial market by innovative low-frequency acoustic mixing methods that are
emerging. Mixing is the most common operation encountered in the Chemical
Processing Industries. In North America alone, the conventional industrial mixer
market is between $200 million and $250 million annually. Other industries
reliant upon mixing and mass transport include food, petroleum, mining,
pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, water treatment and municipal waste water
treatment.
