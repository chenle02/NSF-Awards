The proposed research is a study of the effects of developmental regulation on
the protein composition and chromatin structure of specific eukaryotic genes. A
novel isolation technique, nucleoprotein hybridization, enables the enrichment
and subsequent study of chromatin fragments of the developmentally- regulated
sea urchin early histone gene repeat (SUEHGR) from S. purpuratus. These five
genes undergo a coordinated switch in expression during embryonic development.
The genes have been enriched to greater than 90% purity without noticeable
nucleosome loss or rearrangements, nor degradation of DNA or protein. Electron
microscopy will determine the disposition of nucleosomes and non-histone
proteins along SUEHGR and the folding of the nucleosomes into 30 nm chromosome
fibers. This will be the first direct study of the structure of a specific gene
during embryonic development. The results should be a major contribution to our
understanding of the mechanism of eukaryotic gene regulation during
embryogenesis.
