The goal of this effort is to generate scientific knowledge and to apply this
knowledge to sensor development. The REU Site is part of the Summer
Undergraduate Fellowship in Sensor Technologies (SUNFEST) program of the
University of Pennsylvania's Center for Sensor Technologies. The Center provides
the infrastructure for faculty and students to collaborate, exchange ideas, co-
supervise students, and share resources. Students are selected by a faculty
committee based on their academic potential, interest in pursuing a research
career, attitude towards graduate studies, advisors' recommendations, membership
in underrepresented groups, and research opportunities in the home institution.
Special emphasis is placed on the broader interaction and communication of these
SUNFEST fellows with the graduate students and faculty members associated with
the Center. The projects suggested to the students are chosen for their
educational value, scientific merit, and the prospects for continued involvement
after the summer.
