0103076&lt;br/&gt;Lee&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to NSE,
NSF-0019. As the area of microfabricated biochemical instrumentation continues
to grow, increasingly sophisticated devices are necessary. Fluid flows in the
great majority of current microfluidic devices are electrically driven,
especially for those involved in charge-based separations of biological
molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. This electrically driven flow offers
numerous advantages over micromachined pressure-driven pumps, including ease of
fabrication and operation, simplicity of integration with other functional
elements, and the absence of moving parts. However, this electrical means of
pumping suffers from the lack of simultaneous control over fluid flow in
multiple interconnected channels, and the inability to perform spatial- or time-
controlled modification of flow rate and direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
realization of true lab-on-a-chip technology, in which the capability of desktop
bioanalytical tools is replicated in a credit card sized package, will require
precise flow control and metering in complex networks of interconnected
microfluidic channels between mixers, reactors, reservoirs, separators, sensors,
and related components. To this end, we propose to create an integrated system
for fluid control in this miniaturized format. A novel microfluidic element, a
microfluidic multiplexer, can overcome the limitations mentioned above for
ordinary electrically driven fluid flow. This is accomplished by directly
controlling the electrical properties at the inner surface of the microfluidic
channels through the application of a radial, external electric field. The
microfluidic multiplexer, which allows on-device flow control in complex
microfluidic networks, will serve as the key component in a range of
microfabricated devices for performing unique bioseparations and bioanalyses.
