This award supports travel for participants in the conference "New Perspectives
in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations," held 2-6 May 2011 at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The workshop brings together junior
researchers and leading mathematicians working in the areas of nonlinear partial
differential equations, fluid dynamics, shock waves, general relativity, and
differential geometry. The conference aims to stimulate research inspired by
recent fundamental advances in these fields and to educate young researchers
about these recent developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance
communication among junior and senior researchers in applied nonlinear partial
differential equations. Lectures will be posted on the conference web site. The
conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior
researchers, and members of under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
