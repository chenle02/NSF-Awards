The boundary current east of Abaco in the Bahamas will be studied in a field
experiment using an array of moored current meters. Major goals of this
experiment are to determine the variability of the western boundary currents,
examine a hypothesized gyre east of the boundary current, and add to the
knowledge of the redistribution of heat by the Atlantic Ocean. The velocity will
be measured along a line extending zonally for 400 km. This experiment will be
coordinated with complimentary work by a group from the U. of Miami and NOAA
through the STACS Program.
