CBET-134187&lt;br/&gt;PI: Faghri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Li-air batteries are
promising alternatives to current Li-ion batteries due to the high specific
energy of lithium metal (12 kWh kg-1) and the infinite oxygen for the cathode
available from the ambient. However, even if the specific energy achieved in
practice is much lower than the theoretical value (less than 10% of its
theoretical value), the specific energy of Li-air batteries achieved in
laboratory studies is at least 2-5 times higher than that of Li-ion batteries.
Thus, developing the science and the technology to achieve values closer to the
maximum achievable is an important objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The low
values achieved for the specific energy of a Li-air battery is partly related to
the low mass transfer coefficient of the porous cathode electrode. In the
proposed effort, an innovative and active Li-air battery is proposed that has a
much higher specific energy and power. The innovation lies in the development of
an inter-digitated micro channel system adjacent to the cathode through which
electrolyte and oxygen mixture is circulated. The hypothesis is that the
specific energy and power of Li-air batteries is enhanced because the convection
of electrolyte in the porous electrode can increase the mass flux of oxygen and
lithium ion in the electrode. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, an improved thermal
management system with the circulation of electrolyte, within and outside the
battery electrode is proposed enabling the battery system to operate under
extreme environmental conditions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newly proposed
battery is expected to have a specific energy as high as 600 Wh kg-1, and a
specific power as high as 25 W kg-1. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, the project will lead to
Li-air batteries with enhanced specific energy and power. The application
domains include automotive, energy-storage, aerospace and others.
