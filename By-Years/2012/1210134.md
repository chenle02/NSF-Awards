This action funds Taraneh Mojaverian of University of California, Santa Barbara
to conduct a research project, entitled "Cultural differences among Koreans and
Americans in perceptions and use of received help in the classroom," during the
summer of 2012 at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is
Eunkook Suh.

Combining previous research on culture, academics, motivation, and social
support, the current research addresses how interactions between providers and
recipients of assistance may affect motivation in an academic domain, how
differences in perceptions of unsolicited and solicited assistance may influence
assistance use, and how these differences are influenced by cultural values.
This research contrasts solicited assistance, or help that is given after the
assistant recipient asks for help, with unsolicited assistance, or help that is
given without previous prompting from the recipient. Research on the foundations
of academic achievement has long looked for moderators of academic motivation.
The influence of culture is a recent topic in this area.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
