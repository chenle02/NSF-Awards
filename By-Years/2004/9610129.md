This starter grant award to the University of Central Florida supports the
research of Professor Cherie L. Geiger. Within the field of environmental
chemistry, the work focusses on the interactions and byproducts of agricultural
chemicals. The objective is to understand the mechanism of degradation of five
commonly used agricultural chemicals under conditions found in a central Florida
nursery and to determine the chemical interactions of these five agrochemicals
and their breakdown products. Foliage and soil samples will be analyzed using
high performance liquid chromotography and gas chromatography using both a mass
spectrometer and a photo ionization-electrolytic conductivity detector. Findings
from this research underpin further longterm study of the transport and fate of
agricultural chemicals in the environment. Benefits include better protection
against catastrophic crop loss for nurseries in the foliage industry and a more
comprehensive understanding of the dangers to human health and environmental
contamination.
