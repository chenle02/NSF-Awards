The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable non-technical users to create
complete and comprehensive software test automation. Additionally, it will
enable growing software companies to ship their products faster with higher
quality at a reasonable cost. Currently, these companies spend up to 50% of
their resources on quality assurance (QA) and testing. This project will develop
an automated process for testing software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will combine symbolic
reasoning algorithms, deep learning, and reinforcement learning models to
automate software quality assurance testing. The two problems being addressed by
this project are (1) software development teams spend up to 50% of their time
testing software, and (2) they have to hire skilled software engineers to
automate these tests. The objective of this research is to use artificial
intelligence (AI) to make software quality assurance testing faster and enable
non-technical workers to create sophisticated tests without the need to code.
The proposed research aims to create an AI prototype by (i) building a baseline
of manual test scenarios, (ii) building tests using symbolic reasoning (SR),
(iii) incorporating deep learning, and (iv) adding reinforcement learning to
generate tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
