9321404 Guthrie This study will examine two contending theories which account
for the tremendous extinction of large mammals about 11,000 years ago. Nearly
80% of the American large mammal species were lost over a rather short period of
time. The human overkill theory argues that Paleoindian large-mammal hunters
from Asia expanded rapidly into the Americas, overexploiting their prey species.
The other theory proposes that a radical ecological shift at the end of the
Pleistocene produced such biotic perturbations that many species could not adapt
with sufficient rapidity. A new test will examine the geographic pattern of
woolly mammoth extinction of a much finer scale that has been attempted
previously. Alaska and the Yukon Territory are the focus of this study because
they were a critical geographic link between the Old and New World. This project
is part of the paleo component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.
