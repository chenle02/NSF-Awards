9453888 Moshell This proposal would support the gathering of data and production
of a report which recommends a research agenda concerning the application of
Virtual Environments (VE) to science and mathematics education. The principal
means to be used to gather this data are 1) Correspondence with research leaders
at various universities around the country, and participation in several
Internet news groups to locate additional researchers; 2) Visits to six to eight
of the principal sites around the country in which research on education and
virtual environments is underway; 3) Travel to the United Kingdom (from France,
during another trip) to visit schools and universities developing research
programs in VE for education; 4) Attendance of the National Educational
Computing Convention in Boston, MA for interviews and data gathering. The
resulting report will be provided to the National Science Foundation in draft
form on 15 May 1994, and in final form before the end of June 1994.
