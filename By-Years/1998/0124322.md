This Small Business Innovation Research project has as its primary objective
the investigation of the feasibility of a novel 360-degree display monitor
concept for video conferencing. Videoconferencing technology has long sought to
facilitate more natural and effective one-on-one and group communications and
collaboration among people separated by distance. The plan is to build a
360-degree monitor to show panoramic video images from the center of the table
to all 360-degree viewing angles. All participants can see the displayed image
from where he/she is seated. At the same time, all participants in the
conference room can see each other directly, while communicating with people
from the other site via the 360-degree display monitor and a 360-degree camera.
Genex Technologies' proffered technology will be of interest for a broad range
to a broad range of consumers. Its applications include videoconferencing,
security, and the entertainment industry.
