This renewal grant funds theoretical research to extend liquid state theory -
the Born-Green-Yvon integral equation technique- to more complex fluids
(polymers and polymer mixtures). There are a number of objectives for this
research. One is the greater understanding of both lattice and continuum fluids
and their mixtures. Another is the determination of differences in calculated
thermodynamic properties based on either the lattice or continuum theories. A
final objective is to development theoretical tools which will be useful for
experimentalists to interpret results. Although common in studies of simple
liquids, the methods used here are unique in their application to polymers and
provide a comprehensive theoretical approach which is midway between the more
commonly used polymer lattice and continuum theories. %%% This theoretical
research will establish rigorous models of polymer liquids and liquid mixtures
which will greatly assist the interpretation of experimental results for this
important class of materials. The results should also place more commonly used
theories in better perspective.
