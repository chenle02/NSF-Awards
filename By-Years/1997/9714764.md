This proposal will support a laptop and a projection system for classroom
instruction using Unidata-provided software and data. Upgrading two existing PCs
to new more capable models is also proposed. This equipment will be used to
teach new Earth Systems Science courses being developed by the Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences department of the City College. The City College, being an
inter-city school, has a significant minority student population.
