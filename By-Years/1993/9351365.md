Three sets of optical spectrum analyzers are being used for this project; one
for each of the three work stations in the electro-optics laboratory. That
laboratory is used for two undergraduate laboratory courses which have a total
annual enrollment of about 105 students. In addition, about 20 senior projects
and 10 directed independent studies are completed in that laboratory
annually.The new equipment is being used by students for trouble shooting and as
a means of graphically displaying and analyzing the spectra of optical sources,
modulated optical signals, and what is happening to such signals at various
points in an optical network. A total of three new experiments are being
introduced, enabling the students to gain practical experience in
characteristics of optical sources, longitudinal modes of the laser,
photodetectors and spectral characteristics of fiber optic networks. The
experience gained in using optical spectrum analyzers is stimulating and
expanding undergraduate learning in electro-optics.
