National Science Foundation Informal Science Education Program Abstract PROPOSAL
#97-25790 INSTITUTION: World WildLife Fund PI: Judy Braus PROJECT: Windows on
the Wild - Exploring Biodiversity The World Wildlife Fund will develop Windows
on the Wild - Exploring Biodiversity. The components of this project include two
editions of a 2000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit, mini-exhibition kits designed to
reach small and medium-sized institutions, and complementary educational
materials designed to reach the general public and families including
traditionally underserved audiences, students, and educators. With this project
WWF intends to raise awareness and interest in biodiversity - its importance and
its decline; raise awareness of the nature and role of scientific research in
investigating and protecting biodiversity; raise awareness of, interest in, and
understanding of the impacts of personal choices on biodiversity; and motivate
and empower individuals to get involved in biodiversity issues. The exhibits
will include a centerpiece theater introduction surrounded by five sections
presenting activities and information related to the themes: What is
Biodiversity? How Do We Find Out? Why is it Important? Why Is It at Risk? and
How Can We Get Involved? Ancillary materials form the general public will
include A Family Biodiversity Discovery Notebook, a take-home booklet, a
brochure format for host institutions to use highlighting local events, among
others. Complementary materials linking the exhibit to formal education
activities include Educator's Info, and Windows on the Wild Biodiversity
Educational Materials, as well as information about workshop and institutes.
