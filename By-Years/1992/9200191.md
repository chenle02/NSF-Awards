This project will bring eight undergraduate students to the University of
California, Berkeley for an eight week period in the summer of 1992. Recruiting
for the program is to be national in scope. The participants will work with
faculty and graduate students in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science. The students will be in, or will have completed their junior
year, and will all be women, or members of an underrepresented ethnic minority.
In addition to working one on one with a faculty member, each participant will
be assigned to a graduate student of the same gender and ethnicity. Faculty
involved come from analog integrated circuit design, optical communications,
computational biology, control theory and applications, graphical user
interfaces and CIM, and the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center.
