This project is applying ideas developed in recent research into action
languages, on the logic of causal explanation, and on satisfiability planning to
the formalization and automation of reasoning tasks in a ide range of action
domains. The new formalizations must take into account the possibility of
complex interactions between cuncurrent actions, the role of the exact duration
of an action, the role of knowledge as a prerequisite for executing an action,
and the possibility of creating and destroying objects in the process of
executing actions. Some of the action domains being investigated include
realistic representations of the physical space in which agents move around and
are significantly larger than the typical "toy worlds" that research on actions
has concentrated on in the past. The result will be another step toward
achieving the goals of a theory of commonsense knowledge and reasoning - the
reasoning processes used by humans in everyday life, rather than just the
reasoning used in mathematical theorems. http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/
