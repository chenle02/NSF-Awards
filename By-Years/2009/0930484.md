0930484&lt;br/&gt;Storey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microfluidic devices are critical
components of promising future applications including massively parallel drug
discovery, integrated sensors for biological and chemical threats, and
personalized medicine. Despite their small size, many microfluidic systems
currently in use are limited to the laboratory due to large operational
voltages. A relatively new class of device that places micron size electrodes
inside channels is promising as they operate at relatively low voltage--a key
requirement for portability. Most computational models of these devices are
based in the classical theory of electrokinetic phenomena which couples fluid
flow, ion transport and electric fields in electrolytes. Unfortunately, these
models fail to predict some critically important experimental trends, impeding
their development. Recent work by the PI and collaborators has started to apply
simple corrections to the classical theory of electrokinetics to account for
some of the major deficiencies. To date, the corrected models can predict some
of the key trends but the agreement between model and experiment is still
lacking. The overall objective of this work is to improve modeling capability in
these electrically driven microfluidic applications such that one can use
relatively simple simulations as a tool for engineering design. While the
phenomena of interest is truly at the nanoscale, the strategy put forth is to
develop an accurate yet tractable continuum-based formulation that can be
applied by other researchers. This study has two main trusts. The first is to
study the role of incorporating surface roughness into the model. The second
thrust will be to investigate the role that electrochemical reactions at the
electrode surface plays in models of these flows. The hypothesis is that
inclusion of these two effects can go a long way toward resolving key
discrepancies between simulation and experiment. While the field of
electrokinetics is very mature, the microfluidic designs of interest operate in
regimes where aspects of the commonly used theory do not apply. This study
develops several carefully planned research projects to provide Olin
undergraduate students with an immersive, modern and successful research
experience.&lt;br/&gt;
