In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Brucat will study the gas-phase photodissociation spectroscopy of
transition-metal molecular ions. He will use optical probes, such as resonant
two-photon dissociation spectroscopy and stimulated emission pumping, in order
to learn about metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies. %%% The studies in
this project are aimed at understanding the fundamental bonding interactions in
clusters. With the results of such work, the interactions between atoms in an
ionic crystal or in a solvent may be more readily comprehended. Such an
understanding might then be used to predict, for example, the course of chemical
reactions in solution or the structure of the surface of a metal catalyst.
