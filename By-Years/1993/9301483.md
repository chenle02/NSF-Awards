Nick Pugliano has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Pugliano's doctoral degree was from the University of California-Berkeley
under the supervision of Professor Richard Saykally. Dr. Pugliano will continue
research at the University of Pennsylvania under the sponsorship of Professor
Robin Hochstrasser. Dr. Pugliano's postdoctoral training will provide him with
skills and experience in studying condensed phase reaction dynamics using
ultrafast pump/probe techniques. Longer term he plans to investigate the
reaction dynamics of Ä±2+2! photocycloadditions of ketones with olefins by
ultrafast transient infrared absorption spectroscopy. %%% The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
