of California, Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pilot study, the
PIs will use a social network approach to study cities as important nodes in a
worldwide web of exchanges. The major questions that will be explored are on the
structure and change in a select network of cities. Specifically, which cities
are more central in the network of world cities? Which are peripheral? Is the
network of cities growing more tightly integrated over recent time? Do cities'
roles in the global network reflect those of the nations in which they are
located, or are they becoming independent of national trajectories? Finally, how
is social life within cities influenced by their role in the global network? The
research includes using formal network techniques to analyze data on flows of
airline passengers and air cargo between all pairs of some 150-200 cities
comparing patterns in 1990 and 2000, developing other city-to-city network data
(e.g., telecommunications, oceanic cargo, human migration), and evaluating
untested theoretical claims about the social consequences of global positioning
of cities on social structural change within them. The project will contribute
to scholarly as well as popular debates about globalization, begin to build a
world city network database that will be available to other scholars, contribute
to a number of important public policies debates, provide data and results
relevant to debates about city and nation-based strategies for global economic
competitiveness, the role for "the state" (at various levels) to promote that
sort of development, possible tradeoffs between growth and
polarization/inequality, and long-term challenges presented by emergent patterns
and processes of globalization in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;
