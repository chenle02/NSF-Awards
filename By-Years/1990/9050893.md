An interactive microcomputer laboratory is being established to enhance
instructional and research experiences for undergraduate psychology majors. It
impacts all majors as they work through a four- year laboratory sequence which
has been designed to build 1. cognitive skills involved in the logic of research
design, 2. laboratory techniques to implement research designs, 3. data analytic
skills, 4. independence in the initiation and communication of research
projects, and 5. identification with the profession as scholar-scientists.
Instruction is being provided in 1. interfacing computers to control the
presentation of stimuli for human and animal experiments, 2. computer
programming for environmental control, 3. real-time data acquisition, and 4.
interactive data analysis. Simulation programs are also used to introduce
students to this research strategy and to study phenomena which cannot otherwise
be investigated. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
