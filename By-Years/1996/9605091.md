9605091 Whitfield This project will support travel to Australia by Professor
James Whitfield, Department of Entomology, University of Arkansas, and his Post
Doctoral Research Assistant, Dr. Patrick Mardulyn, to work with Dr. Andrew
Austin of the Department of Crop Protection, Waite Institute, University of
Adelaide. During their visits they will coordinate research and analyze
morphological and DNA sequence data for a phylogenetic study of a group of
parasitoid wasps. The results will be useful in studies of evolution of
parasitism in the wasps and in ongoing research on the co-phylogeny of
polydnaviruses and parasitoid wasps. The new classification will be invaluable
to a large community of biologists interested in naturally-occurring and human-
manipulated management of pest insects and to an additional community of
scientists engaged in biodiversity surveys.
