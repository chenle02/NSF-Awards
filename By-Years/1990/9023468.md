The proposed research will lead to the development of a new class of
superconducting magnetic senors, utilizing the newly discovered high Tc cooper
oxide superconductors. High Tc instruments are expected to offer better
performance than non superconducting counterparts, together with lower operating
cost than low Tc superconducting instruments. The proposed work focuses upon the
coupling of high Tc superconducting sense-loops to a fluxgate magnetometer. The
sense-loop, and flux transformer technology can also be applied to couple to a
high Tc SQUID, if they become more available. Phase I Demonstrated the use of a
fluxgate, coupled to a superconducting loop. We were able to use the
superconducting loop, or "antenna", to couple external fields into the fluxgate,
and we were able to use the fluxgate to demonstrate the ability of the
superconducting loop, to carry a persistent current. Phase II will impliment
refinements needed to meet the requirements of a commercial product. There are:
Higher sensitivity for the fluxgate detector More optimal coupling of the field
to the detector Operation, using liquid nitrogen cryogen Superconducting loops
patterned into gradiometers, not just simple circles. These goals will require
us to fabricate superconducting structures with crossovers.
