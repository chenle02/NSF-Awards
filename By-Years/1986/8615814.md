This proposal was submitted in response to the ECSE announcement of Grant
Opportunities for Engineering Research in Japan. The first year of research is
to be performed in Japan at Kyoto University and the second, at the University
of Miami. Studies will be conducted on thin films for GaAs integrated circuit
technology using the ionized Cluster Beam (ICB) deposition method. ICB research
was initiated by researchers at Kyoto University and is based upon producing,
ionizing, and accelerating atom clusters onto a substrate in a high vacuum
environment. The objectives of the proposed research are to evaluate the claims
about ICB, to obtain a first hand working knowledge of the technique, to develop
ICB epitaxial GaAs films on specially prepared Si substrates and to develop
single crystal interconnect films for GaAs technology. Additional objectives are
to establish long term cooperation with Japanese researchers and establish ICB
research at the University of Miami.
