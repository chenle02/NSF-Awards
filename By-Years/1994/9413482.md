9413482 Friedman This is a request for partial support for the travel of a U.S.
delegation to the Assembly and Administrative Council of the International
Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (IFMBE). The Council will meet
in conjunction with the World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical
Engineering and the International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in
Medicine (IUPESM) on August 21-26, 1994 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The U.S. will
be represented by a delegation of the American Institute for Medical and
Biological Engineering (AIMBE). AIMBE is intended to be a unifying organization
for medical and biological engineering in the U.S. It is essential that the U.S.
be well represented at the IFMBE's International meeting (held only once, every
three years), and it is especially appropriate for the AIMBE to play a major
role in such representation. ***
