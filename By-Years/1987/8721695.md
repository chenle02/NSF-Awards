Many ingredients are required for the formation of severe weather in the
central and eastern parts of the United States. One of these factors, which is
most difficult to forecast, is the timing and location of the return of warm,
moist, unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico. This research is part of a larger
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) led project which seeks
to improve understanding of the modification of cold air outbreaks as they move
over the warm Gulf waters. Of particular interest are the nature of this airmass
modification and the factors which control it. A combined modelling and
observational approach is planned including a small field program. Observational
systems will include the NOAA P-3 research aircraft, supplemental soundings from
National Weather Service (NWS) upper air stations and satellite data. Four
Cross-chain Loran Atmospheric Sounding Systems (CLASS) from the National Science
Foundation sponsored National Center for Atmospheric Research will be used to
improve the spatial density of the sounding information available from the NWS
sites. Three of these systems will be placed in the Gulf of Mexico -- two aboard
research vessels and one on an oil drilling platform. The data collected from
this ensemble of instrumentation will be the most complete to date on airmass
modification over the Gulf.
