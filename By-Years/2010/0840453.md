With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Richard D. Bates and colleague Timothy H.
Warren from Georgetown University will acquire an X-band electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium cryostat. The
spectrometer will impact research in the area of catalytic intermediates for C-H
bond functionalization, optically-switchable magnetic materials, photogenerated
radical intermediates, encapsulated radical species, photoreduction of carbon
dioxide as well as nitroxide-based resonance probes for biological imaging.
Access to EPR techniques will also enable important new, natural directions of
current research programs and student training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR
spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic
structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain
information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive
species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation
of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from
the synthesis of organic molecules to the development of new solid state
materials to the imaging of biological tissues. Employing examples inspired from
ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of teaching at the
undergraduate and graduate levels.
