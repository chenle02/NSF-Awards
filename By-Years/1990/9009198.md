This research is focused on the development of a computer assisted model to
predict when and how people will cluster into groups and polarize. At issue is
the question, under what conditions will people prove susceptible, or resistent,
to the persuasive attempts of the majority or minority groups. The model
developed in this proposal has shown that with only a small amount of
information, changes in group attitude structure can be predicted with a high
degree of accuracy. This research, if successful, will assist considerably in
understanding the manner in which groups influence individuals, and also the
manner in which individuals influence groups. These issues are fundamental to
almost all of social psychology, and as such, the research promises to have a
great impact throughout the field. This research promises to contribute to both
theory and application in social research.
