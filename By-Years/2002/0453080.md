The relationships between social institutions and the development of legal
consciousness and mobilization are among the central concerns of sociolegal
scholarship. This study takes advantage of a unique natural experiment to
examine the ways in which legal consciousness -- including the orientation of
citizens to the law and the invocation of laws and legal rights -- is affected
by changes in state-level legal norms and institutions. The study will rely on
systematic qualitative data analysis of interviews with respondents, using NVIVO
software to isolate analytic themes and patterns of reasoning, as well as on
quantitative analysis of survey data from the entire population of individuals
affected by the legal changes in question in one major metropolitan area. The
research will offer novel and important insights into the engagement of citizens
with the law, not only revealing the perceived role of law according to the
citizen being studied, but also whether and how likely they are to enact their
rights or turn to the law to resolve their problems.
