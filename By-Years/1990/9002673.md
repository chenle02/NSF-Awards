Let L be an oriented link type in the oriented 3-sphere, S3, and let L and L',
defined respectively by closed n- and m-braid diagrams, represent L. The
investigator is primarily concerned with understanding how it is possible to
jump between conjugacy classes without stabilization. This is one of the
technical questions involved in understanding how a finite collection of
(possibly knotted) simple closed curves in 3-dimensional space can be linked
with one another.
