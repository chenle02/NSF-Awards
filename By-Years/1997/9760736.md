This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Physical Optics
Corporation (POC) will develop a compact full color head mounted display (HMD).
The proposed display will be low in weight and cost, easy to manufacture, and
comfortable to use. The firm proposes to develop a compact full-color HMD with
high resolution and a high refresh rate based on the following innovations: (a)
A liquid crystalline, electro-optic, tunable micro-scanner based on POC's
recently demonstrated microrefraction optic technology; (b) multiplexed (RGB)
holographic reflective optics based on POC's established volume holographic
technology; and (c) a modular architecture for improved manufacturability. POC
will investigate the feasibility of the proposed concept through analysis and
experimentation, leading to a proof of concept at the end of Phase I). A novel
head mounted information display technology will be extremely useful in a wide
range of scientific and other applications. Potential commercial applications of
the proposed HMD include virtual reality, telepresence in robotics, medicine,
avionics, education, and CAD applications in the private sector. Video
conferencing, movies, and video games offer huge potential mass markets for
compact, high resolution, low cost HMDS.
