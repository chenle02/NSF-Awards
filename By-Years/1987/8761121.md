This project will develop an integrated, computer graphical design tool for the
numerical solution of boundary value problems over domains containing geometric
features with widely varying scales. Many hours are presently spent in modeling
such problems. The proposed Structural Zooming System (SZS) will significantly
reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of such analyses. The central concept,
as introduced here, is simple, and is coined "structural zooming." This concept
approaches the problem of modeling a large complex object (the "parent" object)
by recursively analyzing smaller portions ("child" objects) of the parent.
Geometrical and mesh refinements may be introduced for each successive analysis.
After analysis of the parent, a child is extracted. Boundary conditions derived
from the parent analysis are applied to the child at the parent/child interface,
and the child is analyzed. Overall accuracy is improved using an iterative
algorithm involving reanalysis of both the parent and child objects to reduce
disequilibrium at the interface (caused by "back-coupling" effects). Finally,
the method is recursive -- a grandchild, greatgrandchild objects, etc., can be
defined if responses on more refined geometrical scales are required. Phase I
research will address the feasibility of structural zooming. A two-dimensional
prototype, consisting of a number of distinct software modules, will be
developed. Phase II will develop a completely integrated Structural Zooming
System for two- and three-dimensional objects, utilizing software designs and
recommendations developed during Phase I.
