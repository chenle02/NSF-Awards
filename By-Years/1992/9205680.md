The Department of Applied Mathematical Sciences of the University of Houston-
Downtown will purchase a high-speed workstation, and a compatible high-
performance co-processor array. This equipment will be used in the following
research projects. Project 1 To develop adaptive grid refinement algorithms
which can be used for solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Project 2 To
develop parallel numerical algorithms to find reliable global numerical
solutions for very large nonlinear systems of equations by using preconditioned
Interval Newton Methods.
