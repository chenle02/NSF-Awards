The goal of the second edition of the AMAST conference is to consolidate the
trend created by the international dialogue during the first edition of the
AMAST making a new step toward transforming algebraic methodology into software
technology. The plan is to provide a forum for algebraists, computer scientists,
and software developers who are capable of tracing the lines of further
development in computer technology based on algebraic methodology and of
demonstrating the power of the algebraic methodology by their software products.
