Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-day workshop that
brings together physicists and philosophers who have a serious interest in the
philosophical foundations of quantum gravity theories (the topic of the
workshop); string theory is an example of such a theory. Participants include
those who have been working in this area for some time as well as those who have
just started out in this area, particularly graduate students and recent PhDs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in
quantum gravity theory promise to revolutionize our conceptions of space and
time, perhaps doing away with them altogether. Such theories will likely have
profound implications for the most basic assumptions in physics, with
consequences for our understanding of the nature of the world, of theorizing and
of scientific methods. Thus the philosophical study of the foundations of
quantum gravity promises to revolutionize philosophy as much as Newton and
Einstein's work in earlier periods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will serve to train graduate students
and recent PhDs. They will not only have the opportunity to learn by attending
the meeting, but there will be sessions designed to help them to present works-
in-progress, to gain valuable experience and feedback. The workshop will also
serve to build a network of scholars working on the philosophy of quantum
gravity, creating opportunities for dialogue and collaboration. Finally, the
proceedings of the meeting (and continuing discussions) will be disseminated via
a website and blog, so that there will be open access to the more immediate
results of the work.
