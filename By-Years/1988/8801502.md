Mechanoreceptors in animals receive mechanical stimuli which are transformed
into electrical responses. Research projects associated with this proposal are
motivated by the study the principal investigator has made on a particular
(tactile) receptor, the Pacinian corpuscle. Pacinian corpuscles receive
mechanical stimuli in the form of displacement, hence stress, on an outer
capsule composed of many layers of elastic membrane with fluid between these
layers. One project is to analyze a model equation for the pressure field in the
capsule derived via homogenization techniques under various boundary and initial
conditions. Evidence supports the hypothesis that pressure transmitted through
the capsule puts stress on the excitable dendritic membrane, which may possess a
strain-activated ionic channel. The mathematical models will be refined to by
comparing theoretical predictions with observations.
