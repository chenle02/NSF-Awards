Available mathematical methods for analyzing the demography of plant and animal
populations do not include the interactions of the sexes. The tacit assumption
is usually made that the population contains sufficient males to fertilize all
mature females, so that the dynamics of the population are determined by the
abundance of the latter (this assumption is referred to as "female dominance").
This assumption is now known not to be universally true, and recent work has
shown that including the sexes in demographic models can produce complicated and
heretofore unexpected patterns of dynamics. This research will investigate these
patterns, using mathematical methods developed for the study of nonlinear
dynamical systems. The models to be studied will include age or size classes of
both males and females, and the possibility of competition for mates among
individuals of the same sex but different ages. The effects of including
different models of the mating process, alternative mating strategies, and the
possibility of developmental sex change (a known phenomenon in some groups of
plants and animals) will be addressed. The results will have implications for
the understanding and management of populations in which the interaction of
males and females is an important determinant of population dynamics. They may
also be applicable to human demographic analysis.
