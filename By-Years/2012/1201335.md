The Langlands Program was launched by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s with
the goal of bringing together number theory and harmonic analysis. These ideas
have since propagated to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry
and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras. And in recent
works by Witten and others, it was shown that the Langlands duality patterns are
closely related to the electro-magnetic duality of Quantum Field Theory. The
goals of this project are two-fold. First, it is to develop further the
connection between the Langlands Program and the electro-magnetic duality,
generalize it to a broader context, and use it to obtain new mathematical
results. Second, to study further the geometric trace formulas developed by the
PI in collaboration with R. Langlands and B.C. Ngo, and to apply them to the
Langlands functoriality conjecture. The two parts of the proposal are
interconnected, because these trace formulas are most naturally interpreted in
the framework of the categorical Langlands correspondence and electro-magnetic
duality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary nature of this proposal will
serve to advance discovery and understanding of models of Quantum Field Theory
and at the same time will stimulate the development of the Langlands Program by
bringing in new insights from geometry and physics.
