A matrix group is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products
and inverses of its members. Representation theory is a branch of algebra
concerned with studying symmetries, especially symmetries arising from matrix
groups. Modular representation theory is the branch of representation theory
concerned with matrix groups whose entries come from a finite field. It has deep
connections with number theory, combinatorics, and geometry. This research
project aims to make advances in modular representation theory using geometric
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to make advances in the
representation theory of algebraic groups over a field of positive
characteristic via the philosophy of local geometric Langlands duality.
Specifically, the PI hopes to establish a collection of derived equivalences in
positive characteristic modeled on characteristic zero results. This work will
lead to explicit connections between between the following notions: (i) modular
representations of algebraic groups; (ii) modular perverse sheaves and parity
sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag variety; and (iii) the
phenomena of Koszul and Q-Koszul duality.
