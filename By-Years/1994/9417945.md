9417945 Navrotsky This award will support high temperature calorimetry studies
of the energetics of aluminosilicate melts, glasses, crystals, and amorphous
materials containing Ti, Zr, and La. Emphasis will be on measurements of heat
capacities, heats of formation, mixing, vitrification, fusion and phase
separation in situ at high temperature. The goals are to understand the role of
high field strength cations in affecting the energetic, structural, and physical
properties of crystals, melts and glasses, to link microscopic structural
features with macroscopic thermodynamics, and to apply these findings to the
behavior of magmatic and ceramic systems.
