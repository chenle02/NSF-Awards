Calvin College's Physics Department is utilizing two instruments to add modern
Fourier-analysis capability to the Fourier-synthesis methods already used in a
variety of courses. The equipment corrects a curricular deficiency identified in
the treatment of waves in general physics, health physics, mechanics,
electronics, and laboratory courses. The Fourier analyzers enable students to
see how audio, or general electronic, signals can be decomposed into a sum of
sinusoidal waves, and how this "frequency domain" viewpoint allows various
physical phenomena to be understood. A computer-resident fast- Fourier-transform
instrument added to a laboratory microcomputer serves to capture and Fourier-
transform signals in the 0 - 500 kHz range. This instrument is particularly
useful in acoustics demonstrations and electronic measurement. A stand-alone
radio-frequency spectrum analyzer extends Fourier-analysis capability to 2000
Mhz, and makes possible a variety of measurements, experiments, and research
directions in electronics and modern optics.NSF grant funds are being matched
with funds from non-federal sources.
