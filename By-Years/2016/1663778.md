This is a project in pure mathematics focusing on low-dimensional and symplectic
topology. It has two broadly constructed goals: to study the three-dimensional
homology cobordism groups, sets of spaces with many algebraic features in common
with the three-dimensional sphere, and to understand area-preserving maps
between manifolds. Philosophically speaking, these goals are united by a desire
to understand the flexibility or rigidity of geometric qualities of spaces.
Understanding the homology cobordism groups is a major motivating question in
topology; questions of the complexity of these groups in three dimensions are
tied to deep structural issues in higher-dimensional topology. Similarly, the
study of area-preserving (symplectic) maps is one of the central issues of
symplectic geometry, and has nontrivial connections to physics. The PI will also
study applications of invariants of knot concordance which arise in connection
with this research. Since one motivation for this project is that the tools used
are particularly computationally accessible, the PI will actively seek to
involve undergraduate and other young researchers in this work. The tools of
this project are equivariant versions of Floer-theoretic invariants. There are
two main programs. The first involves a recently-constructed involutive version
of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology, which gives two new
homology cobordism and knot concordance invariants. Using this invariant, the PI
will study the homology cobordism group and cosmetic surgeries on knots.
Involutive Heegaard Floer homology is a first step toward the long-term goal of
constructing Pin(2)-equivariant Heegaard Floer homology, which the PI will
continue to work toward. This is desirable in light of recent progress made
using Pin(2)-equivariant version of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, an analogous
theory. For the second, the PI proposes to construct a Serre spectral sequence
for the Lagrangian Floer cohomology of certain symplectic fibrations.
Relationships arising from this spectral sequence are expected to give
information about the symplectic mapping class group; furthermore, since many
invariants in symplectic and low-dimensional topology can be formulated in terms
of Lagrangian Floer cohomology, the spectral sequence itself has potentially
broad consequences. Other goals include understanding equivariant Lagrangian
Floer cohomology for general Lie groups, which also has many theoretical
applications; a Z_p version of existing theory for Z_2, for example, would imply
a criterion for deciding that a symplectomorphism of a manifold with stably
trivialized tangent bundle has infinite order.
