This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is for research
activities in all the subfields (organic, physical, analytical, inorganic, and
biochemistry) of chemistry. During the summer of 1992, twelve undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks engaged in research under the supervision of their
faculty, graduate student, or postdoctoral fellow advisors. A unique feature in
this REU activity is use of a graduate student or postdocoral fellow as a "peer"
mentor to help the student get started in the laboratory.
