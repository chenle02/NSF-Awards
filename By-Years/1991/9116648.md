The University of Florida College of Engineering (COE) is supporting a Minority
Engineering Doctorate Initiative (MEDI). Funds will be used to assist in
supporting eight PhD candidates who will have the option of pursuing studies in
the engineering specialty of their choice. Each student will receive an annual
stipend of $16,000 plus a research expense allowance of $5000. The COE will
cover the costs associated with tuition and fees, additions to stipends, and
other expense items not covered by the grant. A unique recruiting and retention
program will: attract qualified candidates, provide remedial opportunities, and
guarantee a high level of success in program completion. The MEDI program would
supplement and operate in concert with current minority recruiting programs. A
major difference is that it provides for a well-supported sharp focus on
minority engineering doctoral recruitment and retention.
