9320843 Shleifer Privatization of state enterprises has been one of the most
important economic changes that the world has seen in the last two decades. In
several dozen countries, including France, Britain, Italy, the United States
(Conrail), as well as many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, public
enterprises have been transferred to the private sector. An even more striking
change is privatization in Eastern Europe and Russia, where almost whole
economies are being transferred from public to private ownership. While it is
generally believed that private enterprise operates more efficiently than state
enterprise, there is very little work to explain why this is so. For example, is
it the fact that politicians have direct control over operating decisions in
public sector firms or is it the fact that any residual cash flow accrues to the
Treasury? This project investigates empirically and theoretically the relative
efficiency of state and private enterprises in different countries depending on
such factors as public vs. private ownership of cash flows, political vs.
managerial control of firms, levels of political corruption, degree of political
competition and the nature of the electoral system, and the importance of the
civil service. The institutional and empirical work focuses on the privatization
process and its aftermath in Russia and Eastern Europe with particular emphasis
on Russia. The broad areas of focus are: 1) trends in the privatization process
itself; 2) the evolution of ownership structure and corporate governance; and 3)
the credit and subsidies to newly privatized vs. public firms. The project uses
firm-level data available through Russian government sources as well as data
from a survey conducted by the investigators.
