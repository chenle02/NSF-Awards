CTS-9308526 University of Arkansas Maria R. Coleman ABSTRACT Chemical structure
will be systematically varied in a series of polyquinolines in order to
investigate relationships between molecular architecture and properties of
polymeric films and membranes. Structural changes will modify intersegmental and
intrasegmental resistances to chain mobility, the inhibitions to chain packing
and the distribution of free volume. Physical and, particularly, gas transport
properties of these rigid, high thermal resistance polymers will be measured.
Polymeric films are important barrier materials in food packaging and in the
microelectronics industries. Membranes are rapidly being developed and used in
production facilities for fuels and in the separation of gases for hospitals and
research institutes.
