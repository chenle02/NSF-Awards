This research focuses on understanding the dynamics and control features of
magnetic servo levitation, and on applying the ideas developed to robot
mechanisms through theoretical and experimental studies. Previous research in
this area has tended to develop magnetic servo levitation only within the
framework of linear control theory. This work differs from the earlier work in
that: 1) it treats explicitly the nonlinear and discrete time elements in the
control system to exploit magnetic levitation with large air gaps, 2) it takes
into consideration the dynamic motion of the stator which is normally assumed to
be stationary, and 3) it includes an experimental research component to evaluate
the control schemes for physical systems. The project is implemented in two
stages, the first of which develops a servo control system for active magnetic
levitation with large gaps, and the second of which demonstates servo levitation
for practical robotic applications.
