bits per second line through the State of Arkansas ARKNET and MIDNET mid-level
networks. The connection enables the school's faculty and students to
communicate and collaborate with the international scientific and edicational
community, and to access network resources such as libraries, databases and
supercomputers. This award funds part of the costs for two years.
