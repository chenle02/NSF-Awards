The proposed review of coastal meteorology is a timely opportunity to examine a
variety of mesoscale problems, which are often neglected or only acknowledged in
incidental ways. Moreover, some mesoscale circulations and cognate problems
associated with the coastal zone, the Great Lakes, estuaries, etc. could provide
important clues for the dynamical structure and response of other circulations
which are often difficult, hazardous, or expensive to investigate.
