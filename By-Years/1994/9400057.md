Layton The investigator studies solution algorithms for viscous, incompressible
flows at high Reynolds number. This problem includes the interrelated
difficulties of: boundary and interior layers, dominating and sensitive
nonlinearities, highly nonsymmetric and possibly indefinite linear systems and
the incompressibility constraint. Solution algorithms are studied for each of
these difficulties from one aspect to another. (For example, it would not be
satisfactory to simplify the linear system at the expense of increasing the
difficult of resolving the nonlinearity.) The general approach is (1) higher
order methods (2) point adaptivity and unstructured meshes, (3) stabilized
finite element discretizations, (4) stabilized, multi-level, multi-step Newton
methods for the nonlinearity, (5) robust (= uniform in Re), parallel, iterative
solvers for the linear systems, and (6) full mathematical support for all
algorithmic developments. Fluid flow problems at high Reynolds number arise in
many technological and scientific applications, such as convection in the melted
region in the solidification of materials, transport and dispersion of
pollutants in air and groundwater and simulations of climatic changes. Since
exact solution of these equations is impossible, computer based simulation of
fluid flow problems is essential in accurately predicting, and ultimately
controlling the quantities which are of interest. Accurate and reliable
simulation of high Reynolds number flow problems is a very challenging
scientific problem which is studied in this research. In large scale
applications this involves the study of algorithms which are highly parallel.
