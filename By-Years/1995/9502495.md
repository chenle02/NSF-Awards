9502495 Keasling This project is on research to develop a methodology whereby
bacterial metabolism can be redirected to synthesize all precursors necessary or
the production of a desired, complex compound from an inexpensive carbon source,
and to control metabolism in such a way that a defined composition can be
achieved. The general aims of the research are: (1) to introduce multiple
metabolic pathways from various organisms into a single bacterium: (2) to
determine how to balance production of enzyme subunits at stoichiometric levels
sufficient for a functioning complex: (3) to develop a mathematical model to
predict how to balance more than one flux necessary for a desired product: and
(4) to coordinately express the genes encoding the enzymes for the pathway at
the desired level. In addition to this research activity, the investigator will
enhance education by developing relevant laboratory experiments. ***
