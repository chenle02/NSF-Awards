This research is an attempt to couple the mechanics of particulate media with
the continuum theory of mixtures in order to better quantify the behavior of
fine grained soils in terms of the soil fabric. This will be accomplished
through the use of the theory of mixtures in a Cosserat continuum. The resulting
coupled theory will have the capability of handling problems involving initial
and evolving fabric and stress anisotropy, rotation of principal stresses, and
partial drainage.//
