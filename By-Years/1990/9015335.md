This grant provides partial funding for the acquisition of a melt rheometer.
Melt rheometry is a useful tool for developing an understanding of the
temperature-dependent phase behavior in polymer systems with complex chain
architectures. The equipment will be used in research on polyurethane systems,
as well as on thermotropic liquid crystalline systems.
