This is a research project supported under the RUI program by the NSF's
Engineering Directorate. Under this project, a procedure employed new solid-
state hydrophones will be used in forced vibration tests of two dam sites for
measurements of water pressure data. These data will be used to study the
dynamic dam-water interactions, taking into consideration of the effects of
water compressibility and reservoir geometry. The research will help evaluate
the accuracy of present analytical procedure and contribute to the current
understanding of the dam-reservoir response problems under seismic conditions.
