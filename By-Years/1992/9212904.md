This equipment grant will be used to purchase a gas chromatograph for research
projects related to combustion and fuels. This system will be able to accept
either packed columns or capillary columns, have injectors for either gas or
liquid samples, and have the capability of accepting various detectors. The
associated data system will be able to automatically control the GC and acquire
data for long- duration experiments. Specific projects for which this instrument
will be used are: chlorine-catalyzed oxidation of chlorinated organic solvents,
combustion synthesis of fullerenes, development of diode lasers as hazardous
waste incinerator monitors, and oxidation of aromatic compounds by singlet
oxygen. The projects for which this instrument will be first used are all in the
area of chemical kinetics and will have immediate practical applications such as
in hazardous waste destruction or in synthesis of new materials.
