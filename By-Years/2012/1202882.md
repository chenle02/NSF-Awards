Quantifying microbial memory and its influence on ecosystem time lags using
Bayesian modeling

Ecosystems do not respond instantaneously to environmental change, but rather
possess a "memory" of past conditions. This memory alters the magnitude and
timescale of an ecosystem's response to climate stress. Therefore, a lack of
understanding of what controls ecosystem memory could contribute to inaccurate
predictions of climate patterns and biogeochemical dynamics. Microbial
communities control carbon and nitrogen (biogeochemical) cycling in the soil.
Contrary to previous assumptions, recent evidence shows that microbial
communities themselves possess a memory that could contribute to ecosystem
responses. However, microbial memory has not been explicitly quantified, or
assessed as a possible mechanism contributing to ecosystem memory. The aim of
this project is: to develop a model framework to examine the magnitude and
timescale of microbial memory; to determine the importance of this microbial
mechanism in predicting lags in soil gas flux; and to identify the microbial
traits (physiology or community composition) that are best linked to the larger
scale functions they mediate.

This research couples innovative statistical tools (hierarchical Bayesian
modeling) and new biological concepts (microbial memory), bridging conceptual
and collaborative gaps between ecology and mathematics. The project will improve
the postdoctoral fellow?s statistical skills, broaden the scope of future work,
and give the fellow novel tools to analyze large ecological datasets. Results
from this project will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications
and university-mediated public seminars, and contribute to ecological workshops
that introduce life scientists to Bayesian methods.
