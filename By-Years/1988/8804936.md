This research involves use of an automated devise for measuring optical
orientations of mineral grains within igneous rocks to address the origin of
preferred mineral fabrics. Rocks from several well-studied and well-expressed
igneous bodies from East Greenland will be studied with this method to
interrelate mineral fabric with macroscopic structures (layering, cross bedding,
etc). Orientations, sizes, and shapes of mineral grains will be recorded to
evaluate control of fabric by such processes as nucleation, crystal growth,
magma convection, compaction, pore liquid migration, and recrystallization.
