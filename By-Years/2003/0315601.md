The goal of this research is to understand the mechanical properties of
tubuliform silk and its evolutionary origin. Tubuliform silk, which is used to
form the egg case of orb-weaving spider, is unique in several important ways.
First, its sequence must be very different from the other orb-weaving spider
silks in that it contains a very different amino acid composition. Second, it is
produced only for a short period in the spider's life, just before the eggs are
laid. Finally, its mechanical properties show a high tensile strength but this
is combined with a low ability to withstand bending without fracture. The work
plan is: 1) Four species of spiders from a broad section of the orb-weaving,
derived orb-weaving and cob weaving spiders will be used. 2) The tubuliform silk
fibers will be collected for mechanical and biophysical testing. 3) Genomic DNA
libraries and cDNA libraries will be constructed, these libraries screened, and
positive clones sequenced. 4) Comparisons will be made between these silk
proteins and other silk proteins to help determine the role the protein sequence
plays in mechanical properties and the evolutionary path of this silk.

The broader impacts of this research involve both the general public and
students. Spider silks represent a unique answer to the production of
biomaterials for applications ranging from protective clothing to medical
products to composite materials. On average 3-4 undergraduates will work in the
laboratory every semester and 2-3 high school minority students every summer. At
least10 presentations are given each year on spiders and spider silk to
elementary and high school groups and service clubs in the state. Information,
pictures and video clips are provide each year for several publications and TV
and radio stations including PBS, National Geographic, CBS, NBC, etc as well as
a number from outside this country, BBC and CBC.
