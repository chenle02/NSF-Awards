9523440 Pershan This project is concerned with the development of techniques and
methods that will allow measurement of previously unobserved phenomena at the
surfaces of both bulk liquids and thin liquid films. Some of the phenomena to be
studied include: (i) The relation between microscopic structure and
thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional (2D) order of Langmuir monolayers
(LM). One particularly interesting such system will be LM of periodic
amphipillic polypeptides prepared by bacterial expression of artificial genes.
(ii) The 2D in plane order of Langmuir monolayers of fullerene chemical
derivatives on the surface of water. (iii) The effects of chemical variations on
the in-plane structure of self assembled Langmuir monolayers of thiols on the
surface of liquid mercury and possibly gallium. (iv) The compositional structure
along the surface normal of wetting layers of complex systems, such as binary
liquids and polymer brushes. These experiments can increase knowledge of the
properties of liquid surfaces dramatically, and have potential commercial
applications in the US and elsewhere. %%% The principal objective of this
research program is to explore the microscopic structure and associated
statistical properties of liquid surfaces. The project is concerned with the
development of techniques and methods that will allow measurement of previously
unobserved phenomena at the surfaces of both bulk liquids and thin liquid films.
In contrast with the relatively comprehensive understanding of the solid phases
of matter, including their surfaces, knowledge of the liquid phase is relatively
modest. One reason that this is true in spite of the vast literature on liquid
phases is that the lack of long-range order in bulk liquids obviates much of the
measurable phenomena that contributed to the current understanding of the
microscopic structure of solids. ***
