This research investigates the origins of knowledge and conceptual structure. An
interactionist perspective leads to a computational model in which the earliest
knowledge structures are influenced by both native structure in the agent and
its exposure to the world. `Physical schemas` are learned that form stable,
dynamical relationships between the agent and the world based on closed-loop
`physical primitives.` A preimaging technique is used to form context-dependent
categories spontaneously in order to improve the quality of sensory and motor
behavior. Declarative models are lifted from the sensorimotor substrate in the
form of `figurative schema.` This representation includes explicit predictive
models of sensation and affect, and thus captures some of the underlying
semantics of behavioral policies. An integrated robot system is used as the
experimental platform. The implications of this work extend to developmental
psychology, epistemology, and psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and
machine learning. Computational agents built on these principles refer
ultimately to the physical world for meaning --- the same physical world that
shapes human conceptual structure. We foresee interfaces to electronic agents
that appeal to semantics based in the physical world to understand the `meaning`
of a human request.
