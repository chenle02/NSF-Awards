This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years to connect a
small rural school district to the Internet. The wireless connection allows
substantially lower cost Internet access through a neighboring telephone company
than from the larger telephone company serving the district.
