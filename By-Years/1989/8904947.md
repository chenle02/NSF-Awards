The 1989 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in Elementary Particle Physics
will be held June 5-30, 1989 at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The
Institute, which will provide lectures to advanced graduate students from
throughout the nation, will emphasize computational aspects of elementary
particle theory. There will, in particular, be a focus on lattice gauge theory,
in which the continuum of space-time is approximated by a discrete lattice of
points, and on the use of the parton model; in which nucleons are pictured as
being composed of tiny constituent "partons," to predict event rates in various
physical processes. The Institute will make an important contribution to the
education of our promising young future physicists.
