9604982 Cobb This one-year planning project will focus on the teaching of
statistics at the middle-school level (grades seven and eight). The
investigators will develop and assess an instructional sequence that uses a
customized mini-tool programmed in Java. This sequence will emphasize students'
exploratory data analysis within the context of large-scale real world
applications in statistics. The tool and instructional sequence will be
designed, then field-tested via a twelve-week teaching experiment in a seventh
grade classroom.
