The PI proposes two main areas of research and study under the FAW award. The
first is the study of what drives plates in plate tectonics. Models of the
forces that drive plates can be tested against actual stress measurements and
provide the necessary discrimination for model verification. The second area of
study is the origin, nature and utility of hotspots and their relation to mantle
convection. The work will involve an integrated geophysical/geochemical
investigation of phase models and resultant conditions required by mantle
processes.
