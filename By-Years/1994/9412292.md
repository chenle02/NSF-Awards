9412292 Hanson Dendritic polymers (dendrimers) are a remarkable new class of
polymers with highly branched structure. This research deals with the synthesis
and characterization of dendrimers with spectroscopic probes covalently built in
to the structure. The spectroscopic studies will provide insight into the
polarity of the probe's microenvironment at strategic locations within the
dendramers, the motion of the polymers in solution, the mobility of branches at
various distances from the molecular core, the acces of small molecules to the
dendrimers' interior, and the effective radius of the dendritic molecules. The
experiments will test the existing theories of dendrimer structure and will
allow formulation of more accurate models for predicting both structure and
dynamics. Such an understanding should enhance the prospects for pratical
applications of dendritic polymers.
