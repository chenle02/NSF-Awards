A common theme to the areas of research described in this proposal is the
presence of nuisance parameters and the necessity of removing an estimation bias
in the parameter of interest, induced by the estimation of the nuisance
parameters. The reason why the bias must be removed is that it may lead to
inconsistency in the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter of interest.
The projects all use a projective approach to modify the score function for the
parameter of interest, so that the bias attributable to the estimation of the
nuisance parameter is reduced. The benefits of reducing bias will transfer to
more accurate parameter estimates, confidence intervals with better coverage
rates and test statistics that for small sample sizes have distributions
"closer" to their asymptotic limiting distributions. We live in an age where
information, that is data, is abundant. Our statistical understanding of this
data arises from making accurate models. The large data sets that we have at
hand show that simple models rarely fit the data well, and so we are led to
consider more complex models with many unknowns. The proposed research will
address the practical implementation and interpretative issues involved with
these rich statistical models involving many variables.
