With partial support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Roger Koenker will
establish an econometrics laboratory at the University of Illinois. Equipment to
be purchased includes 1 Sparc 20-612 Unix Workstation, 6 Sun xterminals, 2
Pentium 102, 1 HP printer and related software. The proposed laboratory would
significantly expand the existing computing resources available to both faculty
and students in econometrics. This is particularly true for graduate students,
many of whom are currently severely constrained. Faculty would also benefit from
this increased computing power which would facilitate research on questions such
as semiparametric econometric models, problems of robustness in estimation and
inference, and nonlinear time series analysis. Econometrics is a computer
intensive science and provision of this equipment will significantly strengthen
a first rate research and teaching group.
