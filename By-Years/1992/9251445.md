The development of a computer-based statistics laboratory to support an
instructional program will allow students to actively learn statistical
reasoning skills. The objective is to improve the education of students in three
areas crucial for statistical reasoning: (1) the conceptual basis for
statistical reasoning and analysis; (2) why statistics are a necessary part of
the research process; and (3) the impact of practical decisions on statistical
outcomes. The laboratory will serve ten psychology courses, including Research
Methods, Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, and eight upper-level Topical
Research courses. The learning activities supported by the laboratory are based
upon Maple, a computer algebra system, and SPSSx, a computer statistics package.
Maple will help address the first two objectives by creating a dynamic learning
environment in which abstract statistical concepts are represented visually.
SPSSx will help address the third objective by providing regular occasions for
instructors to help students understand how the characteristics of psychological
research affect the results of statistical analyses.
