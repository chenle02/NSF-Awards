0243425 Helmuth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Western Transportation Institute
at Montana State University for research opportunities for undergraduate
students in rural transportation research. Eight undergraduate students will be
selected each summer to participate in a ten-week residential program. Students
will present their research results at the end of the program at an in-house
symposium and will produce a written report on their results. This summer REU
program will provide students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to engage
in current research topics relevant to improving rural transportation. The
program aims to increase students' awareness of the breadth of rural
transportation issues and promote fundamental scientific understanding of the
importance of innovative transportation research. The program is designed to
improve students' research, collaborative, and professional skills in order to
address the nation's need for innovative researchers and professionals capable
of developing creative long-term solutions to complex rural transportation
issues. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership
with the NSF REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
