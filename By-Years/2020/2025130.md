People who are paralyzed from the shoulders down rely on 24-hour care to
complete basic daily activities. Restoring arm and hand function would greatly
increase their independence. Assistive robotics and functional electrical
stimulation can potentially restore arm and hand function, but each has
significant drawbacks. The objective of this project is to develop a cooperative
control strategy for functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high
cervical spinal cord injuries using functional electrical stimulation and a
robotic exoskeleton. The results of the project will help move functional
electrical stimulation and upper limb robotics from laboratory assistive
technologies to wearable devices used for everyday tasks by people with full-arm
paralysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complementary strengths of functional
electrical stimulation (FES) and assistive robotics can potentially enable
people with high tetraplegia to independently feed and groom themselves. FES
provides free power using a personâ€™s own muscles but cannot sufficiently control
all joints simultaneously due to permanent denervation of some muscles.
Assistive robots can provide additional power and control, but can be rigid,
bulky, and heavy. This project's objective is to develop a cooperative control
strategy that demonstrates functional elbow and wrist movements in people with
high tetraplegia using a hybrid FES+rigid support robot. By maximizing the
utility of muscles activated by FES, the proposed hybrid strategy will reduce
the need for robot power and size, paving the way for using FES with soft
wearable robotics. This project will use a rigid robot as the testbed for
developing cooperative control strategies, allowing for exploration of the
entire design space for future development of soft wearable exosuits coupled
with FES. FES+robot assisted muscle-induced torques will be measured in real
time during elbow and wrist movements. This information will feed into a
coordinated FES+robot control scheme that aims to decrease robot work while
maintaining tracking accuracy. Performance and robustness of the control scheme
will be benchmarked for varying robot capabilities during a self-feeding task.
The outcome will be a model, mapping robot capabilities to task completion
success, to be used to design future wearable hybrid FES-robotic systems for
upper limb movement restoration. These advances will open up new research
horizons in commanding and controlling hybrid neuroprostheses that could not
otherwise be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
