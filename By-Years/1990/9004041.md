Early neurogenesis in Drosophila establishes neural and epidermal cell lineages
from an apparently homogeneous ectodermal population. Recent molecular and
genetic evidence has demonstrated that this process is regulated by a small
number of zygotic genes, termed the neurogenic loci. One of these genes,
"mastermind (mam)," has not been well characterized in terms of how it functions
and interacts with the other neurogenic loci. The specific aims of this research
will be to 1) localize mam mRNA and protein on the cellular and subcellular
levels throughout development, as an aid to understanding function; 2) examine
the genetic interactions between mam and other loci, determining the sequences
of interesting mam mutations that affect the other loci; and 3) sequence
alternative transcription products of mam to determine whether the gene codes
for more than one protein, and to detect possible homologies to previously
characterized molecules in invertebrates and vertebrates.
