9353683 BELL This conference will bring in at least 80 (K-12) science teachers
who will focus on methods for teaching science at the elementary, middle, and
high school levels. They will also participate in critical discussions about the
methods. Topics to be included are: hands-on discovery-based learning;
reflective teaching and action research; cognitively-guided instruction;
technology-based science teaching; the relationship between laboratory and
classroom work in middle and high school; the role of textbooks in teaching
science; and the effect of school-based management on teaching practice. There
will be a distribution of the conference proceedings which will cover plenary
papers, summaries of the interactive sessions, models of good practice presented
by teachers, and an assessment of what makes good practice and how to reinforce
it. The conference is expected to have a total attendance of about 400 with a
composition of science educators, scientists, business people, state and federal
government policymakers, congressional staff, and others for invited
presentations and joint discussions. ***
