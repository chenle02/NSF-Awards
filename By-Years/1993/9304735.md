9304735 Gwanmesia This award provides partial funding for equipment that will be
assembled and operated in the Department of Physics nd Astronomy at Delaware
State college. The equipment will enable the Principal Investigator and his
students to establish an ultrasonic interferometry system for the measurement of
sound velocities through mineral and rock samples. Such measurements are
important constraints on seismological models of the Earth's internal structure.
