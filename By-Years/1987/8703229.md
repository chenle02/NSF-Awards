Thomas intends to use the methods of the theory of permutation groups to study
omega-categorical expansions of infinite dimensional projective spaces over
finite fields. In particular, he hopes to solve a special case of Lachlan's
conjecture on stable omega-categorical structures. He also intends to use set
theoretic techniques to solve problems about permutation groups and automorphism
towers. Some of his methods have already led to a long-sought combinatorial
design, which could be useful in the design of experiments.
