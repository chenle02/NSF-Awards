This grant involves the development and application of new hybrid electro-optic
techniques for pattern recognition. A general hybrid optical/digital front-end
processor is being designed and simulated with the application of pattern
recognition and information processing. Overall control is furnished by a rule-
based symbolic processor. Adaptation and learning capabilities will be an
emphasized feature of the overall processor.
