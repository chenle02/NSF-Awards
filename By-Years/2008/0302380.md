This grant provides support for the FutureTruck Challenge. This competition is
jointly sponsored by the NSF, the Department of Energy, Natural Resources
Canada, the automotive industry including Ford and General Motors and suppliers
such as Cisco Systems, ArvinMeritor, Delphi, and National Instruments. This is a
continuation of a highly successful educational experience for undergraduate
students at US and Canadian universities. The broader impacts are significant
with teams competing in the application of environmentally benign design and
manufacturing principles to reduce the energy and environmental impacts in the
product life cycle of trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). It has the goal
of designing and competing commercially producible vehicles that are
simultaneously comfortable, safe, road-reliable, commercially viable, and highly
fuel efficient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this competition, a number of
universities compete annually in this event. The award provides funding to
support the competition and to offset costs for expenses such as team prizes,
communication and safety equipment rentals and other competition expenses.
