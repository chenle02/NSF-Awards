9417560 Covington This U.S.-Mexico Program award funds dissertation enhancement
research by Mr. Peter Z. Fule, under the supervision of Dr. W. Covington of
Northern Arizona University. Their project is designed to determine the effects
of regimes of disturbance by frequent, low-intensity fires on the structure of
pine and pine-oak forests at a site subject to recurring fires, representative
of extensive areas of forest land in the Sierra Madre Occidental Range of
northern Mexico. Work on this project will be carried out at the La Michilia
Biosphere Reserve in Durango, Mexico, with the cooperation of Dr. Jorge Nocedal,
Director of the Reserve. This project is important to both the U.S. and Mexico
because it will support the inclusion of disturbance as a key ecological
consideration in the management and conservation plans for the forests of
northern Mexico, and it will provide a source of experimental data from an
actual "natural lab," useful in research, planning, and restoration efforts for
the fire-dependent forests of our west coast. ***
