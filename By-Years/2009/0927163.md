The objectives of this research award are to synthesize tiny, slender pieces of
boron-based materials (nanofilaments) and to measure their electrical, optical,
and mechanical properties. The nanofilaments will be created under controlled
conditions by depositing materials in special atmospheres using energy provided
by a laser. Subsequent experiments conducted on the nanofilaments will determine
a variety of properties including their size, shape, electrical resistance, and
mechanical strength. A unique feature of this program is that the changes in the
properties of the nanofilaments when they are deformed will be determined. The
deliverables for this program include the identification of the processing
conditions that create particular kinds of nanofilaments, and their mechanical,
electrical, and optical properties. Additionally, the researchers will document
their results, educate engineering students, and introduce high school students
to nanoscience through a summer camp.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this award will
provide the basis for a new generation of nanoenabled devices and composites.
The resulting materials could have physical properties superior to traditional
boron filaments and will be easier to use in composites. Potential applications
include ultralight and conductive composites for cell phone housings,
electromagnetic shielding, and aerospace structures. The results of the research
will be disseminated to facilitate the introduction of these materials into both
existing and new commercial products. Undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral
students involved with the program will benefit from classroom instruction and
the research process. Additionally, high school students will participate in a
summer program that will give them a hands-on experience that will heighten
their interest in the sciences and technical careers.&lt;br/&gt;
