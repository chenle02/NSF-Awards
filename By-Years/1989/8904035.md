The Institute for Theoretical Physics will continue its very broad and unique
effort. The Institute promotes researchintheoretical physics with a particular
emphasis, when appro- priate, on problems that cut across the traditional
subfields ofphysics. Its main activities are long term research programswhich
typically run five to six months. Two programs operate inparallel at any one
time, each with twelve to sixteen physicistsin residence. The topics of the
programs, which have spannedthe entire gamut of theoretical physics, are usually
anoutgrowth of suggestions from the national and internationaltheoretical
physics community. Most program coordinators arefrom outside the Institute,
although the permanent members oftenplay a major role in these activities. In
addition, theInstitute conducts an average of six conferences or workshopsper
year, most of which are associated with the long termprograms. The Institute's
effort will foster the health of theoret- ical physics generally, and permit
particulary effective researchon cross-subfield problems.
