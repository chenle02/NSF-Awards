This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is directed
towards the development of new synthetic organic methods, which will permit the
preparation of new materials of theoretical interest. The properties of these
materials will have practical application. This project is concerned with a
study of the synthesis and properties of novel organometallic systems. Of
particular interest are the diruthenium complexes of polycyclic aromatic
compounds. These complexes have the potential for behaving as completely-
delocalized, Class III mixed-valence ions. Such ions can be expected to show
unusual electrical and/or magnetic properties. Electrochemical studies of iron
complexes of ?2.2!indenophanes will be made to try to ascertain the extent of
electron delocalization in these complexes.
