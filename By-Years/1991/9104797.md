The overall objective of the proposed multidisciplinary research is to
determine the basic physiologic signaling processes mediating brainstem
mechanisms involved in coordinating neural, endocrine and behavioral
determinants of nutrient homeostasis and ingestive behavior. Specifically, the
proposed research will focus on brainstem mechanisms mediated by the nucleus of
the solitary tract (NTS) - its central role as an integrating site in the
brainstem for coordinating neural and humoral nutrient-related signals with the
consequent production of appropriate viscerobehavioral response patterns. Our
general hypothesis is that the integration of nutrient-related information and
the coordination of appropriate homeostatic response patterns by the NTS occurs
at both the afferent limb and the efferent limb of the neural organizational
network mediating feeding behavior, nutrient homeostasis and metabolic
regulation. The general hypothesis exploits the observation that the NTS is not
only the principal recipient site in the CNS of first- order afferent input from
the vast array of visceral sensory receptors involved in nutrient homeostasis,
but the NTS also has extensive direct reciprocal connections with virtually all
structures at every level of the neural axis involved in nutrient homeostasis,
metabolic regulation and feeding behavior. Thus, our specific hypotheses are
that the NTS subserves the following multiple roles in nutrient homeostasis: (1)
a chemosensory role for nutrient-related signals in the blood or CSF, likely
mediated via its association with the area postrema (AP); (2) an integrative
role for coordinating visceral sensations mediated by both neural and humoral
signals transmitted to the NTS mainly via the vagus nerve; (3) a major role as
an autonomic control center in the brainstem for the production of "short-loop"
homeostatic response patterns; and (4) an effector role for some components of
feeding behavior. The two Black American and three White American scientists who
work on this project, will employ a multidisciplinary and collaborative research
strategy with investigators working cooperatively so that NTS-mediated
mechanisms of nutrient homeostasis can be simultaneously examined at multiple
levels of analysis - from events occurring at the cellular and tissue level to
relatively complex appetitive responses at the behavioral level.
