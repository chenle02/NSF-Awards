Laboratory exercises employing computer-interfaced scientific instrumentation
are being developed for nine courses in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry,
Physics and Earth Sciences, and Psychology at Moravian College. Enhancement of
laboratory experience is the objective of the effort. The anticipated outcome is
the education of students who, when confronted with an experiment potentially
involving computer assistance, are capable of designing and implementing the
experiment in a reasonable and effective manner. This project is directed
primarily at students majoring in these scientific disciplines, although non-
majors and science education majors will also be affected.
