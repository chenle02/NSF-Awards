9400191 Alladi This award funds the research of Professor Krishnaswami Alladi in
partition theory. Prof. Alladi will try to apply a new technique that he
developed in joint work with Prof. Basil Gordon to five problems. He will study
a partition theorem mf Gollnitz, a recent result of Capparelli, the q-Gauss
identities, and the quintuple product identity. This work is in the general
field of analytic number theory and in particular partition theory. At its most
basic level partition theory studies the question, how many different ways can
one number be written as the sum of smaller numbers? This question becomes a
part of analytic number theory when answers to this question are encoded into
mathematical functions. This allows mathematicians to apply the analysis
techniques of calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate
discrete objects is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic
number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth and led to a deeper
understanding of partitions of the whole numbers.
