A classical problem in multi input multi output system design is to classify
plants or families of plants that admit a robust, switching or nonswitching,
dynamic output feedback compensator and satisfy a specific set of design
constraints viz. sensitivity minimization, stabilization, pole assignment,
disturbance decoupling, tracking, etc. Not all plants and compensators satisfy a
specific set of design constraints and it is therefore of interest to
parameterize those plants and compensators that do. Furthermore, in order to
pose and analyze identification and adaptive control problems as a recursive
algorithm on the parameterized space of plant-compensator pair, it is of
interest to understand the geometric properties of such a parameterization. This
research programme is divided in three parts. First the parameterization problem
will be studied with a view towards parameter- identification and adaptive
control. Subsequently the parameter- identification problem will be studied as a
recursive algorithm on the parameter space and the analysis of both local and
global convergence will be carried out. Finally the adaptive control problem
wherein the parameters of the plant and the compensator vary in real time will
be studied. The aim of the research is to parameterize certain classes of
systems which admit robust output feedback compensation and satisfy certain
design constraints. It is expected that such parameterizations will allow the
development of new classes of stabilization, identification and adaptive control
algorithms for the classes of systems being considered.
