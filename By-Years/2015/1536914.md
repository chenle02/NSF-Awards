The availability of light, strong and tough materials is essential for advances
in modern engineering and to the technological future of society. Nanocomposite
materials consisting of a polymer matrix with distributed nanoparticles are of
current interest. These materials can provide significant property improvments
relative to the pure polymer. Yet, current continuum mechanics based theories
are unable to explain these findings. This award is concerned with fundamental
research on the mechanisms that lead to the desireable properties of polymer
matrix nanocomposites. The anticipated outcomes of this award will thus allow
materials engineers for further advances the science and engineering of
nanocomposites and contribute to the general goals of the Materials Genome
Initiative. The award also supports associated educational and outreach
activities.

This award supports research with the goal to uncover how plastic deformation
originates, or terminates, near a nanoparticle surface and leads to the
formation of shear bands. For amorphous solids it has recently been demonstrated
that regions prone to irreversible deformation can be detected from the
examination of their internal low frequency vibrational modes. The modes that
comprise the so-called boson peak excite the soft regions in the material, or
the regions that are most likely to fail under applied load. The present work
will begin by characterizing the distribution of these modes around a
nanoparticle placed in a model polymer matrix as a function of the particle size
and interaction energy with the matrix. Then, a recent computational polymer
model exhibiting a ductile-to-brittle transition, the study will investigate how
the nanoparticles lead to failure in a pillar geometry. Finally, the goal is to
computationally engineer various surface chemistries to enable an ultimately
tougher polymer nanocomposite material.
