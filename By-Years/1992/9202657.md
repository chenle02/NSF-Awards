In Dabob Bay (Washington), a temperate fjord, the annual cycles of
phytoplankton standing stock and production rate exhibit spectacular increases
(phytoplankton blooms) in spring and autumn, indicating lack of control by
grazer populations. Yet virtually all organic matter produced by the
phytoplankton during blooms is ultimately consumed by grazers. Moreover, a major
fraction of the grazing (about 67% on an annual basis) appears to be due to
macrozooplankton suspension-feeders, with microzooplankton being secondary
grazers. A conceptual model of grazing in Dabob Bay was developed, hypothesizing
the identities of the macro- and microzooplankton grazers and postulating
mechanisms for the approximate annual balance between phytoplankton growth and
grazing. A field test of the conceptual model was developed and carried out on
three extended research cruises to Dabob Bay in 1990-91. This project will
complete the analysis of samples and data, and produce a synthesis. By direct
measuerements this study will provide quanitative assessment of mechanisms and
rates of processes governing the dynamics of phytoplankton production and its
fate in a highly productive coastal pelagic ecosystem.
