H202 is believed to be an important oxidant of SO2 in cloud droplets. There is
evidence to suggest that it may be entrained into clouds that form at the top of
well mixed boundary layers. In these situations SO2 oxidation to sulfate depends
not only on the SO2/H202 ratio but also upon the entrainment of above cloud air
into the cloud. Airborne experiments will be conducted near Elk Mountain,
Wyoming in concert with experimental studies planned for the Elk Mountain
Observatory (EMO) to allow the PIs to investigate the entrainment process by (1)
comparing airborne H2O2 measurements with surface H2O2 measurements at EMO, (2)
using airborne releases of a tracer, SF6, both in the boundary layer air and in
the above cloud air, while monitoring the tracer at EMO, (3) comparing vertical
profiles of potential temperature for evidence of entrainment across the cloud-
capping inversion, and (4) comparing liquid water concentration and droplet
spectra, measured at EMO and from aircraft, with an adiabatic model of the
condensation process.
