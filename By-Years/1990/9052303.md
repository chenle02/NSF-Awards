Laser disks are being used as a basis for computerized interactive multimedia
exercises that will supplement traditional lecture and laboratory experiences,
and will encourage students to develop creative and critical thinking skills and
to become actively involved in scientific reasoning. A statistical program is
also being purchased in order for the students to analyze quantitative data.
This allows an extension of their scientific reasoning skills. The university
will contribute an amount equal to the award.
