The investigator plans several projects designed to illuminate the dynamic
features of computations and the connections between notions of computability in
varying environments. He envisions separate studies on the global theory of
various degree structures; the extension of embeddings problem for the
recursively enumerable degrees; the relativized formulation of Lerman's theorem
on finite ideals in the Turing degrees; Kechris' notion of universal Borel
equivalence relations; and abstract complexity theory. Prominent among the
questions to be addressed by this project are a number that bear on theoretical
computability. They lie in what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a
model of computability knowing no bounds on time or space. Although answers to
such questions have the ability to illuminate practical questions, they are
really practical only when their answers are negative, for it is a very strong
statement indeed to say that something cannot be computed even when one puts no
limits on resources available for the purpose. The finer structure of
computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual computations, and
various aspects of that will also be considered.
