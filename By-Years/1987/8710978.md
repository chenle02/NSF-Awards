The research involves a study of gallium arsenide lattice by methods of
positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The study deals with the point
defects in gallium arsenide. After the identification of these defects has been
made, the presence of these defects can be followed as a function of thermal
treatment as well as manufacturing techniques. Data of this type can help
determine the method by which each defect is formed. This project is one
supported under the Creativity Awards for Engineering Students.
