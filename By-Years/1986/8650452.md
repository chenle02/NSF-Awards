The objective of this project is to acquaint undergraduate chemistry students
with the operation and application of lasers in physical and analytical
chemistry. Because of their unique properties, lasers have taken a major role in
the instrumentation used for chemical research. Therefore, it is important that
potential chemists become familiar with this component so that they will be
better prepared to begin their professional careers. An easy-to-use, cost-
effective tunable dye laser system with a signal measurement system will be used
in an advanced laboratory course and in student research as the basis of a
number of experiments designed to highlight the versatility of this light
source. The availability of the laser will expand the usefulness of several
other instruments already in the department. The experiments done with the laser
system will be published in the appropriate areas in order to encourage more
extensive use of this instrument at undergraduate institutions, and to help meet
a national need for published experiments with lasers. The final result will be
better education in the field of chemical instrumentation.
