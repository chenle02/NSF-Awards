The purpose of this research is to determine whether a contractual approach to
the labor market can help explain the movements of wages and hours worked over
the business cycle. Important, preliminary findings using the contract approach
have already shown great promise for analyzing these movements. The project will
involve extending this preliminary work in several directions in order to
further assess the empirical relevance of contracts in explaining labor market
outcomes. Firstly, the type of contract model which is most consistent with
individual level wage data will be developed and tested. Secondly, research will
focus on how to estimate the intertemporal substitutability of leisure when
employment relations are governed by long term contracts. Thirdly, individual
level data from several different counties will be used to investigate how labor
market flexibility can be compared when employment relations are governed by
contracts. Finally, a market clearing contract model will be analyzed to
determine whether such a model can explain the aggregate behavior of employment
levels over the business cycle. This project is important because it will
provide useful insights into the nature of the movement of wages subject to
contractual relations over the business cycle.
