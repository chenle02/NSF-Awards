The objective of this proposal is to thoroughly investigate the deployment of
non-isotropic sensors for smart building applications. Various sensing and
control applications in smart building require accurate and efficient
localization and tracking of human and activities. To achieve this goal, the
non-isotropic networked sensor deployment is essential.

This proposal addresses a new set of problems arising from the deployment of
four types of sensors: cameras, tripwire, motion sensors and microphones. The
set of deployment problems would strive for full sensor coverage and wireless
connectivity with a complex floor plan, and involve one or more of the following
constraints: (i)Non-isotropic model using visibility (cameras and tripwires),
(ii) Non-overlapping sensing range, (iii) Robust 2-coverage for accurate
localization. The sensor deployment problem will heavily involve the geometric
properties of the environment (building layout), as well as the geometric
properties of the sensors (non-isotropic sensing ranges). Ideas from
computational geometry will be applied to tackle these problems and
approximation algorithms with worst-case guarantee for theoretical rigor as well
as practical algorithms suitable for implementations will be developed.

A clear understanding on how to deploy sensors for smart building systems will
allows for efficient planning and effective practice of networked sensor
deployment to achieve the high quality sensing desired by various indoor
applications. For developers, this work will significantly reduce the design and
development costs for designing and building smart building systems. For end
users, the resultant testbed will lead to exciting applications that will
significantly improve the quality of life. It also enriches engineering
curriculum to integrate the theory of computational geometry with the system
building practice. The PIs are committed in improving female presence in
computer science and exposure of research for high school students.
