This award provides three years of funding to support the team of experimental
particle physicists engaged in the high energy physics program at Cornell
University. The intellectual merit is focused primarily upon the LHC and CMS in
particular, but also includes the completion of physics programs at existing
facilities (CLEO and CDF) and a technology development project for future ILC-
type detectors. This mix of projects exploits the varied expertise of group
members while balancing their responsibilities to bring existing efforts to a
natural close, to provide thesis opportunities to graduate students and career
development for postdocs and young faculty, to have a major impact upon LHC
physics output, and to pave the way for the future. The broader impacts will
include bringing the challenge and excitement of LHC physics into their
extensive program of outreach: to local K-12 schools, including both in-school
programs and out- of-school workshops for teachers, educators, and high school
students; to the general public; and to undergraduates.
