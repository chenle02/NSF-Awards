9402655 Jean This proposal provides funds to purchase a positron source and
pursue exploratory studies of a class of organic superconductor. The materials
are bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene complexes, as well as the new
fullerene C-60 materials. The project involves both experiment methods to
determine the angular distribution of positron annihilation in that materials,
and quantum chemical calculations to provide an interpretation of these data in
terms of the Fermi surface in these materials. The results are of fundamental
interest but may also be of technical importance as they provide information
about the superconducting state in these materials. ***
