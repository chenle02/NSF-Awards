9452229 Hainline This project involves a novel approach to teaching statistics
and survey research methods in psychology and sociology. Undergraduates,
particularly majors, utilize a computer-equipped classroom/laboratory. A more
intuitive method is used and interactive graphics better illustrate statistical
concepts. This approach helps lessen students' statistics and computer anxiety.
The heavily graphical introduction to undergraduate statistics also integrates
the use of computer technology and course materials to introduce statistical
concepts and a feeling for exploratory data analysis. Existing undergraduate
statistics courses are being modified and specific materials and methods are
adapted for use in both fields.
