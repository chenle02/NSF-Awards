Advances in imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and super resolution microscopy have transformed the
practice of clinical medicine and basic biomedical research. Although the
development of such technologies is well known to depend upon progress in
physics and engineering, it is less well known that applied and computational
mathematics has also played an essential role. This research project studies
mathematical questions that arise in new medical biomedical imaging modalities
in which new novel measurements play a key role. The research will study novel
mathematical algorithms that will lead to improvements in optical imaging both
with respect to resolution (visualizing structures at smaller scales) and
computational speed. In particular, the project aims to devise robust and
accurate image reconstruction algorithms that may lead to the detection and
characterization of disease at much earlier stages than is currently possible.
The principal investigator has research interests in applied mathematics and
theoretical physics. He is also a physician. Graduate students will be trained
to function in this interdisciplinary environment.

The objective of this project is to investigate inverse problems with internal
data that arise in biomedical optical imaging. Two classes of problems will be
considered. (i) Teh PI will develop mathematically-justified methods for imaging
below the diffraction limit of resolution, also known as superresolution
imaging. The proposed work includes both analysis of the inverse scattering
problem with internal sources and the development of reconstruction algorithms.
The algorithms will be tested and characterized using data from physically
realistic numerical simulations. (ii) The PI will study inverse problems that
arise in acousto-optic imaging. The research will focus on the regime of
coherent multiple scattering which leads to considerable mathematical
simplifications compared to incoherent imaging. In particular, the PI will
develop reconstruction methods for recovering the absorption and scattering
coefficients of the radiative transport equation from coherent acousto-optic
measurements. Finally, the role of improvements in modeling of the acousto-optic
effect on image reconstruction will be investigated.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
