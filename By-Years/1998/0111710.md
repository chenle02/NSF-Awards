Protein mutation occurs as part of the evolutionary process, through mutagenesis
and through post-translational modification. As yet no resource has been
developed that permits the systematic study of the effect of all these mutations
on protein structure, and hence function, even though the literature is full of
individual instances. The new resource will contain all relevant PDB structures
as its starting point and will be updated along with PDB. A prototype has been
established at http://pmr.sdsc.edu. The production resource will bring together
sequence, structure, and literature information using novel information
acquisition tools and provide query and visualization tools for global analysis
of the effects of mutation. Research in protein structure and engineering will
be enhanced through using the resource for prediction and for confirmation of
methods. The resource will be accessible through the web and other users may
write software for doing direct querying of the resource.
