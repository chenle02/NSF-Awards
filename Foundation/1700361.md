Computability theory is an area within mathematical logic that studies the
complexity of countable mathematical objects. Some mathematical objects,
constructions, and proofs are more complicated than others. Logicians have
developed various ways of measuring this complexity. When one is in interested
in countable objects -- with which a large portion of mathematics is concerned
-- the tools to measure these complexities come from computability theory. The
objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and
structural issues to improve understanding of what shapes and forms complexity
can take.

This project is part of an ongoing study of the structure that emerges when
considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties
that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. In
particular, the project will explore the connections between Vaught's conjecture
and computability theory, and the generalizations of the uniform Martin's
conjecture. A few years ago, connections between computable structure theory and
Vaught's conjecture emerged unexpectedly. While it may take many years to see
Vaught's conjecture settled, this project pursues a particular aspect: its
connections to computability theory.
