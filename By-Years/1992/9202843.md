Clark College is a two-year community college which has established a
connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet
mid-level network. The connection enables the school's faculty and students to
communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and educational
community, and to access network resources. Areas of science and education
addressed over the Internet by Clark include forensic anthropology, atmospheric
physics, education for the disabled, biology, mathematics, chemistry and
computer science. The library also benefits from access to other libraries and
data bases. This award funds part of the costs for two years.***
