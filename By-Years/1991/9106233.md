In January 1988 a seismic tomography experiment was carried out on the East
Pacific Rise at 9 degrees 30'N to image in three dimensions the seismic velocity
structure of the rise axis. This experiment yielded a seismic data set
consisting of more that 8000 records from approximately 500 shots and 15 ocean
bottom seismometers. Initial result from the tomographic inversion of P wave
delay times indicate substantial heterogeneity in structure both across and
along the rise axis; for instance, the axial low velocity anomaly at 2 km depth
is 1.5km/s slower than off axis; the along-axis variations in this velocity
anomaly exceed 20% This renewal will continue the investigation of seismic
velocity models using improved inversion techniques, will explore methods of
utilizing wave form amplitude information to constrain further the 3-D seismic
structure, and will analyze and interpret the gravity, magnetic, and
microearthquake data obtained during thecourse of the tomograph experiment.
