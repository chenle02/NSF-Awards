The western margin of the Indian lithospheric plate represents a
transpressional foreland belt in an active tectonic setting. The plate boundary,
marked by the left-lateral Chaman transform zone gives away eastward to a broad
zone of foreland folding and thrusting in the Sulaiman region of Pakistan. This
project will take advantage of surface and subsurface well data accumulated by
the Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) to interpret the
overall structure, mechanics, and tectonic evolution of the Sulaiman fold belt.
Results will complement tectonic studies to the northeast in Pakistan in
understanding Indian plate interactions with Asia.
