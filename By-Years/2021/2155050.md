Fundamental models for a number of physical systems can be described in
mathematical terms as "nonlinear dispersive equations". This is, for instance,
the case for the equations of General Relativity, Plasma Physics, Atmosphere and
Ocean Science, Nonlinear optics. While these systems are very different in many
respects, the common mathematical features are responsible for similar
behaviors. The phenomena that the project will investigate are, on the one hand,
solitary waves, and on the other hand, wave turbulence. In the case of waves on
a surface of water, think of tsunami for the former (a rigid behavior), and
disordered ripples for the latter (a chaotic behavior). The aim of this project
is to investigate these phenomena, which have many applications to basic science
and technology. The project will also provide research training opportunities
for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will reach a deeper
understanding of two basic features of nonlinear dispersive equations: solitary
waves and wave turbulence. For the former, the distorted Fourier transform will
be used to analyze the stability of solitary waves, in particular their
nonlinear resonances (in the sense of dynamical systems), leading to possibly
optimal stability results. For the latter, the progress will be twofold: on the
derivation of the kinetic description of wave turbulence, and on the analysis of
the kinetic equation describing wave turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
