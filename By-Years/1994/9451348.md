9451348 Thorbjarnarson This project is providing undergraduate majors in
hydrogeology with hands-on, practical field and laboratory experience that is
vital to their future employment or graduate research. The equipment is being
utilized in a new undergraduate course: Field and Laboratory Techniques in
Hydrogeology. In addition, the new equipment is being used in other classes and
is increasing undergraduate research opportunities. This field and laboratory
course is being taught for the first time in the Spring of 1994 and the field
component is being conducted at the new San Diego State University (SDSU) well
field site. The new equipment is being included in several of the field
exercises of this new course. Several peristaltic pumps, a bladder pump, and a
set of packers are being used in the following exercises: Water Sampling, Well
Purging, Tracer Testing. A pump, water level probes, pressure transducers and a
data logger are being used for the Water Level Measurement and Well Pump Test
exercises. Permeameters are being used in the laboratory estimation of core
sample permeability, while specific ion electrodes, meters and a fluorometer are
being used in the Tracer Test exercises.
