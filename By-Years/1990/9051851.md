The Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory: This laboratory is used as an
engineering core laboratory to mechanical and civil engineering students to
provide a basic understanding of material properties. Additional laboratories in
these departments provide added study in the strength and properties of
materials. Through a sequence of laboratory exercises students are introduced to
material property determination and stress analysis using both experimental and
theoretical models. However, there is a need to improve the laboratory
facilities which experimentally reinforce the principles learned in the lectures
courses. The objective of this project is the acquisition of undergraduate
laboratory equipment in the materials and properties analyses area to develop a
more complete undergraduate introduction to material properties and stress
analysis. The improved laboratory facilities will enable students to become more
knowledgeable in the various methods of materials and structural analysis.
