This project is to support a meeting entitled, "Fe-S proteins: Biogenesis and
function" to be held at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, in May 2005.
Recent work has revealed unique and diverse biological functions of this class
of proteins and the existence of highly conserved complex machinery for their
biogenesis. This meeting is to highlight recent advances in this area that
impinge on biological systems from bacteria to humans. The meeting is intended
to serve as a forum for interaction among scientists investigating different
aspects of Fe-S proteins. A goal of the meeting is to foster communication
amongst participants of diverse backgrounds on the belief that such interactions
are key to facilitating integrated approaches to the study of the biogenesis and
diverse functions of Fe-S proteins. The organization of the meeting is such that
participation of scientists in the early stages of their careers will be
encouraged and will facilitate their ability to contribute to this area.
