This grant supports a graduate student who will pursue a Ph.D through this
research, the goal of which is to understand the total variability of the East
Asian monsoon as a component of the earth's climate system. The PIs plan to
carry out a study of the East Asian monsoon rainfall and its relationship with
global scale variability using advanced time series analyses. The objectives of
the research are to: - identify conclusively the principal spatial and temporal
modes of rainfall variability in East Asian monsoon rainfall - investigate
relationship between EAM rainfall and large scale environmental parameters such
as SST, radiation, circulation in various time domains. - use results of
analyses to test and validate theories of monsoon dynamics This research will
make use of both observational data and GCM output. Observational data include:
185 stations of 30 years daily rainfall data over East Asia, weekly to monthly
SST from CAC, surface wind, SST and cloudiness from COADS, analyzed wind from
NMC and ECMWF, and OLR from NOAA/NESDIS. Also used are outputs from long-term
integration of the GLA and COLA GCM. This research is important because it seeks
to understand the processes that control the East Asian monsoon, a major feature
of the climate system.
