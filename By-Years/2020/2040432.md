This award supports the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). WCRP is taking
the lead in ensuring that the global, regional, and national climate research
communities create the enduring, rigorous and scientific foundation required to
meet the urgent demand for robust and useful regional climate information. WCRP
is pursuing – through international coordination – frontier scientific questions
related to the coupled climate system that are too large and too complex to be
tackled by a single nation, agency, institution, or scientific discipline. In
doing so, WCRP brings together scientists from the US and around the world, at
all stages of their careers, to advance the understanding of the multi-scale
dynamic interactions between components of the climate system and external
forcing factors, as well as addressing and studying the role of humans on
climate and society. WCRP informs the development of policies and operationally
focused climate services, and promotes science capacity building and education
in partnership with other programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hubs for modeling and
observations capabilities and for regional climate information for society will
facilitate international coordination of the activities. The expected outcomes
would include integrated capabilities for warning and prediction on global and
regional scales at the multi-annual to decadal timescales; climate information
meaningful at the local scale; approaches that take into account human and
natural systems; and digital and dynamic computational models that represent
past, current, and possible future conditions on the Earth. WCRP also
contributes significantly through its collaboration with national and
international scientific partners to conducting sustained assessments,
communication and education. WCRP activities contribute directly to the goals of
the US Global Change Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
