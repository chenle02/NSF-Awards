Von Neumann algebras are collections of certain infinite matrices of complex
numbers, called Hilbert space operators. They were introduced in the 1930s in
order to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then,
the theory of von Neumann algebras has flourished into an independent area with
fruitful connections to several areas of mathematics and science, including
quantum physics. Von Neumann algebras arise naturally from a variety of
mathematical structures, such as groups of symmetries and actions, which are
present in many areas of mathematics. Their study is closely connected to topics
in group theory and ergodic theory. This project will deepen the connections
between these areas and operator algebras, by investigating a number of open
problems at their interface. The project will also provide opportunities for the
training and professional development of graduate students.

The aim of this project is to expand the scope of rigidity in von Neumann
algebras and uncover new applications to group theory, ergodic theory and
C*-algebras. The first objective of the project is to investigate rigidity for
group von Neumann algebras. Building on recent work on Connes' famous 1980
rigidity conjecture, the PI proposes to find new families of property (T) groups
which are rigid in the context of von Neumann algebras and measure equivalence.
The second objective of the project is to investigate two related rigidity
properties for groups: Hilbert-Schmidt stability and the local lifting property
for full group C*-algebras. The PI proposes to investigate two longstanding
problems concerning almost commuting matrices and the local lifting property.
The third objective of the project is to study asymptotic problems of von
Neumann algebras. The proposed research is expected to lead to new interactions
between operator algebras, (both geometric and measured) group theory and
ergodic theory.
