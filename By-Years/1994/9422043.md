9422043 Iyer This award is to purchase equipment to support the following two
research projects: 1) Automatic Tools for Verification and Debugging of
Concurrent Programs and Designs -- In order to deal with the state explosion
phenomenon inherent in symbolic verification/analysis of concurrent programs and
system designs, the first component of this project will involve the
investigation of data flow and abstraction for concurrent systems. Reachability
based techniques will also be considered for specific properties such as
deadlock, starvation and livelocks in concurrent programs. Finally, better
algorithms for explaining (to a system designer) the errors detected in a design
will be investigated; 2) Error Control in High-Speed Networking -- The use of
conventional error detection in the face of transmission errors, and subsequent
correction of the error, in high-speed networks can lead to rapid degradation of
the network. This project will investigate new error control algorithms, their
implementation and a study of their performance characteristics. A common
characteristic of these two projects is that they involve algorithms which are
computation, and memory, intensive. ***
