The problem of marine biofouling is very important, and one to which extensive
efforts have been expended in order to find materials that will prevent such
fouling. The diversity and adaptability of marine organisms is simultaneously
impressive and depressing. It is sobering to consider the facts that marine
organisms will attach to and colonize fluorinated polymer surfaces, such as
Teflon, albeit not as tenaciously as to other materials, and that the pholad
Martesia has been observed to attack as inert a polymer as polyethylene. This
research program involves a waterborne polymeric formulation which promises to
significantly advance the state of the art of non-toxic antifouling paints. The
novel composition contains no toxic ingredients or volatile organic compounds
(VOC). The proposed technology is also attractive since it involves only
environmentally benign components, will be easy to apply, and will be of low
cost.
