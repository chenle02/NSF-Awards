Funds from this award will be used to acquire an excimer laser ablation system
for a broad range of cutting edge geoscience and anthropological research. The
laser system will interface with an existing multiple collector ICP-MS and be
housed in an established NSF-funded laboratory. The resulting system will
comprise a state-of-the-art laboratory for measuring isotopic ratios at micron
scales in a variety of solid samples (minerals, rocks, glasses, and teeth). The
addition of this laser system to the facility will provide essential training on
modern instrumentation for graduate students from several research groups and
valuable experience with key methods for other graduate students. Undergraduate
research will be greatly enhanced by being able to use this instrument. The
plasma mass spectrometer laboratory has become a regional resource with a number
of outside users from the Midwest region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of this
device by interdisciplinary researchers will simultaneously advance several
fields at the fore-front of integrated geoscience research by enabling high
precision measurements of isotopic compositions at microscale resolution. This
will be applied to major research projects that include: (1) assessing whether a
temperature gradient driven differentiation process has led to the development
of Earth?s silicic continental crust; (2) determining the spatial distribution
of U and Th in zircon to improve the ability to perform accurate U-Th/He in
zircon thermochronology; (3) tracing the migration of hominids and
archaeological artifacts through measurements of Sr isotopes in teeth and
artifacts; (4) determining Sr isotopes in solid materials such as carbonates to
trace reactions with natural waters; and (5) determining&lt;br/&gt;Sr isotope
ratios in carbonate minerals in order to reveal biocomplex microbe-water-mineral
interactions in hot springs and coral reefs.
