Numerical and analytic models will be used to study the sources of shock-
accelerated energetic particles in the near-Earth region. A critical component
of this investigation is the interpretation of data obtained from a variety of
spacecraft such as ACE, WIND, and ULYSSES. The first task will address the
recent popular idea that remnant material from impulsive solar flares may
provide a source of seed particles for injection into large CME-associated
events. These particles can be recycled, or further accelerated by propagating
transient shocks, or perhaps those associated with corotating interaction
regions. The validation of this concept hinges upon a demonstration that the
seed particles can be effectively transported from the compact flare site to the
extended shock fronts. The second task is to look at how low-energy ions are
accelerated by shocks, and to determine what fraction of the thermal particles
swept into the shock can be injected into the acceleration process.
