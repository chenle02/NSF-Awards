The primary objective of this research is to conduct a pilot investigation of
the insertional polymorphism of Alu sequences in New World human populations.
Previous research in the investigators' laboratory has shown that most nuclear
RFLPs are polymorphic in many human populations. Here, the investigators will
analyze the utility of a second type of polymorphism as a tool for
reconstructing the history of human populations. Because of the wealth of
knowledge regarding relationships between Native American populations and the
availability of samples, the system will be tested on this group. Alu sequences
constitute a family of related sequences scattered throughout the nuclear genome
which are capable of moving within the genome. As it is essentially impossible
for a sequence to insert in exactly the same position through independent
mutations, finding identical Alu sequences insertions is presumptive evidence of
common descent. The investigators will test the utility of these polymorphisms
as genetic markers. Additionally, the researchers will investigate the antiquity
of specific Alu polymorphisms by comparison with samples from other human
populations.
