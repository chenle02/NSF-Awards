Holbrook 9401374 Upcoming Delaware multichannel seismic experiment across the
Aleutian Arc will collect high quality vertical incidence seismic refraction
data across and active continental and island arc system. The PI's will
piggyback on this cruise to record sound energy generated by airguns at the
ocean bottom. This will provide deep velocity structure data of both continental
and oceanic arcs as well as direct imaging of wide-angle reflectivity from the
system boundaries. The data will help reconcile conflicting hypothesis of deep
structure and composition of the arc systems.
