During the past decade a substantial effort has been devoted to estimating labor
market models of job search. These are important models in that their
estimation, especially using panel data, can yield relevant predictions about
the effects of various government policies on the unemployment rate and on
wages. Several approaches have been taken to model the search for work. Most of
the models set the job searcher in the framework of a price taker, that is the
distributions of wages across jobs is given, and the person searches for a
position which meets at least the minimum wage rate required to entice him into
the labor force. This type of model has been criticized on the grounds that the
wage distribution might not be stable over even very short periods of time, and
more recent analyses have tried to incorporate a changing wage distribution by
using models of partial equilibrium in the labor market. This project uses a
partial equilibrium framework in which individuals search in a market where
productivity varies from firm to firm. The workers themselves are heterogeneous
with respect to their desires for employment versus leisure time. The wage
distribution is not assumed to be stable independent of the workers, but to
change in response to differences among workers' desire for leisure and in
response to productivity differences among firms. The model is estimated using
data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience of Youth
in which the data follow several cohorts of high school graduates from the time
they graduate until the time they accept their first full-time job. The
estimates can be used to test the effects of minimum wages and unemployment
compensation on the unemployment rate, and also for testing for labor market
segmentation and discrimination, and to give these sometimes loosely defined
concepts more rigor. This project is done in collaboration with Kenneth Wolpin
of Ohio State University.
