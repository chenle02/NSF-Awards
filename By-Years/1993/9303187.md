9303187 Bolt This action is to continue a collaboration in the recording of
earthquake strong ground motion, between principal investigators at the
University of California at Berkeley and at the Institute of Earth Sciences,
Academica Sinica, Taiwan. This collaboration began with the NSF-funded
installation in Taiwan of SMART-1 (Strong Motion Array in Taiwan-1) headed by
the principal investigator. Since that time, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) have collaborated
with Taiwan Power in the complimentary recording of strong ground motions
through a smaller-scale array within SMART-1, for soil-structure interaction
studies motivated by needs in nuclear power plant design. This collaboration is
being repeated with the installation of the Taiwan-funded SMART-2 array at a
stiffer soil site at Hualien. The Taiwan Weather Bureau is now installing 600
strong-motion recorders distributed around the island of Taiwan. NSF-funded
investigators from the University of Houston and the University of Southern
California are participating in this data-gathering program, and the principal
investigator is involved separately as chairman of a technical review panel for
the strong-motion recorders being installed. This action is to: (1) support
collaboration in dissemination and processing of seismic ground motions being
recorded by the new digital accelerograph array (SMART-2); (2) assist in the
integration of SMART-2 data with that from the smaller-scale 3-D array; and (3)
continue research using new SMART-1 and SMART-2 data, on measuring, comparing,
understanding and characterizing variations of strong ground motion paralleling
those at SMART-1 on "soft" soil. ***
