Friedman will continue research on a number of topics that he has initiated in
recent years in collaboration with other researchers, including topics in
definitional structure of mathematics, reverse mathematics, algorithmic
procedures, general unified proof theory, model theory of real functions, Borel
reducibility for classes of countable structures, and the transferability and
provability of positive sentences. Friedman also intends to explore some
additional topics mostly without collaboration, including research exposition,
independence results, round-off structures, Hilbert's seventeenth problem,
intuitionistic set theory, foundations of ultrafinitism, and foundations of
experimental mathematics.
