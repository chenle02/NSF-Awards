This project, trying to acquire a cluster to serve computational biology in
answering its intensive computational needs, aims at providing near linear
speedup while running in a cluster environment. The infrastructure facilitates
simulation, analysis, classification, and prediction of the behavior of
individual molecules or small groups of molecules such as DNA strands, and
proteins using data mining and machine learning algorithms. Examples
include:&lt;br/&gt; Protein Structure, Folding, and Docking,&lt;br/&gt; Protein-
Protein Interactions and Design,&lt;br/&gt; Protein-Expression and Synthetic
Genes,&lt;br/&gt; Self-Assembling Nanostructures,&lt;br/&gt; DNA Microarrays
Data Analysis, and Gene Regulation, and&lt;br/&gt; Systems Biology.&lt;br/&gt;
