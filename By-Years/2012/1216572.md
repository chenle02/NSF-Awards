A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated
by the&lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501
(c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution
incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island
of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The
RV Atlantic Explorer has 157 days funded in 2012 and 150 days in 2011. All 157
days are NSF science days. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation Equipment: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) FERRUPS UPCS system
$17,000&lt;br/&gt;2) Upgrades for the shipboard IP/Data network
$16,400&lt;br/&gt;3) Bottom Finding Pinger $15,600&lt;br/&gt; TOTAL
$49,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of
the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
