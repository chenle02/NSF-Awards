This Award is a Career Advancement Award in the Organic Dynamics Program of the
Chemistry Division. With these funds Professor Hilkka Kenttamaa of Purdue
University will study the feasibility of using gas phase ion-molecule reactivity
techniques to study neutral DNA molecules prepared in the gas phase by laser
desorption. The project has as a long range objective the study of free radical
reactions involving biopolymers. The gas phase study of large molecules of
biological interest holds promise as an analytical technique as well as for
study of solvent-free or sparsely solvated structures and of their interactions.
This project will develop methodology for such studies of DNA.
