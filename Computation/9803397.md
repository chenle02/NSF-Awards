The PI intends to continue his study of uniqueness and stability for certain
important inverse problems. The contemporary methods of the theory of partial
differential equations will be used. Those include Carleman type estimates, the
Fourier integral operators, potential theory, and general functional analytic
approach. An emphasis is on inverse problems with local/partial boundary
measurements, on increasing stability by isolating ill-posedness in a simple
linear transform, on recovery of non-linear equations, and on interaction
between inverse problems and optimal control theory. Based on the theory the PI
plans to develop efficient numerical algorithms for the following important
applied inverse problems. The applied focus of the project will be on - the
problem of electromagnetic detection of the active part of human brain -
identifying a source of acoustical noise located on the surface of an aircraft
cabin from interior measurements - finding constitutive laws for complicated
non-linear physical systems, including underground flows in porous media and
chemical reactions - reconstruction of the volatility coefficient of options
trading from current market data. The second problem is of immediate importance
in designing less noisy cars and midsize aircraft. The fourth one is about
prediction of the future state of the very important financial area influencing
the life of contemporary society.
