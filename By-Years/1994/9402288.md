9402288 Negishi The focus of this research is the development of carbon-carbon
bond making and bond breaking processes that use zirconium mediated methodology.
Bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium derivatives are used to probe a wide range of
organometallic reactions that involve catalysis and have the potential for
enantioselectivity. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Ei-Ichi Negishi of the Department of Chemistry
at Purdue University. Professor Negishi will focus his efforts on developing new
catalytic methods for the formation and breaking of carbon-carbon bonds.
Organometallic reactions featuring zirconium reagents are the key to the
strategy. ***
