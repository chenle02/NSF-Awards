The fabric (that is, the physical structure) of sand, and the effect of aging,
play a fundamental role in determining the stresses necessary to trigger
liquefaction under earthquake loading. Recent observations indicate that changes
in sand fabric, as measured in the field, may result in a rapid initial gain in
stiffness due to aging, but that dynamic loads, such as those induced by
earthquakes, cause this stiffness to degrade. This results in significant
fluctuations of the sand liquefaction resistance with time. It is possible that
both physical and chemical mechanisms may contribute to these age-related
changes in liquefaction resistance. The basic intent of this research project is
to investigate in the laboratory whether beneficial ageing effects on soil
fabric can be destroyed by relatively low levels of cyclic strain, thereby
simulating the effects of earthquakes which are smaller, but more frequent, than
the "design earthquake" for a given site. The goal is to investigate the
earthquake- induced reversibility of the effects of time on sand fabric, thereby
concluding whether it is a matter of practical concern in evaluating the
liquefaction potential of a given site. If this turns out to be the case, it
will bring into question the way in which penetrometer-based design methods are
currently applied, and will further suggest that a conservative design approach
may be to base the liquefaction potential evaluation on the resistance of the
sand in a freshly-deposited state in the laboratory.
