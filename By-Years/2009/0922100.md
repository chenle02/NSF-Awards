This project will apply a new framework of model development for polar science
using open source and open platform software with embedded visualization. The
group will use the ?Processing? model environment to develop visual models that
will allow a better mechanistic understanding of how snow and shrubs
independently and interactively affect physical and biological controls over
soil N dynamics and decomposition in arctic tundra, and how these in turn affect
vegetation composition and productivity. The new visually based applications
will, at least to start, use the physics, chemistry and biology that have been
incorporated into previous more conventional numerical models.

Processing offers a ?friendly? framework for model development that is
inherently visually expressive and can be used to rapidly test ideas. It offers
accelerated scientific understanding through the visual experience and
accelerated model development through the feedback of real time interactivity.
It will accelerate the development of mechanistic models by providing a test bed
for novel ideas and mechanisms before decisions to incorporate such model
components into, for example, the land-surface models of general circulation
models. It will enable and encourage observational and experimental scientists
to explore models without knowledge of specialized programming languages and
thus increase the synergy and collaboration among all parts of the arctic
science community. The approach is also ideal for education and outreach as it
will allow development of applications that allow students and others to explore
scientific concepts easily and intuitively.
