This SGER deals with a fundamental problem in polymer science, namely how do
giant molecules move with respect to each other? A widely held view, espoused by
de Gennes and others, is that macromolecules move in a snakelike fashion, i.e.,
by reptation. Reptation seems to hold under some conditions, but not under
others. In the absence of decisive experiments, the theory has, therefore,
become controversial. This research aims to provide a decive test. It will
consist of careful preparation of a series of polymers with deuteration either
at the ends or in the center of the chains. The diffusion of the molecules will
then be studied under a variety of conditions, using neutron reflectivity and
other means. This careful test of polymer dynamics is needed. If successful, the
experiments will either be a decisive test of the theory or at least point the
way to other experiments that should settle this issue. In either case, rheology
of polymers will be put on a more scientific basis.
