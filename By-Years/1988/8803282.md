Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research projects on the
Juneau Icefield, Alaska, including: geology, glaciology, geophysics,
glaciometeorology, geobotany and surveying. This research/educational activity
aims at a total systems study of one of North America's largest icefields. Each
undergraduate will select a research project and be encouraged to exercise as
much independent judgement and initiative as possible in its development.
Undergraduates selected will be earth science students who demonstrate scholarly
aptitude, motivation, and research potential. Because the research experience
will involve field work in rugged glacier terrain, physical stamina will be
necessary. The staff will be available throughout the season for advice and
help, including lectures, seminars and site specific instructions in
methodologies to insure an effective research experience.
