With this GOALI award, the OMA and the Synthetic Organic Program support the
research of Dr. Douglas F. Taber of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Delaware. Professor Taber will spend a sabbatical year at Dupont
Merck Pharmaceuticals learning to understand the specific challenges currently
faced in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This knowledge will be used, in turn, to
guide the academic research carried out in Dr. Taber's group at Delaware.
