An SBIR Award will support development of a covalent bonding agent for ceramic
coatings deposited by the sol-gel technique. A bi-functional coupling agent will
be used which be bond covalently to the metal or polymer substrate on the one
hand and simultaneously participate in the oxide gelation process. This is
expected to create a covalent bond structure across the interface which should
greatly improve coating adherence. The study involves synthesis of the bonding
agents, study of substrate reactions, and determination of interfacial adhesion
nd coating wear resistance.
