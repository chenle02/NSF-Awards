0854035&lt;br/&gt;Seager&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of this
workshop is currently at center stage in the international debate that is under
way on the impact of biofuels on greenhouse gas emissions. Advances in
methodologies to analyze the impacts of land use on greenhouse gas emissions are
vitally needed. The same need exists more generally for analyzing land use as an
aspect of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of products and processes, a central tool
in the rapidly emerging field of sustainability science and engineering. A
deliverable for this workshop is a multi-author report (that will be submitted
for peer review and publication) articulating the current state-of-the-science,
critical knowledge gaps, and a proposed agenda for future research based on
workshop findings. There are to be about 50 academic participants in this
workshop, which is to be convened at Niagara Falls, NY during the fall of 2009.
