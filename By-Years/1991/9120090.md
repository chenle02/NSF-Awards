This proposal is an investigation of calmodulin in Paramecium. It will extend
the previous observation that a point mutation in calmodulin causes the
Paramecium to swim backward. Calmodulin is involved in calcium-regulated
potassium channels and cell viability in this organism. Other mutant calmodulins
will be prepared and their sensitivity to barium ions will be examined; the
mutant cam1 has been shown to have increased sensitivity to barium, which can
replace calcium in its four binding sites. Intergenic suppressors of the
calmodulin mutants cam1 and cam 11 will be sought, to try to find other genes
involved in the regulation of ion channels and cell viability. Intragenic and
intergenic suppressors which affect activation of the calcium-dependent
potassium channel differentially from the barium sensitivity will be sought.
Proteins which bind wild-type Paramecium calmodulin better than its mutant
calmodulins will be searched for in mammalian cells, and the genes coding for
these proteins will be isolated. Calmodulin is a protein which is present in all
cell types which have been examined. It binds calcium and is involved in
regulation of many aspects of cellular function. Among these are the regulation
of channels which permit entry of ions into cells and regulation of the cell
cycle. In the protozoan Paramecium, a mutation in a single amino acid has been
shown to cause the organism to swim backward. In addition, this mutation
increases the sensitivity of the organism to barium, which can substitute for
calcium at specific binding sites. The proposal involves a search for additional
calmodulin mutants by a variety of techniques, a search for intergenic
suppressors of the proteins, and a search for proteins in mammalian cells which
bind differently to wild-type and mutant calmodulins from the protozoan.
Proteins which do not affect the activation of the calcium-dependent potassium
channel but do affect the ability of calmodulin to bind barium will also be
sought. The study should increase understanding of how calmodulin regulates cell
processes.
