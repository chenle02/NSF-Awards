In this proposal the principal investigator will study the feasibility of a
Quantum Field-Effect Directional Coupler (QFED). The QFED is a proposed device
that intends to exploit the wave nature of electrons confined to a very small
semiconductor structures. The QFED consists basically of two parallel electron
waveguides sufficiently closely spaced over a certain length (the interaction
length) so that electrons can be transferred from one waveguide to the other by
quantum mechanical tunneling. In a QFED, electrons transfer alternatively
between the two waveguides as the electron wave packet travels down the coupler.
For a coupler to transfer any given fraction of the electrons from one waveguide
to the other, coupling between the waveguides can be controlled without changing
their interaction length. This is achieved by the field-effect action of a metal
gate running through the middle of the coupler. The QFED behaves as a current
switch, much like an entire Emitter-Coupler Logic gate.
