Engineering NEC (59) The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI), a
national Indian community college, is developing a model for engineering
technology and engineering transfer programs that will be reproducible and
applicable to other locations with significant Indian populations. By employing
articulation agreements with a wide range of four and two-year institutions,
national laboratories and industry, SIPI is providing lower division courses in
engineering and in engineering technology allowing participants to go directly
into the workforce or continue with baccalaureate
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASEET's comprehensive program design encompasses
curriculum development, faculty recruitment, professional development, community
outreach, student recruitment, student retention, and career development for the
transitions between high school and 2- and 4-year colleges. &lt;br/&gt;SIPI's
ASEET program is:&lt;br/&gt;1. Improving Native American student proficiency in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through the development and
revision of science-based academic programs and course offerings.&lt;br/&gt;2.
Motivating pre-college Native American students to pursue careers in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics by offering seminars, short courses,
and workshops onsite and through distance education, engineering survey courses,
directed learning experiences and internships as part of SIPI's pre-engineering
degree program.&lt;br/&gt;3. Improving science, technology, engineering and
mathematics instruction through professional development opportunities and
curriculum review and revision.&lt;br/&gt;4. Continuing to build Southwestern
Indian Polytechnic Institute's capacity to develop world-class science and
technology knowledge and skills for the technological workplace.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, SIPI is assisting other tribal colleges in
establishing similar programs. Faculty members from other tribal colleges are
being encouraged to serve as visiting or adjunct faculty and receive training in
the methodology developed at SIPI. These faculty members are helping to develop
teaching materials and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the pedagogy and
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
