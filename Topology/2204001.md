Topology is the study of global properties of geometric objects which are
preserved under deformation; it has recently found applications in areas such as
protein folding, materials science, analysis of high-dimensional data, and
robotics. A particularly successful approach, which has produced innumerable
results since the 1950's, is computing algebraic invariants which are then
studied through algebraic means. However, in many situations this way of
transforming the problem hides some inherent geometric complexity - for example,
one can deform one object to another, but only by making it very complicated
somewhere in the middle. In such a case, the existence of a deformation may not
be particularly meaningful from a physical, application-oriented point of view.
In other cases, in contrast, one can always find a reasonably straightforward
deformation, validating the use of algebraic methods for applications. The
purpose of this project is to investigate these phenomena. Broader impacts of
this project include research training opportunities for graduate students.

The past few years have seen significant progress in the area of quantitative
homotopy theory: understanding the complexity, typically measured by the
Lipschitz constant, of objects, such as maps and homotopies, whose existence is
guaranteed by algebraic topology. This progress has been particularly pronounced
for simply connected spaces. The current project will seek to harness this
progress mainly in two ways. The first goal is to obtain quantitative results
about topics in geometric topology such as immersions, embeddings, and surgery
theory. Since these topics are usually studied via reduction to homotopy theory,
this will also require a more geometric understanding of these reductions. The
second goal to apply the ideas of quantitative homotopy theory to studying the
geometry of nilpotent groups, an area at the intersection of geometric group
theory, sub-Riemannian geometry, and analysis on metric spaces.
