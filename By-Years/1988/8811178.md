Neurons function better in the presence of glial cells, but few of the glial
molecules responsible for that effect are known because of the difficulty in
separating them from axonal molecules. However, that separation can be achieved
in the squid giant axon because of its size (typically 3-6 cm long and 0.5 mm in
diameter). Recently, this investigator found that one of the glial proteins
transferred into the squid axon belongs to the group of heat stress proteins.
These proteins are produced in abundance by most cells after acute exposure to
metabolic stress. As the proteins accumulate, the cells become more resistant to
potentially lethal stress. The discovery of glia-axon transfer of stress
proteins represents a potential breakthrough in the understanding of nervous
system response to injury because it implies that the glia can provide to the
axon proteins designed to keep the axon from dying in the face of trauma. In the
squid giant axon, biochemical, immunochemical and morphological techniques will
be used to examine the relationship between the synthesis and glia-axon transfer
of stress proteins and axonal stress tolerance. Additionally, stress proteins
transfer will be compared to the transfer of other glial proteins to determine
if there are multiple mechanisms of glia-axon protein transfer. The work
described in this research project will show how the stress protein response in
nerve tissue can be enhanced. This information may provide a tool that can help
to ameliorate the loss of function after central nervous system injury.
Potentially, recovery after nervous system trauma could be improved by
stimulation of the production of stress proteins or by administering stress
proteins. More far-reaching is the possibility that the loss of neurons after
physical trauma to the nervous system could be reduced by proper manipulation of
the stress protein response.
