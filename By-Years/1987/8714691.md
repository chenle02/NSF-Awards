A planning workshop will be convened to identify basic science and engineering
research needed to exploit environmental biotechnology for biological treatment
of hazardous wastes and environmental contaminants. The workshop participants
will be a cross-disciplinary expert working group representing microbial
biochemistry, genetics, ecology, environmental microbiology, and chemical and
environmental bioprocess engineering. This working group will define those
research imperatives required to advance the biological treatment of hazardous
wastes and environmental contaminants. The output of this workshop will be a
consensus research plan to provide specific direction for integrating modern
biotechnology in basic environmental science and engineering research.
