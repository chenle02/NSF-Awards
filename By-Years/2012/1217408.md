This project presents a software system to have the smartphone itself deal with
the abnormal battery drain (ABD) issues that are caused by 'battery bugs' in
smartphone applications or system software as well as by battery-related
configuration errors and environmental changes. The proposed system architecture
contains four subsystems, namely information collection, data analysis,
diagnosis, and resolution, to self-detect, self-diagnose, and self-recover with
little user intervention if possible when ABD events happen. Various technical
methods, including machine learning and statistical approaches, will be
investigated to achieve the design goal.
