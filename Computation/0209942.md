The investigator studies the dynamics of certain classes of integro-
differential equations that arise in models of cortex. He examines how recurrent
activity terminates due to any of several effects such as synaptic depression,
depolarization block, and after-hyperpolarization. He also considers how
recurrent connections lead to bistability and under what conditions this is
sufficient to produce localized spatial states, wave fronts, and pulses. He uses
methods of averaging and bifurcation theory to derive and analyse simplified
dynamics from these models. The mathematical results explain a variety of
experimental findings in both normal and pharmacologically manipulated neural
tissue. These methods are applied to the Limax procerebral lobe, the turtle
olfactory bulb, and various cortical slice preparations. Neurons, the main cells
in the brain, are responsible for processing inputs from the outside world and
converting this to motor actions. They communicate by producing spikes that are
propagated to different regions of the brain by chemicals called transmitters.
The nvestigator is interested in how this electrical and chemical information
moves from one part of the brain to others. He uses simulations and mathematics
to derive equations and general principles about how this is done. Experiments
have shown that during some cognitive tasks, certain groups of neurons fire
synchronously. He is interested in the conditions that are necessary to attain
precise timing between different groups of neurons. In order to study these, he
has developed mathematical software for the study of complex biological and
physical systems. As part of this project, he continues to develop this software
and to make it widely available. The project also provides interdisciplinary
training opportunities for students and postdocs.
