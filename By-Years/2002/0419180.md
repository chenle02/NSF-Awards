This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel method, Evolutionary Chemistry, to simultaneously generate and
select from a library of small molecules, using modified RNA both as a catalyst
and as an amplifiable tag for detection of binding to a target.

The commercial application of this project will be to streamline the process of
discovery of new compounds for therapeutic and agricultural use.
