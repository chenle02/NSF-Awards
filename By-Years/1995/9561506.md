9561506 Quarles As lasers evolve from an object of basic scientific study into
rugged components that are used in an ever-increasing number of real-world
applications, courses that acquaint students with the basic operating principles
of laser devices are becoming an important part of the engineering and physics
curricula in a number of colleges and universities. This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the necessary hardware
components for a one semester course on laser operating principles for advanced
undergraduate and masters-level graduate students. The proposed laboratory
package will take advantage of recent technical advances in diode-pumped solid
state laser technology, that now make it possible to design a complete laser
laboratory course based on a set of low cost components. During Phase I, the
necessary components for the kit will be identified, engineered, and fabricated
at Lightning Optical Corporation. Simultaneously, a set of laboratory notes
outlining experiments to be performed with the Laboratory Optics Kit will be
prepared. Five prototype test kits will be assembled and delivered to the Center
for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers at the University of Central
Florida, where they will be tested as the basis for a one-semester laboratory
course scheduled to be offered during the 1996 summer semester. The anticipated
final result of this project is the marketing of a self-contained, economical
laser laboratory package by Lightning Optical Corporation, complete with
hardware, optics, and lab text. This project offers the prospect of the
commercial introduction of a laser laboratory package consisting of optics and
hardware kits and an accompanying lab text. The availability of this package
should make it possible for graduate and undergraduate institutions to add a
laboratory component to classroom courses on laser operating principles.
