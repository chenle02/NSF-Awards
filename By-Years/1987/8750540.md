Infrared (IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopy are crucial methods
for the current understanding of chemical structure and reaction mechanisms. The
use of two such spectrophotometers, recently acquired by the Chemistry
Department at Siena College, is providing students with knowledge of the
theoretical basis of these methods and experience with state-of-the-art
techniques for data retrieval and analysis. Together with a data station which
is shared by the two instruments, and selected software, the laboratory sections
of all of the upper level chemistry courses are impacted by the use of this
integrated system. These courses include Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry,
Instrumental Methods, Synthesis and Characterization, and Independent Research.
