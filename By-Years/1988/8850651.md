Introduction to College Mathematics, a new advanced high school course in
mathematics developed at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics,
will be disseminated to other teachers in a variety of ways. It will be prepared
for conventional distribution as a published book, but particular emphasis will
be placed on a variety of networking techniques to acquaint teachers with the
material and support them during its introduction into use. One group of
teachers beginning use of the course will use the MATHLINK network to interact
with each other as they try the new material. Other groups will attend summer
workshops at the school, following which they will form a SHARETEXT network. One
of the special activities of this networked group will be to explore use of
super calculators in teaching the course material. Newsletters will also be used
to link the teachers. Some of the teachers will be selected and trained as
leaders to introduce the course to more teachers. The various forms of
networking will be evaluated to provide guidance which can be used in planning
introduction of new teaching materials and curricula in general.
