This award provides one-half of the funding required to purchase a gas source
isotope ratio mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Institute of
Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. The University is
committed to providing the remaining half of the funds necessary for the
purchase and will house and maintain the equipment. The new instrument will
provide direct analytical support for two research projects: (1) Stable hydrogen
isotope ratios and deuterium excess in snow and polar ice, and (2) Stable carbon
isotope ratios measured in atmospheric carbon dioxide collected as part of the
world-wide sampling network. Additional projects that will be supported by the
new equipment include the application of deuterium excess in coastal ice in
Greenland and Antarctica to the study of sea ice extent; studies of hydrogen and
oxygen isotope ratios in groundwaters, surface waters and air vapor;
reconstruction of paleotemperatures from isotopes in ice cores and tree rings;
and the application of nitrogen isotope ratios to specific problems in the
nitrogen cycle.
