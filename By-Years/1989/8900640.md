A theoretical model, and experimental simulations in a wave tank, will be
constructed and applied to the problem of wave run-up and damage on breakwaters.
A prior numerical model developed by this investigator will be extended to
include the effect of porosity in the medium beneath the rubble material which
forms the armor of the breakwater. Further, the incident train of waves will be
generalized to be irregular rather than periodic. Wave run-up statistics and
reflected waves, as well as damage and breakwater profile changes will be
determined.
