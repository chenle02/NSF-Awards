The project will develop new methods for locating earthquakes in remote areas of
the world with greater precision. Current methods of earthquake location, based
on classical techniques that are used routinely by agencies such as the United
States Geological Survey, the International Seismological Centre, and the
International Monitoring System, provide no better than 25-km precision in
earthquake location in many areas of the world. This lack of precision limits
the ability to attribute individual earthquakes to specific earthquake faults,
and thus also the possibility to understand better the tectonic context. The
project will develop new algorithms based on inter-event correlations of
intermediate-period surface waves, and is expected to lead to a location
precision of 5 km or better. The algorithm will be used to address questions of
plate-boundary tectonics and seismogenesis. The improvements in earthquake
location will lead to new data sets with broad utility for research in plate
tectonics, plate-boundary processes and global seismic
tomography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new algorithm is based on cross correlation
of surface-wave signals from nearby earthquakes recorded on common stations.
Effects of wave propagation between the earthquakes and the stations are
canceled out, and the remaining signal is related to the propagation time delay
between the stations, and to predictable source effects. The results are
improved by correcting for laterally varying dispersion. The approach will make
use of all available pairs of Rayleigh and Love waves for a regional cluster of
earthquakes to invert for relative locations of all events in the cluster. The
cluster will then be anchored to geomorphological features to provide absolute
locations of the individual earthquakes.
