The objective of this project is to subject a relatively large body of existing
data for a surface water impoundment to statistical computations for
establishing and quantifying the largely wind-driven circulation and turbulent
processes that affect the quality of the impounded water. The impoundment being
studied in this project is the Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Sabine River in
Texas, characteristic of many highly stratified, water supply and cooling water
reservoirs in the United States with a relatively low rate of water-
displacement. The results of this project are potentially applicable for use in
validating existing mathematical models for characterizing the physical
processes that affect circulation in these types of impoundments and influence
the quality of the impounded water. This project's results are likely to lead to
a better understanding than now exists of mixing and circulation patterns in
stratified lakes that have an impact on the quality of the impounded water. This
knowledge may be applied to engineering design of new impoundments, operation of
existing impoundments, and the location and operation of treatment systems for
bringing the water to standards of quality that are appropriate for the intended
use.
