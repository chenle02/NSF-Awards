This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will study the formation
and applications of ultracold molecules with translational temperatures less
than 0.001 K. The formation of the homonuclear molecule Rb_2 and the
heteronuclear molecule KRb will be investigated by photoassociation (PA) of
ultracold atoms, emphasizing two newly proposed novel variants of PA in which a
long-range state of a molecule is mixed quantum mechanically with a short-range
state. Either of the two variant schemes can lead to formation of molecules in
their lowest energy states. These molecules, trapped in a so-called optical
trap, will be examined to determine their elastic, inelastic, and chemically
reactive collision rates, which are expected to be vastly different from rates
extrapolated from higher temperatures. External electric and magnetic fields
will be applied to observe their anticipated major influence on collision
rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that it will integrate
fundamental research with education at the graduate, postdoctoral, and
undergraduate level through group meetings, mentoring, workshops, seminars, and
collaborations. The research will have cross-disciplinary implications,
including contributions to the proposed application of ultracold polar molecules
for quantum information processing. Presentations and papers by the program
participants will contribute to scientific understanding, including areas such
as ultracold chemistry, fundamental symmetries, quantum information, and
nanoscience, and to international scientific cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;
