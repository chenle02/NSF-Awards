This SBIR Phase II research focuses on a high energy device that can cut the
skin and foam of an automotive instrument panel surface in an emergency
activation of an airbag. The cutting action is effected by the release of stored
chemical energy either by detonation and/or heat deflagration. The fabrication
concept uses a paint slurry printed onto the back surface of an instrument panel
directly on an intermediate membrane or on the airbag door substrate. Current
passenger airbag technology leaves a visible appearance of the airbag in the
front surface of and instrument panel. The technology under this award will
improve safety, appearance, and flexibility in locating the cut without adverse
effect on reliability of the airbag or on other instrument panel parameters.
