C-CR 0105639 Dana Randall "Markov Chain Algorithms for Computational Problems
from Physics and Biology"

This research in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods has three primary goals: (i)
developing new, general techniques for analyzing convergence rates of Markov
chains; (ii) designing rigorous, efficient algorithms for specific computational
applications, focusing on problems from statistical physics and biology with
relevance to computer science; and (iii) exploring the connections between the
phase structure of physical models and the inherent limitations of various
sampling methods.

The research is concentrated in these areas. 1) Coupling has been a very popular
method for bounding the convergence rates of Markov chains based on local
updates, but only works in restrictive settings. Heat bath algorithms, which
allow possibly nonlocal updates, appear to circumvent potentially bad situations
arising from simpler chains, but tend to be prohibitively complex for analysis.
Decomposition theorems provide a new tool which allow a Markov chain to be
broken into pieces whereby a hybrid approach can be used to analyze each piece.
The investigator studies how these methods can be used together to approach some
new sampling problems. 2) Computational biologists have developed a Turing-
universal model of computation based on Wang tiles using double-stranded DNA.
New efficient sampling algorithms for some of these simple models are explored
with the goal of providing ways to test the model predict outcomes of
experiments. 3) The research additionally explores the connection between rapid
mixing of locally defined Markov chains and the uniqueness of the Gibbs state of
the underlying physical system, also characterized by the lack of a phase
transition. Knowledge of this phase structure is used to develop algorithms
which will allow sampling below the critical point, where local Markov chains
are inefficient.
