This collaborative proposal would use establishment data from EEO reports to
investigate changes in occupational segregation across nine broad occupational
categories between 1966 and 1999. Preliminary analyses have documented the
national declines in average within-establishment segregation by gender and
racial/ethnic group across the 34 years of data. Average segregation by county
and industry will be made available as a public use data file. The levels of and
changes in establishment-level segregation will be analyzed to estimate the
effects of factors at the establishment level (e.g., years since founding), the
firm level (e.g., federal reporting requirements), the industry level (e.g.,
market competition), and the local area (e.g., minority concentrations and
women's labor force participation).
