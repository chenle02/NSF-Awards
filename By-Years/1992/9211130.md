We are interested in developing efficient parallel algorithms for computational
materials science. In particular, we intend to continue ongoing research on
semiconductor alloys in the framework of Monte Carlo simulations of a
generalized lattice gas model including elastic degrees of freedom. This
materials research project, which is interesting both from the point of view of
fundamental research, as well as with respect to potential technological
applications, shall be extended in order to study surface reconstruction, the
behavior of expitaxial films, and electronic structure. The simulation program,
which presently is fully vectorized, shall be modified in order to make the
algorithm suitable for parallel processing using the "parallel virtual machine"
software.
