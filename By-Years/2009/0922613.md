This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lewis &amp; Clark College, a selective
liberal arts institution focused on educating undergraduates and advancing
knowledge, has received an award from the National Science Foundation to
purchase a Zeiss AxioImager high resolution, time-lapse, fluorescence
deconvolution microscope. Faculty and undergraduate researchers from Lewis &amp;
Clark College will use the microscope to investigate a broad range of important
biological topics ranging from fundamental aspects of cell structure/function to
the characterization and documentation of new venomous brown recluse spider
species. The imaging system will significantly expand the scope of questions
Lewis &amp; Clark College faculty and students can collaboratively address and
strengthen the ties between research and teaching so fundamental to the most
effective science education. Use of the microscope will be integrated into the
College curriculum, so that 60 undergraduates a year will be trained in cutting-
edge light microscopy techniques that they will utilize while carrying out
independent research into topics directly related to faculty research programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the microscopy system will be a centerpiece
of ongoing outreach activities in area science classrooms and summer research
programs targeting high school and community college students from
underrepresented groups in science. The research and training outcomes from use
of the microscopy system will be published in peer-reviewed journals and
highlighted on Cell Biology/Molecular Biology/Biochemistry course related
websites, faculty research websites, and outreach associated websites at Lewis
&amp; Clark College.&lt;br/&gt;
