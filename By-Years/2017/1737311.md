Ocean warming kills corals and efforts are underway to identify and protect
coral reefs that may withstand the projected 21st century rise in tropical ocean
temperatures. Coral reefs in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP) have been
exposed to episodes of extreme warmth every 3-7 years for centuries, if not
millennia, yet remain highly productive ecosystems. Initial data obtained by the
investigator from stress signatures archived in the skeletons of long lived
coral species, suggests that CEP reefs lose their symbiotic algae or bleach,
sometimes severely, during warm episodes. The observation that CEP reefs bleach
repetitively yet remain productive implies uncommon resilience to ocean warming.
The investigator will use laboratory experiments and field observations to
validate skeletal records of historical bleaching. A successful outcome will
provide novel and valuable insights into the resilience of the CEP reefs and a
new tool with which to identify thermally tolerant coral reef ecosystems across
the tropics. Additionally, this project includes mentorship of a postdoc and six
undergraduate or high school students, outreach through presentations and media,
and expansion of publically available software for coral stress band
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ocean warming projections indicate severe impacts
to coral reefs will occur on an annual basis within the next few decades.
Consequently, a coordinated effort is underway to identify reefs that might
survive these changes. The investigator will test the hypothesis that such reefs
exist at the epicenter of influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
where strong inter-annual temperature variability creates conditions conducive
for the development of thermal resilience. The project uses laboratory-based
bleaching experiments and actual stress signatures accreted by wild corals
during the 2015 El Niño to validate signatures of historical bleaching archived
in the skeletons of massive reef building corals. In addition the investigator
will use new, long cores from the CEP to build a robust dataset of historical
bleaching back to the 1800's. A successful outcome will increase confidence in
the interpretation of skeletal stress bands as quantitative bleaching proxies
and enable the reconstruction of the history of coral reef bleaching and
recovery in the CEP.
