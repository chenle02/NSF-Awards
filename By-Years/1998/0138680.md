This project will develop six mathematics and six science graduate level
courses. The goal is to provide science and mathematics content for teachers
with elementary certifications who now teach at the middle school level. Each
summer participants will take either two math or two science courses during an
intensive four-week program. It is expected the same participants will return
for three years, eventually taking all six courses. 150 teachers will be served
over a three-year period. Teachers will receive follow-up support through the
internet and/or on-site support. Competitive $500 grants will be available for
supplies and travel. In addition, the PI will establish a professional
development support group, the Northeastern Oklahoma Math and Science Teacher
Association (NOMSTA).
