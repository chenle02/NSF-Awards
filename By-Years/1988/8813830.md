Magnetic fields of sufficient strength are known to suppress mixing in fluidized
beds of magnetically polarizable particles. This research concerns the fluid
mechanical behavior of magnetically stablilized liquid fluidized beds using
various mixtures of particles, some magnetically polarizable for bed
stabilization, and some having specific adsorptive properties suitable for an
efficient biochemical separation process. Stability of the bed will be
investigated as a function of the particle sizes, densities and composition,
liquid velocity, and magnetic field strength and orientation. The research will
also examine protein separation in such beds. If successful stable operation of
mixed particle fluidized beds can be achieved, it would permit greater
flexibility in fluidized bed operations for biochemical separations and
immediate adoption by the industry through the use of already existing non-
magnetic particles having specialized adsorptive properties. The study should
also yield interesting information on stabilization of liquid fluidized beds in
magnetic fields.
