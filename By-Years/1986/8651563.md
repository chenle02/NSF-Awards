This is an interagency transfer of funds to the Department of Education to
support jointly the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS: 88)
to be conducted by the National Opinion Research Center. NELS: 88 is a survey
based on the national probability sample of eighth grade students and teachers.
These same students will also be surveyed in the 10th and 12th grades and in
later years to determine the educational effects in middle and secondary schools
on their higher educational and occupational experiences. This award will
support two aspects of the NELS: 88 survey, as follows: (1)Teacher Survey -- A
teacher questionnaire (science and mathematics teachers) will be used in the
base-year survey to gather data about the students samples, the student body as
a whole, the teachers themselves (their training, career expectations, courses
taught, and textbooks used), and the school's facilities, environment, and
policies. Approximately 11,000 teachers will be identified to complete the
teacher questionnaire; (2)Math and Science Survey Items -- Two pages of survey
items will be added to the eighth grade student questionnaire to ask about
student attitudes and aspirations toward math and science. Also, similar items
will be asked of the student's parents.
