9306365 Minshall The importance of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) as an
energy source in streams is well documented and considerable data exist on
spatial and temporal patterns of FPOM in transport and in benthic storage.
Information on FPOM dynamics, including transport distance, rates of FPOM
deposition and resuspension, retention time on the stream bed, the influence of
varying hydraulic and geomorphic conditions, and direct determination of capture
by aquatic insects, is, however, very limited. Our initial research has
established the efficacy of the method and its utility for tracking the fate of
natural FPOM in two turbulent streams. Using a unique method to label
individual, natural particles of FPOM with 14C which enables us to recover and
detect individual FPOM particles under natural stream conditions, we propose a
detailed research program utilizing the developed methods to (1) quantify the
dynamics of transport, deposition and resuspension of FPOM in selected streams,
and (3) examine more precisely mechanism governing FPOM dynamics using
experimental fumes. The techniques allows us to overcome a major impediment in
advances in stream ecology by providing direct measures of transport distance
and rates of capture (both biological and physical), retention, and
resuspension. %%% The data from these studies will provide values for these
factors over a range of geomorphic and hydraulic conditions and valuable
information to test and modify some of the basic paradigms in stream ecology
including the River Continuum Concept and Nutrient Spiraling Concept. We are
confident that the results and methods will have broad applicability to similar
studies in other ecosystems.
