Set-theoretic topology is a branch of topology in which set- theoretic
techniques are used to solve problems about abstract spaces. In it, special
axioms (such as Godel's Axiom of Constructibility, Martin's Axiom, the covering
Lemma, and the Product Measure Extension Axiom), forcing techniques, and other
set-theoretic tools are used to clarify, and often solve, long- outstanding
problems, and through consistency results to isolate and identify topological
properties worthy of study. The principal investigator will continue his
research in this branch, centered on four areas where recent results have
greatly enhanced our understanding of the spaces in question and, in some cases,
the set-theoretic tools themselves. The spaces in question are various classes
of countably compact spaces; Frechet chain net spaces; nonmetrizable manifolds;
and countably metacompact spaces. Such studies will probably have less immediate
application than more geometric topological studies but in the long run can be
expected to influence our ideas about space and even about the nature of proof.
