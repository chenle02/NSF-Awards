9510694 Sussman The award will support the continued operation and further
development of the Protein DataBank (PDB), a unique international database of
three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules at atomic resolution.
The staff of the database are located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The
goals of the project are to provide an easily accessible, user friendly resource
of service to an international community of researchers including
crystallographers, theoreticians, modelers and other investigators who are
interested in such structures. The PDB will continue efforts to facilitate
deposition and retrieval of entries, and will emphasize use of newer database
methodologies for storage and access. Use of the World Wide Web will play a key
role in these efforts. In addition, the database will cooperate closely with
databases at Rutgers University and at the European Bioinformatics Institute, as
well as with a number of secondary distributors within the U.S. and in other
countries. The study of structure and function of biological macromolecules at
the atomic level is one of the most technically challenging and intellectually
demanding areas of modern biology, and is a central aspect of the new
biotechnology industry. The structures of nearly 4000 macromolecules have now
been determined and deposited in the PDB. The role of the PDB in making these
structures available to researchers with diverse interests through the internet
and other means of distribution is critical to the advancement of both basic and
applied biology. Additional support for the PDB is provided through separate
actions by the Office of Health and Energy Research of the Department of Energy
and by the National Library of Medicine and National Institute of General
Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, pursuant to a Memorandum
of Understanding between these agencies and the National Science Foundation. ***
