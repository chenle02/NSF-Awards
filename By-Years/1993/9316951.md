9316951 Mattinson This award provides one-half the funding needed to modernize a
thermal ionization source mass spectrometer operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The
institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
project. The research projects necessitating the upgrade include geochronology
of very small samples using uranium-lead isotopes, tracer studies of mantle
processes, and uranium disequilibrium dating studies of marine carbonate
materials. The upgrades to the instrument will enhance its ability to analyze
very small amounts of samples, a basic requirement of the research. ***
