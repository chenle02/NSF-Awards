This project enables high school physics teachers, community college physics
professors and 4-year college/university professors to participate in the third
U.S./Japan/China Conference on Physics Education. The conference is scheduled
for July 26-30, 1993 in Zhaoqing, Qixinghu, China. The theme of the conference
is curriculum reform in physics. The work of the conference will be done by
seven working groups with balanced membership from the three countries. In the
United States, dissemination of conference recommendations derived from working
group reports is facilitated by the American Associations of Physics Teachers,
the submitting agency, in their journals and at their national and state
meetings. This conference is the third in a series of three such tri-partite
conferences on physics education.
