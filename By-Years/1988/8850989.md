The University of California, Berkeley, will provide a month- long
interdisciplinary institute design to provide scientific and technological
background and laboratory techniques. Fifty middle school teachers each year
(for three years) will have this opportunity to increase their subject-matter
competence, as well as to broaden their ability to conduct laboratory
activities. The program includes lectures by teaching - award winning science
faculty and specially designed laboratory activities led by outstanding
intermediate and secondary teachers. In addition, computer software review,
laboratory visits, and field trips will be conducted. The University will
contribute in cost-sharing to this project an amount equivalent to 28.9% of the
NSF funds.
