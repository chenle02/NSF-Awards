This project is providing critical financial support to approximately 20 young
women who have shown promise in their first year studies, specifically in the
College's gateway courses in Biology. Ten returning sophomores are then selected
in each of two consecutive years to become BioScholars. These students are
enrolled in an Honors Colloquium in Biology and in workshops to assist them to
obtain scientific internships, admission to graduate school, and/or employment
in one of the life sciences. In addition, a Biology tutor has been hired in the
College's Learning Resource Center to provide support for students in the
program. Each participant receives a scholarship to help close the gap between
their existing aid and the cost of attendance. This award is adjusted annually
and follows each Bioscholar through to graduation as long as need and
eligibility continue. In addition, other science students at the College may
participate in certain activities within the program on a space available basis,
increasing the impact of BioScholars.
