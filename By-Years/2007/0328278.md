The PIs will investigate submarine edifice-collapse deposits off the coast of
New Britain and related tsunami deposits. The PIs propose to map, date and
characterize offshore debris deposits and coastal tsunami deposits in the
volcanic arc and to use these data to model collapse-generated tsunamis. Edifice
collapse has been shown to have been a frequent occurrence in Papua New Guinea,
including the well-documented 1888 event at Ritter Island. Knowledge gained
could ultimately lead to prediction of coastal impacts from future events in
similar tectonic areas.&lt;br/&gt;
