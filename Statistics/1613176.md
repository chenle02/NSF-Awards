The Fifth Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics will be held on the
campus of Georgia State University, Atlanta, May 5-7, 2017. The objective of the
workshop is to reflect new developments in the frontiers of biostatistics and
bioinformatics. The conference will cover a broad range of current research
topics, including high-dimensional and big data analysis, high-throughput
genomics data analysis, survival analysis, and empirical likelihood methods. The
invited speakers will include leading experts and outstanding junior
researchers. The workshop will provide opportunities for the exchange of new
ideas and genesis of research collaborations. Graduate students and postdocs
will gain valuable research experience by attending the workshop and making
poster presentations.

This award supports the participation of approximately 12 graduate students and
junior faculty. The conference organizers are making special efforts to provide
travel support for a diverse group of researchers to attend the workshop.
Participants from underrepresented groups are encouraged to attend and apply for
travel support. For detailed information, please visit the website:
