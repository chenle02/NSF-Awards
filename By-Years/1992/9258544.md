Research underway includes studies of a variety of surface processes with
modern surface science techniques. Surface chemistry on technologically
important aluminide surfaces (i.e. TiAl, FeAl, CoAl, and NiAl) will be
investigated. Also, reactions of hyperthermal (1-10 eV) ions on solid surfaces,
including the aluminides, will be researched. Finally, research is planned that
uses tunable synchrotron light to synthesize epitaxial dielectric thin films
(e.g. BN and AlN) on a variety of ordered substrates, from condensed layers of
molecular precursors at cryogenic temperatures.
