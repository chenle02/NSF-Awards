Traditional models and paradigms of the upper ocean vertical stratification rely
on dynamics that take place in only the vertical dimension. Atmospheric forcing
and turbulent processes create a "mixed layer" in the uppermost surface of the
ocean. However, recent measurements in the North Pacific indicate that the water
may have horizontal gradients of temperature and salinity and these may "slump"
over. This project will conduct field work to examine the "slumping" process to
determine how it plays a role in establishing the vertical stratification of the
mixed layer. They will make measurements of temperature and salinity profiles at
one location and will use the ship to sample a grid to capture three dimensional
structures of temperature and salinity. Their goals are to observe the evolution
of the slumping process and to obtain estimates of the forcing and dissipative
terms which drive the slumping and to determine the horizontal length scales of
the slumping which will give an indication of the physical processes that halt
the slumping process. They will also investigate whether the size of the density
contrasts depends on the larger-scale mean density gradient and this will
determine whether the density contrasts can be predicted by combining combining
one-dimensional dynamics and larger scale gradients. The datasets will be
suitable for testing others' models of the three-dimensional mixed layer.
