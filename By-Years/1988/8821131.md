In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Muenter will study the radio frequency, microwave and infrared spectroscopy of
weakly bound clusters. The study will lead to a better understanding of the
intermolecular forces which play a role in many aspects of chemistry such as
molecular conformations, solvent-solute interactions and transport properties.
Minima of the intermolecular potential energy surfaces of cluster molecules will
be determined by using high-resolution spectroscopy. Vibrational frequency
shifts will provide the change in complex stability when a monomer mode is
excited, while Stark effect measurements will provide a quantitative measure of
mutual polarization of molecular charge distributions. The project will obtain
radio frequency and microwave results from molecular beam resonance data.
