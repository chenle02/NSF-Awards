Advanced microscopy techniques will be incorporated into the microbiology
laboratory curriculum. A scanning electron microscope, critical point dryer, and
sputter coater will implement improvements in the Microtechnique and Electron
Microscopy course. They will allow the students to receive up-to-date
instruction in methods of specimen preparation and SEM operation as well as
first hand knowledge about biological fine structure. The SEM will also be used
to demonstrate relevant biological structures to students in other classes. A
photomicroscope will allow students in Microtechnique and Electron Microscopy to
receive instruction in photomicrography and Independent Research students to
record data for presentation. Phase contrast, epifluorescence, and interference
microscopes will be used by students in Aquatic Microbial Ecology, Bacterial
Diversity, Bacterial Physiology, and Pathogenic Bacteriology to identify,
observe and characterize microorganisms, their structures, and activities. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
