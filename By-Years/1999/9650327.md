Two critical issues that dominate planning, growth, and success of the chemical
manufacturing industry are product quality and the environment. Traditional
undergraduate chemical engineering education emphasizes fundamentals, but
consideration of the over-reaching manufacturing issues of product quality and
environmentally conscious chemical manufacturing has not been integrated into
the curriculum. This project provides an interrelated series of experiments
centered upon manufacturing and evaluating the quality of a familiar chemical
product, namely poly(methyl methacrylate). These experiments can be incorporated
into a 2-semester unit operations laboratory sequence. This project continues to
employ the existing, highly successful paradigm of teaching science and
engineering fundamentals. At the same time, it allows for the integration of the
principles of product quality and environmental accountability into the
laboratory. Furthermore, this project improves several other required and
elective lecture courses, as short teaching modules based on the experiments can
be disseminated into those courses, providing continual reinforcement of the
fundamentals of chemical manufacturing throughout several semesters of
undergraduate education. This project is located in the Department of Chemical
Engineering but can affect other disciplines, most notably Mechanical
Engineering, by offering elements of these experiments and the teaching modules
through interdisciplinary electives and the South Carolina Honors College.
