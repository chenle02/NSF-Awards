Psychologists study human beings to understand the causes of behavior and the
circumstances under which specific behaviors maybe predicted. For their studies
psychologists use a variety of assessment techniques, including interviews,
observations, and objective and projective testing. The project would establish
a research laboratory to enable introductory-level and advanced students to
learn about some of the techniques used by psychologists to understand behavior
and assess personality. With the establishment of the laboratory, students would
be able to participate in research as subjects and to conduct research
themselves. This "hands-on" learning experience is expected to enhance student
knowledge of personality assessment and correlational and experimental research
methodology, as well as to increase their statistical and computer programming
skills.
