Many infrastructure challenges of national interest such as building integrity
need new technology breakthroughs on the small ubiquitous sensors, operated in
the passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) manner. This technology will
cause great impact to embedded biomedical sensors as well. We propose such a
microsystem that is composed of a broadband directional antenna and a nonlinear
transmission line (NLTL) with application-specific sensing capacitors as the
segment varactors. External inquisitive signal is received by the antenna and
travels forth and back on NLTL with harmonic generation and phase-shift coding
by the sensing capacitors. The output signal is transmitted in the harmonic
frequency to avoid self jamming in the current RFID technology, which can
significantly increase the bit rate of this miniaturized passive system. Two
model systems with foot prints less than 20mm will be demonstrated: an acidity
sensor for structural health monitoring and an embedded sensor for intra-ocular
pressure (IOP) on hard contact lens. The design of the micro sensor system will
be used as a lower-level undergraduate curriculum module to show that
engineering directly touches people?s life. The misconception of society
irrelevance of engineering has turned away many brilliant female and minority
students from physical electronics careers.
