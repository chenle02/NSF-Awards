This is an award to support research, the objective of which is to continue
developing a mathematical model of leakage through clay cover "liners" used to
cap land fills for hazardous wastes, to verify the model at laboratory scale and
by data collected from a field-scale compacted clay liner. The model being
developed in this research, which is a renewal of work conducted under NSF Grant
No.
