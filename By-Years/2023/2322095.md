The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a
groundbreaking technology that uses microbiologicals to increase crop yield
while reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. By reducing the environmental
impact of fertilizers, this technology has the potential to revolutionize
sustainable agriculture and improve human health. The technology seeks to
address the global need for more food to be grown with fewer resources, lower
costs, and fewer environmental impacts. The goal of the project is to meet this
need through entrepreneurial training to determine customer demand for the
technology.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a microbiological technology
that can be applied to soil during planting to promote plant growth while
reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. The microbiological technology
seeks to overcome functional problems that plague the crop probiotic industry,
and its innovation is expected to consistently increase crop yield while
offsetting the monetary and environmental costs of synthetic fertilizers. This
technology could be used to improve human health through the reduction of
ecosystem, waterway, and air pollution caused by synthetic fertilizers. By
creating high-paying jobs and fostering a more educated workforce, the
technology is expected to spur innovation and solve more problems in the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
