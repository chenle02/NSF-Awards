For various superconducting single crystals and polycrystals (including those of
high-Tc compounds), the magnetization will be measured as a two-dimensional
vector as the sample is rotated in a fixed magnetic field. These measurements
seperate the diamagnetic shielding component of the magnetization, leaving the
penetrating vortex-flux magnetization, whose frictional rotational behavior is
related to vortex pinning forces that govern the critical current in these
materials. The viscous response of the penetrating vortex-flux magnetization
will also be investigated. For the single cystals, the measured anisotropy on
the rotational magnetic properties will provide a full characterization of the
unusual modes of vortex-flux behavior (including cross-flux effects) previously
found in these studies. %%% The magnetic polarization of various superconducting
materials (including those of high critical temperatures) will be measured as
they are rotated in a magnetic field of different strengths. The frictional
magnetic forces determined by these measurements are directly related to the
maximum electic current that the materials can carry without losing their
superconductivity. This information is needed to asses the technical potential
for applications of these materials.
