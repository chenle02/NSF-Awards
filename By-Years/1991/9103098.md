The objectives of this research activity are, firstly, to develop some very
general, all purpose, algorithms to help study groups given by generators and
defining relations; secondly, to compile computer-generated libraries of
examples, references and the like, pertaining to the general subject
Combinatorial Group Theory; and thirdly to provide a vehicle for the
dissemination of new results and advances in the field. In the main, the program
that will be developed will be designed to provide information about a wide
variety of properties of groups. Combinatorial Group Theory is an important in
abstract algebra, and with close connections to topology, logic and wide variety
of other disciplines as well. Its study leads to a deeper understanding of
structures underlying many aspects of science.
