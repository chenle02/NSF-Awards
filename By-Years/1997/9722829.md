Lay Abstract PI: Ramirez, Julio J. Proposal Number: IBN-9722829 Two areas of the
brain that are very important for learning and memory are the hippocampus and
the entorhinal cortex. When the hippocampus is deprived of its connections with
the entorhinal cortex, for example as a result of injury to the brain, memory
functions become impaired but recover within two weeks after the injury. After
injury, remaining areas of the entorhinal cortex and other brain areas grow new
connections to the hippocampus. This project examines how these new connections
work together to mediate compensatory changes in the brain and to promote the
recovery of memory functions. The project clarifies how different brain regions
involved in learning and memory work together and how they interact following
damage to compensate for that damage. In addition to these specific
contributions, the project provides fundamental information about the capacity
of brain structures to reorganize and how such reorganization leads to changes
in function.
