This proposal addresses several basic issues of the colloidal stability in non-
aqueous media: the effect of water content in the presence of a surfactant,
modeling of flocculation induced by water, measurements on the stabilizing
effect of surfactants, and the correlation between the green body microstructure
and suspension stability. For this purpose, measurements of physicochemical
properties, such as adsorption and zeta potential, will be performed. The
molecular conformation at the solid-liquid interface will be investigated using
Electron Spin Resonance and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods. The research has
applications in ceramic and tape processing, inks, paints, and in other energy
and environment related processes.*** //
