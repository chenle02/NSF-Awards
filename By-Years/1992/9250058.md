The Virginia Quality Education in Science and Technology (V- QUEST) will extend
two major state efforts already underway, the department of education's "World
Class Education", an ambitious ten-year plan to define learning outcomes for all
students and "Workforce 2000", a blue-ribbon panel report to the governor that
calls for a scientific and technologically literate citizenry. The project will
focus on improving mathematics and science education in grades K - 8. Virginia
conducted an extensive needs assessment and from this developed the seven
components of V-QUEST: 1. Creating a school-based mathematics and science lead
teachers initiative; 2. Developing new preservice and inservice models for
teachers; 3. Tying selection criteria for instructional materials and assessment
reform to the effort; 4. Developing a leadership component for school and
district administrators; 5. Conducting a community action campaign; 6.
Supporting mathematics and science education through the state's
telecommunications system (V-PEN); and 7. Improving student assessment. The PI
will work with seven component coordinators, a State Action Council, and ten
Local Action Councils to create a management structure that links content
(through the components) with a process (State and Local Action Councils) for
local involvement.
