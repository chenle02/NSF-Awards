TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on "Macromolecular Materials: From Synthesis to Applications" offers a
comprehensive polymer program covering advances in macromolecular synthesis,
biomolecular materials, theory and simulation, characterization, rheology,
processing, nanomaterials and materials uses. These topics will be covered by
twenty-two experts including representatives of underrepresented minorities. The
conference offers a comprehensive opportunity for the exchange and cross-
fertilization of ideas among both academic and industrial polymer scientists and
engineers. The main program will be preceded the weekend before by a Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) organized and run by post-docs and graduate students, at
which they will present and discuss their work with their peers and benefit from
a Panel discussion with experts. The postdocs and graduate students will
subsequently attend the main conference.
