The research is in four areas of IC design theory: floor-planning, global
routing, wirability theory, and point dominance. In floor- planning a
generalized version of the module placement problem, where the modules can
assume any shape is being developed. For global routing, a generalization of
sequential methods to a method, which can handle all nets in 2-D (and higher
dimension) arrays simultaneously, is under investigation. A layout model that
generalizes the Lipski- Preparata wirability model to include 2 and 3 layer net
routing and includes more detail is being analyzed. Point dominance is a new
area which builds on and integrates results in graph theory relating to layout
problems. Questions about k-chains and circular k-chains are being addressed.
