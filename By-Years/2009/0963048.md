This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project renovates space for marine
science that is no longer adequate for research needs in the Galbraith Marine
Science Laboratory at Eckerd College. Eckerd College is an undergraduate
institution that is widely considered as an important engine for educating and
training undergraduates who continue to graduate school in the marine sciences.
Improvements to institutional infrastructure include upgrading the electrical
and lighting, lab facilities, HVAC, and laboratory security. It will also
provide better generator/battery back-up, which is important for laboratories in
locations prone to hurricanes or other severe weather events. These improvements
will impact laboratories that carry out important research in scientific imaging
and neurophysiology, molecular biology and biogeochemistry, research computing,
marine ecology, and sedimentology. It will also provide upgrades to the seawater
and core processing labs. Institutional research programs that will be impacted
include those that involve the geologic development of coastal and shallow
marine systems impacted by human activities, the development of sensory systems
of marine organisms, bottlenose dolphin ecology and adaptation, marine genetics,
mangrove ecology, and how seawater temperature and salinity have changed over
time. Broader impacts consist of improving research training of large numbers of
undergraduates, many of whom go on to get advanced degrees, increasing
infrastructure for science, and improving research performance on awards not
only from NSF but from other Federal agencies.
