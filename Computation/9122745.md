A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit ordinary differential
equation of the form F(y,y,u(t),t)=0 where y(t) is a vector valued function, the
Jacobian F y is a singular matrix, and u(t) is a vector valued function of
source or control terms. Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a
DAE. They arise, for example, in a variety of control problems in flight
control, robotics, chemical process control, and contact or constrained problems
in mechanics. In addition, differential algebraic equations occur in the
solution of partial differential equations by the method of lines and in many
circuit models. DAEs are sometimes also called singular or descriptor systems.
The long range goal of the proposed research is for scientists and engineers to
be able to work directly with the original implicit model thus reducing design
and simulation time as well as facilitating the consideration of more complex
problems. Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require special problem
structure and do not handle many problems of interest. This project will develop
a general numerical method for nonlinear differential algebraic equations. These
results will also be of interest when explicit models exist, but the sparsity,
nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the equations, make the original
implicit system preferable to a lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to
compute local) explicit system.
