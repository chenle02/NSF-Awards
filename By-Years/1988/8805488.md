This grant will help defray travel expenses for international participants and
graduate students from North American universities planning to attend Geological
Society of America Penrose Conference on "Volcanic Influences on Terrestrial
Sedimentation". The conference is to be held in late August- early September at
the Crystal Mountain Resort in Washington. Three general themes of the
conference are: 1) What processes transport and deposit coarse'grained
volcaniclastic sediment? 2) What features characterize synvolcanic
sedimentation? and 3) What is the role of terrestrial sedfimentology in
evaluating the tectonic and volcanic evolution of continental volcanic centers.
This award will make it possible for both students and distinguished foreigners
to attend who would otherwise be unable to.
