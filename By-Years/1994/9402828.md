9402828 Coco This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Wayne M. Coco to work with Dr. Hans-Joachim Knackmuss at the
University of Stuttgart on the in-vivo mapping of alternative DNA slippage
structures. The program will also support a year of re-entry so Dr. Coco can
continue his research at Yale University with Dr. L. N. Ornston. In some of the
most complex structures now predicted, one can assign hybridization pairings to
nearly every stretch of DNA looped away from its normal Watson and Crick pairing
strand position. Such structures are thought to act by simultaneously bringing
into proximity a large number of motifs. This either allows simultaneous repair
at several loci or stabilizes the slippage structure, which increases the time
repair mechanisms have to act on any given motif pair. The aim of this research
is to map in vivo the DNA slippage structures in pcaD. If successful, the
planned experiments would give the first in vivo mapping of DNA strand slippage
and increase current understanding of the evolution and maintenance of pcaD,
catD and of other genes predicted to undergo slippage events. ***
