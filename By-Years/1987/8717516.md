Dr. James Kimbrough of the University of Florida will continue his electron-
microscopic studies of fungi of the orders Pezizales and Tuberales in order to
improve recognition of the genera and families constituting these orders and to
begin determining the evolutionary lineages among these saprobic and mycorrhizal
organisms. Tuberales includes the well-known edible truffles, species of which
have evolved a subterranean existence through a mycorrhizal attachment to the
roots of host trees. Dr. Kimbrough's fine-scale analysis of developmental and
microchemical features of the spore-discharge apparatus of these fungi is
providing data showing the phylogenetic linkage of these subterranean organisms
to better-known aboveground cup-fungi. His work will test theories about the
evolution of hypogeous (belowground) truffle taxa from the more numerous
epigeous (aboveground) taxa of Pezizales, particularly the likelihood that
several parallel occurrences of this peculiar subterranean mode of life have
evolved among ascomycete fungi.
