Peter Lykos and Russ Bonham are supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform experimental meaurements of pair-correlation
functions of atoms and molecules at the Advanced Light Source at Argonne
National Laboratory. Their collaborative effort will also include a theoretical
treatment to extract from the observed pair-correlation functions the electron-
electron repulsive potential energies. This latter quantity is a sensitive
measure of electron correlation, and thus this research will provide a set of
benchmarks against which new quantum chemical electron correlation treatments
and basis sets can be tested. At the core of all quantum chemistry computations
are the twin choices of basis set and electron correlation method. With the
remarkable increase in computational power in the last decade, calculated total
energies of atoms and molecules approach those obtained experimentally. To
further improve our understanding of basis set design and approximate
correlation techniques in quantum chemistry, more precise benchmarks are
necessary.
