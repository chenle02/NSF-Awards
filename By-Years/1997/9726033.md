Rapid expansion of wireless communication services during the last decade is
expected to continue at an even faster pace in the future. This growth creates a
demand for novel modulation, coding, and detection methods suitable for the
rapidly varying multipath fading channels encountered in mobile radio. We
propose to investigate a new approach to the estimation and prediction of the
fading channel which does not rely on statistical characterization. In this
method, the physical nature of the flat fading signal is exploited to yield a
deterministic model that predicts the channel for an entire block of data.
Specifically, the mobile radio signal is decomposed into several scattered
components distinguished by their Doppler shifts; the slowly varying parameters
associated with these components are determined and tracked, and the composite
fading signal is predicted. This approach may potentially result in the ability
to anticipate and compensate for the "deep fades that severely limit the
performance of wireless communication systems and will aid in the development of
low-power mobile radio systems.
