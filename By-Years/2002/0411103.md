With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the
Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP),
Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) will implement the project Improving
Research and Technology Experiences of Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics Undergraduates. The overall goal of project is an increase in the
production of well-prepared, competitively trained minority graduates who enter
the workforce or pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines. The target
population will be faculty and students within the Departments of Mathematics,
Computer and Information Sciences (MCIS) and Natural Science and Environmental
Health (NSEH). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of project: The project will
integrate significant research activities into the education of STEM majors who
can adequately compete with students from large research universities. Students
will participate in conferences and research activites that are not normally
available to MVSU students. The project will also significantly enhance the
infrastructure for research and education of MVSU through faculty development
efforts, which are the key to sustaining the long-term production of highly
trained minority STEM graduates. The results of the project will be disseminated
through oral presentations at both national and local conferences, articles in
research journals, and web distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit of the project: The project will address the low pass rate of gatekeeper
courses including calculus, chemistry and physics. Strategies to improve this
rate include: 1) Reforming the gatekeeper courses for STEM disciplines, 2)
Motivating faculty to integrate research into the teaching of STEM disciplines,
3) Providing in-school tutoring for 1st and 2nd year STEM students, and 4)
Providing opportunities for faculty development and in the use of the latest
scientific technology. The project will also update the MVSU STEM program
offerings by helping to bring a new Bioinformatics major online.
