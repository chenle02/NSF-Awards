Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a major immunoregulatory molecule in mammals, and it
has a critical role in defense mechanisms against a variety of environmental
insults. "Tumor necrosis factor" (TNF) is another macrophage-derived cytokine
whose activities are very similar to those of IL-1. The great importance of
these proteins in self defense suggests that they may have been conserved
through evolution. Results from this laboratory suggest that IL-1 is found in
the echinoderms and protochordates. The major goals of the proposed research are
to define the amino acid sequence and corresponding DNA sequence for
invertebrate IL-1, to trace the emergence of the cells responsible for its
production and release, and to characterize the functions of this mediators in
the invertebrates. The invertebrate homolog of TNF will also be sought and
studied in parallel with IL-1. The discovery of a homolog of the
immunoregulatory molecule, IL- 1, in the starfish strongly suggests that
chemical signaling molecules are important in defense mechanisms of organisms at
all levels of complexity. This research will provide new information on the
mechanisms of self defense in invertebrates. In addition to its intrinsic
interest, however, information on the function of this immunoregulatory molecule
in invertebrates may provide new insights into the mechanism of its multiple
actions in higher animals.
