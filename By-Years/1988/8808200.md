David Drake will conduct research into combinatorial problems in geometry. The
motivating problem for this work is the long standing conjecture that there are
no finite projective planes of non-prime order. Numerous composite orders are
well known not to be possible orders but the question remains open even for
relatively small numbers such as 10, 12 and 15. Drake will employ computational
techniques to make progress with some of these questions. He will investigate
the possibility of embedding into finite projective planes certain linear
spaces. The objective is to make these embeddings as tight as possible in the
sense of minimizing the order of the containing plane. The tightest possible
situation would yield planes of non-prime order. In other situations important
information in extremal set theory should be forthcoming.
