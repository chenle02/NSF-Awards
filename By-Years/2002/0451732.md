This proposal requests grant funding for a small-scale, exploratory study
designed to develop new analytic tools for examining the relationship between
strategies for systemic reform of urban educational practices and student
achievement. The research outlined in this proposal builds upon work that Westat
has been performing for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Systemic
Initiative (SI) programs over the past 8 years. Specifically, Westat proposes to
collect trend data that can be used to characterize the range of activities that
have received support under the various Urban Systemic Initiative projects.
Westat also plans to conduct case studies and other analyses to explore the
relationship between specific educational reform practices and student
achievement. Specifically, the proposed research represents a venture into
emerging and potentially transformative research ideas, as well as application
of new approaches to an established research topic i.e., the exploration of new
methods for assessing the link between educational reform and student
performance on accountability assessments.
