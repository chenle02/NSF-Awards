This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of a matrix assisted, laser
desorption ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) for
use in research and training. The major use of such instruments is in
determination of the mass of molecules, with accuracy of one-hundredth of an
atomic weight. The instrument will be placed in a common facility where it is
expected to enable research in a varied areas of biology, including studies of
plant drought tolerance and selection of new plant variants, and the
bioremediation of brown-earth sites. Other projects expected to make use of the
instrument include studies of human proteins involved in cholesterol tolerance,
and phylogenetic analysis of genetic diversity among relatively ancient animals,
such as sharks, and primitive plants such as mosses, liverworts and hornworts.
In addition, the instrument will be used to enhance research training for over
60 undergraduates involved in the Institution's Research Experiences for
Undergraduates and Undergraduate Workship programs, as well as being used in
training of graduate and postgraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
