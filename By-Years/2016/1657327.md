The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
gas sensing for chemical and environmental monitoring, food safety, and
antiterrorism capabilities. The global gas sensor market is estimated to be
about $20 billion, while the subset of the nanosensor segment is only $13.1
million in 2014. The small market size is partially attributed to the lack of
feasible manufacturing techniques that allow the utilization of novel
nanomaterials for sensor applications. The complexity and the cost have
prevented rapid growth of domestic nanosensor market despite tremendous progress
in nanomaterials research and development. This technology may reduce the cost
and complexity of manufacturing of nanowire sensors and could potentially propel
significant growth of the nanosensor market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project pursues a gas sensor manufacturing technology, which is compatible with
current microelectronics. It relies on a solution crystallization process that
places nanowires directly and precisely on chips. The technology stems from a
discovery when organic crystalline compounds were mixed with nanoparticles,
nanowires nucleated on nanoparticles upon solvent evaporation. The nanowire
sensor has been tested against a number of gases to obtain sensor performance
data. In current competing technologies, nanowires need to be aligned and placed
at precise locations and orientations on the patterned substrates, a complex
process to scale up. This method synthesizes organic nanowires directly on the
metal substrates by using the substrate pattern as nucleation points for the
nanowire growth and orientation.
