Abstract

Award: DMS-0456590 Principal Investigator: Bo'az B. Klartag

This project explores several challenging directions in the study of high
dimensional convex bodies. The unifying theme of the project is that high
dimensionality, when viewed correctly, may entail simplicity and order, rather
than enormous diversity which is impossible to control, the so-called ``curse of
dimensionality''. In particular, the PI will address the fundamental questions
regarding distribution of mass in high dimensions, the typical shape of lower-
dimensional sections of a given convex set, and the interplay between convex-
geometric inequalities and functional inequalities, mostly in the category of
logarithmically concave functions. While classical convexity focuses on fine
properties of bodies or shapes in a fixed dimension, in the asymptotic theory
one views the dimension as being finite, yet tending to infinity. We aim at
bridging between these two disciplines, both by applying classical tools to the
study of asymptotic questions, and by drawing corollaries of a classical flavor
from asymptotic results. These corollaries are often of an almost-isometric
nature, not only isomorphic.

The study of high dimensional objects is common to various scientific
disciplines, including statistical mechanics, the theory of machine learning and
asymptotic combinatorics, to name a few. Connections between these areas and
asymptotic convex geometry have already begun to emerge. A better understanding
of the high dimensional phenomena from the geometric viewpoint has the potential
to contribute to the development of the aforementioned fields and to others
