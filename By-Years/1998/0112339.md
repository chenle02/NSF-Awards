This grant provides partial support to the Department of Earth and Planetary
Sciences at the University of New Mexico (UNM) for the acquisition of a new
electron microprobe (EMP) for petrologic and cosmochemical research. A companion
proposal submitted concurrently to NASA's Cosmochemistry program will also be
funded and together with UNM matching funds, will allow the department to
purchase a state-of-the-art EMP with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers
and light element analytical capabilities. The new EMP will replace an aging
JEOL 733 Superprobe (vintage '83) and will be maintained within the Electron
Microbeam Analysis Facility at UNM which also houses a modern SEM and TEM and is
staffed by a full time research associate with expertise in electron microscopy.
The instrument will support a wide range of research programs within the
department and in collaboration with nearby scientists from Sandia National
Laboratory including petrologic studies of high pressure mantle phases,
investigations of the Precambrian tectonics of the southwest U.S., low
temperature geochemistry and petrologic investigations of meteorites. The
instrument will also support a large and active graduate student population. ***
