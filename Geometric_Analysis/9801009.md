Abstract Schwarz

The main goal of this project is to apply methods of modern mathematics to
problems arising in theoretical physics. Many of problems are related to
M-theory. This theory can be considered as an extension of string theory. It is
believed that M-theory describes all interactions existing in nature. It was
conjectured recently that M-theory can be formulated as a matrix model, called
M(atrix) theory. It is clear in this approach that the geometry of physical
space is non-commutative in some sense, and so it is natural to apply methods of
non-commutative geometry. This idea was used in the formulation of some projects
as well as in our recent work concerning toroidal compactifications of M(atrix)
theory. Most of the other problems are related to applications of super-geometry
to various problems of quantum field theory, including general problems of
quantization of gauge theories and topological quantum field theory.

This multidisciplinary research is jointly funded by the Division of
Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activity of the Director of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.
