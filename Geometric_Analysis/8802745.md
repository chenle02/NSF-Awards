This project will yield basic knowledge of Liouville theorems and regularity of
p-minimizing maps into p-superstrongly unstable manifolds. Much of the proposed
work is ongoing research that continues or extends previous individual work
(e.g. regularity of minimizing harmonic maps in to super-strongly unstable
manifolds) and joint work of the investigators. It draws on techniques from
several areas, including differential geometry, partial differential equations,
geometric measure theory, topology and calculus of variations. Dr. S. Walter Wei
will work on geometric aspects of nonlinear elliptic systems and the regularity
of minimizers; Dr. Chi-Ming Yau will work on Function theoretic properties of
Riemannian manifolds. In joint projects, Wei and Yau will continue to study the
average variational method from an extrinsic view point as an approach to
confront and resolve problems in global nonlinear analysis and geometry.
