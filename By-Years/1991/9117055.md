This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Implications of Contemporary Behavioral Research on
Language Pragmatics and Derived Stimulus Relations. The co-organizers of the
seminar, which will be held July 13-18, 1992 in Yamanishi, Japan, are Professors
Steven Hayes and Linda Hayes, both of the Department of Psychology, University
of Nevada, and Professor Masaya Sato, Department of Psychology, Keio University,
Tokyo. Researchers in both the United States and Japan have made major
contributions to the growing literature on the impact of these research
developments on behavioral approaches to the analysis of complex human behavior
more generally. This U.S.-Japan seminar will be the first conference to examine
the topic. Participants will consider the implications of these new research
findings for the analysis of such topics as problem solving, reasoning, choice,
self-control, lying, superstition, and imagining. Japanese psychological
scientists have long had a particular interest in complex human behavior, and
they are especially sensitive to the theoretical implications of these research
developments. There is, in addition, a great deal of innovative work on
artificial language in primates going on at the Institute of Primate Research at
Kyoto University. This work bears on the distinction between human and animal
language of considerable interest to U.S. researchers. Conversely, much of the
basic behavioral research literature is published by researchers in the United
States. By bringing together notable researchers from both countries, the
seminar should encourage better coordinated efforts and collaborative research.
