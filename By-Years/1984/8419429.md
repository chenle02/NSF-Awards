This action is concerned with the transfer of a project on the
robuststabilization problem supported under NSF grant ECS-8311290 from the
University of Rochester to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In particular,
robustness bounds have been developed for systems with uncertainties in the
parameters when these systems are controlled using an observer (a construct
which allows the estimation of the system states when they are not all directly
measurable). Norm bounds on the parameter variations have been developed which,
whensatisfied lead to stability of the overall system. In addition, conditions
have been developed which allow the extension of the classical separation
theorem to systems with uncertainties in the parameters and controls which are
certain nonlinear functions of the state estimates.
