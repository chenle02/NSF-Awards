This project is part of a series of National Research Council studies that seek
to develop the scientific goals for fields of physics and astronomy for the next
decade and beyond. The focus of this project is nuclear physics research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, new U.S. initiatives in nuclear
physics have been successful not only in expanding the understanding of basic
nuclear science, but also in translating that understanding into applications
with enormous societal impact. Representative samplings of the areas that have
been advanced in the last ten years are successes in probing the quark structure
of the nucleus, in investigating the physics of quark-gluon plasma and in
studying nuclei near the limits of stability. Applications now range from
isotope production for medical use and material analysis techniques to energy
production and the finding of solutions for nuclear forensics and defense-
related problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this study is to develop a
strategy that can serve as a framework for the field through 2020 and beyond.
This strategy not only will build on recent successes in the field, but also
will evaluate how to take advantage of potential international collaborations.
There are a number of international efforts either underway or in development,
and an important part of this project will be to have the U.S. nuclear physics
research communities determine how best to advance the science in this field,
whether it be through collaboration in these international projects or the
development of additional facilities that will help address the many as-yet
unresolved questions in this field.
