9506371 Birkeland This project will conduct mapping and trenching studies of
antislope bedrock scarps on the arests and flanks of mountain ridges, to find
diagnostic criteria to distinguish between seismic and non-seismic origins of
these features. The origins of antislope scarps are presently disputed and this
project will test the hypothesis that creep-generated scarps display folded
stratigraphy whereas earthquake-generated scarps display colluvial wedge
stratigraphy with subsidiary fractures. Field work will analyze bedrock scarps
of known seismic and known non-seismic origin. The results of this work will
provide significant new information about the seismic hazard potential of
antislope scarps in actively deforming tectonic regions.
