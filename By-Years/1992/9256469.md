This award to a group of 21 Faculty in the Department of Plant Biology provides
5 positions graduate students who will participate in an existing training
program in Plant Science. The program emphasizes fundamental and often unique
aspects of plant processes including photosynthetic mechanisms, aspects of
meiosis, and the regulation of growth and development. Most of these faculty are
participants in an existing NSF Biological Research Center for Plant
Development. The training program also includes a required course in pedagogy
and two semesters of experience as a teaching assistant. This includes funds to
permit student participation in meetings and summer courses, and purchase of
materials and supplies for student research.
