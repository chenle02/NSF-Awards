The emergence of affordable, high performance networking technology like
InfiniBand is fueling the growth of high-end computing (HEC) systems. However,
there are no schemes in these systems to provide a minimal Quality of Service
(QoS) for the execution of parallel jobs by taking network-level contention into
account. InfiniBand provides feature-rich QoS mechanisms. The research focuses
on the following novel research directions: 1) How to take advantage of
InfiniBand QoS mechanisms to design a QoS-aware MPI library? 2) How to take
advantage of these mechanisms to design a QoS-aware parallel file system? 3) How
to dynamically provide QoS by monitoring network traffic and making adjustments
to virtual lane arbitration at InfiniBand's switch and adapter hardware? 4) How
to design and establish job priority guidelines with the proposed QoS framework?
and 5) What kind of performance, scalability, efficiency and productivity
benefits can be achieved by this proposed QoS framework with petascale
applications? The transformative impact of the research enables next generation
InfiniBand clusters and applications to be QoS-aware and highly efficient in
addition to delivering performance and scalability. The research has significant
impact on the design, deployment, and utilization of next generation ultra-scale
systems with QoS support.
