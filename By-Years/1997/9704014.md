Whitlow 9704014 This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Larry Whitlow at the
Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Whitlow will work with Dr.
Toshitaka Ohta, Director of the Fundamental Energy Research Section, on a
research project entitled, "Transport Theory of Thermoelectric Superlattices."
This theoretical research project is directed toward the design of new high-
efficiency thermoelectric materials. In particular, the researchers will study
the use of superlattice structures to enhance the thermoelectric power factor of
semiconductors. Superlattice structures are expected to influence the charge-
carrier energy spectrum through changes in the defined density of states and
carrier interactions. The proposed research will offer substantial and
innovative insight into the connection between structure and function in
thermoelectric semiconductors and will give important guidance to ongoing
international experiments in superlattice construction. The main goal of the
research is to increase the over-all efficiency of current thermal- energy
sources and develop alternative high-energy thermoelectric systems required for
refrigeration and energy conversion devices. ***
