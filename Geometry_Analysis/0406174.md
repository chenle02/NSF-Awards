Abstract

Award: DMS-0406174 Principal Investigator: Bruce Solomon, Christopher M. Judge

This award provides partial support for the 2004 Bloomington Geometry Workshop,
the third in a series of regional conferences on geometric mathematics. The
conference format encourages interaction through participants, who are largely
drawn from Indiana and its neighboring states. Speaker selection is intended to
maximize scientific variety, participation by historically underrepresented
groups, and geographic diversity.
