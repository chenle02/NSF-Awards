A multi-course instrumentation laboratory has been established in the Chemistry
Department at Morehouse College. This laboratory includes equipment for the
instrumental part of a traditional undergraduate chemistry laboratory together
with a laser laboratory and a computer laboratory. Courses have been modified to
include the use of computer- interfaced spectroscopic equipment with appropriate
software for data analysis, laser-based experiments, and computer-based
instruction devoted to solving chemical problems with the type of software found
in modern academic and industrial settings. Majors in chemistry, biology, and
physics, and students pursuing careers in the health and engineering professions
are impacted by the activities of this facility. Since Morehouse is the only one
of four colleges in the Atlanta University Center Consortium which offers all of
the upper division courses required of chemistry and pre-engineering majors,
these activities represent a unifying effort embracing students at four
undergraduate institutions.
