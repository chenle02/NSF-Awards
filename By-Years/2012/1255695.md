For over a decade, the preferred tool that has been considered to be the basis
for effective molecular and genetic studies has been a fully assembled genome.
Because of its simple nervous system and large nerve cells, the marine snail
Aplysia californica is an important modelsystem for studies of the neural basis
of behavior. Dr. Eric Kandel was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2000 primarily for
his work on this system. In 2005, a major federally-funded effort was begun to
sequence and assemble the genome of this important model species. Because of
large amounts of repeat DNA sequences in Aplysia and the lack of a closely
related genome, the completion of the genome has been both costly and
challenging. The present project will take an alternative approach: sequencing
and assembly of RNA transcripts (the genes expressed in Aplysia) using two Next
Generation sequencing platforms that have complementary advantages. The
sequencing, assembly and annotation of these Aplysia transcripts using newly
developed computational tools will be conducted at the Institute for Genome
Sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. This focus on the
transcriptome assembly in the absence of a reference genome, a "transcriptome-
first" approach, should provide an important model for other research
communities working on diverse, non-vertebrate species without a closely related
reference genome. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Data will first be evaluated by an
advisory panel, which will comprise representatives from between six and eight
Aplysia research groups. Data will then be posted on an Aplysia Gene Tools
website, http://www.aplysiagenetools.org/. This site will host the preliminary
RNA-seq assembly as it becomes available, as well as all future preliminary and
complete data. Additionally a finalized annotated transcriptome will be provided
to NCBI (ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The Aplysia Gene Tools web site will be
accessible via links from the established Molluscan Neuroscience Gateway
(http://squishybrain.org/), and progress will be communicated with the
MolluscNet email list. The specific timelime for data dissemination is as
follows: 6 months: preliminary RNA-seq assembly and preliminary annotation, 12
months: final RNA-seq assembly and updated annotation, 18 months: final
annotation following annotation workshop (involving 12-14 research groups), 18
months, completion of paper describing "transcriptome-first" strategy and
innovative hybrid RNA-seq assembly, ~24 months: annotation of genome following
transcript mapping and targeted sequencing.
