This research studies the design of public institutions and the relationship
between institutional characteristics and the public policies adopted by those
institutions. The former focuses on the design of institutional arrangements,
such as the price-cap systems and the privatization arrangements being used by
various countries in telecommunications, taking into account both economic and
political incentives. The approach treats the ability of governments to commit
to a long-run incentive system as endogenous and depending on the political
action of interest groups as triggered by information released over time through
the performance of the incentive system. For parliamentary systems, the
objective is to develop a theory in which political parties, coalition
governments, and policy formation are endogenous functions of electoral and
legislative institutions. For the U.S., parties are perhaps less important than
in parliamentary systems, and interest groups interact more with individual
legislators than with parties. In the U.S. context, the objective is to
investigate the role of interest groups in influencing policies through lobbying
and election finance. The overall objective of this research program is to
provide a political economy theory of the public control of firms and markets as
a function of the structure of the political system. The research will have a
significant impact on our understanding of regulation, political institutions
such as electoral laws and parliamentary governments, interest group activity,
and electoral competition.
