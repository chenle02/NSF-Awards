ABSTRACT PI: Zucker Neural Basis of Circadian Rhythms Orientation in time is a
critical adaptation of all animals. Daily activity cycles and seasonal rhythms
both rely heavily on endogenous circadian rhythms apparently generated in some
vertebrates by highly localized brain "clocks." In mammals and birds the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus has been considered the
dominant or "master" circadian clock. When in the course of vertebrate evolution
the SCN assumed its timekeeping function is not known. Dr. Zucker is determining
if the SCN is essential for the generation of circadian rhythms in swimming
behavior and physiology and whether the retino-hypothalamic pathway that
terminates in the SCN mediates entrainment of circadian rhythms. This highly
innovative and risky investigation will provide the first information on brain
mechanisms responsible for generation of non-mammalian circadian rhythms and
will be useful in theorizing about the evolution of neural control of
rhythmicity in vertebrates.
