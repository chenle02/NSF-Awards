Most cryptographic applications crucially rely on secret keys that are chosen
randomly and are unknown to an attacker. Unfortunately, the process of deriving
secret keys in practice is often difficult, error-prone and riddled with
security vulnerabilities. Badly generated keys offer a prevalent source of
attacks that render complex cryptographic applications completely insecure,
despite their sophisticated design and rigorous mathematical analysis. Even
though key derivation plays a central role in the security landscape, it has
received surprisingly little formal study within the cryptographic community,
leading to a large disconnect between the theory and practice. In this project,
several important scenarios for key derivation are examined for their capability
to improve security with provable guarantees, including the use of random number
generators (RNGs), passwords, and biometrics. In particular: - How RNGs are
designed to properly combine the entropy gathering, randomness extraction and
pseudorandom generation modules, while achieving the best possible subset of
clearly defined security properties against a variety of adversarial scenarios.
- How to reduce the effectiveness of ?offline dictionary attacks? when
generating keys from passwords. - How biometrics can be safely reused to
generate many secret keys across many applications raises several interesting
questions, combining cryptographic security properties with those of error-
correcting codes.
