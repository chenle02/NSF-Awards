This study focuses on attorneys, both U.S. and non-U.S. nationals, engaged in
the overseas practice of American securities law. The research has multiple
objectives. One is to develop the study of regulatory lawyering across different
types of regulatory agencies. A second objective is to generate new evidence of
how American law is understood and practiced by attorney overseas. A third
objective is to build on existing literature regarding process of corporate
regulatory decisionmaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected through
approximately 150 interviews with attorneys in law firms, corporate general
counsel, and corporate and government officials. These interviews will include a
representative sample of both American and British lawyers practicing law in
London. The research also includes a survey of securities practitioners and
general counsel in both countries.&lt;br/&gt;
