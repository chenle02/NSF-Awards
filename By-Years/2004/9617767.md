Human behavior is probabilistic. Even in the simplest of tasks, some randomness
or unpredictability creeps into human responses. This makes it difficult to
study the details of how people respond to subtly different stimuli. To gain a
good understanding of such responses, it is necessary to collect large amounts
of data, which can be expensive and time-consuming. This research seeks to
develop new procedures for efficient data collection, and new methods for
evaluating such procedures. It applies information theory and the theory of
stochastic processes to develop adaptive algorithms for extracting as much
information as possible from experiments. A particular test case for these
methods will be experiments in visual psychophysics, which is notorious for
requiring extremely long and numerous data-collection sessions. However, the
methods will be developed abstractly, in order to maximize their applicability
to a wide range of problems, such as experiments in economics and the evaluation
of reliability of electronic components.
