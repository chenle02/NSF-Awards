Algebraic and Geometric Examples in Combinatorial Geometry

ABSTRACT

We will study a collection of problems of similar flavor coming from different
parts of mathematics. The problems are all combinatorial in nature and involve
estimates on the overlap between various geometric objects. We will attempt to
produce examples in these problems by both algebraic and probabilistic methods.

A great deal of mathematical analysis involves handling the infinite. Here
however we engage in a deep study of the finite. To be precise, we study the
ways in which finite collections of geometric objects like rectangles, patterns
of points in a grid, and vectors on a high dimensional sphere can be arranged to
achieve certain unusual effects. We will attempt to discover new and better such
arrangements. One way of doing this is by using a known algebraic structure to
suggest a construction. Another possibility is to choose the example randomly
within certain constraints.
