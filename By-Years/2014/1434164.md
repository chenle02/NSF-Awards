40 years since the pioneering work of sociologist, Mark Granovetter, on the
"strength of weak ties," numerous studies have confirmed his counter-intuitive
thesis that individuals are more likely to acquire novel information from an
acquaintance who bridges long network distances than from a close friend.
Although the importance of bridge ties for diffusion has been well documented,
the focus has primarily been on comparing the relational strength of ties
embedded in tightly knit circles vs. the relational strength of ties that bridge
long network distances, rather than examining tie strengths of bridge ties that
span varying network distances.

Drawing on population-scale data from Twitter and other social/communication
networks, this project will (a) test the proposition that bridging ties tend to
be weaker with the network distance they span, (b) develop an explanation for
the relationship between the strength and span-length of bridging ties using
statistical and simulation approaches, and (c) further explore the variation in
these relationships across countries of different cultures and economic
development. This study will contribute to research across the social sciences,
including studies of diffusion and contagion, network evolution, social capital,
and labor market processes. The development and dissemination of effective
methods to collect, analyze, and compare multiple networks constituted by
hundreds of millions of individuals will contribute to the social science
community that primarily relied on survey-based egocentric network data. The
project will also contribute to graduate training on the use of distributed and
parallel cloud-computing tools for studying population-scale social networks
