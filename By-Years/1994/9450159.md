9450159 Jennings A short course in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry and
Mass Spectrometry will be offered to 20 undergraduate faculty. Participants will
be chosen from institutions which have recently purchased, or are in the process
of purchasing, this instrumentation. These techniques are the most widely used
methods for determining molecular structure in the modern laboratory. Often the
faculty have inadequate experience with the techniques and are unable to take
full advantage of the instruments in their curriculum. This course is designed
to provide the participants with indepth knowledge of the fundamentals and
applications of this instrumentation. The participants will be encouraged to
utilize their experience through the development of curricular modules. The
curricular modules may be used to enhance undergraduate education at their home
institutions in these two important chemical instrumentation techniques.
