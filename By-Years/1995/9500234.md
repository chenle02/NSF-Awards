9500234 Behr-Andres This is an award to provide support for the purchase of
equipment the investigator plans to use in determining the toxicity of
potentially hazardous substances. The equipment includes the standard apparatus
and accessories needed for conducting the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
Procedure in connection with her research on management of solid and hazardous
wastes. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to Program
Announcement and Guidelines NSF 93-155, Engineering Research Equipment Grant
Program. The equipment will be used by the investigator for instruction of
students and in conduct of her research on management of industrial wastes to
recover their resource values by recycling and to minimize the negative impact
of waste management practices on the quality of environmental media. ***
