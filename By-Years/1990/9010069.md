The objective of this research is an investigation of gravity waves in the
lower atmosphere. Three problems are posed: (1) roll waves, (2) waves, and
consequent mixing, produced by air encountering obstacles in rough terrain, (3)
the diurnal excitation (from heating) of inertio-gravity waves near 30o
latitude.
