With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Ryan Bailey and his group at University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign aim to perform high information content separations using a
silicon photonic microring resonator platform. The focus of this work is to
improve analysis of polymers and small molecules, for example, with applications
in consumer goods quality control and pharmaceutical drug development. The
inherent versatility, quantitative nature, and dynamic range of this analytical
platform make it applicable to a wide range of chromatographic detection
challenges. In conjunction with the scientific goals of the project, the award
will also support the training and development of young scientists, particularly
those students from traditionally underrepresented minorities. Furthermore, the
group will continue participation in outreach activities within the local
community, including an innovative Spanish language science outreach program
developed in collaboration with the campus chapter of the Society for the
Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).

Modified sensor arrays for multiparametric separations can be applied to polymer
characterization using tunable organic sensor surfaces, to pharmaceutical
biologics validation using immune-affinity characterization, and to integrated
on-chip separations with electrophoresis for a lab-on-a-chip devices. The
current methods for the analysis of polymer and small molecules suffer from slow
product validation and often require multiple analytical methods for complete
characterization. This project seeks to simplify the validation process by
incorporating rapid and chemically informative separations into a single device,
representing a new capability for the separations field. Such a device will
prove particularly important in the separation and analysis of the next
generation of pharmaceuticals, including antibody-based therapeutics. Unlike
more conventional small molecule drugs these biological therapeutics demand
unique analytical characterization tools.
