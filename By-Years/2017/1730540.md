Wireless communication has become ubiquitous over the last decade. This
project's intent is to help create a new kind of scientific laboratory that will
allow researchers to study a wide range of future wireless communications and
networking problems. The laboratory is designed to let anyone with a new idea
try it out quickly, see how well it works, and share it with others at an early
stage, before moving on to much more expensive, complicated, and time-consuming
later-stage experiments. Working with others across the wireless research and
development communities, the project team aims to develop detailed plans for the
laboratory, share those plans with potential users, collect feedback, and refine
a larger community infrastructure proposal for building the laboratory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take four key steps towards developing a
full plan for the laboratory: (a) definition and specification of key hardware
and software modules; (b) development of practices and processes to facilitate
required FCC licensing; (c) identification and qualification of initial
deployment sites; (d) community engagement and outreach activities. For each
step, the team will produce relevant outputs, to include reports, design
documents, information packets, and similar artifacts.
