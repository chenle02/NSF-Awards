A liquid scintillation counter will be acquired to support neuroscience and
physiological research. Among the projects to be enhanced are studies on the
role of the olfactory adenylate cyclase in chemosensory cilia of the bullfrog;
the compartmentalization of glycolytic metabolism in Leishmania; the
intracellular water in cultured heart cells and evaluating the role of the
sodium-potassium pump in regulating the water volume.
