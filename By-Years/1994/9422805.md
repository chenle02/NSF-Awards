This is a project to create unified documentation for individual-level samples
of the United States census, covering the years: 1850, 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920,
1940, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. These microdata have proven to be a valuable
resource, since they allow researchers to make tabulations tailored to their
specific research questions and to overcome incompatibilities in the published
census tabulations. In addition, the public use microdata samples have made it
possible for researchers to move beyond simple tabular analysis and apply
increasingly sophisticated multivariate techniques. This project will enhance
the compatibility of variables over time and incorporate the 1850 and 1920
census years into the data series. %%% The public use microdata samples from
United States population censuses are of great value in several fields of social
science, permitting a variety of researchers to carry out scientific tests of
general theories concerning socio-economic trends, migration patterns, social
change, and several other aspects of American life. Proper documentation and
comparability of variables and coding across samples will increase the value of
the data sets for researchers and educators. Already some of these data and
codebooks are available over Internet or the World Wide Web, and they will be an
important part of the national information infrastructure
