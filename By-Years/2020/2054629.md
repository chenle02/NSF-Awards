The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of practical methods of
collecting, analyzing and utilizing student online learning activity data to
improve teaching and learning. COVID-19 caused an accelerated adoption of
educational technologies. The new normal of education may be much more infused
with technology. This project provides the analytic tools for educators to get
the data insights necessary to design effective digital learning experiences and
fully support students. Data analytics provide immense value to many online
commercial organizations and businesses. These commercial analytics are used to
better understand customers, promote desired customer behavior, predict future
interactions and support many organizational decisions. This project seeks to
make these insights available to educators and students. There are over three
million teachers in the United States who currently have no practical way of
reaping the value of analytics to gain insight into the online experiences that
they are designing for their own students. The objective of this project is to
provide teachers with the analytics and insights necessary to hold students
accountable, provide instructional support, and design effective digital
lessons. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will explore ways to create automated processes that extract
key data from student online learning activity records. In turn, the project
seeks to translate this data into useful analytics that will offer teachers
insights into students’ online learning experience. This project may improve the
collection and display of targeted online learning analytics that provide
educators with critical information about how students interact with online
content. These advances will be coupled with doctoral research studies at East
Stroudsburg University to collect and analyze student online learning data in
order to create automated “Key Learning Indicators” and “Learning Experience
Scores.” This project will work toward creating an industry standard for how
student online learning data should be ethically collected, analyzed, and
presented to educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
