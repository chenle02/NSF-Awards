A high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system is being purchased by the
Departments of Chemistry and Biology for use in several courses in the
undergraduate curriculum, including a new program in environmental analysis. The
instrument includes a gradient delivery system, a computer workstation, an
autosampler, an ultraviolet detector, a fluorescence detector and columns. A
special course in the use of HPLC provides students with the opportunity to
study the principles and applications of HPLC in environmental analysis,
specifically the detections and quantization of priority pollutants. The
increased need for environmental impact studies and environmental monitoring due
to state and Federal regulations has resulted in a demand for graduates trained
in the specific analytical techniques of environmental analysis.
