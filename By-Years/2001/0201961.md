0201961 Tesh This award to Skidaway Institute of Oceanography in the State of
Georgia provides instrumentation to significantly improve the oceanographic
research capabilities of the new research vessel Savannah, operated by SkIO as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
The award supports acquisition of sensors to be used in the vessel's surface
mapping system and on its CTD system, as well as an uninterruptible power
supply. All of these are shared-use capabilities that are available to all
funded users of the R/V Wecoma. These improvements will be of substantial
advantage to marine scientists during 2002 and future years. ***
