The older pipeline systems for water, gas, steam, and sewage are experiencing
failures as a result of aging conditions and are now in need of repair,
replacement and/or rehabilitation. This project will investigate the causes for
the breaks in the networks, and the patterns of failures as observed in the
field, and will collect data sets for the development of analytical metholds to
arrive at predictive models of failure. The final metholology will be beneficial
to decision makers responsible for the management of various types of network
systems.
