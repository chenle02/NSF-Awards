Nanoscale Clusters in the Design of Ductile Cr Base
Alloys&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morris E. Fine, Arthur J. Freeman, David N. Seidman
and Johannes Weertman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Nanocrystalline embedded particles
in materials are currently subjects of great interest in basic solid state
physics and also because of possible useful applications. Chromium's use is
highly restricted because it lacks ductility at room and lower temperatures. If
the room temperature ductility could be increased substantially chromium alloys
would find extensive use to save weight because of its very high modulus to
density ratio and at high temperatures because its melting temperature is
substantially higher than that of nickel. Coherent nanoscale clusters are
proposed to increase the ductility of chromium at ambient temperatures by
lowering the Peierls stress for screw dislocations. Clustering of solute atoms
in chromium will be investigated from first principles by ab-initio computation
and experimentally with the three-dimensional atom probe. Their effect on
ductility will be fundamentally investigated by determining the flow stress
versus temperature and strain rate. The interaction of embedded particles with
dislocations will be advanced theoretically&lt;br/&gt;
