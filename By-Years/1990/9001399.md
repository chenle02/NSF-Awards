This award extends for one year the American Statistical Association project
entitled "On- Site Research Program to Improve the Quality of Labor Statistics".
The plan for subsequent years is to effect a merger with similar on- site
research programs conducted at the Bureau of Census and the National Center for
Education Statistics. The program, which was initiated at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics in 1987, brings senior research fellows and associates to the Bureau
for periods of up to one year. Its broadbased goal is to help bridge the gap
between academic scholars and governmental scientists by exposing the fellows
and associates to the methodological problems and policy issues likely to be
encountered only in a large scale Federal statistical agency and by exposing
government social scientists to new theoretical developments which might have
application to their work. Residence at the Bureau allows fellows and associates
to carry out research that would be difficult if not impossible to do without
the ready access to the data resources of the Bureau of Labor Statistics which
the program provides.
