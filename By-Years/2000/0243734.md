Clemson supports a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site with an emphasis on the applications of nanotechnology in health and
food sciences. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-
week summer research experience. Students participate in a variety of research
projects within the physical and biological sciences and engineering, with a
focus on the design and development of nanostructures for biosensing
applications. In addition, students participate in weekly seminars and in a
local research symposium at the end of the summer.
