Critical Issues in Science and Engineering Technician Education The American
Chemical Society (ACS),the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE),
and the National Science Foundation is sponsoring a workshop on "Critical Issues
in Science and Engineering Technician Education." The workshop participants
include key constituencies from government, industry, and academia. Important
issues in technical education such as accreditation, voluntary industry
standards, who the technicians are and how they should be recruited, how they
should be educated, the needs of industry for technicians, how the curriculum
evolves, and how the faculty who teach in such programs are educated both in
preservice and inservice programs are being addressed. Recommendations are being
developed for government agencies, employers, and educators.***//
