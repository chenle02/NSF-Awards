Electrochemical methods are becoming increasingly important in the studies of
chemical, biomedical and environmental sciences. Laboratory experience is being
offered in the principles and techniques of contemporary electroanalytical
methods to chemsitry majors and other science students enrolled in instrumental
analysis courses. The BAS 100A electrochemical analyzer capable of performing a
wide variety of controlled potential techniques and computer data handling is
being utilized in inorganic and organic trace analyses, kinetics and mechanism
studies. The voltammetric techniques are being taught via an integrated
electrochemistry workstation in a simple, rational and stimulating manner.
Students who are generally more familiar with spectrochemistry and
chromatography, are also using electrochemical techniques to equal advantage in
solving analytical problems in their independent projects and undergraduate
research. In addition, students in an environmental chemistry course are
applying the electrochemical techniques to investigate "speciation" of metals
and anions in electrochemical samples. The grantee is matching the award from
non-Federal sources.
