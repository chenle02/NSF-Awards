A study of fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and compliant (elastic
or viscoelastic) arteries is proposed. The underlying mathematical model couples
the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid with the
structure equations describing vessel wall dynamics. The resulting moving-
boundary problem has features of a mixed, hyperbolic-parabolic problem. An
existence and uniqueness study of a reduced problem, and a novel scheme for
efficient computation of the full problem, are proposed. A theoretical and
computational study of Taylor dispersion in compliant tubes is also proposed.
Results from this work are important for a study of intravascular nano-particle
cancer drug delivery, and more generally, in the study of human cardiovascular
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of new mathematical and
computational techniques to study blood flow in pulsating human arteries is
proposed. The work is motivated by cardiovascular and oncological applications,
and will proceed in collaboration with the Texas Medical Center in
Houston.&lt;br/&gt;
