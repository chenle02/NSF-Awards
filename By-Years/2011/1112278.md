This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Geoffrey
Coates at Cornell University to develop new bimetallic complexes that have
potential utility as catalysts for the synthesis of polymeric materials. The
work will focus on the utilization of epoxides in polymer synthesis for three
primary reasons: 1) epoxides are inexpensive chemical feedstocks; 2) epoxides
can be derived from biorenewable sources; and 3) epoxides can be used to make
polyethers, polyesters, and polycarbonates, all of which safely biodegrade in
the environment. Work will focus on the development of a range of bimetallic
zinc and cobalt complexes for epoxide polymerization. Specific objectives are:
1) the development of chiral catalysts that can control the stereochemistry of
the polymerization, resulting in semi-crystalline polymers with improved
properties over their stereorandom counterparts; 2) understanding the design
challenges of bimetallic catalysts, from both an organic and inorganic
perspective, and utilization of these new catalysts for polymer synthesis. The
target polymers are polyethers from epoxide homopolymerization, polycarbonates
from epoxide/CO2 copolymerization, and polyesters from epoxide/anhydride
copolymerization.

The proposed work centers on developing bimetallic catalysts for environmentally
benign epoxide transformations including polycarbonates from epoxide/CO2
copolymerization. Outreach activities include a variety of chemistry
demonstrations and hands-on, inquiry based experiments in local elementary and
middle schools. During the last funding period, the PI and his group have spent
over 140 hours in K-12 outreach activities, interacting with 780 students and
201 teachers. The research on synthesizing plastics from natural substances is
easily accessible by the general public and this research group endeavors to
actively engage with television networks, newspapers and magazines to help the
general public see that science has great potential to meet the needs of society
in an environmentally responsible way.
