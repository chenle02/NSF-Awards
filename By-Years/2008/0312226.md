Grant Smith and Dmitry Bedrov of the University of Utah, and Jacek Dudowicz and
Karl Freed of the University of Chicago are supported by the Chemistry Division
and the Division of Materials Research through the Information Technology
Research program to develop multiscale molecular simulation tools that are
amenable to the simulation of polymer/nanoparticle suspensions. The resulting
tools will offer speedups of several orders of magnitude in comparison to
atomistic simulations. Applications are aimed at designing nanostructure
material properties by tuning the distance between nanoparticles via the polymer
materix. Tools will be made accessible to the community by distribution through
websites at the University of Utah and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of multiscale simulations is still
relatively young and a common set of tools are required as a standard for
comparisons. This research will develop such tools and distribute the
information freely through web sites. Applications include understanding how
modified fullerenes may be used to cross cell membranes as a means for drug
delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
