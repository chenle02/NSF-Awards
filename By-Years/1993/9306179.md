9306179 Kelly Clonality is an extremely important phenomenon in plants. Clonal
plant species comprise up to 90% of the higher plant species in alpine and
Arctic communities, 60% or more of temperate floras, and even in tropical
habitats, the majority of woody species possess the ability to sucker, crown
sprout, or develop adventitious roots. Clonality is found in trees, shrubs, and
herbs, under terrestrial, aquatic and arboreal conditions, and in both
autotrophic and parasitic groups, yet much about this widely successful growth
mode remains poorly understood. In clonal plants, sugars and other nutrients are
transported from 'mother' plants to 'daughter' offshoots (ramets). Using
greenhouse experiments to test theory, the research proposed will examine how
variation in resource allocation among ramets affects the life history and
contributes to the success of different genetic individuals of the clonal plant
dodder (Cuscuta exaltata).%%% Clonal plants have broad economic importance as
both crop plants (e.g. strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and asparagus) and
noted crop pests such as dodder, which parasitizes crops including alfalfa in
both temperate and tropical agriculture. The information provided by this study
may prove useful for both crop growth and pest control, offering the data needed
to create better schemes for timing and distribution of fertilizers in clonal
crops, and reducing the dependence on chemical control of clonal pests.***
