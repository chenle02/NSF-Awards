The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of Gallaudet University will
sponsor the 1986-1988 Summer Institute in Mathematics and Computer Science for
Elementary and Secondary Teachers of Hearing Impaired Persons. One hundred and
ten elementary and secondary teachers of the hearing impaired from various
schools across the country will come to Gallaudet for a six-week workshop in
each of three years. Fifteen elementary school teachers and fifteen secondary
teachers who will be selected to participate in year one will have the
opportunity to choose courses in mathematics, computer literacy, geometry and
advanced algebra. Nine credits will be awarded for the completion of these
courses which will include training in the basic concepts of mathematics,
computer programming and applications and methodology and application of
classroom teaching skills. The project director will be visiting the schools
during the school year to observe and follow-up the progress of the teachers in
their classrooms. He will offer the resources of the University as well as the
project staff to help the teachers improve their mathematics teaching.
