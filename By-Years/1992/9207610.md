This project will support the purchase of a continuous flow nutrient analyzer.
The contiunous flow nutrient analyzer would rapidly and automatically determine
the concentrations of at least five compounds. The high-resolution data set
which can be produced is essential for examining questions about the controls of
marine biological production, the exchange between land and estuarine
ecosystems, and the utilization of nutrients in controlled laboratory
experiments. The requested instrumentation would be used by a majority of the
faculty at the Lewes Campus of the College of Marine Studies (CMS). The Lewes
Campus, which houses the only marine biological laboratories in Delaware, has 22
faculty and 56 graduate students, and is a NSF supported Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site. The Lewes Campus has grown in size and prominence
(onc: member was elected to the National Academy of Science) over the last five
years. In recognition of this growth, the University of Delaware is constructing
a new building for Biogeochemistry that will house the requested
instrumentation.
