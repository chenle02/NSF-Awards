The objective of this research is to develop quasi-experimental control group
methods that are well suited to geographical research. A group of places where
some event of interest did not occur (analagous to no treatment in an
experimental design) will be selected as a control group for places where
something did occur (analagous to treatment). Approximately 100 case study
applications will be examined to determine whether the assumptions of simple
quasi-experimental methods can be satisfied. After the geographic quasi-
experimental control group methods have been developed and tested in the
abstract, they will be applied to substantive research issues in regional
economic development to determine their value as a basic research technique.
