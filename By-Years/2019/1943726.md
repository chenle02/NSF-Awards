This CAREER research program addresses CO2-based energy production and storage
to open potential paths for decarbonizing the energy sector. The project will
identify conditions and characteristics that favor sustainable CO2 storage in
subsurface geologic reservoirs. The principal applications targeted are using
CO2 for production of geothermal energy and large-scale storage of intermittent
power generated from renewable energy resources. Interactions between CO2,
water, and rock will be examined to allow better prediction of the fate of
injected CO2 in geologic reservoirs within the context of these emerging energy
technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will be integrated with
the educational mission of raising student literacy of subsurface processes
related to energy production, carbon mitigation, and sustainable groundwater
management. UM undergraduate students will be directly engaged in research
efforts by performing scenario analyses to define conditions under which
CO2-based geothermal energy production can provide grid-scale energy with net
negative life cycle CO2 emissions. Additionally, the educational program will
build upon the PI's experience interfacing with middle school students on the
topic of the energy-water nexus and leverage the UM Wolverine Pathways program
to develop a series of educational modules for students in the greater metro-
Detroit area. The Wolverine Pathways program follows a cohort of students from
7th through 12th grade, allowing the PI to develop and refine teaching modules
through rigorous evaluation of student learning objectives over the span of the
five-year project period. Once fully developed, these modules will be made
freely available to educators through an online resource catalog coupled with
companion video teaching tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
