WiGRAPH is an ACM SIGGRAPH Community Group that aims to broaden the network of
women researchers in Computer Graphics. Its mission is to increase the number of
women pursuing cutting-edge research in the field by creating supportive
environments where women researchers can interact with each other and seek role
models, mentorship, and encouragement. WiGRAPH offers a range of opportunities,
including research panels, networking spaces, and an online article series that
highlights the journeys and accomplishments of inspiring women researchers. The
Rising Stars program is a series of workshops designed to empower women who are
finishing their PhD and about to enter the job market, providing them with
resources that can help them pursue research careers in the field and achieve
their goals, thereby creating a more inclusive and diverse research community
that can drive innovation and progress in the field.

The program is designed to empower and inspire young women in Computer Graphics
research. Through a series of workshops and panels, it provides practical advice
on how to pick research topics, pursue research questions, and navigate the
industry/academic markets. This is particularly important for women researchers,
especially those from underrepresented groups, who face unique challenges and
obstacles in their careers. The program includes a range of workshops covering
topics such as networking, negotiation, and career development, all of which are
relevant to women researchers. Participants also have the opportunity to network
with each other and build relationships with potential mentors and sponsors,
creating a supportive community that can help women researchers thrive. Overall,
the program provides women researchers with the tools they need to succeed,
whether in industry or academia.
