Assistive robots that autonomously manipulate objects within everyday settings
have the potential to improve the lives of the elderly, injured, and disabled.
Although researchers have demonstrated relevant capabilities within laboratory
environments, current methods are untested and potentially unsuitable for the
variability of real-world healthcare environments. In order to address this
critical issue, the new infrastructure funded by this award consists of a state-
of-the-art robot (a mobile manipulator) dedicated to research conducted outside
of the lab via collaborations with healthcare researchers and providers. The
robot spends extended periods of time (residencies) in environments where
assistive robots are expected to make a positive impact, including the homes of
persons with disabilities, assisted living environments for the elderly, and
clinical facilities. These residencies enable robotics researchers to maximize
the impact of their research by identifying and addressing the roadblocks to
deployment of autonomous mobile manipulators for healthcare. The research
supported by this infrastructure will result in new methods for assistive
manipulation and contributions to compliant arm control, multi-modal perception,
and human-robot interaction. It will also begin to quantitatively characterize
the variability of real-world healthcare environments. Results of this research
will be communicated via academic publications, a website, open source code, and
publicly released data captured with the robot. The robot will also have
residencies at Spelman College (an HBCU for women) to promote science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.
