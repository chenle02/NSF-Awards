Recent discoveries of Silurian/early Devonian fossils in metamorphosed clastic
rocks of the western Blue Ridge province, southern Appalachians have called into
question the prevailing views of Blue Ridge tectonic evolution. The
fossiliferous rocks indicate that metamorphism must be Devonian or younger,
whereas a number of published radiometric ages indicate Ordovician metamorphism.
This study will resolve the extent and role of Taconic (Ordovician) versus
Acadian (Devonian) metamorphism and thus the discrepancies between the
paleontologic and radiometric data. 40Ar/39Ar and Rb/Sr geochronology will be
used in two well- studied areas to constrain the timing of metamorphism,
mylonitization and thrusting. The results of this study will resolve the current
controversy surrounding the tectonic evolution of the Blue Ridge crystalline
rocks of the southern Appalachians.
