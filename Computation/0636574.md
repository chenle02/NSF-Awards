This project establishes a flexible, modern training program in applied
mathematics within the Research Training Group program.

Mathematics is a central component in physical sciences, biological sciences,
and engineering, and many diverse disciplines exhibit common mathematical
structures. Work in these fields profits from the involvement of applied
mathematicians with broad backgrounds. This program will train such young
applied mathematicians at all levels, from undergraduates through postdoctoral
researchers.

A significant feature of the program is its interdisciplinary nature -- the
group's activities involve not just mathematicians, but engineers and scientists
as well. Thus, group members, while trained as applied mathematicians, will be
comfortable interacting with non-mathematicians in research teams. The research
activities will emphasize breadth and flexibility; trainees will be able to
tackle problems involving a wide variety of mathematical techniques, ranging
from analytical and computational methods to the development of suitable models
of physical processes, and they will be able to adapt their research to diverse
areas as opportunities arise.

The group's activities will involve mathematical research ranging from
analytical to computational, in application areas including life sciences
(particularly microbiology and biological fluids), fluid mechanics, materials
science, and combustion. A special focus is on interfacial phenomena and
phenomena involving multiple scales.

The project will produce a group of young applied mathematicians who are
multifaceted in their scientific knowledge, able to grasp common mathematical
features in problems from a diverse range of application areas, comfortable
working and interacting with scientists and engineers in an interdisciplinary
environment, and sufficiently flexible to pursue productive research in other
areas as national priorities evolve.
