The aim of this project is to develop theoretical models that provide new
understanding of the handoff problem in cellular communications networks. The
performance of handoff algorithms in different propagation environments will be
analyzed in terms of the tradeoff between unnecessary handoffs and handoff
delay. Procedures for choosing parameters for existing algorithms will be
developed. New optimal algorithms will be derived using the analytic models.
Handoff algorithms will be analyzed using level crossing theory, an approach
that has yielded promising preliminary results. Results from propagation
analysis will be used to study the effect of radio channel characteristics on
the handoff procedure. The design of optimal algorithms will involve the use of
sequential decision making, and control and estimation theory. This project aims
for fundamental theoretical results regarding the performance of handoff
algorithms.
