This project aims to solve basic open questions regarding the geometrisation of
topological groups. Topological groups and, in particular, the Polish groups
that are the central object of attention of the proposal, appear throughout
mathematics and very often in the form that groups were initially conceived by
Galois 200 years ago, namely, as collections of symmetries of various
mathematical objects. Whereas the groups themselves have no explicit concept of
distance and therefore also no explicit geometry, the project is devoted to
unveiling the implicit geometry that can be defined from their algebraic and
topological structure. The mathematical problems proposed bring together ideas
stemming from mathematical logic, analysis, and metric geometry, while at the
same time their solution will develop a tool set applicable to other areas such
as geometric topology. The project will also contribute to US workforce
development, through the training of students and post-doctoral scholars, and to
community building in the mathematical sciences through targeted conference and
workshop organisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from their topological and
algebraic structure, topological groups carry well-defined large scale and small
scale geometries in the form of canonical coarse and uniform structures that may
or may not be instances of underlying large or small scale Lipschitz geometries
on the group. Although this Lipschitziation problem is satisfyingly solved for
large scale geometry, it remains largely open for small scale geometry. One
facet of the proposal is exactly to make progress on this problem by
constructing an appropriate Banach–Lie algebra for groups admitting small scale
Lipschitz geometry and perhaps ultimately characterise them as closed subgroups
of Banach–Lie groups. Other problems in the proposal concern liftings of bounded
sets in Polish groups, non-commutative analogs of coarsely proper actions on
locally compact spaces and new constructions of groups admitting coarsely proper
and cocompact on said spaces. The project also aims to provide a better grasp of
the large scale geometric implications of amenability by substituting proximity
in L1-norm by proximity in Wasserstein distance and thereby connecting
amenability with issues in optimal transport theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
