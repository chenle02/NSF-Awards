The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire sea- going data management
systems and items of oceanographic instrumentation that will be placed in a pool
of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the three research vessels operated by the institution. A
substantial part of the ships' operating schedules during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ships and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Shipboard data management
systems and components for real- time acquisition, management, analysis, and
display of large environmental data sets, -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and
other enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and
temperature as a function of depth, -Seagoing computer, disk drive system and
other peripheral equipment for increasing the reliability and capabilities of
shared-use CTDs, -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for continuous, underway
measurements of subsurface circulation features, and acoustic backscattering as
a measure of the abundance of planktonic organisms, -Precision acoustic
transponder for use in determining the precise position of a scientific
instrument package relative to the seafloor, and -Portable fume hoods for
removing chemical fumes from the ship's laboratories. The Office of Naval
Research is cost sharing the acquisition of this equipment. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects.
