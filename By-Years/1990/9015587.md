This research is in the area of blind equalization and channel impulse response
estimation for digital communication systems, including telephone channels as
well as digital radio channels. One of the main objectives of the research is to
propose and analyze novel schemes for reliable initialization of the
conventional decision directed equalizers. Both batch an recursive methods are
considered. It is known that the second order statistics are inadequate for ISI
removal since the communication channel models are nonminimum-phase in general.
Therefore, emphasis is on exploitation of higher order cumulant statistics, in
addition to the usual second order statistics, of the data and of appropriately
defined error signals. Another objective is to design and analyze novel globally
convergent blind equalizers based on second and fourth order cumulant statistics
of the data.
