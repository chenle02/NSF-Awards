&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of catalytic,
enantioselective Diels-Alder (DA) chemistry. New metal-salen complexes will be
synthesized and heteroatom-substituted dienes will be developed for use in DA
reactions. Further, metal-free catalysts that use hydrogen bonding rather than
Lewis acids will be employed to promote the enantioselective process. The
asymmetric catalysis capabilities of chiral alcohols and other hydrogen bond
donors will be examined. The project will integrate crystallographic studies and
molecular modeling into the work in order to develop models to rationalize
observed enantioselectivities &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Viresh H.
Rawal in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Professor
Rawal will focus on developing methodology for the selective catalytic
preparation of chiral compounds. Specifically, enantioselective Diels-Alder (DA)
reactions catalyzed by metal-salen complexes and metal-free catalysts will be
carried out. There is great potential for broader impact of the work in the area
for the pharmaceutical industry and the project also presents an excellent
setting for the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
