Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Divisions of
Materials Research and Chemistry along with the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities will provide funds to support the participation of US students and US
faculty at 2012 Gordon Conference entitled "Scientific Methods in Cultural
Heritage Research: Non-Destructive Imaging and Micro-Analysis in Cultural
Heritage" that will take place at Mount Snow Resort, VT, from July 29 to August
3, 2012. Thirty-eight leading researchers from museums, art conservation
research centers, universities, and national laboratories, from the United
States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Israel, China and Japan will be on the program
of the conference as discussion leaders and speakers. The conference will foster
dialogue between those pushing the boundaries on methods and instrumentation and
researchers in cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;Nine session topics will be covered:
(1) Complex materials: case studies from the Old and the New World, (2)
Structures at the Nanoscale, (3)Hard X-Rays: from Large Scale Facilities to
Tabletop Sources, (4) Structures at the Microscale I: The Role of Spectroscopy,
(5) Structures at the Macroscale, (6) Structures at the Microscale II: From Bio-
Organic Heritage to Modern Art, (7) Lasers: from Molecules to Macrostructure,
(8) Imaging and Depth Profiling, and (9) Interdisciplinary Investigations in
Archaeology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The National
