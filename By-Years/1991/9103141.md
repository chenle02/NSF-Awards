In this project the principal investigators will work with graduate students on
the subject of rational interpolation in the complex domain by Pade'
approximants and continued fractions. These topics are intimately related to
moment theory, orthogonal polynomials, Laurent polynomials and Gaussian
quadrature. The principal investigators and their students will apply their
results to the computation of special functions and to problems in digital
signal processing. The field of rational approximation is one of the oldest
areas of classical analysis and one with many important connections to other
fields of science and engineering. In this project the principal investigators
will work with graduate students to study the location of zeros of polynomials
for use in developing quadrature formulas, studying the convergence properties
of continued fractions (Pade' approximants) and determining hidden periodicities
in a given digital signal.
