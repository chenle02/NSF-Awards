This award will provide funding for graduate student conference travel to the
9th International Gender and Language Association (IGALA 9) conference. This is
the first time that the conference will be held in China. Participating in the
conference will afford the students an opportunity to share their work in an
international forum and to impact the field as it develops in this region of the
world. The award is consistent with NSF's mission of developing the next
generation of scientists and promoting international scientific
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The IGALA 9 conference has taken as its
theme, "Time and Transition." The conference will address such questions as: how
discourse, gender, and language intersect with rapid change; how meanings are
discursively constructed across various timescales; how short-term performances
persist across time; and how self is projected discursively into the future
while drawing on the past.
