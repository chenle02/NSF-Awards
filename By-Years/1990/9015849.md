The focus of this project in the Organic Chemical Dynamics Program is the
chemistry of organosulfur compounds. This family of compounds includes a number
of substances of vital importance in biological systems, important starting
materials and intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry, and several
compounds which play important roles in environmental chemistry. The project
will emphasize reaction intermediates and unstable species which are involved in
the synthesis and reaction mechanisms of selected organic compounds of sulfur
and other chalcogens. One phase of the project will be the study of the
chemistry of imidazole-2-chalcogenones (-2-thiones; -2-selenones;
-2-tellurones). This will include a kinetic and mechanistic study of charge
transfer complex formation with halogens and cyanogen halides, the preparation
and chemistry of imidazolyl sulfines, selenines and tellurines. In another
aspect of the project, the oxidation of disulfides, trisulfides, thioozonides,
sulfenic acids, and sulfinic acids will be investigated. The mechanisms and
products from the reactions of sulfinyl halides with light, heat, amides,
sulfenic acids, and sulfines will be studied. Molecular orbital calculations
will be performed for many of the reaction intermediates and products.
