&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of asymmetric
synthetic methods centered on new protocols for sequential zirconium to zinc
transmetalation-carbonyl and -imine additions, including catalytic asymmetric
methods and chiral auxiliaries. Further, the study of the chemistry of
C-cyclopropylalkylamines and the the preparative extension of the water-
acceleration effect in Zr/Al cascade reactions will be carried
out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Peter Wipf in the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Wipf will focus his work on
developing methodology for asymmetric synthesis using the intermediacy of
organometallic compounds known as zirconocenes. The strategy takes advantage of
the availability and ease of handling of alkenes and alkynes as precursors for
stereoselective C-C and C-heteroatom bond formation. The broader impact of the
work is in the areas of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemistry. Further, the
project presents an excellent venue for the training of graduate students and
postdoctorals.&lt;br/&gt;
