The objective of this project is to develop algorithms and rules that will allow
actuated traffic signals, free of any fixed cycle length, to form green waves by
communicating with signals at neighboring intersections. Algorithms and rules
will be developed for transit priority, to deal with oversaturated conditions,
to provide more efficient multilane gap-out, and to make best use of the slack
inherent in lagging left turn phasing. Algorithms will be coded in C++ and
tested using the traffic microsimulation software VISSIM. Actuated traffic
signal control, in which changes in signal state (red, green) respond to vehicle
detections, has many advantages - it reduces delay, especially for pedestrians,
improves safety, and is readily adaptable to giving priority to public
transportation. However, it is sparingly used on urban arterials because it
lacks mechanisms for coordinating with neighboring intersections.

If successful, this project will create incremental improvements that can be
applied in existing signal controllers as well as a whole new paradigm for
traffic signal control that will improve safety, efficiency, and cost-
effectiveness. These new control methods will reduce delay for all traffic users
by being more responsive to traffic detection. Pedestrians and public
transportation will benefit the most, thus promoting sustainable modes of
transportation. Self-organizing logic will reduce the cost of maintaining
traffic signals because unlike standard signal timing plans, it does not need to
be updated every few years. Outreach activities will take advantage of the
strong public interest in traffic through presentations at high schools and
public meetings, and through instructional videos posted on the web illustrating
the principles of self-organizing traffic signal control.
