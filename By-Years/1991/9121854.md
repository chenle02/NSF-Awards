This award is to purchase a spot reading spectrometer, a 1-D scanning
rangefinder, and high quality color video camera to develop
multispectral/multisensor systems laboratory for problems in vision & electronic
imaging. Research projects using this system will include reflectance estimation
& determination of material properties from reflectance; modeling &
identification of objects in a natural scene; development of morphological
approaches to processing multiband images for noise reduction & feature
extraction; development of physics-based approaches to color image enhancement;
and development of methods for self-calibration of electronic imaging systems.
Purdue University will purchase equipment to develop a new
multispectral/multisensor systems laboratory for research in machine vision and
electronic imaging. The system will be used for acquisition of high spatial
resolution multispectral, color, and range information from a model scene under
controlled lighting conditions. The researchers will be able to investigate a
number of important problems associated with image formation, image processing,
and scene understanding.
