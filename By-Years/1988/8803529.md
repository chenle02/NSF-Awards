Professor Unertl and Dr. Liang, Exxon Corp., will use grazing incidence x-ray
scattering, low energy election diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy to
determine the kinetics of ordering for surface phase transitions. The
measurements will be compared with recent theoretical predictions about pattern
formation and universal scaling behavior including; a description of domain
growth, the existence of universality classes and the scaling properties of
scattering functions, the description of effects of ground state degeneracy and
symmetry, and the limitations imposed by surface imperfections. If validated
these predictions will permit a wide range of nucleation and growth phenomena in
diverse systems to be characterized simply. Technological processes including
sintering in then films, solidification following laser melting, and the
stability of rapidly quenched amorphous materials can be better understood. The
model systems to be studied include Au(110), Pb/Cu(110), Pb/Cu(001), and
Se/Ni(001). Experiments will include the use of the National Synchrotron Light
Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
