9317299 O'Farrell Cells develop in accord with their position within an embryo.
To do so, they either read position by communicating with neighbors (regulative
control), or inherit information about position through lineage (determination).
Typically, embryonic cells go through a transition from regulative control to
determination. In Drosophila, we know many of the genes that direct the fates of
cells. The transition from regulative control to determination should be
associated with a change in the regulation of these genes. One of these genes,
engrailed, directs cells to form the posterior parts of segments. There is a
multistepped transition in the control of engrailed expression that appears to
represent a transition from regulative control to determination. Dr. O'Farrell
has defined four tiers of engrailed control: initial patterning by localized
transcription factors, maintenance by the wingless signal, autoregulation and
control by Polycomb group genes. Dr. O'Farrell will precisely define the
relationship between the type of control of engrailed and developmental
determination. This will involve the use of new lineage tracing methods and the
development of a method to follow gene expression in real time. Additionally, he
will begin biochemical analysis of the involvement of Polycomb regulators in
stable control of engrailed expression. ***
