Recently developed analytical and computational methods will be utilized to
calculate the equilibrium atomic positions, charge densities, total energies and
the electronic structure of systems with very large unit cells. Specific
applications will include boron and its compounds which are of scientific
interest because of their unique icosahedrally based crystal structures and of
technological interest because of their hardness, lightness, and thermoelectric
properties. A second large unit cell system to be investigated will be II-
VI/III-V semiconductor superlattices. Work will also be undertaken to speed up
ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.
