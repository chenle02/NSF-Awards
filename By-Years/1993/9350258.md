The Psi Calculus is taught and used as a mathematical framework for
architecture independent enhanced parallel performance for array expressions.
Results are applicable in actual compilers for data parallel languages such as
High Performance Fortran. Real world practicum trains computer science and
engineering students in leading edge research and development technologies.
