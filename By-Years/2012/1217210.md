ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;03 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1217210&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI: S. Higgins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS
LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
(LDEO); namely Line Islands cruise coring support equipment, wireless remote
controls, a 40 KVa uninterrupted power supply and a commercial-grade sign maker.
Funding of these items will greatly enhance science support capability and
safety on board the vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
The LANGSETH supports federally funded scientific research throughout the
world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the
only 3D seismic vessel in the Academic Fleet. During operations, the vessel
routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography
through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events. The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete nearly 200 NSF sponsored days in
2012.
