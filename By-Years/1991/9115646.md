This project involves the dissertation research of a graduate student in
cognitive anthropology from the University of California-San Diego. The project
will study how fishermen from a rural Swedish village coordinate their work
activities given a set of constraints from their social life, cultural
tradition, human cognition and the physical environment. Working from videotapes
of activity in fishing boat settings, transcripts will be produced that make
explicit the representations used by actors to satisfy task constraints with the
resources at hand. The transcription process involves a translation of
behavioral data into a language that reveals the task-relevant representations
that are communicated, acted upon, or otherwise used to enable coordination. The
data will test propositions about the relationships between cognitive action,
cultural resources, and social processes. This research is important because
understanding how task groups solve problems and coordinate action can help
society design equipment and processes to minimize error and improve efficiency.
The relevance to important work activities, such as air traffic controllers, and
navigation teams, is clear.
