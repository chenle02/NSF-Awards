The Institute for Computational Science and Informatics (ICSI) at George Mason
University will purchase a network of RISC workstations which will be dedicated
to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment is
necessary to carry on computational mathematical research in several areas:
theory of wavelets and computational harmonic analysis, including numerically
stable inversion procedures for tomographic imaging and multisensor
deconvolution problems; existence and stability of solitary waves in partial
differential equations; control theory for certain partial differential and
delay-differential equations; and attractor reconstruction for dynamical
systems, involving methods which combine delay-coordinate embeddings and
Fourier-based filtering for noise reduction and prediction in nonlinear
processes.
