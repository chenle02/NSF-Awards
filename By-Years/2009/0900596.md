Abstract CMMI - 0900596&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis for the proposed
finite element model based state space (FEMSS) is that given that the
displacements in a living tissue are known (can be provided via MRI, ultrasound
etc.) then we can characterize its elastic and viscous properties. The FEMSS is
not based on a particular imaging technique in order to acquire the
displacements. During this project we will develop an ultrasound array so as to
have immediate correlation and validation of the model in house, and we will use
MRI images to correlate our data. In order to achieve our goal we propose to (a)
Investigate linear and non-linear solid dynamics models for soft tissues, (b)
Model and characterize of uncertainties presented in measurements and our
system, (c) Develop a phantom virtual laboratory, and to (d) Experimental
validation and fine tuning. We will fine-tune our FEMSS model with experiments
performed in our labs.&lt;br/&gt;If successful the proposed work will provide a
consistent, unitary mathematical model for the solution of the forward problem
for the non-invasive characterization of living tissues. We anticipate that this
work will create enabling technologies for tissue diagnostics with applications
in cancer research, remote surgery and athletics. Moreover this
multidisciplinary program will bring in tasks from materials science,
bioengineering, micro &amp; nano measurements, geometric &amp; material modeling
controls, hi-tech computational techniques, and image processing to develop a
state of the art tissue diagnostic tool, with unique quantitative measuring
capabilities and that is described mathematically to its entirety. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained in state of the art computational and
experimental techniques. We will actively collaborate and train minority
students and we will outreach to local communities in order to educate the
public about the use of materials modeling in biomedical applications. Results
dissemination will occur via internet, journals and conferences.
