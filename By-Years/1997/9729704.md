J. F. Drake State Technical College, located in Huntsville, AL has served the
area for 36 years. It provides technology degrees as well as diploma and
certificate programs in various technical areas. This grant will help fund
Internet access for the institution by supporting the acquisition of a leased
line, connection equipment, installation services and service provider fees. The
students and faculty of the J. F. Drake State Technical College need the
Internet connections to be able to access information resources throughout the
state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
students of this institution as well as the community in general. The award
provides partial support of the project for two years.
