The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US
Air Force with its adaptive optics system will be used to determine the density
as a function of altitude and the structure of the atmosphere of the satellite
of Saturn: Titan. The observational plan is to observe a stellar occultation and
measure intensity and spatial distribution as the light from a background star
passes (refracts) through the atmosphere of Titan. The A/O system has been shown
to lock-up and correct wavefront errors using Titan as the source. ***
