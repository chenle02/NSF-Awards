The Division of Chemistry supports Skye Fortier of the University of Indiana as
an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Fortier will work on
synthesizing new redox catalysts using earth-abundant transition metals and
'non-innocent' ligands. The PI will collaborate with scientists at Argonne
National Laboratory and Roosevelt University (Chicago). The ultimate goal of
this research is to develop efficient, inexpensive catalysts for chemical
synthesis. For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Fortier will mentor
young scientists at Indiana University and participate in a science summer camp
for high school students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that
of Dr. Fortier is aimed at developing better ways of conducting chemical
reactions. The catalysts that Dr. Fortier will develop will use earth-abundant
materials, and as a result will be less expensive. The results of research like
this can help scientists and the chemical industry do chemistry with less
environmental impact. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by
Dr. Fortier are aimed at giving a young scientists and the public exposure to
the chemical sciences.
