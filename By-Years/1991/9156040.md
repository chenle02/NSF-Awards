The goal of this project is to develop an instructional module for first-year
college, and senior high school, students that uses a stimulating video,
subsequent role playing, and class projects. The module uses advanced technology
to deliver the following messages: (1) Careers in engineering are important,
well respected, intellectually challenging, creative, and socially responsible.
(2) Engineering is not just a "man's" profession. (3) It is important for
everyone to be technologically literate. An Advisory Board is being formed to
review and revise the development of the material. A script is being developed
for the video material, and a team of university and high school teachers and
students is writing instructional materials. Plans will be developed to produce
the video material and to test the module in introductory engineering courses at
two universities and in a special course on the Principles of Engineering at
selected high schools in New York State.
