9320826 Borjas The large number of immigrants admitted into the U.S. over the
past two decades has had a major impact on the skill composition of the labor
force, and might even be responsible for some of the major changes in the wage
structure observed in the 1980s. It is important to stress, however, that the
economic impact of today's immigration is not limited to the current generation.
Because of the intergenerational link between the skills of parents and
children, current immigration policy might already be determining the skill
endowment of the labor force for the next two or three generations. The purpose
of this research is to determine and analyze the role that immigration and
ethnicity play in the U.S. economy. The underlying theme of the various aspects
of this project is that immigration has both short and long-run effects, and
that these effects are much better understood by grounding the analysis in a
solid microeconomic, theoretical foundation. The empirical analysis will use a
number of data sets, including the newly released 1990 Public Use Sample of the
U.S. Census, the National Longitudinal Surveys, and the General Social Surveys.
