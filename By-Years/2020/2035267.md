Aeronomy is a field robustly interdisciplinary and fundamentally dependent upon
multi-diagnostic observations and advanced computer modeling capabilities. This
proposal describes networks of existing all-sky-imagers (ASIs) and the
contributions they can make to some of the outstanding problems in Space
Physics. The term “Imaging Science” is used to describe the avenues of
exploration enabled by actual two-dimensional images of emission, as well as the
visualization aspects of data analysis, and the pictoral portrayal of modeling
results. The infra-structure required for a team science effort is led by an
experienced team of PI and senior staff for instrument operations, observations,
data transfer, data management and rapid availability to multiple research
communities. The effort is conducted in conjunction with research colleagues and
students eager to use new observations to further their studies of Ionosphere-
Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
