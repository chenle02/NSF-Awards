9614725 Leeman This grant provides $48,871 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer in the Geology and Geophysics
Department at William Marsh Rice University. Specifically, the upgrade would
include installation of a PC control system and associated software to replace
the DEC PDP-11 system currently installed on their Rigaku XRF and two months
salary for their current XRF technician who would train new users of the
upgraded XRF. This upgrade would also include installation of a multi-layered
crystal for analysis of light elements (i.e. B, F). Upgrade of the computer
system will ensure the availability of a critical piece of analytical
instrumentation for the analysis of major and trace elements in whole rock
samples for studies in igneous and metamorphic petrology for Rice University and
a host of other researchers in the Houston area. The enhanced capabilities to
conduct analyses for light element concentrations (i.e Boron) within whole rock
samples will immediately be utilized for research on fluid mobility during
metamorphism. Continued petrologic studies of magmatic processes in a host of
environments including volcanic island arcs, hot spots, intracontinental
extensional regimes and metamorphic terranes will also take advantage of this
upgrade. ***
