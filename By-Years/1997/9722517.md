The research which will be supported by this grant will aim to discover the
details of how the b quark decays. These particles will be produced in electron
positron collisions at the CESR accelerator at Cornell. The b quark is one of
six types of quarks known to exist. Its decays probe the details of how quarks
change their flavor (or type) when they decay via the weak force.
