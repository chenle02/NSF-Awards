This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I addresses the development
of a remote-telemetry compatible sensor for measuring reductions in methyl
tertiary butyl ether levels in soil at underground storage tank cleanup sites.
At present, there are over 160,000 sites with petroleum and methyl tertiary
butyl ether contaminated soil, which poses a significant threat to the
environment as well as human health and safety. In addition, there are
approximately 286,000 underground storage tanks that pose a significant risk to
the environment because they are not in compliance with federally mandated leak
detection requirements.

This sensor would enable the development of a new and improved chemical
detection system for identifying methyl tertiary butyl ether levels in soil and
to accurately determine the risks of underground storage tanks in cleanup sites.
