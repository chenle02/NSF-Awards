This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the NMR spectroscopic
studies of Professor Pochapsky at Brandeis University. The studies focus on the
characterization of closed-shell ion pairs and ionic aggregates. The research on
chiral and achiral ammonium cations with borohydride and chloride anions
concentrates on the structures of ion-pairs, the effect of ion pairing on
chemical reactivity, and dynamic self-assembling systems. The design of improved
stereo-selectivity in phase-transfer catalysis is targeted. A broad spectrum of
advanced NMR techniques will be used in conjunction with molecular modeling
techniques and vibrational spectroscopy to illucidate the structural and dynamic
properties of ion-pairs. In this spectroscopic project Dr. Pochapsky uses
nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for the characterization of the
structures, reactivities, and dynamic behavior of ion-pairs and ionic
aggregates. These studies use chiral ammonium cations and are valuable for the
design of improved chiral recognition in the important area of phase transfer
catalysis. The combined use of advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular
modeling is of further interest to the chemical community.
