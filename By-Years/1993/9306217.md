9306217 Luke Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii, is a shrub native to
northeastern Asia but has become an invasive weed in many midwestern states. It
initially colonizes a wide range of disturbed habitats. In northern Kentucky,
forests presently exist in which the understory is a dense thicket of Amur
honeysuckle with few other plants present. Succeeding generations can also
become established and grow in the shade of parent plants. It is not known
whether this ability to become established in deep shade is the result of
natural selection for shade tolerance, or of high phenotypic plasticity (non-
genetic acclimation). This research will assess how succeeding generations of
Amur honeysuckle growing in the shade of parent plants in forest understories
differ from their parents in shade tolerance and plasticity. %%% This work will
have implications not only for understanding the basic biology of this
introduced species, but for better understanding of the mechanisms by which
invasive weeds are able to dominate natural and agricultural areas.***
