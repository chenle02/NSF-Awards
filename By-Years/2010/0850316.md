This project is enhancing learning opportunities for low income, academically
talented students by offering at least 74 scholarships over four academic years
through a Technology, Engineering, and Math Science Scholars (TEAMS) Program.
For TEAMS scholars, who are majoring in Mathematics/Pre-engineering, Computer
Information Systems, Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Physics, Aerospace
Technology or Process Technology, the program is providing numerous career
awareness activities and developing a learning community cohort with enhanced
tutoring, mentoring and additional student support services. Enhanced
partnerships with area institutions of higher education and with industry are
helping to ensure increased transfer rates and employment opportunities for the
scholars. Major goals of the program are to increase by 5% each year the number
of students majoring in STEM disciplines through intensive recruiting at local
high schools and via web-based media, to increase transfer rates and employment
opportunities for TEAMS scholars, and to contribute to the K-20 educational
pipeline for preparing a qualified workforce for regional high growth/high
demand biotechnology and nanotechnology industries.
