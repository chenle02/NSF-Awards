Guttorp&lt;br/&gt;Title Collaborative proposal: ISI and TIES Conference Support
Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
project supports travel of new researchers from US institutions to two
international conferences in Statistics during the summer of 2003. The
conferences are the International Environmetrics Society (TIES) 2003 Conference,
held in August 2003 in Beijing, China, and the International Statistics
Institute (ISI) Conference on Environmental Statistics and Health (ISI-ESH),
held in July 2003 in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The conferences provide a
forum for these new researchers to present their work and interact with
established researchers in statistics who work on environmental and health
related scientific issues. &lt;br/&gt;
