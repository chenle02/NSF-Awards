The purpose of this project is to analyze some of the difficulties encountered
in the transition from a planned to market economy. The first issue to be
analyzed is what happens to firm specific knowledge or organizational capital as
state run firms are replaced by private ones. A growth model of industry
evolution and transition is developed and used with panel data on the patterns
of birth, growth, and death of manufacturing plants to estimate the scale of
investment in organizational capital. Another issue to be analyzed is the
initial and usually significant drop in total output that occurs in converting
to a market system. This drop in output is modeled as arising from the changes
in managers' and workers' incentives that arise as their rents are redistributed
as a result of economic reform. Finally, the potential role that changes in
energy prices might play in explaining the transition path of the former
socialist economies is analyzed. A model of production is developed to assess
the impact of energy price changes on energy use, total output, productivity,
investment, and employment. ***
