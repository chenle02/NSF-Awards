The project is providing Junior-level Biology majors with basic training in the
design, execution and evaluation of scientific research in a two- semester
course entitled Investigative Biology. The first semester includes discussions
of general principles and the performance of sample experiments from a variety
of biological areas using oscilloscopes and other equipment for relatively
simple investigations. The second semester consists of the design and
performance of a research project from the area of photoreceptor physiology,
using some model experiments with the electronic probes, amplifiers,
analysis/recording devices and computers to process the data. The students are
studying the physiological effects of the timing, intensity and wavelength of
light on several types of photoreceptors.
