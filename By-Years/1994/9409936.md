This is a project to study how individuals and households are adapting to the
momentous changes underway in rural areas of the former Soviet Union. In
collaboration with researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the project
team will carry out a three wave panel study of residents in two villages in
Russia. The questionnaires will be designed to collect extensive information
about the social networks in which inviduals and families are enmeshed in order
to understand the role of connections and social support in adapting to rapid
social change. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 it was next to
impossible for Western researchers to collect objective survey data on social
life in rural Russia. Since the downfall of communism in that state, rapid and
disruptive changes in social and economic life are underway which are poorly
understood. It is now possible for Western researchers to collect systematic
empirical data on the changes underway, and there is some urgency to collect
baseline information before these changes have progressed too far. By carrying
out three waves of surveys in two contrasting villages, this project will help
us understand the dramatic changes that are occurring in rural Russia and what
their likely outcomes are.
