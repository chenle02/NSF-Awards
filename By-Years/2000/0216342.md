This Major Research Instrumentation award to Old Dominion University in Virginia
provides funds for acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to outfit a
55-foot coastal research vessel for research and education projects in and
around the Chesapeake Bay. Specific instrumentation to be acquired included a
Conductivity-Temperature-Depth system (CTD), a precision depth recorder, an
acoustic current profiler, a global positioning sytem, a box corer and a data
logging computer system. The award also included partial support of a marine
technician to integrate, install and oversee operation of the instrumentation
during the initial three years. The project is supported by the Division of
Ocean Sciences at NSF. Old Dominion University will provide cost-share support
from non-federal funds for more than 30% of total project
costs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
