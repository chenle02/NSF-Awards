The award to the organizers is for student travel support for the 36th
International Conference on Plasma Science and 23rd Symposium on Fusion
Engineering to be held in San Diego May 31-June 5, 2009. Students who attend
this conference will be exposed to scientists from a variety of disciplines who
are working in the expanding area of high energy density science, low
temperature plasmas with industrial and medical applications, and basic plasma
physics such as dusty plasmas and computational plasma physics. The conference
webpage advertises the availability of student travel support and the procedure
for application is clear. In addition, there are 3 awards for student
accomplishments to be presented at the meeting.
