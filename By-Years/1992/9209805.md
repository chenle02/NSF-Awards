Malik This research is on verifying the temporal correctness of synchronous
digital systems. The emphasis is on obtaining accurate, efficient algorithms
within the paradigm of certified timing analysis. This combines the efficiency
and coverage of timing analysis with the accuracy of timing simulation. Vectors
that sensitize the long paths in the combinational parts of the circuit are
generated by timing analysis. These are then used in timing simulation. The
research addresses the problem that in order to provide these vectors, timing
analysis must consider the functionality of the circuit components.
