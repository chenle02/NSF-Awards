This small grant for exploratory research is investigating a new approach to
determining paleoelevation of collapsed or eroded orogens using the stable
isotope composition of mylonitic quartzite that interacted and equilibrated with
meteoric water during deformation. During extensional collapse of the orogen,
mateoric water penetrates the upper crust and interacts thoroughly with
recrystallizing white mica in detachment mylonites. The isotopic composition of
the meteoric water can be retrieved from the isotopic ratios measured in white
micas, permitting a direct link to be made between the chemical and structural
evolution of rocks at depth and the evolution of landscape and climate. Syn-
kinematic white mica in the quartzite is dated using 40Ar/39Ar methods to
determine the timing of deformation and interaction with fluids. Deuterium-
hydrogen ratios measured in mica provide the link to elevation using existing
climate models. Preliminary Results from the Shuswap core complex (British
Columbia) indicate that the region was at an elevation of at least 4000 meters
about 49 million years ago. The new method is being applied to mylonitic
quartzite exposed in other core complexes in the Cordillera (Okanogan-Kettle
Complex, Albion-Raft River-Grouse Creek Complex ) as a test of the
reproducabilty of the method. The age of mylonitization varies from 50 to 15
million years old. Therefore, the method is being used to interpret the
tectonics and paleoelevation of the Cordillera from Eocene to Miocene time. This
technique is portable to other orogens and enhances understanding of the
interaction among crustal dynamics, landscape evolution, and climate during
orogeny.
