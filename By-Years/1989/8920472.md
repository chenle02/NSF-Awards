There is very little research on emergency preparedness during periods of
routine operations. Most studies concentrate on the immediate response during
post-impact disaster periods but pre-event linkage patterns are important for
understanding response actions. Research is needed that accurately describes the
normally established multiorganizational networks of community preparedness
across functional areas such as search and rescue, food provision, medical
supply stockpiles, public shelters, and mobilization of volunteers in
conjunction with other emergency personnel. The goal of this research is to
strengthen disaster preparedness by deepening and refining the understanding of
how organization work together. The study will examine the underlying processes
producing the patterns of interorganizational relations in the preparedness
network of St. Louis, Missouri, an area which is at risk to many types of
hazards including earthquakes. The empirical focus of the study will be on the
system of negotiations that underlie the definitions of resources and
responsibilities among a sample of organizations for meeting the needs of
disaster victims. The study has implications for large urban areas in the U.S.
threatened by natural hazards.
