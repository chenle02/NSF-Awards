9530875 LIPSCHULTZ Denitrification (=respiration of oxidized nitrogen to
dinitrogen gas) results in the loss, from the biosphere, of combined nitrogen, a
critical nutrient for plant growth. The magnitude of denitrification affects the
rates of decomposition of organic matter in the water column. Changes in these
rates can alter the balance between the amount of carbon that reaches the deep
ocean and the amount of CO2 available in the atmosphere. The project will be
conducted in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific where suitably low oxygen waters
persist. Various measurements of denitrification in this environment will
address research questions that are crucial to understanding nitrogen and carbon
cycling in the ocean. State-of-practice N-15 techniques and isotope ratio mass
spectrometry will be used to determine dinitrification rates. ***
