The Gulf of Lions presents an opportunity to investigate the development of a
continental margin after it had been stripped bare, by the Messinian desiccation
of the Mediterranean. One the connection to the open sea was reestablished thick
sedimentary sequences with characteristic clinoform morphology were deposited
along this margin. PIs propose to use the re-establishment of the continental
shelf and slope as a natural experiment for how continental margins evolve in
general. They plan to build a 3D picture of the Gulf of Lion region using
several thousand km of existing MCS profiles. They will use back-stripping
techniques to document layer by layer how the margin developed in 3D, which will
allow them to understand the processes involved in the margin growth.
