ABSTRACT CTS-9400654 Incropera The proposed study seeks to experimentally and
theoretically delineate transport phenomena related to a processing technique
which uses intense, localized sources of heat to augment conventional machining
of ceramic materials. Specifically, thermally enhanced machining (TEM) processes
will be studied for turning operations involving integration of a lathe with
existing CO2 laser or plasma arc sources to machine cylindrical specimens of
silicon nitride, zirconia and alumina-zirconia. Theoretical treatments of TEM
processes will be used to delineate the role of pertinent physical mechanisms.
Models will consider localized heating at and convection heat transfer from the
workpiece surface, conduction within the workpiece, friction at the tool-chip
interface, and/or plastic flow. Supporting experiments will also be performed to
determine flow and convection heat transfer conditions at a simulated or actual
workpiece surface. On-line monitoring will include sensing of workpiece and tool
temperatures and cutting forces for a wide range of system operating parameters
and heat source conditions. Off-line measurements will also be used to determine
the residual stress, tool wear, microstructure and hardness distribution in the
machined surface. The objective of the theoretical and experimental studies is
to obtain an improved understanding of underlying physical mechanisms for TEM
processes and to establish a range of suitable operating conditions.
