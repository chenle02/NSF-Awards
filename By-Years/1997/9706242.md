With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor William H. Saunders,
Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester, is carrying
out quantum chemical calculations on elimination and proton transfer reactions.
Calculations on fluorine-substituted carbanions permit the assessment of the
role of negative ion hyperconjugation, and studies of elimination reactions of
fluorohydrocarbons address the borderline between E1cb and E2 reaction pathways.
Factors governing the orientation and stereochemistry of concerted elimination
reactions are examined through consideration of charge distributions, isotope
effects, and ion pairing. Particular attention is placed on developing an
understanding of the syn-anti dichotomy, wherein cis olefins are produced by
anti elimination but trans olefins are produced by syn elimination. Among the
superficially simplest chemical reactions are those involving the transfer of a
single positively-charged hydrogen atom (a proton) from one place in a molecule
to another. Despite the apparent simplicity of such reactions, however,
experimental results indicate appreciable complexity. Through the application of
calculational techniques and with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program,
Professor William H. Saunders, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Rochester, is exploring the fundamental aspects of proton transfer
reactions. His studies also extend to the analysis of reactions initiated by the
loss of a proton, focusing in particular on whether the overall reaction path
for such reactions involves simultaneous elimination of an additional group or
if such elimination occurs subsequently to the initial proton loss. These issues
are central to an extraordinarily wide variety of chemical reactions, and
Professor Saunders' studies are leading to a fundamental understanding of the
factors controlling them.
