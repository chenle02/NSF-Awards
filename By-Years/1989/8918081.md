This research addresses supercomputing aspects in reacting flows. It is well
known that the success of computational fluid dynamics hinges on efficient
numerical methods and data management on the supercomputer. This is particularly
true when complicated physical phenomena such as turbulence, shock waves, and
reacting flows are involved. The emphasis in this research will be placed on
supercomputing aspects such as multigrid adaptive methods, unstructured grids,
vector processing, and parallel processing. The best features of finite
differences and finite element will be investigated, although emphasis is on
finite elements due to an advantage in unstructured grids. With the most
rigorous supercomputing capabilities available, our efforts will then be
centered on evaluation and development of numerical strategies in dealing with
widely disparate length and time scales typical of turbulence and reating flows.
The end product is to achieve an enhanced understanding of the physics of
turbulent flow phenomena in general and combustion of propulsion systems in
particular.
