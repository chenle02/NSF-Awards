Wayne State University seeks to provide an intellectually intense Early Alert
Initiative (EAI) program in physics and mathematics for 40 talented and highly
motivated seventh grade females. The participants will be from urban
economically disadvantaged communities as well as some of their counterparts
from suburban and rural communities in the Greater Detroit Metropolitan area.
The program is a five week commuter summer program with follow-up activities
during the academic year. There will be innovative mathematics activities,
challenging physics activities focused on research methodology, philosophy and
ethics of science, and career exploration.
