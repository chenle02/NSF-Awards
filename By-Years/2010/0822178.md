ABSTRACT

This exploratory project is identifying and describing the concepts and
techniques in data analysis that are needed for secondary students to more
effectively learn from and about large scientific data sets. This is to be done
primarily with a search of the relevant literature. Also, it is developing a set
of software and curricular design recommendations to address these needs. It is
working with consultants knowledgeable in a number of large scientific data
sets. The results are being disseminated in formats available to curriculum and
software developers.
