&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0201486
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jeffrey J. Derby, Podromos
Daoutidis, and Csaba Szeles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: GOALI: Modeling the Industrial
Growth of CdZnTe Substrate Crystals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
is for a cooperative program between investigators at the University of
Minnesota and eV Products to develop, validate, and apply new theoretical models
for vertical Bridgman growth of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), a semi-conductor
material important in infrared and nuclear detector applications. Specific tasks
include model development for vertical Bridgman growth, assessment of process
improvements that may be expected from crucible rotation techniques, and the
application of model based control strategies for melt-crystal interface shape
and for suppression of flow instabilities and compositional inhomogeneities. The
research program will combine experimental and process development expertise at
eV Products with the theoretical computational capability and advanced control
algorithm development at the University of Minnesota. If successful, the results
could lead to better process operation and design for a broad spectrum of
crystal growth systems, yielding better quality crystals at higher production
rates and lower costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
