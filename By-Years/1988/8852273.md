Computer technology is playing an increasingly important role in the biological
sciences. Computers are being used for data acquisition and analysis, and they
make the simulation of complex biological systems possible. Despite their
importance, the integration of computers into the undergraduate biology
curriculum has not been consistently achieved. This means that students often
underestimate the need for quantitative skills in modern biological research.
This project attempts to overcome this problem by developing a computer
laboratory for the biological sciences. The laboratory is being configured with
a network of 12 MacIntosh II computers to allow for interaction among the
instructor and students. One of the main uses of the lab is to allow students to
develop their analytical skills by designing simulation models of biological
processes. Simulations are used in the department's Ecology, Limnology, Human
Physiology and Research courses. The new equipment also supports the development
of an Evolution course in which the majority of the labs are to be based on
model building. In addition, the lab is used by students in a number of classes
to acquire data from scientific instruments and to conduct the subsequent
statistical analyses of these data. Finally there are plans to use the computer
lab for literature searching and accessing external databases through the
college's local area network. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award
with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
