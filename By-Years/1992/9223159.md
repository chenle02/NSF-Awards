Anyone who has ever tried to learn to play a musical instrument has had the
experience of feeling "all thumbs". With practice, one becomes more skilled, but
it is always difficult to conceptualize what one has actually learned. What is
the difference between skilled and unskilled motor behavior? Dr. Kruger, and his
colleagues, a physicist and a musician, with the help of two undergraduate
research assistants, will identify differences in wrist and elbow movements
between skilled and unskilled trombone players. They will use sophisticated
biomechanical recording equipment to determine the relative influence of
kinesthetic, visual and auditory feedback on motor control. This work will
contribute to increased understanding of movement related injuries and improved
teaching methods for musicians and athletes. This grant will also establish a
model for teaching interdisciplinary research skills at the undergraduate
level.***//
