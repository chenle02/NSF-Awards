Yagle Research efforts focus on the development of a variety of fast algorithms
for signal processing applications. These include a geometric approach to phase
retrieval, reconstructing a signal of finite support from its Fourier magnitude,
fast algorithms for close-to-Toeplitz-plus-Hankel systems of equations with
applications to two-sided spectral estimation, and time- frequency methods -
wavelets and short-time Fourier transforms - to perform spatially-varying
windowing in order to improve the composition of derivatives of non-stationary
signals in non- stationary noise.
