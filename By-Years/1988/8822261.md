Dr. Aldenderfer will continue his archaeological research in the Osmore basin
which is located in far southern Peru. Three sites, two situated in rockshelters
and one in open air, will be excavated. All are located well above sea level and
sample different high altitude zones. All date from the Middle Archaic and Early
Formative periods which extend from approximately 8,000 to 3,500 years before
the present. Dr. Aldenderfer and his colleagues will excavate large areas of
these sites to identify architectural remains and to recover artifactual,
faunal, and floral remains. Subsequent analysis will allow him to trace changing
settlement patterns, diet, and social organization over time. During the time
period under investigation, a sedentarization process appears to have taken
place in the Osmore region. Coincident changes in population size and density,
in subsistence - with the emergence of domesticated plants and animals - and in
degree of social complexity also seem to have occurred. It was during this
period and general area that camelids and Andean tubers were domesticated.
Although the general outlines of the process are known, it is still not clear
how these different factors interacted and which played the primary causal role.
The goal of this research is to answer these questions. The shift documented in
the Osmore basin occurred at roughly the same time in many parts of both the Old
and New Worlds. Thus, the Osmore basin research may provide insight into this
broader process. Because the region was a center for both plant and animal
domestication and because preliminary work has shown that faunal and floral
remains are extremely well preserved at these sites, the region provides an
excellent context to examine this issue. The work will provide insight into the
early stages of the process which led to the development of complex societies
such as our own.
