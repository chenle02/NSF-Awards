This model science teacher retention and mentoring project will involve more
than 300 elementary teachers in "Lesson Study" of inquiry science around school
gardens. Drawing on the rich resources of the University of California Botanical
Garden and the science educators at the Lawrence Hall of Science this project
will develop Teacher Leaders and provide science content professional
development to colleagues in four urban school districts. Using the rich and
authentic contexts of gardens to engage students and teachers in scientific
inquiry opens the opportunity to invite parents to become actively involved with
their children in the learning process. As teachers improve their classroom
practices of teaching science through inquiry with the help of school-based
mentoring they are able to connect the teaching of science to mathematics and
literacy and will be able to apply the lesson study approach in their teaching
of other innovative projects. Teacher leaders and mentors will have on-going
learning opportunities as well as engage participating teachers in lesson study
and reflection aimed toward improving science content understanding and the
quality of science learning in summer garden learning experiences and having
context rich science inquiry experiences throughout the school year.
