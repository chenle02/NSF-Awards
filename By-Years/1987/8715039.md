This award will support collaborative research on the topic of protein chemistry
between Dr. Mark Olson, University of Mississippi Medical Center and Dr.
Francois Amalric, Center for Research in Biochemistry and Cellular Genetics of
the French National Center for Scientific Research in Toulouse, France. The
objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the relationship of the
structure to the function of nucleolin, a preribosomal RNA binding protein. The
work will focus on the role of phosphorylation of nucleolin and the
identification of the nucleic acid binding domains of the protein. This
collaboration is mutually beneficial because of the common interest of the U.S.
and French labs in the protein and the complementarity of expertise and
facilities. The Toulouse group has expertise in cell culture and nucleic acids
methods. The U.S. lab has expertise and facilities for protein chemistry and the
ability to isolate greater quantities of the protein, facilitating progress at
the protein and posttranslational level. The projects proposed require a
chemical approach (to be done in the U.S.) as well as an advanced knowledge of
the protein sequence, manipulation of cells and isolation of cell fractions
(provided by Dr. Amalric's group). Without the collaboration and exchange of
information, the project would proceed at a much slower pace with considerable
duplication of effort. Completion of the proposed studies will enable both labs
to clarify the role of phosphorylation of nucleolin and the mechanism of nucleic
acid binding by this and other proteins which share the RNP consensus sequence.
This should provide a foundation for further studies on structure-function
relationships in nucleolin and its role in ribosome biogenesis.
