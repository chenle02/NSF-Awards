Analysis of solid surfaces with high sensitivity, and with a broad dynamic
range, is important to a number of technologies, including semiconductor
processing and heterogeneous catalysis. In this research project supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, a picosecond laser will be used to
ionize species directly above a solid surface, and then analyze them by time of
flight mass spectrometry. These species will be desorbed by ion beam or laser
beam interaction with the surface being analyzed. The objectives of this
research program are to develop this surface analysis method by carefully
characterizing the photoionization process, measuring velocity and angular
distributions of sputtered particles, and by determining detection sensitivity
factors and relative neutral and ion fraction sputtering yields. In order to
detect low levels of contaminants on semiconductor surfaces, or to identify low
coverage species in catalytic systems, it is necessary to have available very
sensitive surface analytical tools. This research program is designed to develop
and perfect a very sensitive photoionization probe of surface composition. A
fast laser pulse will be used to ionize ion or laser desorbed species, and mass
spectrometry will be used to detect and identify the ions. This approach
promises a significant increase in surface analytical sensitivity over presently
available methods.
