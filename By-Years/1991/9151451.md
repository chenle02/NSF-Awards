The goal of this project is to establish an integrated set of experiments
addressing the light reactions of photosynthesis across three appropriate
courses: introductory biology, introductory botany, and plant physiology. These
experiments introduce the subject at appropriate levels of theoretical and
mechanical sophistication for the intended student groups, at an institution
that has the largest teacher education program in the state. The
Spectrophotometers, orbital shaker and rotary evaporator allow experiments that
include measuring photosynthetic rates at different light intensities,
wavelengths, and temperatures using chloroplast suspensions and whole cell
cultures. They also include obtaining absorption spectra from chloroplast
suspensions and separated pigments.
