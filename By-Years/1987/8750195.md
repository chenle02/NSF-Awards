A system of microcomputers will be used to enhance the general physics
curriculum at the University of North Carolina, Asheville and to provide physics
majors with experience in data acquisition, analysis and control. A set of four
microcomputers equipped with scientific graphics and analysis software will be
integrated into the laboratory portion of all introductory physics courses. A
fifth microcomputer, equipped with data acquisition hardware and software, will
be used to increase the extent to which computer data acquisition and control
techniques are used by physics majors in the junior level experimental physics
course. The main computer will also be used by students in upper level physics
courses as well as senior research projects.
