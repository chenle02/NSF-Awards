9453243 Kenkel This planning grant is enabling a working group of chemistry
educators from community colleges, high schools, and a university, along with
laboratory technicians and supervisors from industry and government, to develop
a comprehensive plan for creating and operating a National Center of Excellence
for Chemistry-Based Technician Education ("NCE"). The center, which will be
based at the Southeast Community College in Lincoln Nebraska, will serve as a
national model for program and materials development, and will serve as a
clearinghouse for information critical to chemistry-based technician education.
The working group for the proposed NCE builds on the broad experience and
national leadership of its members and is comprehensively considering issues
related to the Center's development, including: curriculum reform and
implementation, alliances with industry, direct transfer of credit to four-year
institutions, and "2+2+2" articulation. During the planning period, the working
group will be developing the structural and programmatic basis to create a
National Center of Excellence at Southeast Community College which can take the
national lead in the development of a dynamic and cooperative approach to
chemistry-based technician education. ***
