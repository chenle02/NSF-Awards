This project is creating hands-on biomedical engineering experiments and course
materials with a focus on artificial organs. These modules are being implemented
in freshman engineering courses and in core and elective courses in chemical,
mechanical and electrical engineering to expand the biomedical engineering
workforce. The modules are also being adapted for Grade 6-12 teachers and
students, which will expose more students to biomedical engineering careers.
Each module is being introduced with a medical case study which provides context
to motivate students and present ethical issues. Teams of students are engaging
in guided discovery through hands-on laboratory investigations, which maximizes
learning and enables them to discover underlying engineering principles to
inform their design of an artificial organ. The project's focus on social
relevance and teamwork is designed to increase diversity in engineering.
