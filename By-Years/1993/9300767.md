An international workshop on the experimental and theoretical aspects of the
physics associated with supersymmetry and related topics will be held at
Northeastern University March 29 - April 1, 1993. Supersymmetry relates
elementary particles with different amounts of spin, and is potentially the
answer to the puzzle of how different phenomena in particle physics can occur at
such vastly different energy scales. However, so far supersymmetry is just a
conjecture, and discussion of its theoretical status and future tests will be
very worthwhile.
