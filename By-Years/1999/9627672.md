9627672 Greschler The Computer Museum will develop two 2500 sq. ft. computer-
based exhibits the "Virtual Fishtank: Splashing Into Complex Systems". One
exhibit will be installed permanently in the Computer Museum and the other will
travel nationally for three to five years. These exhibits will use computer
modeling of fish to introduce the public to new ideas about complex systems
science and demonstrate the central concept that complex behaviors and patterns
can emerge from simple interactions among simple rules. Visitors will spend
eight to ten minutes designing their own fish at one of the ten FishBuilder
computer stations. As they make decisions, they will be able to observe the
effects of their rule selections on a computer display. When satisfied with
their design, visitors can then "tag" their fish by placing their initials on
fish tails and launch them in the central "fishtank". Large projection screens
will encircle visitors in a dramatic simulation of an underwater aquarium
environment. Visitors will observe and analyze how the few simple rules imbedded
in the design of individual fish give rise to complex behaviors and patterns in
the entire ecosystem. This exhibit draws on research conducted at MIT's Media
Lab, The Computer Museum, and the New England Aquarium and will be able to reach
people with a variety of learning styles. It anticipated completion date is
March, 1998 for the TCM's version and the traveling version will begin it's
national tour in September, 1998.
