The objective of this research is to show that commercially available relational
database management systems (RDBMS) would be better suited as a platform for
integrated, full-phase computer-aided software engineering (CASE) products if
they provided more sophisticated data integrity checking. Most CASE product
development includes its own data management; those few products which do
utilize a standard RDBMS tend to be of smaller and more limited scope. Using a
standard RDBMS and an open architecture would allow CASE tools to be developed
by persons with broader ranges of expertise and experience, would facilitate new
RDBMS advances to be made available immediately to the CASE product without
added effort or cost, and would encourage the central CASE data to be integrated
with the remainder of the corporate information. The tasks of this research
include: (l) to show that all the functionality that is available in current
products can be replicated in a RDBMS with an extended constraint management
subsystem, (2) to simulate that subsystem using a commercial RDBMS, and (3) to
define the minimum set of integrity constraint functions which must be
implemented.
