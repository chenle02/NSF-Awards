This is a proposal to develop a storm-time correction map that will improve the
ability of existing models to specify the variations in ionospheric density
associated with magnetic storms. During a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere can
be severely altered causing disruptions to communication and navigation systems.
This project takes advantage of the new understanding of the response of the
upper atmosphere to geomagnetic storms to develop a correction map for the mid
and high latitude ionosphere. Two approaches are planned. The first involves the
use of a physically-based Coupled Thermosphere Ionopshere Model, the second
involves capturing the essential physics in an empirical description. The study
will determine the most successful prescription for magnetospheric forcing of
the upper atmosphere and will develop a measure of accuracy of prediction.
