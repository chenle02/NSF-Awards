The ``Conference: Spectral Theory and Partial Differential Equations'' will be
held June 17-21, 2013 at the University of California-Los Angeles. The roots of
microlocal analysis,one of the main tools employed in the conference subject
area, go back to the beginning of the twentieth century, but its systematic
development began about fifty years ago with the theories of Pseudodifferential
Operators and Fourier Integral Operators. Since then these theories have
revolutionized the subject of partial differential equations. For example, they
have played decisive roles in finding the Atiayh-Singer formula for the index of
an elliptic operator and in solving the Weyl conjecture about the distribution
of eigenvalues for elliptic operators on manifolds, and they provided the
precise tools needed for studying the propagation of singularities for solutions
of hyperbolic equations on manifolds. Though microlocal analysis has been an
important part of linear PDE theory, it has also been successfully applied to
non-linear equations as well and there are numerous connections of microlocal
analysis to spectral theory, scattering theory, and inverse problems.

This mathematics research conference will bring together leading experts in
partial differential equations and it will consider a wide variety of research
topics in differential equations. The conference will increase communication
among mathematicians from different specialties and it will accelerate research
progress in several fields. The organizers plan to publish the talks presented
on the conference in a dedicated volume of the series Contemporary Mathematics
published by the American Mathematical Society. Special efforts will be made to
bring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to the conference and thereby
to stimulate the research of future mathematicians.
