The Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research
(CASPER) was founded eleven years ago to develop specialized computational
methods for radio astronomy. It has since become a community of hundreds of
scientists and engineers worldwide and their methods have become ubiquitous
throughout radio astronomy. Such numerically intensive methods require high-
performance computing hardware and specially designed software. This project
will support a conference that provides training and opportunities for students
to make contacts with representatives from industry. Funds will offset costs of
student registration, accommodation, and travel. This workshop will provide
students with specialized software development experience and direct access to
core developers and experienced researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CASPER has a
user community of about 600 scientists and engineers worldwide, and it is
supported by a current ATI award (AST-1407804). CASPER supports each of the top-
ranked radio astronomy initiatives of the last decadal review. This project will
support the CASPER Conference scheduled for 2017 August 14-18 at the California
Institute of Technology. The workshop will include morning presentations and
afternoon tutorials and breakout sessions. Tutorials will cover developing
software for Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Graphical Processing Units
(GPUs) in support of radio astronomy research goals such as pulsar search and
timing, searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), spectrometers, correlators, and
beamformers. Students will have the opportunity to meet and interact with
software developers and experienced researchers. Presentations from the
conference will be made publicly available on the conference and CASPER
websites.
