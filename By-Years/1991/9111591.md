The broad goals of this project are to gain a more precise understanding of the
potential of parallel computation, to recognize its limitations, and to design
computers and algorithms with optimal or near-optimal performance. The following
topics will be addressed: 1. The refinement of current models of parallel
computation through the incorporation of additional technological parameters. 2.
The design of special-purpose sorting hardware. 3. The feasibility of general
purpose parallel computers based on sorting. 4. The design and analysis of
fault-tolerant sorting circuits.
