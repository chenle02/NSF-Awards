9508987 Hillis Biologists have long been interested in the history of life, and
the last few decades have been accompanied by major expansion in the areas of
biology concerned with reconstructing these histories. There are now many
different methods that can be used to reconstruct history, and there have been
several new applications of the methods, such as discovering the US hantavirus
and its animal reservoirs, as well as helping to determine whether health
professionals infected their patients with HIV. An inherent difficulty in this
important field of science is that there is usually no way to truly know the
histories of the organisms being studied, hence it is difficult to know hmw
often reconstruction methods fail. In the study proposed here, we will overcome
that limitation. A virus will be grown in the laboratory to generate lineages
with known ancestries. DNA sequences and other characteristics will be obtained
from the resulting lineages. The success of reconstruction methods will be
tested directly by comparing the estimated histories with the known histories.
The data will also be studied for unusual properties that may thwart recovering
history, such as the possibility of molecular convergence resulting from common
selective pressures. %%% This study should impact the field of systematic
biology both in establishing an empirical methodology for experimental phylogeny
construction and in providing direct tests of phylogenetic inference
methodology. ***
