This full-scale development project would use a multi-platform approach (TV,
Field School, and Web site) to engage public audiences and underserved youth in
archaeology research and discovery. The project will advance knowledge and
practice in the field of ISE by establishing the utility of archaeology as an
entry point to multiple STEM fields showing how it answers important questions
about human origins-culture, history, and the natural environment. The target
audience includes a broad demographic of viewers who will watch the PBS
broadcasts. The other key audience is underserved youth who will participate in
the archeology digs and be featured in the national broadcast. They will engage
other underserved youth who will have the opportunity to participate in the
interactive online virtual field school. Primary organizational partners include
the Crow Canyon Archaeology Center in Colorado and other archeology
organizations at the 4 field sites.

Deliverables include four hours of PBS programming filmed at four archaeological
sites telling the stories of diverse cultures (Native American, African
American, Hispanic); field schools designed for underrepresented youth both
onsite and online; blogs, online discussions, and user-generated videos. The
evaluation will determine the impact of the television series, online content,
and the on-site Field School on audiences' understanding of, interest in, and
interactions around STEM topics within the context of archaeology. Formative
evaluation will provide input and help refine the television programs, web site,
and field school. The summative evaluation will use a variety of methods and
artifacts to determine the degree to which the process of the TV series, web
site, and Field School was successful.

The television programs are expected to reach 13 million viewers via broadcast,
300,000 via streaming video and 50,000 unique web site visitors. The lessons
learned from this project will be disseminated to other media and ISE
organizations.
