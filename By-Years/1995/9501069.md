The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology using
inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloadditions utilizing indole and pyrrole
as dienophiles. Targets of the methodology include Aspidosperma alkaloids, beta-
carbolines, carbazole alkaloids and azaindole analogues of indole alkaloids.
With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
John K. Snyder of the Department of Chemistry at Boston University. Professor
Snyder will focus his work on the use of cycloaddition methodology for the
synthesis of alkaloid natural products that have interesting biological
properties
