AST 0098701&lt;br/&gt;Zweibel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic magnetic field
is a major component of the interstellar medium. Although the origin of the
field remains a mystery, many of the processes which maintain the field in its
current state have now been identified. One of the most important of these
processes is diffusive transport, which changes the distribution of magnetic
flux to mass despite the high conductivity of interstellar gas. Dr. Ellen
Zweibel, at the University of Colorado, will pursue two research projects
directed at understanding diffusive transport of the interstellar magnetic
field. The first project concerns the field strengths in molecular clouds, which
impact molecular cloud dynamics and star formation. The second project concerns
the escape of magnetic flux from the Galactic disk, its implications for the
vertical structure of the Galactic magnetic field, and its impact on the
Galactic dynamo. These projects are related through their joint dependence on
ambipolar drift and turbulence. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
