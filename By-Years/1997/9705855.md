9705855 Hollister The Himalaya has long been recognized as an example of
continent-continent collision, and has received considerable study despite
various logistical and political problems. It is apparent that manifestation of
the collision of India with Asia are different along the trend of the Himalayas.
This study is part of an international project in the Kingdom at Bhutan, eastern
Himalayas where some evidence indicates that the Higher Himalayan crystallines
of Bhutan extruded south as a hot ductile penetratively flowing mass over cooler
rocks and cooled rapidly enough to preserve temperature inversions in
metamorphic reactions. The work involves extensive thermobarometry on samples
collected near the main central thrust and other deformation zones. Results are
expected to contribute to understanding of the processes of high-level ductile
extrusion in such continent-continent collisions.
