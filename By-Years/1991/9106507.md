In this project the principal investigator will continue his fine work on
problems that lie on the border between harmonic analysis and partial
differential equations. The main goal of his work is the description of harmonic
measure for the exterior of a convex domain. A key question is to provide a
bound on the second variation of the electrostatic capacity that is analgous to
the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the volume. Other topics for study are the
behavior of nodal lines of eigenfunctions of free boundary problems, mixed
boundary value problems in Lipschitz domains and L-p estimates for Airy-type
operators. The two subjects of harmonic analysis and partial differential
equations figure prominently in the branch of mathematics known as classical
analysis. Indeed, harmonic analysis grew out of Fourier analysis, which was
developed to help solve various types of partial differential equations. In this
project the principal investigator will work on problems that span both of these
areas. In particular, he will try to describe the harmonic measure of the
exterior of a convex domain and he will study various types of boundary value
problems using techniques from the theory of harmonic functions.
