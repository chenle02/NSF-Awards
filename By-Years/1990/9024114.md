This project will attempt to quantify the effects of variations in the major
ice-atmosphere energy budget terms on the arctic sea ice concentration and
distribution. Observational studies have shown the existence of a variety of
interrelationships between the atmosphere and the sea ice, but modeling studies
are required to identify and quantify forcing mechanisms, directions of
operation, and the sensitivity of the interactions to changes in the state of
the ocean and the atmosphere. Specifically, this project will make use of a ten-
year data set to construct forcing functions for a coupled sea ice-radiative
transfer model. Sensitivity studies will be conducted to identify specific
climatically interesting regions, to determine if intense short- term events
affect the long-term sea ice state, and to define the overall limits of the
arctic climate system.
