The objectives of this research are (1) the analysis and interpretation of
radar and aircraft observations obtained during the Hawaiian Rainband Project
(1990), and (2) participation in the Convection and Precipitation
Electrification Experiment (CaPE) in Florida to obtain observations on the shape
of raindrops, in particular the effects of their variability on the scattering
of microwaves including polarization.
