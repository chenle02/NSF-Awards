9307190 Amy This is an award to provide support for research to develop a
comprehensive model that describes the competitive sorption of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons in water by minerals bound and naturally present organic
matter. The investigators plan on relating the transport of hydrophobic organic
compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to factors that facilitate or
retard them by sorption on materials through which the water flows. The
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to be studied span the solubility range from
naphthalene to benzo(alpha)anthracene. The natural organic matter will include
standard reference humic substances as well as that in natural soils. Minerals
used will include quartz, goethite, calcite, kaolinite and montmorillonite alone
and in various combinations typical of aquifers. The result of this project is
expected to be a mathematical model that describes transport characteristics of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater when subjected to contact with
naturally present organic matter and aquifer minerals. Its potential use will be
in the design and operation of processes and systems for remediation of
groundwater and soil that has been contaminated with hydrocarbons.
