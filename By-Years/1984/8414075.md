The objective of this project is to develop a complete set of instructions and
verifications for damage assessment based on pattern recognition theories and
decision-making processes. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to conduct
research in mathematical formulation, computer program development, collection
and syntheses of expert knowledge and performance of case studies,
identification of structural features relevant to damages, and continuing
calibration of the methodology developed.
