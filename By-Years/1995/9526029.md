9526029 McNeil For both older and newer cities, brownfields industrial sites
which are often vacant because they do not meet the strict remediation
requirements of the Superfund law, are both a resource and a liability.
Brownfield sites represent an opportunity to build the tax base and rejuvenate
decaying infrastructure and depressed communities. With ever increasing
pressures on existing infrastructure from both development and age, and the
opportunities for more rational approaches to site redemption, brownfields and
their associated infrastructure offer an attractive alternative to greenfield
sites. Particularly since increasing restrictions and public opposition to
greenfield development slows down the development process. The interdisciplinary
three year research program addresses the implications of brownfield development
for urban infrastructure and the impact of urban infrastructure on brownfield
development. The research will focus on information management and rational
decision making using the City of Pittsburgh as a case study. ***
