A program of development and refinement of facilities for neutron
interferometry is carried out at the University of Missouri Research Reactor
(MURR) and at the NIST Research Reactor's Cold Neutron Research Facility, where
a new neutron interferometry station will be built as a collaborative program.
These facilities will be applied to the study of various aspects of neutron
Schroedinger Wave Optics, including the following: 1) Aharonov-Casher
topological phase shift; 2) Wave-packet reconstruction with a crystal analyzer;
3) Scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect; 4) Development of large-scale interferometers;
5) Search for quaternions in quantum mechanics; 6) Gravitationally-induced
quantum interference; 7) Michelson-Morley experiment with neutrons; 8) Search
for phase shift due to the coupling of neutron spin to rotation; 9) Wheeler
delayed-choice experiment; and 10) Effect of the moon and sun upon quantum
interference.
