This award is for support of a project to evaluate processes occurring at the
grounding line of polar glaciers in order to constrain both glaciological and
oceanographic models. A Remotely- Operated Submersible Vehicle (ROV) will be
used to help obtain the data. The project will examine the physical processes
involved in the release of debris from the glacier and its dispersal in the ice-
proximal marine environment. Sedimentary processes, surface sedimentary facies,
and biological communities will be studied to improve interpretation of older
glacial sedimentary facies.
