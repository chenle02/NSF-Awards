This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
and commercialize novel monodisperse ceramic membranes and membrane-reactors.
Our innovation is based on self-organized anodic alumina with precisely
engineered porous structure and previously unattainable pore size (down to 1 nm
or less), greatly enhanced chemical and thermal stability, and superb mechanical
properties. Commercially available anodic alumina membranes have limited
practical application due to their fragility, susceptibility to acid and base
attack, as well as the lack of membranes with pore size smaller than 100 nm for
symmetrical membranes. The proposed approach addresses these limitations by
combining innovative synthesis of highly ordered nanoporous anodic alumina with
symmetrical porosity, conversion of anodic alumina into polycrystalline ceramic
while preserving its morphology, and conformal deposition of functional layers.
The proposed technology will enable the fine-tuning of the pore diameter in the
ranges from below 1 nm to 200 nm. Deposition of materials inside the nanopores
will afford desired functionality.

The membranes will target selected applications, such as fuel cell reformers
sized for Next Generation Vehicles, integrated mesoscopic power sources for
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as future portable energy
sources.
