The atomic nucleus has been observed to exist in a variety of shapes including
spherical, prolate (like a rugby ball), oblate (like a door knob), and even
octupole (like a pear). In addition, a single nucleus may have multiple shapes
depending on how much excitation energy and/or angular momentum it possesses.
Even more exotic shapes than those mentioned have been predicted by theorists
based upon their understanding of the forces between the protons and neutrons.
This program of research is based on finding experimental evidence for these
unusual shapes. Almost all of the shapes described have at least one axis of
symmetry. That is, an axis exists where the mass distribution is perfectly
symmetric about it. Nuclei that are asymmetric, i.e. lacking a symmetry axis,
have been predicted for decades, but compelling evidence of their existence has
been limited until very recently, where a few nuclei were found to exhibit
"wobbling" behavior. This project will search for other examples beyond the very
small sample that have been found to date. Perhaps even more exotic is the
recent prediction of nuclei possessing a tetrahedral shape, that is, having a
very-rounded pyramid structure. We plan to look for such nuclei by observing the
pattern of gamma rays emitted when such nuclei decay; these can provide the
signature for the existence of tetrahedral shapes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students from the U.S. Naval Academy and
graduate students from Florida State University will take the lead in analyzing
these data sets. These projects will expose these students to the nuclear
science field as a possible career choice.
