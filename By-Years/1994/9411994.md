9411994 Williams Nontraditional Manufacturing processes are being used to
produce geometrically complex and highly accurate parts from modern materials.
This project involves an effort to link abrasive flow machining (AFM) research
with a leading machine tool builder of the equipment. The project will involve
the principal investigator spending one summer at the machine tool builder. The
project entails three major objectives: (1) Integration of abrasive flow
machining research results into industrial applications. Particularly, the use
of the acoustic emission monitoring system. (2) Involvement of graduate
engineering students in the AFM research projects. This will include students
from colleges and universities. (3) Exposure of the academic researcher to the
competitive issues facing the machine tool builders. Expected benefits include
enhanced technology of the abrasive flow-machining systems, greater
understanding of AFM and better awareness of industry needs, and the
establishment of long-term collaborative research efforts.
