The Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the&lt;br/&gt;University
of Iowa will purchase computer equipment (a Microway &lt;br/&gt;Beowulf cluster
for intensive computation as well as 3 workstations &lt;br/&gt;for individual
faculty at a total cost of $88411) which will be dedicated &lt;br/&gt;to the
support of research in computational, applied, and theoretical
&lt;br/&gt;statistics. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
&lt;br/&gt;including in particular:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. The extension,
implementation and application of&lt;br/&gt; posterior simulators (John
Geweke)&lt;br/&gt; 2. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and
convergence&lt;br/&gt; assessment in Bayesian hierarchical models with
application to&lt;br/&gt; spatial and temporal modeling (Mary Kathryn
Cowles)&lt;br/&gt; 3. Analysis of unreplicated experiments (Russell
Lenth)&lt;br/&gt; 4. On Inference in Continuous-Time Models &lt;br/&gt; with
Applications to Finance (Osnat Stramer)&lt;br/&gt; 5. Analysis of surface
roughness data and studying the properties &lt;br/&gt; of fractal dimension
estimator in a class of stationary &lt;br/&gt; non-Gaussian random fields (Grace
Chan)&lt;br/&gt;
