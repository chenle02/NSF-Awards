The International Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference aims to
facilitate cross-cultural collaboration across the cognitive, educational,
developmental and neural sciences. The biennial IMBES meeting is a unique
opportunity for scholars and educators to come together to engage in reciprocal
dialogue about research and practice. Researchers investigating learning
processes have the opportunity to share the results of their work with educators
and receive feedback on the translational opportunities for the research. In
turn, educators can update their understanding of the cognitive, developmental
and neural bases of learning and share their knowledge of efficacious
techniques, tools, and classroom practices with researchers. IMBES has now
formed a partnership with the EARLI SIG 22, and they plan to meet jointly in
2021 and in 2022. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a leading venue for building the
science of learning, the 2021 IMBES conference includes the following
objectives: (1) To build diversity in the attendees with travel fellowship; (2)
To build diversity with a symposium addressing diversity in the science of
learning; (3) To facilitate formation of a Global Science of Learning Network
with travel fellowships to attend a pre-conference meeting. Conference abstracts
and poster presentations will be available on the IMBES website (www.imbes.org)
after the conference and selected papers will invited from the conference for
peer review for possible publication in a special issue of the societyâ€™s
journal, Mind, Brain and Education. To the extent possible, key sessions at the
conference will be live-streamed and/or video-recorded for audiences who are
unable to attend, including classroom teachers, educational administrators and
policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
