Recent volcanic activity on Monteserrat in the Lesser Antilles has led to
generation of pyroclastic flows by the collapse of growing andesitic dome. Some
flows have been sufficiently mobile to have traveled over the sea surface while
other parts interact explosively in shallow water. A delta is being constructed
on the east coast of the island and shoaling of 150 m at a distance of three km
offshore has been measured. The project will study these flows during a nine-day
marine geological survey using side-scan sonar, Chirp II and bubble pulser
system, from a locally charted vessel. The results will lead to better
understanding of the depositional mechanisms of pyroclastic flows and the types
of deposits that form in the marine environment.
