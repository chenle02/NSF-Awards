9560678 Kwan This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
addresses a novel concept in amphibious vehicles. The vehicle would drive on
normal roads at customary speeds and yet provide off-road traction equal to that
of tracked vehicles. It would utilize a series of co-axial half wheels in
tandem, adjusted and synchronized to maintain road contact at constant height
above ground and thus maintain smooth vehicular movement at speed. When
operating in water, the half wheels provide efficient propulsion, with no wheel
adjustment required in landing on a beach. Phase I will conduct feasibility
tests with a powered model. Commercial applications are potentially in use as
amphibious vehicles for recreational and rescue purposes. It may also find use
at farm and construction sites while affording convenient travel on conventional
raods at normal speeds.
