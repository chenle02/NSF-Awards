Thermodynamics and transport properties of liquid-crystalline mixtures - Theory
and Experiment Liquid crystals (LC), especially their mixtures, are used
extensively in many technological applications, and in biological systems their
presence is widespread. Despite their importance, an understanding of their
thermodynamics and transport properties is very poor, especially at the
microscopic level. In this research the PI will use statistical mechanical
theories (both the composition-space DFT as well as the traditional
configuration-space DFT), molecular simulation, and experiment to study the
dynamics and thermodynamic behavior of LC substances in the presence of various
types of solutes. These studies are designed to satisfy several goals,
including: (1) to explore the limits of both types of DFT; (2) to produce a
comprehensive set of experimental data on the behavior of LC mixtures; (3) to
validate some model potentials through comparison with the experimental data;
and (4) to provide a molecular-level understanding of the behavior of LC
mixtures to a degree which cannot be achieved by any other means.
