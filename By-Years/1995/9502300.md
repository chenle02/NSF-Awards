This research is on path delay testing. Tools and techniques to enable the
development and evaluation of practical at-speed delay tests are being
investigated. Test generators, fault simulators, and techniques for the design
of design-for-testability (DFT) and built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry are
being developed. Special attention is being paid to robust delay testing of the
most critical circuit paths. Software tools which provide a practical testing
solution for large circuits are being developed.
