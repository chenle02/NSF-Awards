This proposal is a request for funding to establish and operate an IGERT
National Recruitment Program (INRP) that will serve all of the Integrative
Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) sites in the United States
(soon to be 100 sites). The goal will be to identify potential IGERT students
and to facilitate their recruitment by the IGERT sites. A high priority will be
to increase the participation of under-represented groups including women and
minorities. The national recruitment program will identify these students and
educate them and their mentors regarding IGERT programs and future career
opportunities. The INRP will assess student backgrounds and creer interests and
will facilitate contact between prospective students and the directors and
faculty of the appropriate IGERT program(s). This represents a partnership
between the INRP and the IGERT directors and faculty to recruit students into
appropriate IGERT sites and related opportunities. Recruitment will occur at
colleges and universities throughout the United States and at national and
regional minority student science conferences.
