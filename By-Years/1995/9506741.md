9506741 Nei This award supports a joint U.S.-Japan Workshop on Molecular
Evolution to explore two topics of current interest: 1) theory and practice of
molecular phylogenetics; and 2) molecular evolution of morphogenesis and
adaptive characters. Researchers who are early in their careers will be the
primary participants at this workshop. The workshop will be held on August
26-27, 1995 at the Graduate School of Advanced Studies, Hayama, Japan and is
being held in conjunction with the Third International Meeting of the Society
for Molecular Biology and Evolution. This workshop in molecular evolution
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
young investigators from the United States and Japan to meet and discuss
research problems of mutual interest and importance. It is the expectation of
the program that research partnerships will develop from this opportunity. ***
