This project, designing and developing 'ScaleMed', an open-source instrument,
aims to accelerate the progression of mHealth technologies from lab prototypes
to at-scale clinical trials. The instrument impacts the area of healthcare,
currently one of the biggest societal challenges. By providing a streamlined
method to include diverse devices, the instrument will make significant
contributions to the field. Using open-standards-compliant protocols, ScaleMed
will help open doors to new at-scale clinical trials and lower the technology
barrier. Since the infrastructure will be open-source and will serve as a
community resource, its impact will scale with its user populations. Finally,
the educational and outreach plan will certainly have a high impact, in the
critical area of mHealth.

The instrument consists of three components: Hardware Adaptor; Medical
Application Modules, Libraries and Templates; and Cloud Control and Management.
The instrument will be available as open-source to the entire community. Its
immediate deployment is foreseen in three mHealth projects currently led by the
PIs: SOLVD: a smartphone based tracking systems for conditions of depression;
mobileVision, a smartphone based retinal imager; and mobileSpiro, a portable
personalized spirometer.
