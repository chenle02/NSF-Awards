Marginal Models refer to models built on the structure of generalized linear
models, but extended beyond the Gaussian case to a wide class of distributions
for discrete or continuous- valued variables. This project will extend these
models to growth curve models with particular emphasis on discrete data.
Implementation of software, particularly for modest computing support will be
undertaken as part of this project. When individuals are observed over a period
of time, the objective of the data analysis is usually both to examine the
pattern of change for the individuals and to examine the commonalities of these
patterns among individuals. Often this leads to distinctions among groups of
individuals or to associating features of these patterns with particular
attributes of the groups. This research will develop statistical procedures for
this kind of analysis.
