The objectives of this project are to produce new knowledge on the molecular
genetics and enzymology of anaerobic butyric clostridia that will allow
beneficial genetic alterations of the cell metabolism for a variety of
applications. Butyric acid clostridia have an excellent potential for industrial
applications to produce commodity and specialty chemicals. The current knowledge
base on the genetics, regulation and metabolism of these cells has been limited,
but considerable progress has been made by work on previous grants. This project
will continue the study of gene regulation, develop further the expression
systems in clostridia, and evaluate other factors involved in the regulation of
metabolic pathways in clostridia.
