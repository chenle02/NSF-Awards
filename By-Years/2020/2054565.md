Many complex systems behave in a random fashion at the smallest scales. Why then
does the world around us appear to be so predictable? This is explained in a
very general context by a principle known as concentration of measure: smooth
functions of many independent random variables behave in an essentially
predictable manner. Precise mathematical formulations of this phenomenon provide
powerful tools for studying complex random structures. This project aims to
study new concentration phenomena that arise from unexpected connections with
several different areas of mathematics: from the study of embeddings (how well
can data be represented in a particular space?); from the study of exotic shapes
which date back to old problems in geometry from over a century ago; and from
the study of non homogeneous random matrices, which are widely used in modern
data science. The unusual features of these problems motivate the development of
the theory in new directions, as well as the introduction of new tools that may
be applied to a wide range of random structures that arise in both pure and
applied mathematics. The project includes educational, mentoring and outreach
activities that are aimed at attracting and training the next generation of
mathematicians, and at increasing participation and diversity in the
mathematical sciences. It also provides research training opportunities for
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to
systematically develop novel concentration phenomena that arise from problems in
probability, functional analysis, metric geometry, and convex geometry. The
project is organized around three topics. The first topic aims to develop a
general theory of concentration inequalities for functions taking values in
normed spaces. The second topic aims to understand certain long-standing
questions in convex geometry that may be viewed as unusual analogues of the
concentration phenomenon. The third topic is concerned with concentration
inequalities for the norms of non-homogeneous random matrices. The investigation
of concentration phenomena in nonstandard settings motivates new questions and
the development of new tools that are both of direct probabilistic significance,
and that provide new perspectives on problems in other areas of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
