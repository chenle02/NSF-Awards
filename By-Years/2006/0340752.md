0340752&lt;br/&gt;Chrobak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year U.S.-France
cooperative research project in computer science involves Marek Chrobak at the
University of California, Riverside and French researchers, Philippe Baptiste at
the Ecole Polytechnique and Christoph Durr at the Universite Paris Sud. Their
objective is to design efficient algorithms for scheduling problems arising in
real-time systems and multi-user computer systems with service quality
constraints. To model such constraints, they focus on techniques for speeding-up
dynamic programming algorithms for scheduling problems and on very fast
algorithms that compute near-optimal schedules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
takes advantage of complementary expertise of the U.S. and French researchers in
algorithm design and analysis and computer theory. A U.S. graduate student will
participate in the design, analysis, and implementation of the developed
algorithms and is expected to base his doctoral dissertation on this research.
Computational problems in other areas of scheduling may apply the developed
algorithms. These ideas include approximation methods for solving scheduling
problems, and new performance measures for online problems.
