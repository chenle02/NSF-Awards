This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need to
improve the state of the art in efficient air disinfection by introducing a
novel disinfection reactor developed around an optimized proprietary optical
design in conjunction with an engineered suite of wavelengths delivered by
Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes (UV LEDs). Despite the numerous benefits of
LED based units, high UV LED costs currently restrict the commercial viability
of UV LED based Air Disinfection units. Dot Metrics Technologies is proposing to
develop a 10X to 20X cheaper disinfection unit by dramatically improving
efficiency of the disinfection unit. This will be accomplished by creating an
optimal optical design solution to air disinfection.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is project is immediate
and long-term. Over 1.7 million healthcare associated infections (HAI) occur
annually in the U.S. alone with an overall annual direct medical cost of HAI to
U.S. hospitals ranging $28.4 to $33.8 billion. Drug resistance of pathogenic
microorganisms that cause HAI is a growing problem. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging worldwide as a community acquired
infection, and M. tuberculosis, which is known for its significant airborne
transmission potential, has also become multi-drug resistant. As drug treatments
grow increasingly inadequate against airborne pathogens, innovative, engineered
UV disinfection systems such as the proposed solution may be one of the few
remaining means to resolve the problem. In addition, increased use of mercury
free UV technology will results in reduced hazardous environmental risks, and
reduced costs associated with hazardous materials disposal.
