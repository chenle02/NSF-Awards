This program will include quantitative studies of the fluorescence spectra
emitted by atoms during transient excitation by strong, nearly resonant, laser
fields. Emphasis will be placed on elucidation of features of the non-stationary
spectra that differ from those observed in the steady-state. Studies of atomic
dynamics in the presence of transient bichromatic excitation fields will also be
carried out.
