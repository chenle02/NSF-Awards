This action funds Patricia Yang of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a
research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Lab of Marine
Resources Management in National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
The project title is "Aero-Hydrodynamics of Flying Fish." The host scientist is
Dr. Shui-Kai Chang.

Flying fish perform specialized kinematics and fin morphing in order to rapidly
transition from swimming underwater to gliding in air. The project is to
elucidate the novel mechanisms used by flying fish to propel themselves
efficiently and stably in both air and water. A series of experimental fluid
dynamic studies are being conducted on larval flying fish raised in the
laboratory. This study provides original data on kinematics, morphology, and
surface wetting properties of the body and appendages that facilitate propulsion
on both sides of the air-water interface.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow's work will be disseminated
through publication in journals and Popular Mechanics and other widely read
magazines. The Fellow will organize a conservation group for flying fish to
increase understanding of both the fluid mechanics involved in locomotion, and
the effect of human behavior on sustainability of flying fish in the wild.
