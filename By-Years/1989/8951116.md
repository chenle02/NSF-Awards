This award provides funds to purchase equipment that will allow faculty to
develop an alternative version of an introductory psychology laboratory course
(Learning & Motivation) that is an integral part of the undergraduate psychology
curriculum at Northeastern University. This alternative course substitutes human
laboratory and animal field experiments for traditional animal laboratory
studies. Major equipment items to be purchased include portable event and video
recorders, and video cameras for field experiments of animal learning. Also to
be purchased are standard video recording equipment, personal computers,
software packages, printers and interfaces for laboratory studies of behavioral
and physiological conditioning in humans. Examination of the history and
rationale for using laboratory animals in this introductory course indicate that
the field has matured to the point where the original reasons for doing so are
no longer viable or essential to meet pedagogical goals of the science. Equally
important, the new version will enhance the student's learning experience in
important ways and draw attention to the fact that behavioral scientists are
sensitive to animal welfare issues and willing to make considered changes. The
proposed course will serve as an attractive model for hundreds of colleagues who
teach this type of laboratory course throughout the United States.
