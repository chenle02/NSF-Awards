The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enabling the expansion of the Internet of
Things (IoT) through new functions and applications requiring greater wires-free
power than available by battery. IoT is an ever-widening array of everyday
objects interconnected via the Internet and transforming the way we live and
work. "Smart devices" inter-networking in homes, businesses, vehicles, public
spaces and elsewhere are an essential driver of the big data revolution,
enabling innumerable societal benefits such as improved efficiencies, assure
safety, and increase productivity. The growth of IoT devices has been enabled by
the miniaturization, modularization, and cost reduction of common chipsets as
well as increased intelligence in low-power consumption. IoT products that
utilize existing wired power - e.g. smart lights, TVs, speakers, thermostats,
security cameras, personal digital assistants, etc. - have dominated the market.
Increasingly, however, stand-alone battery-powered IoT devices are gaining
traction; but while battery technology is improving, the cost, complexity and
downtime of battery replacement and/or recharging are major constraints. This
project aims to develop a new type of indoor light harvesting technology capable
of efficiently converting ambient indoor light into the electrical energy needed
to power wire-free IoT products.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims
to demonstrate and develop perovskite PV technology with the efficiency,
uniformity, and durability needed for high-impact indoor IoT applications.
Visible light is the most ubiquitous ambient power source available in places
where humans live, work and gather, but existing light harvesting methods - e.g.
crystalline and amorphous silicon PV cells - do not efficiently convert typical
indoor light to electricity. For example, state-of-the-art amorphous silicon
cells give only 3.6-7% efficiency under typical indoor lighting conditions. In
order to enable new IoT products, a photovoltaic material that operates above
30% efficiency under a range of indoor lighting conditions is needed to unlock
new levels of power available for sensors and communications that batteries may
not easily supply. This project will demonstrate cell designs, film deposition
and processing techniques needed to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite PV and
to scale perovskite PV from university laboratory sizes to commercial IoT
product sizes.
