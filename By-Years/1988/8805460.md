The objective of this work is the effect cumular convection has on the large
scale atmospheric circulation and the circumstances of the latter that seems to
initiate the former. These feedback effects will be investigated using three
dimensional numerical simulations with consequent regard for the scale of
convective motion, and other essential boundary conditions. The results will be
examined in terms of large scale forcing the spectral characteristics of
convective heating.
