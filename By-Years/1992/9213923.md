Bank Street College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to NYSERnet. NYSERnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
New York. NYSERnet will provide operations management and information services
and it will provide Bank Street College with a 19.2 thousand bits per second
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the school to explore innovative educational resources.***//
