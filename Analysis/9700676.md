Proposal: DMS-9700676 PI: Carlen, Harrell, Loss The proposal is for an
International Conference on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics to
be held in March, 1997 at Georgia Tech. The program will include lectures on
nonlinear partial differential equations, spectral and scattering theory,
variational and topological methods, bifurcation and normal forms, and symmetry
analysis. The support is to be used for travel and local expenses for speakers
and for a discount and travel expenses for regional and minority participants.
