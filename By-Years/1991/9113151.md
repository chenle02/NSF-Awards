This study is an investigation of the mechanisms of heat transfer associated
with plume formation occurring during the interaction of laser radiation with
metal targets. The primary objective of the study is the development of
techniques which can be used to determine the relative importance of plume
absorption, scattering, and emission on coupling of laser energy into metal
targets. The methods used include high speed photography, target temperature
measurement, plume light scattering and transmission measurements, and
calibrated plume emission spectroscopy. A pulsed Nd-YAG laser is used as the
primary source of incident laser radiation at flux levels of 105 W/cm2 and
greater. Aluminum and aluminum alloy materials are used as targets. Another
objective of this study is the investigation of the role of the assist gas on
plume ionization and coupling of laser energy into the workpiece. The influence
of molecular oxygen on degree of plume ionization is studied by performing tests
in various atmospheres with and without molecular oxygen. The significance of
this study is that a clearer understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms
associated with plume formation is expected to be obtained. This study will help
accomplish the long term goal of this research program which is to provide an
understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in laser target interaction so that
lasers may be utilized to their full advantage in materials processing.
