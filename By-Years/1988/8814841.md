This research will consider numerical methods for highly advective flow
problems with particular application to simulation of flows in porous media and
incompressible flows modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Discretization by
operator splitting methods will be emphasized. The advection operator will be
approximated using the modified method of characteristics, and diffusion-
dispersion or viscosity and the Stokes problem will be dealt with using finite
element methods. This work should provide new insight into flows in unsaturated
zones and flows in fractured media.
