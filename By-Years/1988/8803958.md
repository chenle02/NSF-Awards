This is a petrochemical study of xenoliths which have been collected from seven
regionally distinct outcrops of Patagonian plateau lavas of southernmost South
America. Xenoliths from these sites include a variety of mantle-derived types.
This will provide the first analytical data from six of the sites, as well as
extend the previously published results of xenoliths from the seventh. The goal
of the study is to clearify aspects of magmagenesis and the nature and evolution
of continental lithosphere in an Andean- type oceanic-continental convergent
plate-boundary environment. Major and trace element and isotopic analysis of
whole-rock and constituent minerals will be used to estimate the conditions of
equilibration of the xenoloths so that lithologic and thermal cross-sections
through different regions of the southern South American continental lithosphere
can be constructed.
