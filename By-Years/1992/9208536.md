Theoretical game theory focusses on identifying stable equilibrium solutions to
strategic behavior. However, many empirical strategic contexts exhibit complex,
erratic, or evolutionary strategies over time. For example, in competition when
"winning" in addition to merely "Doing well" is important, such as arms races
where states are concerned with relative security, a wide range of dynamical
strategic behavior is possible. This project examines iterated strategies in the
cases where empirical choices do not result in a stable equilibrium. The project
takes a game-theoretic context and using laboratory experiments, applies the
conceptual and methodological tools of chaotic dynamical systems. This approach
allows for complex and varied strategies resulting from relatively simple
interactive relationships.
