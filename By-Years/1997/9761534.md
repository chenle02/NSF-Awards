*** 9761534 Marx Sight Systems Inc. will develop a low cost, high speed critical
dimension measurement tool for 0.18 m features in the IC and data storage
industry. This tool takes advantage of an optical technique developed at the
California Institute of Technology, that exploits the polarization properties of
light diffracted by a subwavelength-sized structure. The cost per measurement of
the tool developed will be less than one twelfth that of existing, competing SEM
or AFM technologies. ***
