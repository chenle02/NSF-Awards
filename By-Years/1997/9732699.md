Crystal plasticity based models and simulation tools are developed for bulk
deformation processes involving large deformations in both low stacking fault
energy (SFE) fcc metals as well as in hcp metals with good predictive
capabilities for both the anisotropic stress-strain response as well as the
averaged crystallographic texture. a-brass (a low SFE fcc metal) and
commercially pure titanium (hcp metal) are used as model materials for the
study. The study has a strong impact on the metal working industry as it
provides predictive tools that yield a large amount of quantitative information
on microstructure evolution during deformation. The microstructural state of a
material is important as it plays a governing role in shape and size control
during deformation processing, structural integrity of the produced component,
and its performance characteristics in service.
