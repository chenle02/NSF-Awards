Trace elements (those present at the parts-per-million level) play a critical
role in virtually all biological processes; they are essential to life but can
also be toxic if present at the wrong concentration. Consequently, the trace
element levels within cells tend to be tightly regulated, with a complex set of
machinery to control the "inorganic physiology" of cells, that is, the
regulation, uptake, storage, and efflux of trace elements. Although there have
been many studies of trace elements in biology, virtually all have relied on
bulk analyses (e.g., how much metal is present on average in an ensemble of
cells; and how does this change as a function of chemical and/or biological
treatment?). The new instrument that will be developed will permit the direct
determination of the concentrations of trace elements in intact individual
cells. The instrument will allow, for the first time, facile determination of
the inorganic composition of individual cells, thereby providing direct insight
into the distribution of compositions within the population, and permitting
studies aimed at correlating other cellular properties with chemical
composition. By permitting determination of not only average concentrations but
also the cell-to-cell variations in individual concentrations, and by allowing
these data to be correlated with conventional measures of cell status, this will
provide a transformative capability, opening the possibility of dissecting the
cellular roles of both essential and toxic trace elements with an unprecedented
level
