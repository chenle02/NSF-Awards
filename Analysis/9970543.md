Abstract Misiurewicz

The objective of the project is to perform research in the theory of dynamical
systems, mainly low-dimensional, both smooth and continuous. The Principal
Investigator will apply analytical, topological and combinatorial tools in order
to investigate real and complex systems. The main parts of the project are
devoted to the study of the attractors for rational functions, rotation sets for
maps of trees and graphs, entropy of the 2-dimensional golden mean shift (using
methods developed for studying one-dimensional systems), and nonautonomous
discrete dynamical systems, both low-dimensional and general. For almost every
phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Economy and other
sciences one can make a mathematical model that can be regarded as a dynamical
system. Sometimes the study of this system is extremely difficult, but quite
often it can be reduced to the study of a much simpler, low dimensional one.
This project is devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of this
type of systems from the mathematical point of view. The results that can be
obtained are usually much stronger than in the general case.
