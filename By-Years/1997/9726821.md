This SGER award will support analysis of stable isotopes in individual specimens
of planktic foraminifera collected in sediment traps from the equatorial Pacific
and off Bermuda. The objective is to determine whether isotopic ratios are
dependent upon ambient-water alkalinity as observed in controlled laboratory
experiments. If an alkalinity effect exists and can be quantified, published
interpretations of changes in ocean production, circulation, and pCO2 based upon
foraminiferal isotope data will require revision.
