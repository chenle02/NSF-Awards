This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in
Political Science through SUNY, Stony Brook. The project provides the
opportunity for eight undergraduate students to be immersed into an active
research environment spanning topics from the demise of consensual norms on the
U.S. Supreme Court to the propensity of nations to wage war as a function of
their prior war experience. The students will work as apprentices under the
close supervision of faculty mentors and experienced graduate students. The goal
is to introduce students to the latest, state-of-the-art equipment and
methodological techniques. Also, students will be introduced to ethical aspects
of scientific research through a series of six seminars focusing on current
ethical questions in social research. In addition to the research experience,
participants will receive academic counseling and have access to a variety of
support services. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts
to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.
