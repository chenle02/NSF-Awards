This Small Business Innovation (SBIR)Phase I research project will develop a
novel radial magnetic field actuator for fully flexible electromagnetic
automotive engine valves. Dramatic improvement in engine performance and
reduction in environmental impact is possible with this technology. The imminent
international adoption of a 42V automotive power system enhances the approach. A
fully electronically-controlled inlet/exhaust valve actuating system eliminates
camshafts completely, thus (1) eliminating the packaging restrictions placed
upon an engine by conventional camshaft profiling, and (2) allowing optimization
of the gas exchange process across the whole engine speed and load range.
Commercial applications of the proposed concept include: automotive engine valve
actuators, general linear actuators, automotive active suspension, and unmanned
aerial vehicle flight actuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major benefit to society
of electromechanical valve technology will be better fuel economy. Improving
fuel economy is a worthy national goal: it will reduce America's dependence on
imported oil, cut the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, and
reduce vehicle operating cost.
