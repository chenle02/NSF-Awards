A newly constructed, pulsed-nozzle Fourier transform microwave spectrometer
will be used to determine the structures, dipole moments, and reaction
energetics of a variety of gaseous species that are precursors to certain
atmospheric aerosols and acids. Particular emphasis will be placed on adducts of
sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is the immediate precursor to sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
in the atmosphere. Additional studies will focus on complexes involving water
vapor, sulfur trioxide, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, nitrogen oxides,
and nitric acid. The data from these spectroscopic investigations will provide
new molecular-level detail about the chemical mechanisms that produce sulfuric
acid and nitric acid aerosols. Because aerosols influence the earth's albedo and
precipitation patterns, this research will impact our understanding of climate.
Many of the adducts targeted for study are expected to involve bonding forces
that are intermediate between van der Waals and covalent. Consequently, this
research will explore the role of unconventional bonding in complexes involved
in postulated processes of atmospheric importance. Extensions of the initial
project will include studies of radical intermediates and selected tertiary
clusters that represent the next step beyond dimers in the homogeneous
nucleation process.
