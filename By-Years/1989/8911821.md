Dr. Conti-Tronconi studies the relationship between the molecular structure and
function of the nicotinic receptor, a membrane protein which recognizes and
binds acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is an ubiquitous neurotransmitter, which
mediates transmission of commands between nerve cells and between neurons and
effector cells, such as muscle. For this reason, Dr. Conti-Tronconi's research
has both theoretical and practical implications. She has developed a technique
to define separate regions of the nicotinic receptor, using antibodies raised
against fragments of the receptor molecule, which are isolated by reacting the
receptors with naturally occurring poisons. When these antibodies react with
native receptors they disturb the receptor's function. These data are then used
to construct a steric and functional model of the molecule. Dr. Conti-Tronconi
intends to exploit fully the advantages of this technical approach by
systematically altering the amino acids sequence in separate fragments of the
nicotinic receptor already recognized; the functional effects of these
modifications will be assessed by testing the ability of the altered segment to
bind to poisons as well as to antibodies raised against intact fragments. Dr.
Conti-Tronconi also intends to complement these studies by obtaining maps of
nicotinic receptor fragments by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and by X-ray
diffraction. The most ambitious goal of the research is to define the structure
of the receptor which determines the selectivity of this membrane protein to ion
flow. These same techniques, once proven and refined in studying the nicotinic
receptors, can be applied in the future to the elucidation of other functional
structure of other receptors' molecules.
