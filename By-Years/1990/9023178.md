This award, made under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program, will
permit Dr. David Koo, one of the countries leading young observers, and a
Presidential Young Investigator, to make a pilot study to test whether there are
large scale density regularities in the distribution of galaxies. Dr. Koo has
reported some evidence for such regularities, but further confirmation is
required of such a controversial effect.
