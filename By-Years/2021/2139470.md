The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will be to facilitate improved animal husbandry practices by providing
high-performance natural supplements that can replace prophylactic antibiotics,
drugs, and hormones. The use of medically-relevant antibiotics in animal feed
initiated the spread of “super bugs,” causing a public health concern. Reducing
the dependency on antibiotics in animal feed requires a concerted effort from
multiple sectors. The outcome from this project may provide pragmatic
alternatives to using antibiotics. Through research and demonstration, this
project aims to overcome consumer skepticism towards accepting new supplements
and contribute to maintaining profitability in animal farming even after
antibiotics are eliminated from feed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
uses state-of-the-art computational tools in enzyme design to create new
biocatalysts with tailored microorganisms. The resultant designer microorganisms
with new functionalities may produce supplements used in animal feed using
sustainable bioprocesses. A crucial component of the project is to design
efficient bioprocesses that provide supplements that are fungible with existing
supply chains, without the need for any additional on-farm infrastructure. Many
natural supplements are either extracted from plants or produced using harsh
processes, contributing to their expense. Successful completion of this project
may overcome geographical or seasonal limitations in supplment production and
represent the use of cutting-edge technology in the dietary supplements
sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
