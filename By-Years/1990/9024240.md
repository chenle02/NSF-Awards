Professor Shields and others have recently found many new interpretations of
entropy in such diverse areas as string matching in DNA analysis, prefix
generation and Hausdorf dimension, recurrence and waiting time problems in
probability theory, Markov order estimation, statistical problems associated
with recognizing a process from its sample paths, and hypothesis testing. In his
project, Professor Shields will extend and sharpen these recent results and will
further develop the theoretical properties of processes which have connections
with entropy. Professor Shields' work is on the interface between abstract and
applied information theory. The concept of entropy, originally developed in
physics, and of crucial importance for the second law of thermodynamics, is the
mathematical realization of the vague idea of disorder or lack of information.
This concept continues to bear fruit in many fields including those mentioned
above.
