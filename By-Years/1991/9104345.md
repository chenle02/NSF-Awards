This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Maize meiosis: the role of the centromere" is to be
carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Zacheus Cande at University of California,
Berkeley. This fellow whose background is in the molecular genetics of maize
will study the mytotic cell cycle in maize using cell biology techniques. The
postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to increase the number of
outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
