ABSTRACT New work on the study of pragmatics has begun to address its relation
to syntactic development. We have identified three ways to investigate this
issue: (a) contrastive study of the differential developmental histories of
given grammatical forms across different contexts as a first step towards
isolating the crucial contexts for the forms and discovering the early
interactional and ideational meanings to which they are tied; (b) discovery of
children's units of discourse organization and interaction through contrastive
study of related grammatical forms; (c) study of crucial contexts (e.g.,
replies, arguments) to discover the grammatical markers arising in these
contexts. Study Area I concers the development of causal constructions,
examining the claim that causal expressions first arise as expressions
justifying speech acts (Pragmatic Causal Expressions) and only later become used
to explain physical events (Mathetic Causal Expressions). Study Area II
investigates the discourse features controlling the contrastive use of different
temporal, causal, tag, and question forms, and also examines the relevant form-
function mappings cross- linguistically. Study Area III examines the development
of verb ellipsis and modal auxilliaries within two given discourse contexts,
replies and arguments, since these forms appear frequently within these
contexts. These studies are intended to inform the issue of how children use
communicative functions as guides in acquiring the grammatical categories of
their language.
