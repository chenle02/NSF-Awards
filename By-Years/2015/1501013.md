This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Summer Symposium in Real Analysis 39" that will be held June 8-13, 2015, on the
campus of St. Olaf College. This conference is the thirty-ninth in a series that
has evolved into one of the major venues internationally for the presentation of
research developments in real analysis and related areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program for the 2015 Symposium covers a
broad array of topics, ranging from regularity issues for partial differential
equations to Morse-Sard-type results, from questions in geometric measure theory
to topics in combinatorial and set theoretic analysis. The featured speakers are
Marianna Csornyei (University of Chicago), Alexander Olevskii (University of Tel
Aviv), and Miklos Laczkovich (Eotovos Lorand University). The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work. Proceedings of the Symposium will be made
available on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
