9604250 Suki This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research between
Dr. Bela Suki of Boston University and Professor Jose Andrade at Federal do
Ceara, on the project entitled, "Threshold Phenomena and Avalanches in
Physiological Tree Structures." A curious phenomenon has been noted during
procedures such as heart surgery, where the clamping off of blood vessels stops
the blood flow to parts of the body other than the part being operated on. It
was thought that the flow would be diverted, taking another course. This project
will address this problem. Specifically, the PIs believe that vessels and
airways are parts of a tree structure and the the opening and closing is
influenced by the closing or opening of other segments of the tree. They
describe this as a highly discontinuous avalanche phenomenon. The goal of their
project is to further the analytic procedures necessary to solve this problem.
