The 2nd International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer will
be held on May 20-25, 2001, in Palm Cove, Queensland, Australia. The
International Centre for Heat and Mass Transfer will host the conference. The
purpose of the conference is to provide technical exchange, identification of
the state-of-the-art, and the projection of future needs and trends in
computational techniques applied to heat transfer. The conference will assemble
scientists and engineers working in fields related to, and requiring,
computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer, including
coupling with fluid flow. The symposium will be held at the Novotel Palm Cove
Resort, Palm Cove, Queensland, Australia. The conference web site is
(http://cht01.mech.unsw.edu.au); Begell House, Inc will publish the conference
proceedings. The NSF funds will help support travel for U.S. participants
consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and
non-tenured faculty with limited research funding working in the field of
computational heat transfer.
