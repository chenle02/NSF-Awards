Climate patterns are changing rapidly as evidenced by increases in temperature
associated with global warming and in annual variability in weather conditions.
The impacts of such changes on animal populations are not well understood, but
can be assessed with long-term demographic studies that take advantage of
temporal and spatial variation in weather across environmental gradients. This
proposal intensively examines the demographic responses of the Black-throated
Blue Warbler, as well as other bird species at larger geographic scales, and
quantifies annual shifts in spatial distribution and abundance. The 800 m
elevational gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White
Mountains provides a breadth of environmental conditions needed to compare the
effects of intra- and inter-annual differences in local weather conditions and
biotic factors (e.g., food abundance and predator density) on bird population
dynamics and reproductive performance. Such information is key to assessing the
potential local effects of climate change on bird populations, and ultimately to
predicting how these populations and communities will respond in the future to
climate-induced environmental change associated with human activities.
