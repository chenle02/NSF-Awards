This award is for support of a one year project to study the micropaleontologic
character (diatoms, foraminifera, and other microfossils) of sub-glacial
sediments from beneath ice stream B, as part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
(WAIS) program. The sediments to be studied were obtained by Barclay Kamb as
part of his drilling program on Ice Stream B during the 1991/1992 Antarctic
field season. The objectives of this study are to: 1) identify Pleistocene and
Pliocene episodes of West Antarctic ice sheet glaciation, 2) evaluate deglacial
and preglacial environments in West Antarctica, 3) evaluate sediment provenance
and glacial mixing, 4) test models of rapid ice stream flow (sub- ice till
deformation or basal sliding), and 5) provide base-line geologic and
chronostratigraphic data as an aid to geophysical interpretations.
