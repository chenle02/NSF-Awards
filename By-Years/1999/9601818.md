9601818 Liou This grant will establish a simulation and testing facility for
motion control and power electronic technology. It will support: * One HP
Engineering Workstation with peripheral devices to run SABER system simulation
software; * A three-year SABER system simulation software maintenance agreement;
* Three Yokogawa high bandwidth, three-phase power analyzers to measure voltage,
current, and power of tested power converter or machine; * One four-quadrant
Dynamometer for loading of rotating machine under test (MUT); * Two LeCroy high
sampling frequency digital oscilloscopes for data acquisition of experimental
results; * Two digital signal processor (DSP)-based developmental systems for
implementing various control algorithms in motion control applications; *
Voltage and current transducers for measuring and isolating experimental voltage
and current signals. Existing research in this PI focuses on the rotating
machines used in various motion control applications, especially squirrel cage
induction SCI machines and switched reluctance machines (SRM). The new
instrumentation will increase the capability and efficiency of is research
efforts and enable him to train more graduate students. With the proposed SABER
system simulator, design mistakes can be found and corrected easily by
conducting simulation runs before building a prototype in the laboratory. A
four-quadrant dynamometer will provide all kinds of load profiles for a machine
under test. Accurate data collection is vital in verification of efficiency and
performance improvements made possible by innovations. High bandwidth voltage,
current, and power meters and digital oscilloscopes can enable him to conduct
experiments on the prototypes with both accuracy and ease. Since there is no
such motion control testing facility available for the general research
community in the San Francisco Bay, he also plans to reorganize short courses
using this pro posed facility for professional enhancement of motion control
engineers and engineering faculty. *** ??
