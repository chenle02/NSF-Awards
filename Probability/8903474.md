The principal investigator will study several models which arise in science in
the study of growth, spread and development of a system of like particles. The
evolution of these systems is random and can be conveniently described as a
stochastic process with an infinite dimensional state space. The investigator
will study these models by formulating and solving appropriate martingale
problems then using the martingale framework to prove various limit theorems.
