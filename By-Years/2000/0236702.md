The Universe is believed to consist primarily of dark matter, some unknown
substance that makes its presence known only by its gravitational effects. Among
these effects is the deflection of starlight, also known as gravitational
lensing: objects seen behind a dark matter concentration will have their
appearance distorted as the light rays pass the dark matter. In some cases this
lensing distortion is dramatic, but our view of nearly every galaxy in the
Universe is distorted to a very small degree by intervening dark matter. By
measuring these weak gravitational lensing effects, one can map the distribution
of the dark matter. The distortion typically amounts to a <1% elongation of a
background galaxy, so exploitation of weak gravitational lensing requires the
astronomer to measure 100,000 to 10,000,000 galaxy shapes, and to pay careful
attention to slight optical defects that can mimic gravitational lensing. The
rewards are great, however, since the ability to "see" dark matter can answer
many of the most important questions about the Universe. The work under this
grant will apply new techniques to the analysis of weak lensing data, and
advance the precision of these measurements to the few-percent level using data
being gathered by the Deep Lens Survey and other large imaging surveys. With
these data it will be possible to plot the evolution of dark matter halos around
galaxies since redshift 0.5. Other existing and new data will be analyzed to map
the dark matter in massive galaxy clusters. ***
