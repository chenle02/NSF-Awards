CTS-9500156 ABSTRACT A laser light scattering apparatus which will be purchase,
and will be primarily utilized for a project on the production and
characterization of the properties of a variety of inorganic nanoparticles. New
aqueous colloidal processing technique that utilizes intravesicular reactions to
produce batches of nanometer sized inorganic particles have been developed. The
objectives are better understanding and controlling the particle formation
technique, and understanding the properties of the nanoparticles. The small size
of the particles could dramatically alter electron wave functions, leading to
'quantum' size effects. Furthermore, particles in this size range contain mostly
'surface' atoms (bond lengths and mobilities for these atoms can differ from
that in bulk), leading to a large impact on the properties of these particles.
This apparatus will also be used to characterize a variety of surface
functionalized magnetic nanoclusters that are being used in a magnetic
immunoabsorption technique for cell and plasmid separations, obtain accurate
size distributions in magnetic colloidal preparations so that neutron and X-ray
scattering data on the same sample can be interpreted properly, as well as
monitor kinetics of tubulin assembly/disassembly in response to the
environmental toxin cadmium. ***
