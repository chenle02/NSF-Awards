In this project, the department is purchasing a collection of robot kits to
enable the incorporation of robot-based activities into undergraduate science
courses within a liberal arts setting. The goal is to increase the level of
engagement of liberal arts students, particularly women, in the physical
sciences and engineering by providing experiences that capture the excitement,
spirit, and intellectual substance of these disciplines. The department is
developing an introductory robot-based design course that highlights connections
between physics, computer science, mathematics, and biology. Additionally, the
surprising versatility of robots makes them useful in a wide range of existing
computer science and physics courses.
