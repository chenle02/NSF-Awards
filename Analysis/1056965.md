The aim of this proposal is the study of interactions between quasiconformal
(QC) mappings, geometric analysis (in particular uniform rectifiability),
Fourier analysis, and geometric combinatorics. Five problems will be addressed.
The unifying method to be employed is an underlying geometric-combinatorial
vision which often manifests itself through multiscale analysis (i.e., the
analysis of a problem on different scales.) This method will be applied in the
contexts of so called "K-QC mappings" (mappings sending an infinitesimal
circle/ball to an infinitesimal ellipse/ellipsoid), geometric measure theory
(GMT, which analyzes sets and measures on them -these are generalizations of
length, area and volume-), harmonic analysis (decomposing a signal into
elementary pieces of wavelike character), and potential theory (study of
Coulombic potential and related topics.)

The mathematical objects involved have found abundant applications in other
disciplines, so the problems proposed will advance knowledge in those areas.
Fractals (GMT) appear naturally in electrodeposition and Diffusion Limited
Aggregation. The internal structure of lungs has a high fractal dimension (to
capture more oxygen.) Fourier analysis is often applied in signal and image
processing. QC maps are solutions to problems in non-linear elasticity, and have
found applications in string theory. Uniform rectifiability appears in
minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional (originally used for image
segmentation.) Geometric combinatorics is used for fair division and voting
problems in the social sciences, and for phylogenetic trees models in biology.
Distance sets are used in industry to study the dimensionality of data sets. The
PI will continue preparing students for the Putnam Competition, participating in
the Math Club, and mentoring graduate students informally in the context of
graduate courses. Fractals and geometric combinatorics are excellent areas for
promoting teaching and training of undergraduates and postdocs. The basic
notions of multiscale analysis, dimension, combinatorics, etc. are deep enough
to convey some flavor of research yet can be successfully explained in an
elementary way.
