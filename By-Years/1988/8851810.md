This project provides undergraduate students in computer engineering, computer
science, and electrical engineering the opportunity to design, implement, and
test the significant elements of office automation systems used to process
documents in digital form. It provides the necessary equipment to augment a new
digital image processing laboratory. Scanners, displays, printers, and array
processors, working in conjunction with new and existing PC/AT-type computers,
enable the students to capture, display, process, and print hard-copy data. This
equipment is used primarily by students in a new undergraduate Computer
Engineering concentration called Digital Document Processing. It also provides
the electrical engineering students additional laboratory facilities in their
digital signal processing concentration. Computer Science students use the
instrumentation to provide laboratory experiences augmenting previous optional
hardware courses. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
