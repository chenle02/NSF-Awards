Arizona State University will conduct The Hispanic Math Project (HMP) which has
as a major goal to promote the achievements of migrant Hispanic elementary
students in mathematics - focusing specifically on the mathematics of
measurement. The Hispanic Math Project will be an interactive active video,
computer-based learning station to be used with Limited English Proficiency
(LEP) students. The math content will be presented by using the formula of form,
function and use via multiple media. Audio (spoken language), videodisc
(visual), and written language text will interact and enforce one another to
provide a near real-life environment for the child. The Integrated Whole
Language approach is the theoretical base for the development of the Hispanic
Math Project. The learning station's expert system maintains language
transparency and provides a natural language interface, which will promote an
optimal environment for Hispanic students learning mathematics content. Another
important contribution that HMP will provide for migrant Hispanic students is a
continuity of performance record through the Migrant Student Record Transfer
System (MSRTS). By utilizing the MSRTS mathematics objectives as the basis for
the interactive tutorial materials, HMP can establish a clearly defined,
transferable profile of a student's math skill level regardless of where the
student is within the United States. In summary, the project will develop and
explore whether an expert system can interact as a partner and guide to
ameliorate math illiteracy for a growing number of minority students.
