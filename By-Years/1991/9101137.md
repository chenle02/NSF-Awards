This is a dissertation improvement proposal. The research investigates
relations between aggregate (community) and family wealth, and husbands' share
of family work. While the link between social wealth and family work has not
previously been studied, PIs expect to find that husbands' shares will increase
as family wealth increases. The reason, investigators believe, is that as wives'
resources increase, so does their power in the family, and hence, the amount of
household work they can expect from their spouses. The research thus introduces
ex- change/power theories to demographic issues.
