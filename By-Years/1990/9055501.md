This three year project, the Rice University School Mathematics Project,
continues the work initiated through a previous Teacher Enhancement award. The
program will have elementary, middle school, and secondary school components,
and includes a four-week summer institute as well as academic year activity.
Participants from the Houston Independent School District will attend in three-
person teams (two teachers, one administrator) from their schools. Each summer,
a new group of 48 teachers will be involved, 16 at each level. Teachers will
study mathematics content and pedagogy, with emphasis on patterns and functions,
geometric ideas, modeling, statistics, and algebra.A school-based coordinator
will assist teachers with academic-year inservice and implementation activities.
Cost sharing is provided as 45% of the total award, from the private sector,
Rice, and the Houston Independent School District.
