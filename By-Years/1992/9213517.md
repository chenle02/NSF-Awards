Research in intermediate energy nuclear physics will be carried out at IUCF,
CERN, and CEBAF. The IUCF work will probe threshold pion production via a new
technique - recoil detection - made possible by the use of ultra-thin targets in
the IUCF cooler ring and internal target facility. An array of silicon strip
detectors built by the Northwestern group will be used for this purpose. The
CERN experiment will determine the spin structure function of quarks in the
proton and neutron by scattering polarized muons from polarized nuclear targets.
Planning of electron and photon induced nucleon knockout experiments at CEBAF
will be carried out. These experiments are designed to explore the quark sub-
structure of nucleons and search for the onset of quark sub- structure effects
in nuclear systems.
