This research aims to clarify electrochemical mechanisms. Electrochemical cells
are used to produce special chemicals as analyzers to measure the concentration
of particular species, and to generate electrical energy. Understanding the
nature of the charge-transfer reactions which occur within these cells aids in
the design of new cell systems to meet specialty needs of the future. This would
include sensors for trace amounts of chemicals now difficult to detect. A series
of experiments has been designed which will do much to clarify the kinetics in
zirconia cells.
