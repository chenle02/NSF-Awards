A meeting on the molecular biology of recombination will be held at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory on August 31, through september 4, 1988. This meeting will
focus on the mechanics and enzymology of DNA strand interaction during
recombination. Recent advances in molecular biology have provided new tools for
classical, biochemical, and biophysical approaches to genetic recombination. As
a consequence this field is making rapid advances and will be greatly served by
the opportunity for the exchange of information provided by this meeting. This
meeting will bring together researchers with varied approaches to the study of
genetic recombination where a discussion of ideas, techniques and results
related to recombination can advance the field.
