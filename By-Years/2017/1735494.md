Paragraph 1&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop to examine the potential
for supporting research on submerged human habitation sites on the continental
shelf of the U.S. The workshop brings together approximately twenty-five
individuals with relevant and specialized expertise on this topic of research
and will be held at the Smithsonian Institution, in conjunction with the Society
for American Archaeology meeting Spring 2018 in Washington, DC. An investigation
of submerged human habitation sites has the potential to provide important
insights into human evolution in North America, including topics of migration,
colonization, response to sea level rise, and the origins of maritime
adaptations. These topics are important not only for understanding the
development of early social organization in North America but can also give us
critical information about the societal impacts of sea level rise, which is a
potential threat in coastal regions of the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;br/&gt;The
interdisciplinary workshop will include senior and early career scholars from
the social and physical sciences, federal resource managers, and other
stakeholders. The workshop will identify and explore innovative methods and
relationships necessary to address the archaeology and paleoecology of submerged
coastal landscapes on the US continental shelves. Participants will identify
extant and needed technological, fiscal, human, educational, and logistic
resources, and explore synergistic interagency and interdisciplinary
relationships needed to promote and support this type research. The product will
be a synoptic report and proposed action plan for distribution to
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
