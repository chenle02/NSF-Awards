The dissolution of novolak polymers and other hydroxylic resins will be studied
in terms of a molecular model where the rate of dissolution is controlled by
percolative diffusion of base into the solid matrix. The percolation theory
provides a scaling law for the dependence of dissolution rate on the
concentration of hydrophilic sites (hydroxyl groups). The materials to be
studied will be novolak resins from mixtures of o-cresol and p-cresol, and
copolymers of hexafluorodimethylhydroxystyrene and styrene. Dissolution
inhibition of novolak and other resins is the basis of the most important
imaging materials in the semiconductor industry. Yet the nature of this
phenomenon is incompletely understood. This research aims to provide an
explanation in terms of the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance in these resins.
