In this project, an aircraft version of an aerosol time-of-flight mass
spectrometer (ATOFMS) for fast real-time analysis of individual particle size
and chemical composition will be developed. The instrument will couple
aerodynamic particle sizing and laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight
mass spectrometry for composition analysis. The design will be based on several
existing instruments in the PI's laboratory (mobile/ground based) and take
advantage of new technologies to achieve significant reductions in size, weight,
and power consumption, and autonomous operation. In order to make the instrument
suitable for aircraft operation, a new interface will be designed for increased
sampling efficiency and higher temporal resolution. Other modifications will be
aimed at improving the efficiency of detecting smaller particles. &lt;br/&gt;
This instrument will provide the ability to measure, semi-quantitatively, the
chemical composition of individual atmospheric particles from aircraft. These
measurements will provide detailed information on the sources, transport, and
transformation of aerosols and on the particle mixing state, which is
information currently inaccessible from bulk measurement techniques. The project
will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;
