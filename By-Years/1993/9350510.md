This project is to design and develop a set of four video- based Scientists in
Action episodes including a variety of hands-on activities that provide
opportunities for students to work along with scientists (video-based) in using
technology to solve environmental and human health problems. The video
productions will be patterned after the Jasper series. The first tape will be a
re-shooting of the Overturned Tanker episode. Topics of the other three tapes
will be chosen with advice from students, teachers, the Internal Review Board
and the National Advisory Committee. Software will be identified that can be
linked to the video based materials.
