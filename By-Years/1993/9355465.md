9355465 Hoffman The National Research Council (NRC) through its Coordinating
Council for Education requests $800,000 to support the NRCs work on development
of national science teaching and assessment standards. Work to date has focussed
on the curriculum standards work. But work on the teaching and assessment
portions of the project must be accelerated if an integrated draft of the
science standards is to be published and disseminated by late fall of 1993. ***
