Information on objects that resemble quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) such as
Seyfert nuclei and N systems has been collected for many years. In classifying
objects for the recently published QSO catalog, many recently discovered objects
with comparatively small redshifts, which clearly resemble QSOs in as far as
their continuum and line spectra are concerned, have been found. Many of the
extragalactic sources found by X-ray techniques, often called Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN), fall into this category. Sometimes they are clearly parts of
normal galaxies, and in other cases their environment is less clear. To look at
the general properties of these phenomena, a comprehensive list of such objects
is required. A catalog similar to the previous QSO catalog will be prepared.
Objects to be included in the catalog must have a nucleus that is the most
dominant feature and a spectrum that shows evidence of violent activity clearly
not due to the evolution of normal single stars, i.e. the spectrum must show
evidence for a nonthermal continuum, sometimes variable, and an emission line
spectrum dominated by broad lines. The nucleus may often be a radio source or an
X-ray source. As in the case for QSOs, the objects have been found by a variety
of techniques: colors; morphology; low dispersion spectroscopy, including the
grism-objective prism techniques; and optical studies following identification
by radio or X-ray techniques. The Principal Investigator estimates that this
catalogue will contain between 500 and 1000 objects. He plans to publish the
catalog in 1988.
