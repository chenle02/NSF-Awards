9512282 Rocca This research proposes to develop a unique table-top soft X-ray
laser for photochemistry and photophysics studies. This innovative instrument is
made feasible by a recent demonstration by the researchers of large soft X-ray
amplification in the plasma created by a compact electrical discharge. This
breakthrough offers the opportunity for the development of a new type of soft
X-ray laser of significantly reduced size and increased simplicity that can
operate repetitively. The laser will provide high peak power beams (circa 10
microjoules per nanosecond pulse) of high energy photons (26.5 electron volts)
that will permit extension of laser photochemistry and photophysics studies of
molecules, clusters, and surfaces to the soft X-ray region. %%% The development
of this innovative soft X-ray laser will benefit numerous applications and open
new areas of research. These applications include the diagnostics of material
surfaces, the testing of optical coatings and soft X-ray optics, diagnostic of
dense plasmas and of nuclear detector materials, and high resolution imaging.
The compact soft X-ray laser source can also impact basic studies in atomic
physics and nonlinear optics. ***
