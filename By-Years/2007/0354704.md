Recently developed optical mirrors with very high reflectivities of 99.995% and
special "chirps" in the coatings will be used to study the enhancement of multi-
wave mixing in an optical cavity filled with hydrogen in an optical process
called Raman scattering. The specific multi-wave mixing to be studied in this
cavity is called anti-Stokes emission and will occur in conjunction with Stokes
emission. Using a green pump YAG laser interacting with hydrogen in the cavity,
the anti-Stokes process will produce blue emission and the Stokes process will
produce red emission. These studies will be used to verify recent theoretical
predictions of quantum limited cw anti-Stokes conversion in the high finesse
cavity. Specifically, the theory predicts that for low loss cavity mirrors, the
photon conversion efficiency will approach 50% into the blue anti-Stokes
emission and 50% into the red Stokes emission. Theory also predicts that
scanning the pressure of the hydrogen gas in the high finesse cavity will allow
numerous spatial modes of the anti-Stokes emission to be
observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program will involve
the training of two female graduate students, the participation of Native
American high school students from Montana in summer research, three different
outreach programs to students from Montana schools and continued impact on the
development of the local optical industry in Bozeman. In addition, this research
will result in the development of a tricolor laser that could simultaneously
provide the three primary colors - red,&lt;br/&gt;blue and green - needed for
full color displays, with applications in large projection systems including
large, full color parallax holograms.
