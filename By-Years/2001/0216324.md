This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
photonic devices based on a new and proprietary family of rare earth oxide -
aluminum oxide glasses, the real glasses, doped with Yb, Tm, and Er oxides.
Phase I research showed exceptionally broad emission from Yb 3+, efficient
energy transfer in co-doped glasses, and fluorescence lifetimes and spectra of
Tm and Er that meet device requirements at high dopant concentrations.
Feasibility of scaled-up production of the glasses was demonstrated. The Phase
II activities include: collaboration with firms engaged in the glass and optical
device business; scaled-up glass synthesis; optimization of dopant concentration
and optical properties for devices; and construction and characterization of
prototype laser devices.

Markets for optical device products are extremely large, multinational, and
growing though expanded applications and displaced technologies. The Phase II
R&D is focused on lasers, amplifiers, and optical devices for communications,
laser surgery, and emerging military applications. The patent position and the
absence of complex proprietary interests in the technology place this work in a
strong commercial position.
