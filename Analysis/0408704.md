Burns proposes to study partially hyperbolic dynamical systems. He will focus on
the time-one map of the frame flow, on compact group extensions of hyperbolic
basic sets, and on extensions of the Pugh-Shub theorems. The proposed research
will contribute to the understanding of partial hyperbolicity, a far-reaching
extension of one of the basic paradigms in the study of chaotic systems, namely,
uniform hyperbolicity.

The results of the research will be broadly disseminated in the scientific
literature and in lectures. This work will also contribute to the mathematical
formation of graduate students at Northwestern, in part by lectures of the PI,
and in part by students working on this and related subjects under his guidance.
