The Solanaceae, which includes tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper, comprises
the third most valuable crop family in the U.S. Tomato is the centerpiece for
genetic and molecular research for the Solanaceae, due in part to features that
make it an attractive research system. These features include 2N chromosome
number, a modest-sized genome (about 950 Mb), tolerance of inbreeding,
amenability to genetic transformation, and an existing collection of well-
characterized genetic resources. During the course of the project, a physical
map will be constructed for the nuclear genome of tomato. This physical map will
comprise overlapping, ordered Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs). The
physical map will be superimposed onto the tomato genetic map using a common set
of genes. Together, the physical and genetic maps will provide a detailed road
map of tomato chromosomes and allow scientists to more easily identify new gene
functions. They will also allow comparison of the organization of the tomato
genome with that of other related species (e.g. petunia, pepper, potato and
eggplant) and the well-studied model plant Arabidopsis. Gene silencing
approaches will be employed to study disease resistance and fruit development,
two aspects of plant biology for which tomato is a model system. Finally, a
series of genetic and genomic resources will be developed and disseminated to
other researchers. These will include: 1) a non-redundant tomato unigene set; 2)
tomato cDNA microarrays; 3) DNA, associated data sets from mapping populations,
and seeds; 4) a set of ordered tomato BAC clones; and 5) new solanaceous BAC
libraries. To facilitate distribution of genomic information for tomato and
related species in a comparative genomic context, we will continue development
of the Solanaceae Genome Network database. This is a genomics database that ties
together information about sequence, genetic and physical maps among solanaceous
species, and anchors this information against the Arabidopsis genome sequence.
