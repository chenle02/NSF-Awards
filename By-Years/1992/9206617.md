This award will provide 58% of the funds required to purchase a
cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope system for research and teaching use in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the
acquisition of this equipment. The CL technique (inducing luminescence by
electron bombardment of the microscopic target) is useful in bringing out
features otherwise invisible during microscopy of geological samples. The
Principal Investigator and colleagues in the Department of Geological Sciences
are involved in research on rocks that have been tectonically deformed, on
ancient soil profiles, and on processes of rock-fluid chemical interactions
during rock metamorphism. In all of these studies the CL method is a necessary
tool for detecting microscopic mineralogical changes used to interpret
geological processes.
