Modern operating systems are large and complex code bases in which hundreds of
programmer-years have been invested. As a result, modifying an operating system
is a difficult, costly, and often impractical endeavor. However, viewing the OS
as an immutable object is at odds with most OS research.

This research proposes techniques that enable the deployment of OS ideas without
changing OS source code. The thesis is that an OS-like service can acquire
information about the internal state of the OS and control its behavior, even
when no explicit interfaces to do so are provided. With this approach, the OS is
treated as a gray box, in which the general characteristics of its algorithms
are known; this knowledge is then combined with run-time observations of how the
OS reacts to probes in order to infer its state and exert control.

Initial experience with gray-box systems points to additional areas of research:
automated discovery of algorithms, on-line benchmarking to configure parameters,
dynamic insertion of probes, and aggressive inference of OS internal state.
Thus, the goal of this proposal is two-fold: to understand the theoretical
foundations of gray-box systems and to implement a toolbox of software for the
rapid development of gray-box systems.
