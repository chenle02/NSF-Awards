Online marketplaces that rely on matching customers with services have become an
important sector of the US economy. These matching platforms rely critically on
algorithms to quickly and efficiently match available supply and demand, where
both arrive randomly over time. This award contributes to the the Nation's
economic prosperity by advancing a fundamental theory of networked matching
platforms capable of supporting decisions regarding allocation of scarce
resources in these environments, with particular emphasis on modern online
payment channel networks and quantum bit-matching problems arising in privacy-
preserving communications. The award contributes to the education and training
of graduate and undergraduate students as well as to outreach activities at
local high schools to broaden STEM interest. Results will be disseminated
through publications, incorporation into curriculum, and tutorials for the
research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop heavy-
traffic theory for two-sided queues and bipartite matching platforms where the
entities to be matched involve networks. Unlike a classical queue, a two-sided
queue exhibits a phase transition in heavy-traffic. Conditions for this behavior
and the rate of convergence of the transition will be characterized. Going
beyond the simple single server-customer bipartite paradigm, the project further
considers networked matching platforms, such as those arising in payment channel
networks, generalizing the results for a single two-sided queue to the case of
capacitated two-sided queues connected through a network. This theory will be
used to develop practical routing algorithms for payment channel networks that
will be evaluated on publicly available data sets. Finally, the project will
examine a physical networked matching platform that arises in a quantum switch
employing a very general hypergraph-based matching platform. The project will
develop analytical tools to study such platforms and use them to develop
provably optimal matching algorithms that will be evaluated using traces from
quantum simulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
