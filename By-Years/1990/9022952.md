Recent Federal legislation has increased the importance of the contingent
valuation(CV) method for valuing goods, particularly environmental amenities,
not sold in markets. The method is now widely used but is subject to several
theoretical and applied problems that have led to lively debates among
economists as well as extensive litigation in the courts. This proposal outlines
two studies designed to improve CV methods and, specifically, the use of
expressed willingness to pay(WTP) measures of resource value. The first study
examines how much, and what kind of, information should be provided to
respondents as part of a CV study. The second study explores linkages between CV
methods and the multiattribute utility approaches commonly used in the decision
sciences. This study has as its core the belief that preferences are
constructive and that determinations of total resource values can arise only
through an understanding of the component parts. By helping to resolve these two
vexing problems currently facing CV researchers, results of the proposed studies
will improve the defensibility of an important approach to estimating economic
value.
