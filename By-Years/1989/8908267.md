This award supports the research in Combinatorics of Professor Lauren Rose of
Ohio State University. Her project is to study d-arrangements of hyperplanes,
and the homological dimension of certain associated modules. An application of
this work relates to piecewise polynomial functions, and hence to approximation
by multivariate polynomial splines. This research falls in the broad category of
Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.
Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of
all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however,
Combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of
advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several
centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades
because of its importance in communications and information technology.
