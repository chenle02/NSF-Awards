It is proposed to measure and analyze the electgrical conductivity and Hall
effect in high-temperature superconducting compounds. The work will begin with
studies of YBa2Cu3O7-s untwinned single crystals as a function of Temperature,
magnetic field and the Oxygen-Content parameter s, and will then be extended to
other compounds as high-quality samples become available. These measurements
will test the adequacy of current theory to explain the behavior of high-
temperature superconductors (HTSCs) and should help one to develop a better
theory of HTSC.
