This research project utilizes laser spectroscopy techniques to investigate
fundamental physical processes in inorganic host crystals doped with transition
metal and rare earth ions. The processes to be studied include energy migration
among the ions and radiationless relaxation transitions. The experimental
techniques to be employed include four-wave mixing, accumulated photon echos,
and pulse-probe transient absorption experiments. An effort will be made to
verify a detailed model for the origin of the four-wave mixing signal of ions in
solids, in addition to characterizing the energy migration between these ions in
solids. The measurements will feature real time measurements in the
subpicosecond regime. Uniaxial stress measurements will also be employed. It is
hoped to learn more about the poorly understood processes associated with
radiationless relaxation among the excited states of the ions in solids.
