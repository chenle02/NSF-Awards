This project has established an Integrated Geographic Analysis Facility to
enhance the teaching of computerized Remote Sensing and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) technologies. The project addresses an immediate curriculum goal
identified by the Department of Geography and Human Environmental Studies in its
five-year plan: support for Remote Sensing coursework through digital image-
processing technology. Students studying GIS are benefiting from the
incorporation of Earth image data while students studying Remote Sensing benefit
from the incorporation of ancillary GIS data. The integration of thematic
mapping and spatial analysis activities through networked graphics workstations
are also expected to benefit all levels of the Geographic Techniques curriculum.
