With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Xue-Long Sun from Cleveland State University and colleagues John Masnovi, Nolan
Holland and Bin Su will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will
enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such
as (a) development of chemically selective and biocompatible compounds for
biomolecule, biomaterial and living cell modification and synthesis and
evaluation of cell surface mimetic molecules for biological and biomedical
research and applications, (b) synthesis and characterization of functional
molecular building blocks for responsive materials, (c) design, synthesis and
evaluation of aromatase inhibitors for hormone-dependent breast cancer, (d)
polymerization initiators for synthetic biological materials and electrical
conductors, (e) synthesis and evaluation of hydroximinosteroid derivatives as
cytotoxic agents, (f) modulation of DNA base excision repair pathways through
synthesis of methoxyamine-like compounds for materials and organic blocking of
DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, (g) studies of PNAs for nucleic-acid
detection, (h) calculation of NMR protection factors using molecular mechanics,
and (i) study of polycyclic biochemical mechanisms for metal accumulation in
plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
