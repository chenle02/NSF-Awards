The carbon isotopic composition of Cenozoic (8 to 56 Myr) paleosol carbonates
is significantly different than Mesozoic paleosol carbonates, having C values of
about - 10 to - 12 permil (118 samples) and -6 to -8 permil (21 samples),
respectively. In this preliminary data set there is only one data point that
overlaps. Consideration of the possible causes for this distinct differences
leads to a possible difference in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 . If this
is true it could lead to a method to estimate P(CO2) in the atmosphere to at
least 200 Ma ago, greatly extending our knowledge of paleoatmospheric chemistry.
So far, direct measurements of paleo-CO2 measurements go back only 0.16 Ma
(Barnola, et al., 1987). The isotopic composition of soil carbonate records the
isotopic composition of soil CO2 which is directly related to the concentration
of CO2 in the atmosphere. For modern soils the atmospheric contribution to total
soil CO2 is almost negligible. However, higher atmospheric P(CO2) levels make a
significant difference in the isotopic composition of soil CO2 and hence, soil
carbonate formed in equilibrium with soil CO2. In this study we examine the
isotopic composition of paleosol carbonates from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic with
the aim of determining P(CO2) of the ancient atmosphere. Preliminary results
suggest that this is a viable approach and that Mesozoic CO2 levels were
significantly higher than today, on the order of 1500 to 2500 ppmV.
