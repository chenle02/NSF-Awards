ABSTRACT: CMS-9714858, C.B. Crouse, Dames & Moore The strong ground shaking
recorded at the Jensen Filtration Plant during the 1994 Northridge earthquake
sequence (mainshock and aftershocks) offers a unique opportunity to study soil
nonlinearity. Two accelerographs stations close together at the Jensen
Filtration Plant in California recorded the earthquake motions; one station was
situated over moderately stiff soil, the other on very stiff soil. The character
of the two recordings -- which were quite different -- suggests that nonlinear
soil response could have been significant at the moderately stiff soil site
during the mainshock. However the two buildings containing station
accelerographs at this site were also different, which raises the concern
whether soil- structure interaction affected the motions at one or both
stations. Thus the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of
soil-structure interaction on the recordings. Two Federal agencies are
collaborating in the support of this project: the US Geological Survey and the
National Science Foundation.
