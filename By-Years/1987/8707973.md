This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
electrochemistry. During the two year period beginning 1 July 1987, Professor
Shaw will exploit the unique properties of zeolites in the development of solid
state microcells. These single crystals of zeolites with attached
microelectrodes should enable exciting new experimental work in the voltammetry
of gases and solid state ionic conductors, an improved understanding of charge
propagation in zeolite modified electrodes, and the electropreparation of new
zeolite-polymer composite electrode materials. In the course of this work,
Professor Shaw's research capabilities will be enhanced through her acquiring
expertise in Raman spectroscopy which she will use in the development of a
zeolite microcell for Raman microprobe spectroelectrochemistry.
