Abstract CTS-0116947 A. Hirsa, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

This proposal is one part of a collaborative research effort between Dr. Hirsa
of Rensselaer and Dr. Lopez of Arizona State University (CTS-0116995) on the
effects of bulk flow on monolayer formation at gas/liquid interfaces. These two
are renewal proposals for the present Grants CTS-9803478 at Rensselaer and
CTS-9896259 at ASU. The present grants focus on the experimental and
theoretical/computational study of interfacial transport properties of
monolayers of insoluble surfactants on the air/water interface. It is proposed
to extend the study to the effect of bulk liquid flow on the self-assembled
monolayers along the air/liquid interface. Dr. Hirsa will carry out experimental
investigations and Dr. Lopez will perform theoretical/computational studies.
