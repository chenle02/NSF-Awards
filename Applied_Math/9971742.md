The investigator studies problems of wave propagation in complex media, using
both analytical and numerical techniques. Long range propagation of seismic and
other waves in domains that involve both external boundaries and sharp
interfaces between random media with different characteristics are studied. The
correct boundary and interface conditions are analyzed from first principles
(wave equations) for smooth and random interfaces. They are used to derive the
interface conditions in the diffusion approximation that is more tractable for
numerical simulations. Analytical and numerical methods for the analysis of the
matrix valued radiative transport equations for polarized waves are developed.
Effects of inhomogeneous turbulent flows on acoustic wave propagation and in
some other problems (front propagation in combustion problems) are also
addressed. Wave propagation is one of the most fundamental physical processes.
Many physical applications require consideration of waves in highly
inhomogeneous media. These include such basic phenomena as acoustic wave
propagation in the atmosphere, seismic waves in the Earth, and many others.
Direct application of wave equations to such problems is beyond reach of even
the fast computers available today. The radiative transport theory is a valuable
approximation that describes energy propagation of waves in complex media with
rapid fluctuations of the material properties. One of the most promising
applications is in seismic wave propagation, where this theory has been
successfully applied in the last ten years, in particular to model propagation
of disturbances caused by earthquakes.
