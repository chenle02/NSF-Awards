This award provides support to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at the University of Georgia, Savannah River Ecology
Laboratory (SREL). The goal of this REU program is to provide research
experience, training and career perspective for undergraduate students through
the use of unique field sites, laboratory facilities and the association and
active involvement in research with full-time research ecologists. Project
participants will examine the influence of by-products of nuclear and fossil
fuel energy production on selected biological and chemical properties in
southeastern ecosystems. SREL faculty members, all actively engaged in research
and publication, will be paired with students having compatible research
interests. Student projects, while distinct and independent, are portions of
ongoing research programs of SREL. The student experience is enhanced by
interaction with a programmatic team comprising individuals with a diversity of
ecological backgrounds, interests and ideas. Applicants from minority schools
and regional institutions with limited research programs will continue to be
actively encouraged. Participant selection is based upon the quality of an
application, letters of recommendation and academic record. Through the research
training of more than 380 undergraduate participants over the past 22 years,
SREL has created a highly successful program of student/advisor interaction.
