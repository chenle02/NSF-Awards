The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to provide an efficient, automated biopsy diagnostic process which
will allow patients to access high quality cancer diagnostics at lower cost and
without being subjected to unnecessary and painful repeat procedures from
inefficient biopsy processes. The innovation addresses a critical global need to
improve the efficiency and analytics of biopsies. An automated, rapid on-site
evaluation (ROSE) system will potentially eliminate the 20% fail-rate of fine
needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy sampling. The application may also be scaled to
provide a solution to facilities that may not be able to afford the rapid onsite
evaluation service of FNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to
provide an automated, rapid on-site evaluation process by leveraging a system-
engaging technology and robotics to increase fine needle aspiration biopsy
sampling efficiency and improve patient experience, while reducing costs to
ensure accessibility to all facilities. This device will have three processes to
produce an image-ready glass slide that a pathologist can access remotely and
render an adequacy assessment. The device will perform smearing, staining, and
image capture of a fine needle aspiration biopsy sample. Normally, these
processes are performed by a pathologist/cytotechnologist, making rapid on-site
evaluation service inaccessible to fine needle aspiration providers in most
rural or small facilities. With an automated device, the rapid on-site
evaluation service may be mroe readily available and accessible at a fraction of
cost, saving time and resources for patients and medical
providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
