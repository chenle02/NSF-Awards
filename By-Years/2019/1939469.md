geological, geophysical and biological processes. Studying "societally" relevant
topics such as sea level rise, changing weather and climate patterns, and the
implications for scientifically and commercially important ecosystems and

for fisheries, energy, tourism, etc. Louisiana and Mississippi are both EPSCOR
states, and operating this vessel is its own kind of economic stimulation. The

U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
