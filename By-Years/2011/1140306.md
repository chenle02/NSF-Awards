PROJECT DESCRIPTION This project is developing a software environment to
simulate an electrical machines laboratory. The environment has an embedded
intelligent agent coupled with an intelligent tutoring system and offers an
alternative experimentation experience at institutions that do not have a
physical machines laboratory. Students are using the virtual laboratory as a
safe test bed to garner experience prior to encountering machines in a real
laboratory. The software offers an intelligent agent-based virtual instructor
that represents an expert in the power field. The instructor answers questions,
provides guidance and supervises the virtual laboratory - when specifically
requested by the student. The graphical user interface (GUI) enables students to
simulate various electrical machines and drives described by differential
equations, without requiring students to develop computer programs. The
intuitive and simple-to-use GUI is based on detailed numerical methods (for the
simulation), which is entirely transparent to the users. The environment allows
students to learn the basics of electric machines, while they test, analyze and
design them. The GUI allows users to modify any machine "on-the-fly" by entering
a new set of machine parameters, such as resistors, inductors, inertia, etc.
Advanced users also have the ability to define their own mathematical model of
an electrical machine.

BROADER SIGNIFICANCE The project is developing an intelligent tutoring system
that is engaging, adaptable, and tailors instruction to individual learners. The
virtual laboratory increases the number of students who can experience the
challenges and excitement of power engineering. The system offers the potential
for reaching a diverse range of students who might not otherwise have access to
equipment or are discouraged from entering a physical laboratory. The effort
also helps address safety concerns of students that might avoid taking power
engineering courses because of the high currents and voltages encountered in the
labs.
