ABSTRACT The Principal Investigator will interview 30 to 40 English- speaking 3
to 6 year old children longitudinally during a two- year period, in order to
investigate wh-movement types in their grammars. Several recent studies using
comprehension and production tasks have suggested that English-speaking
children's grammars allow types of wh-movement that do not exist in adult
English. These are constructions in which a wh-phrase that appears in a lower
clause at S-structure can take higher scope (over the whole sentence). Such
constructions occur in other adult languages, such as German and Romani. An in-
depth investigation of these constructions in children's grammars will compare
their properties with those of German and Romani. In this way, the project
should contribute to the understanding of both the children's grammars and the
adult grammars.
