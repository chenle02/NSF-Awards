The institute will focus on current research and theory on ten different topics
related to aging. It will strengthen the participants' disciplinary expertise,
enhance skills in presenting up-to-date material in aging to students, and
provide opportunities to interact intensively with experts in the field and with
colleagues from other institutions. In order to promote participants'
utilization of what they learn in the institute: the director will maintain
contact with them in the following year and will conduct site visits to colleges
with special needs; the faculty will be available to provide them consultation
throughout the year; and the participants will report their progress at a
follow-up institute in Summer 1993. Evaluation will focus on assessing the
program impact on participants' knowledge, attitudes, and instructional
practices.
