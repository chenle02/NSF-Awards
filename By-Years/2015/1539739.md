The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that
support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advancing what we
know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Capacity-building
(CAP) projects help build the capacity of the field to do high-quality, high-
impact research on learning. This project supports the mission of NSF to train
more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) by supporting doctoral students attendance at the International
Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) and the 6th
International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) to be held in Madrid,
Spain in June of 2015.

The intellectual merit of the grant rests on the quality of the research being
presented at the conferences. Together, the conferences provide cross-
fertilization of information and ideas from artificial intelligence, cognitive
science, machine learning, education, learning sciences, educational technology,
psychology, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, and the many
domain-specific areas for which cyberlearning systems are designed and built.
The broader impact of the work rests in the inculcation of students into this
field. Doctoral students will be selected from U.S. institutions. The criteria
for selection include either having a paper accepted for one of the conferences
and/or or submitting an strong rationale for what the student would learn at the
conference. All students receiving support will be assigned a mentor. The
selecting committee will strive to ensure that there is diversity of
institutions, topics, disciplines, ethnicities, and gender in the cohort of
awardees. Selected students will receive up to $1,000 to partially cover
expenses.
