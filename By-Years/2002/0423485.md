The objective of this research is to develop a robust methodology for the design
of functionally graded materials (FGMs). FGMs are advanced composite materials
that are engineered to have a smooth spatial variation of material properties.
This is achieved by gradually varying the relative volume fractions and
microstructure of the material constituents during fabrication. FGM components
typically exhibit smaller stresses and higher factors of safety than discretely
bonded monolithic materials. The aim of this research project is to create a
unified framework for the simultaneous optimization of structural shape,
compositional profile and microstructure of metal/ceramic FGMs that are
subjected to time varying thermal and mechanical loads. The proposed technique
utilizes a nonlinear elastoplastic model and numerical simulations using a
meshless method to accurately analyze candidate designs. A robust multi-
objective genetic algorithm will be used to simultaneously optimize structure
shape, fractional composition and microstructure of the material.

If successful, this project will result in a powerful design tool that could
assist engineers and other professionals engaged in the design process with
FGMs. It will benefit society by contributing new knowledge regarding the
simulation and optimization of FGMs and by reducing the failure of mechanical
components. A user-friendly software package implementing the proposed method
will be developed and distributed freely on the Internet through the PI's web
page. The educational plan will emphasize design as an important element of
engineering education by incorporating computer-aided analysis, shape and
material optimization to the PI's machine design and composite materials
courses.
