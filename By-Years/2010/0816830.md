This proposal requests support for a symposium on Mechanical Instabilities in
Polymer Films, Interfaces and Nanostructures, which will be held at the 235th
American Chemical Society National Meeting at New Orleans, LA, April 6-10, 2008.
Once seen as mechanical failure phenomena, surface instabilities are now being
harnessed to design novel devices such as flexible electronics and tunable
gratings as well as provide innovative approaches to measuring material
properties. As the study and use of surface instabilities branch out into new
scientific disciplines, there is a clear need for organized forums to foster an
exchange of knowledge and ideas among experts in fields such as solid mechanics,
experimental materials research, polymer science, and device engineering. The
goals of organizing this symposium are: (1) To capture the breadth of research
being conducted in the area of mechanical instabilities; (2) To identify and
authenticate the scientific needs across the discipline boundaries; (3) To
educate graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and other young
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide a unique forum for
interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and ideas in an open and friendly
environment. The speakers will be selected to reflect the diversity of
researchers in the field, with both established and young participants,
including speakers from traditionally underrepresented groups in science and
engineering (e.g., women and minorities). A good portion of the symposium (oral
and poster presentations) will be reserved for graduate students. The work
presented in this symposium will be widely disseminated for broader impacts in
various forms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
