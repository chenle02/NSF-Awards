AST-0098048&lt;br/&gt;Bunn, E.F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve
methods of analysis for large data sets in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
studies, including refinements of algorithms for analyzing large maps and
removing foreground contamination. The methods will be tested using simulations,
and then applied to datasets generated by BEAST, an existing balloon-borne
telescope for measuring CMB anisotropies, and eventually all-sky satellite
observations. Extraction of statistics beyond the simple power spectrum, such as
non-gaussianity and isotropy of the fluctuations, is the main goal of the
research.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
