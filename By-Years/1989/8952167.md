The Geologic map is the geologists premier tool for understanding the three
dimensional geometry of rock distributions and rock fabric; mapping is often an
essential first step in reconstructuring earth history. Making and interpreting
maps is an effective way to teach undergraduates the scientific method while
also teaching geologic principals. Northern Arizona University will introduce
modern technologies to geologic mapping: Computer assisted compilation combined
with graphical relational databases. A SUN workstation will be used to run
software ARC/INFO, and four MSDOS workstations to run GSMAP. These technologies
will be used in to Field Methods courses for sophomores, juniors, and seniors,
to summer field course, to undergraduate research projects, and to introductory
courses for non- majors. A revolution in geologic mapping technologies is in
progress; this project will help set a standard for undergraduate education by
having undergraduates participate in this revolution. The university will match
the award with an equal amount of funds.
