9624966 Shen This CAREER award will investigate the research issues associated
with metrology in manufacturing science and technology, with emphasis on
coordinate measuring machines (CMM). It will enhance the manufacturing education
program with the introduction of a geometric dimensioning and tolerancing
(GD&amp;T) curriculum, complemented by a newly developed metrology laboratory.
The research objectives are to develop a methodology for assessing uncertainties
in CMM measurements, so that compensation and sampling strategies can be
designed to improve the accuracy and productivity of precision dimensional
measurement. Because competition demands precision products, the educational
component's curriculum for metrology and GD&amp;T is important for developing
engineers with not only a quality focus, but with experience on how to achieve
precision. The principal investigator has a record of collaborating with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology and Brown and Sharpe on precision
metrology, and this collaboration will expand with this award. This project
shows innovation and collaboration in research and education. Results from this
work have the potential to increase the accuracy and productivity of coordinate
measuring machines, and the educational component will enhance the human
infrastructure needed to design and manufacture quality precision products.
