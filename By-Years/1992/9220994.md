This is a conference that draws together researchers from both universities and
industry across a wide range of disciplines. The emphasis of the conference is
the design of systems taking into account chip design, packaging, and
interconnection issues. By holding one session track instead of parallel
sessions, the organizers emphasize the importance of a firm grasp of all of
these issues for the modern system designer.
