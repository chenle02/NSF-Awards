This grant provides support for two workshops that will investigate the
potential of empirical/statistical downscaling, a method to estimate how local
climate is affected by regional and/or global conditions, to help develop a
robust knowledge platform for decisions regarding adaptation to environmental
change. This approach will bring together the research community, stakeholders
and practitioners to establish a more rigorous foundation for the evaluation of
data generated by this technique and to investigate the efficacy of including
the data in outputs targeted at the needs of the adaptation and impact
communities. The workshop will bring together an international community that
will contribute a strong scientific base to a broad range of ongoing and
proposed stake-holder relevant adaptation activities.
