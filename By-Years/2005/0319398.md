This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
ultra-high speed detector for terahertz applications. The ever-increasing volume
of the information to be&lt;br/&gt;Transmitted and processed demands fast
communication systems that will have to fulfill a throughput of 1 Tb/s or even
10 Tb/s. This requires more than 100 times improvement of performance over
today's fiber optic communication systems, and calls for the development of
terahertz or femtosecond technologies. The success of this program will lead to
drastic improvement of device performance in response speed, gain, responsivity
and detectivity. Phase I of this program is to demonstrate the proof-of-
concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent surveys suggest that the communication
systems will have to fulfill, a throughput of at least 1 Tb/s or even 10 Tb/s by
2010. This puts a demand for more than 100 times improvement of performance in
today's fiber-optic communication systems, and calls for the development of
terahertz or femtosecond technologies. The potential applications include,
detector of ultra-fast laser pulse, generator and detector of ultra-fast
electrical transients, broadband detectors, samplers, demultiplexers, and mixer
in multi-gigahertz range, high speed optical switches, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
