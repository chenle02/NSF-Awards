Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on nonlinear dynamics in
chemical systems. The research involves studies of complex chemical dynamics in
continuously stirred reactors, in homogeneous and unstirred systems, and
distributed chemical systems. Three main lines of research are proposed: 1)
developing techniques to control chaos using linear and nonlinear control
methods; 2) studies of chemical waves in inhomogeneous and perturbed excitable
media; and 3) studies of instabilities in propagating reaction-diffusion fronts.
Both experimental and theoretical studies will be performed. One novel
experimental project being explored by Showalter is the use of an ink jet
printer to prepare patterns of immobilized catalyst for excitable chemical
systems. This enables him to study chemical wave behavior in the presence of
systematically designed geometric constraints which are models for excitable
biological media such as the heart muscle. Nonlinear dynamics is a powerful tool
for understanding complexity in nature, and it has many practical applications.
Biological applications include stabilizing periodic rhythms in heart tissue and
inducing periodic and chaotic behavior in hippocampal brain tissue. Major
successes can also be found in applications of the principles of excitable media
to cardiology, which have led to an understanding of the role spiral waves play
in heart maladies such as tachycardia and fibrillation. Showalter's research
provides a fundamental chemical understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings
for these important biological phenomena.
