The development of new and synthetically useful reactions based upon cation
radical catalysis is planned. The advantages and attributes of these new
reactions will be investigated by means of thorough study of their selectivity
profiles and mechanisms. Extremely sensitive mechanistic probes for the cation
radical intermediates involved in catalyzed reactions have been designed and
will be further quantitated and perfected. These probes will permit the
definitive detection of these catalytic mechanisms, in general, where these are
operative. The full scope of this powerful, new catalytic principle can thus be
defined. The involvement of a catalytic mechanism in biological and enzyme model
catalyzed epoxidation will be examined using these probes. The involvement of
radical cation catalysis in, or its relationship to other biological oxidation
reactions will also be examined. %%% With this award, the Organic Synthesis
Program will continue to support the research of Dr. Nathan L. Bauld at the
University of Texas. The research explores new ramifications and applications of
the chemistry of cation radicals. It will generate new methodology that should
benefit research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical
industry.
