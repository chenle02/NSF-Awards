In 1984 and 1985, Dr. Feinman, with support from the National Science
Foundation, conducted archaeological survey in the Ejutla Valley which is
located in South Central Mexico to the south of the Valley of Oaxaca. This
latter, with its prehistoric capital of Monte Alban, saw the rise of a
centralized state which likely controlled a large hinterland. After many years
of archaeological research the prehistory of Oaxaca is fairly well known. As a
result of the Ejutla survey, Dr. Feinman was able to begin an examination of the
interaction between this marginal area and the center at Monte Alban. In this
follow-up project Dr. Feinman and his colleagues will initiate excavation at a
site located on the edge of the modern town of Ejutla. Large surface scatters of
shell fragments indicate that this area served as a factory in which shells
brought from the Pacific coastline were turned into finished objects and then
presumably traded to Monte Alban. Excavation should provide information on the
time interval covered and the social context in which this work took place. It
will also reveal whether stratified deposits are present and whether detailed
chronological information is available. These results, if positive, will set the
stage for a larger excavation project. These data will provide insight into the
interactions between the core area of Monte Alban and the Ejutla periphery. This
research is important for several reasons. First, it will provide insight into
how complex societies arise and are maintained. Secondly, it will increase our
understanding of the interactions between core and peripheral areas and how
these develop and change over time. Finally, it will aid in the training of a
graduate student.
