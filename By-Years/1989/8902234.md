This award supports the research in Analytic Number Theory of Professors J.
Brian Conrey and Amit Ghosh of Oklahoma State University. Their project includes
continuation of their research on simple zeros of zeta-functions and
L-functions. In particular, they hope to show that any Dedekind zeta-function
has infinitely many simple zeros in the critical strip. This would mark one of
the entrances into the attack on the notorious Generalized Riemann Hypothesis,
perhaps the most challenging open question of the modern theory of numbers. The
field of Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole
numbers the techniques of Analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and
limit, originating in Calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to
investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern
analytic number theorists such as Professors Conrey and Ghosh, the field has had
a new rebirth.
