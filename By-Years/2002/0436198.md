This project is a continuation of the series of Interdisciplinary Conferences in
Applied Mathematics conducted by the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM). The conferences are designed to bring together mathematical
scientists, computational scientists, engineers, and applications scientists who
are developing and applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms.
A successful feature of this series is the inclusion of interdisciplinary,
academic/industry workshops, as either stand-alone workshops or as a sequence of
minisymposia embedded within a larger meeting. This project is for partial
support for five conferences and a diversity workshop.

The primary objective of the series is to initiate new interaction among the
creators and users of the mathematical and computational science and thereby
contribute to the understanding of mathematics and encourage its application to
problems of society.

The series of conferences encourages the attendance of students, women, and
minorities. A recent feature is a workshop to encourage diversity in the
mathematical and computational science workforce.
