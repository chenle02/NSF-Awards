This is an SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) award. Tropical tidal
flat deposits of the Western Atlantic may contain a unique strip-chart-like
record of variations in climate during the past few thousand years. The locally-
adhesive surfaces of these flats act like fly-paper to retain aerosols from
Africa and centimeter-thick layers of marine sediment record the passage of
hurricanes. Both the frequency of hurricanes and the flux of aerosols from
Africa reflect global-scale variations in climate. To explore this potential
record of climate variations, a series of cores will be collected for sediments
that have accumulated continuously for the past 3000 years or more. The sediment
layers that record major storms will be logged and their compositions
determined; the aerosols will be extracted from the inter-storm algal layers,
weighed and their compositions determined by x-ray diffraction and optical
microscopy. To date the storm layers and determine rates of accumulation of
aerosols, sections of the cores will be dated by radiocarbon and possibly with
thorium230. This pilot project may produce a local record of hurricane frequency
and the flux of aerosols and by applying the method to other tidal flat
deposits, it is possible to develop the record of a much larger area. This
exploratory research is important because, if successful, it will provide
information of storm frequency under different global climate regimes.
