Modern CFD methods will be applied to calculate multiphase flows. The focus in
Phase one is on separated flows in pipelines, including stratified and slug
flows, where the individual gas or liquid phases are well represented as
continua. The CFD calculations will be performed in regions where one phase
exists alone, and the solutions will be matched to find the interface between
the phases.
