This project focuses on the geometric properties of harmonic measure and
properties of conformal mappings that are related to this classical conformal
invariant. Harmonic measure is a fundamental object in complex analysis, and its
multifractal structure provides an appropriate framework in which to describe
the conformal geometry of sets in the complex plane. It is well known that
harmonic measure exhibits its extremal behavior in domains that are bounded by
fractal sets (i.e., sets of nonintegral Hausdorff dimension). Experience has
shown that in this context it is more productive to work with random fractals
than with deterministic ones. A motivating reason for doing so is that it allows
one to bring to bear on problems a wide range of powerful probabilistic and
analytic tools. There are a number of classes of random fractals that arise in
physics as scaling limits of lattice models and that simulate real physical
phenomena. Study of the multifractal structure of harmonic measure on such
random fractals may help to solve some longstanding problems in geometric
function theory -- or at least to improve significantly our understanding of
them. The research will also shed new light on the linkages between complex
analysis and theoretical physics.

The project is closely related to multifractal analysis, an interdisciplinary
subject that lies on the border between mathematics and physics. It emphasizes
interaction between complex analysis, probability theory, and statistical
physics. All these areas can benefit from this project. For example, some of the
results will provide a deeper understanding of several important models from
statistical physics. Moreover, certain results in this area have a direct
connection to engineering.
