This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr. Robert M. Buchanan
at the University of Louisville to investigate one-dimensional proton wires.
Proton transport is essential in biological systems and seeems likely to become
increasingly important in other applications. In order to gain a better
understanding of factors controlling the stabilization of continuous single file
water chains in membranes and to develop functional models of proton wires, the
properties of a new class of hydrated imidazole compounds that stabilize one-
dimensional water chain structures will be investigated. The hydrated compounds
will be characterized by a variety of methods including X-ray crystallography,
IR, TGA, DSC, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Conductance of samples will be
studied by impedance methods. The dynamic motion of the water chains will be
studied using deuterium-exchanged samples at various temperatures by solid-state
NMR spectroscopy. The water exchange process and dynamic motion of oxygen atoms
within the channels will be studied using 17O-NMR spectroscopy. Molecular
dynamics simulations will be performed on fragments of the water channel
structures to study proton (deuterium) mobility along the water chains, and to
establish the presence and nature of the charge species involved in proton
translocation. Donor-acceptor properties of the water channels will be examined
using pH-sensitive organic compounds, amino acids, peptides and proteins.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is designed to provide a fundamental
understanding of intermolecular water interactions relating proton/water
mobility to ion/electron transfer. This project complements the U of
Louisville's NSF-EPSCoR- supported Structural Biology Initiative and is
potentially beneficial to the economic development of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky. In addition, the proposed project will contribute to the development
of an emerging research environment in biochemistry and structural biology
targeting regional students who ultimately will contribute to the economic
development of the state&lt;br/&gt;
