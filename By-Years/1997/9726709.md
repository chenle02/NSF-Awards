This two-year award supports US-France cooperative research in
neuroendocrinology. It involves Rae Silver and Ann Silverman at Barnard College
and Philippe Chemineau, Yves Combarnous and J. Claude Thierry at the French
National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). The objective of their
research is to study the role of brain mast cells in the physiology of
reproduction and seasonal reproduction. They hypothesize that changes in mast
cell activity, acting on blood vessels and/or on neurons, participate in
seasonally induced alterations in the central nervous system and in hormonal
modulation. Sheep will be used as the experimental model. The US investigators
bring to this collaboration expertise in tissue techniques and brain mast cells.
This is complemented by French expertise in developing models using sheep and
other farm animals.
