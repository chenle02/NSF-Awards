The principal investigators document the origin of Mesozoic arc development
across the Tujunga terrane boundary in southern California. They will utilize
field, petrologic, chemical, isotopic, and mineralogic information. An important
result will be an evaluation of the magmatic processes operative in the middle
and upper crustal portions of continental margin magmatic arcs that overlie or
contain a sizeable proportion of Proterozoic basement. In general this
information will help geologists under-stand the geologic development of the
Earth's crust.
