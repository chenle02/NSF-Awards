Some species of animals occur in two different morphologies, a phenomenon
called polyphenism. Usually the different alternative morphologies develop in
different seasons of the year. In order to develop a different morphology it is
necessary to activate a different set of genes, and thus the problem of control
of polyphenism is to discover the mechanism by which an animal "chooses" between
two alternative gene sets. The aim of the proposed research is to develop, for
the first time, an understanding of complete pathway of genetic control in such
a seasonal polyphenism. For this research we will use the butterfly, Precis
coenia, which has a dramatic color polyphenism and for which our preliminary
studies have already elucidated portions of the control pathway. The proposed
research will identify the pigments responsible for the different color forms
and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis. The genes for these enzymes
will then be cloned so that we may develop tools to study the mechanism by which
their expression is controlled. We know that a steroid hormone, 20-OH-ecdysone,
is ultimately responsible for stimulating the genetic switch that causes the
alternative pigment synthesis to occur, and experiments will be done to begin to
investigate how this could control the differential expression of enzymes for
the alternative pigments.
