This proposal is for equipment to establish a novel form of Dynamic Systems and
Controls Laboratory at the University of Texas - Pan American to be used by
undergraduates in its Electrical, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering
programs. The main objectives of this Laboratory are to prepare students to be
multidisciplinary in their thinking, to familiarize them with a model-based
simulation-oriented approach to control systems design and development, to let
them gain experience with the actual equipment needed for DSP-based controller
implementation (typically not done at the undergraduate level in most
Engineering programs) and to physically demonstrate their implemented
controllers on educational and industrial hardware, such as inverted pendulums,
mechanical linkages and simple robots. We plan to achieve these goals by using
hardware and software that are not only educational but also realistic (when
compared to pre-packaged and proprietary educational control systems), since
most of the same equipment requested in this proposal are being widely used in
the companies where these students can expect to be employed upon graduation.
The requested equipment will benefit this University's Engineering program in
other ways. Firstly, it will help to increase the design component of several
existing courses and make possible at least one new course. Secondly, via actual
and videotape demonstrations of the more 'exciting' experiments as well as
dissemination on the Web, it will assist in our efforts to motivate enrolled
students as well as to recruit students from this region (the majority of whom
are Hispanic and potential first-generation college students) by giving them a
better idea of what engineers can help accomplish in an increasingly technology-
driven society. Finally, we also believe that this proposal can and will serve
as an improved model for other schools of what a Dynamic Systems and Controls
Laboratory should be.
