The PI's will study foundational questions that arise in the study of
mathematical models inspired by applied science and mathematical research. One
of the problems, the so-called third boundary problem, is a mathematical model
for real systems with semipermeable membranes. The PI's will develop the
mathematical theory of such systems with fractal structure. The quality of
approximation of continuous processes by discrete models will be investigated.
Simple stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, can be perturbed in
various ways, for example, by inert drift or oblique reflection. These more
complicated models require new mathematical tools which will be developed. The
PI's will study some multiparticle systems confined to bounded domains. Several
mathematical tools will be sharpened, including new versions of the boundary
Harnack principle and heat kernel estimates.

The project will develop theoretical mathematical tools needed in and inspired
by scientific application of mathematics. The applied phenomena that gave rise
to the ideas under consideration include natural semipermeable membranes, such
as human lungs, and man-made objects, such as catalytic converters and car
batteries. Some of the applications are related to computer science, especially
approximation of real continuous phenomena with digital models suitable for
computer based analysis. The PI's will also study mathematical models describing
populations undergoing evolution according to various schemes.
