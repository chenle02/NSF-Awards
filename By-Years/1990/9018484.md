The biogeochemistry of H.2S and OCS in the oxic ocean will be examined with the
objectives (1) to elucidate specific production mechanisms (e.g., for H.2S; OCS
hydrolysis, photosynthetic production for OCS; photolysis of dissolved organic
sulfur compounds, organic matter regeneration), (2) to evaluate the interactions
of H.2S and trace metals, (3) to quantify the sea.air exchange of H.2S, and (4)
to examine the sources and long range transport of H.2S and OCS in the major
thermocline of the Sargasso Sea. These objectives will be met through field
sampling, cooperative studies with trace metal and atmospheric researchers, and
laboratory.based experiments. . J H.***//
