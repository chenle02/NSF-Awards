Recent measurements of Be-10 in ~250 volcanic rocks from various geologic
settings indicate that that young, near-surface oceanic sediments are subducted
and incorporated in arc magmas in the Kurile, Aleutian, Central America, Peru-
Chile and New Britain arcs. Integration of Be-10 data with geophysical and
structural studies of convergent margins suggests that sedfiments may be
subducted in grabens in the subducting plate, as Be-10 concentrations an arc
lavas are highest where the pelagic sediment thickness approximately equals
vertical displacement of the down- dropped basins. Recent improvements in the
University of Pennsylvania accelerator permit smaller samples to be analyzed
more precisely, and the recent acqusition of an I.C.P. spectrometer at Carnegie
permits measurement of Be-9. This project is to measure Be-10/Be-9 ratios and
Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions for mineral seperates, new volcanic arc
lavas, and a subset of the existing sample collection. Wherever possible results
will be combined with other geochemical studies and evaluated in the context of
geophysical studies in order to arrive at an integrated model of sediment
subduction and recycling at volcanic arcs.
