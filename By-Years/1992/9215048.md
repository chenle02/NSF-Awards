The purpose of the workshop is to develop a strategy and plan for advancing U.S.
economic interests in our 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The workshop
will focus on: 1) the present status and urgency for addressing this subject, 2)
the economic value of U.S. EEZ resources to the Nation, 3) areas of policy
concern, 4) institutional roles and technical capabilities, and 5) opportunities
for enhancing U.S. competitiveness. The workshop will develop national plan for
energizing industry, the university community, and government to find creative
solutions to the problems that are inhibiting growth and development in this
important U.S. economic sector.
