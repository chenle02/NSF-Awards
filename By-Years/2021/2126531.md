The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical care through
the use of new materials to support biological functions. This project will
develop a material for a variety of surgical implants for soft tissue repair and
support. This project specifically develops a sling implant for the treatment of
stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women. These conditions
cause significant loss of function and quality of life. The current solution,
polypropylene mesh implants, can cause adverse events such as pain and mesh
exposure. Collagen is more biocompatible than polypropylene and should produce
equivalent outcomes with fewer adverse events. In the longer term, other
applications for this biofabric include implants for orthopedic repairs, hernia
treatment, nerve regeneration, and general surgery.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up the
manufacturing process for producing a novel biofabric made from electrocompacted
collagen threads. This biofabric is highly biocompatible, induces a positive
tissue response, and resorbs slowly. The technical advances proposed include the
development of higher speed and throughput equipment and processes to
manufacture the thread and biofabric. This project advances the manufacturing
process associated with scaled production, as well as creating the verification
and validation procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
