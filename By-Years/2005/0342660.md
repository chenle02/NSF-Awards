With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at SUNY Albany will acquire a 400
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
research in a number of areas, including a) synthetic organic chemistry; b)
studies of redox, ligand substitution and isomerization transformation of metal-
metal bonded complexes; c) new synthetic methods and strategies for the total
synthesis of naturally occurring polycyclic aromatic compounds; d) study of the
organosulfur chemistry of natural products isolated from plants with
insecticidal, agricultural or medicinal value; e) studies on the regulatory
interdomain interactions of proteins; and f) the synthesis of peptidomimetics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and biochemistry.
