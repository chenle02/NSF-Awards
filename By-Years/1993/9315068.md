9315068 Sneden The production and distribution of elements in the Galaxy can be
most directly studied through high resolution spectroscopy of nearby stars. The
elemental abundances in old disk and population II giants, in metal-poor field
stars and in globular cluster giants will be determined. Spectra of selected
stars will be used to determine the abundances of calcium and sodium in
interstellar clouds in the galactic halo. Although diffuse interstellar bands
have been observed in reddened stars for a long time, the agent responsible is
still not identified. A new strategy involving lightly reddened stars will be
pursued to identify them. ***
