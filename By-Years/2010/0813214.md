Go Figure is a new multimedia project targeting 3- to 6-year olds, with a
secondary audience of parents and caregivers. The intended impact of the project
is to support the development of mathematics literacy for the pre-school
audience and to help the secondary audience to support young children's informal
mathematics education. This award supports pre-production development and
evaluation of project elements including the continuing design of characters and
locations, creation and test of interstitials, animatic and script, development
and testing of scaffolded math game prototypes and piloting real-world
extensions. The project will be produced by WGBH, with the support of advisors
and a third-party evaluator. The project is being designed for broadcast on
public television, with an extensive educational outreach component focused on
improving parental attitudes toward math.
