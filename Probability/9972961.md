The principal investigator will study diffusions on manifolds and stochastic
flows. The work on diffusions is aimed at various aspects of coupling and their
applications. One goal is to develop a method for coupling a diffusion which
arises from a Dirichlet form. A potential application of this work is a
probabilistic proof of the Moser Harnack inequality. Another goal is to study
the efficiency of the commonly used mirror coupling on manifolds. A goal of this
work is to gain potential new insights of the influence of geometry on the
bottom of the spectrum. A third problem is to determine which diffusions with
the normalized Riemannian volume as equilibrium distribution converge to
equilibrium the fastest. The principal problems in flows focus on rates of
dispersion of bodies under stochastic flows. This research concentrates on the
diffusion of particles on geometric structures called manifolds. It arises from
the theory of Brownian motion and exploits well known connections between
diffusions and the spread of heat in bodies (manifolds). Part of the research
deals with rates of change of temperature distributions on manifolds while
another deals with the rate of convergence to a steady state temperature
distribution. These can be studied by diffusion theory and the influence of the
geometry of the manifold on these quantities can be determined. The work on
dispersion of stochastic flows is essentially the determination of how fast an
oil slick will spread if all the oil particles are undergoing diffusive or
Brownian motion. Applications of this work can be made to pollution control
problems.
