The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most powerful carbon-carbon bond forming
reactions in chemistry, generating as many as four stereocenters in a single
step. A U-shaped template will be developed bearing 2,6-di(acylamino)pyridine
and carboxylic acid groups to simultaneously bind maleimide and dienes bearing
pendant amino groups in an appropriate orientation for Diels-Alder reaction. By
means of enthalpic(hydrogen bonding) and entropic(proximity) effects, the
template is anticipated to catalyze the Diels-Alder reaction while controlling
the stereo- and regioselectivity. The goals of the research include control of
the regioselectivity of reaction of substituted cyclopentadienes, inversion of
the natural endo-selectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction, and achievement of
enantioselectivity. Emphasis will be placed upon the development of strategies
to overcome product inhibition interactions. %%% This award is the starter grant
increment of Dr. Nowick's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry in
support of his research at the University of California at Irvine. The main
thrust of Dr. Nowick's research is the development of a template catalyst to
bind suitable diene and dienophile components and catalyze regio-, stereo-, and
enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions.
