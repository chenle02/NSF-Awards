The Event Horizon Telescope Science Gateway project is a collaborative effort to
develop an accessible web-based portal for analyzing black hole images. Bringing
together astrophysics researchers and students from the University of Arizona
with technology designers, cyberinfrastructure experts, and user experience
specialists from the Cyberinfrastructure Integration Research Center at the
Indiana Universityâ€™s Pervasive Technology Institute, the project aims to create
an intuitive gateway that harnesses the computational power provided by the
Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing and the Open Science Grid. The
gateway is built on the Apache Airavata Science Gateway framework. The user-
centric design of the portal allows both experienced and novice scientists to
access essential analysis tools and benefit from millions of freely available
computing cycles. Beyond providing a valuable compute environment and access to
untapped resources for the astrophysics community, the project serves as a case
study for using science gateways to facilitate access to high-throughput
computing resources, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating human-
computer interaction design with science gateway technologies to simplify access
to advanced computational resources.

Science gateways are effective tools for expanding access to scientific
cyberinfrastructure by creating user environments customized for specific
scientific communities. An emerging area of research in this field involves
integrating science gateway technologies with human-computer interaction and
user experience design methodologies. The Event Horizon Telescope community's
utilization of the Open Science Grid exemplifies this approach. This project
focuses on combining human-centered design principles with science gateway
technologies to address key challenges in resource provisioning, meta-
scheduling, data management, and complex computing workflows in high-throughput
settings. The objective is to enhance the Event Horizon Telescope community's
capacity to analyze extensive astronomical datasets by providing a more user-
friendly and efficient gateway. This innovative approach introduces a new
perspective to astrophysics and high-throughput computing, with the potential to
drive transformative advancements in both fields.
