The Connected Curriculum Project (CCP) is developing materials that emphasize
the unity of mathematics and the sciences. It combines hands-on experimentation
with computer-based exploration using Netscape and the World Wide Web. The
hypertext architecture of the Web is built on links and connections and, thus,
matches curricular goals. In addition, it allows students to customize their
learning, choosing examples and applications of particular interest and using
`just-in-time` help that is available at the click of a button. Using Netscape
to coordinate helper applications, the project creates a very interactive
environment with students moving among a browser window, a CAS window, and
hands-on laboratory work using the TI-CBL. The structure of CCP is open, taking
advantage of the adaptability of Web-based material to create a curriculum
featuring the very best material from the very best teachers. This multiple,
distributed authorship creates a widespread sense of ownership, the key to wide
and lasting dissemination. This project will transform workstations at four
sites to provide students at any of these sites with the same functionality.
Students working at one of these sites will be able to work on any CCP course
and to use CCP material in other courses as well. This is a cooperative effort
with the faculty of Bonneville High School in the development, implementation,
and assessment of materials for courses that are often taught at both the high
school and college levels. The Bonneville High School site can also be an
integral part of the preservice secondary education programs in mathematics and
science and a demonstration site for CCP materials for Utah high schools.
