9988480 Talagrand While studying mean field models for spin glasses (such as the
famous Sherrington Kirkpatrick model) a number of physicists "discovered" (or
more accurately, conjectured) some completely new phenomenon of probability
theory, namely the existence of intricate structures among the near extreme
values of large families of correlated random variables. The main goal of this
research is, through the study of the main models, to provide mathematically
rigorous foundations for their conjectures. Two main objectives are the control
of the entire high temperature region for the main models, and a complete
description of the low temperature phase of the simplest models. One of the
central themes of probability theory is the emergence of a kind of order out of
large number of random events. This is expressed by the main classical theorems,
starting with the law of large numbers. These classical result relate to
situations where the events are independent, that is do not influence each
other. Such an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the
emergence of new types of collective behavior in large collections of random
events, where each event can, and will, influence all the others.
