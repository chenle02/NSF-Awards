The Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP) is a
collaborative alliance of nine institutions, including two Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and three two-year institutions. The
overarching goal of ARK-LSAMP is to increase the pool of baccalaureate, masters,
and doctoral degree graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics
(STEM) disciplines entering Arkansas? workforce. The Alliance maintains its
commitment to the overarching goal of this transformative initiative through
objectives that will continue to increase the number of STEM graduates, as well
as implement best practices learned from initial NSF funding. A summer Bridge
program prepares first semester freshmen to successfully navigate the transition
to college level coursework. Mentoring programs provide peer mentoring (upper-
level student to lower-level student) as well as faculty mentoring. Summer and
academic year research in faculty laboratories provide extracurricular
involvement in research at the forefront of STEM. In addition to undergraduate
STEM programs, the Alliance continues to focus on increasing graduate STEM
scholars with a STEM seminar series providing training in research ethics,
information on STEM careers, STEM in society, and preparation for graduate
school. In response to NSF priorities, a veteran student focus will be added to
the program. An existing and well-established veterans program at a member
institution will serve as the best practice model. Alliance-wide and inter-
institutional conferences and activities will foster greater collaborative
research among faculty across institutions.
