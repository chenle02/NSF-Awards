Jackson State University, lead institution for the Louis Stokes Mississippi
Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-MAMP) will continue to make a
significant contribution to the nation?s science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) workforce through the statewide alliance. The LS-MAMP is a
consortium of six (6) state supported universities (Alcorn State University,
Jackson State University, University of Mississippi, Mississippi State
University, University of Southern Mississippi, Mississippi Valley State
University), one private college (Tougaloo College); and a community college
(Hinds Community College). &lt;br/&gt;The partnership will continue to implement
and improve recruitment and retention strategies through community college
bridge programs, synergistic scientific leadership development programs, global
internship research programs, business, industrial and governmental (BIG) STEM
internship programs, outreach programs, institutionalization programs, and other
programs that will contribute to LS-MAMP?s systemic shared transformative (SST)
vision. The vision is to produce and increase the competitiveness and number of
globally astute STEM graduates from historically underrepresented minority (URM)
populations in the state and nation who are prepared to make a positive impact
in graduate school and/or the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;Through the LS-MAMP program,
the number of highly competent, competitive, globally astute URM STEM graduates
who are prepared to make a positive impact in graduate school and/or the
workforce within Mississippi and the nation will be increased. Furthermore,
through the LS-MAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program, alliance institutions
will increase the number of STEM doctoral degrees to historically
underrepresented minorities who will become well-qualified scientists, STEM
faculty members, mathematicians, and engineers.
