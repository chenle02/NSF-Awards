This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
CUNY. The student will conduct a case study of a development project in
Cochabamba, Bolivia, instituted by a German development agency. Through
intensive interviews, the student will examine the goals and objectives of the
different actors in the project -- donors, administrators, experts, and the
local people. The PROSANA development project will be studied to describe how
the values of the German donors and Bolivian intermediaries and subjects
intermesh, compare and contrast. By examining the development project as a
process beginning in Germany and continuing in Bolivia, with interaction and
back-and-forth negotiation instead of the simple picture of top-down
development, the project will contribute a valuable case to the literature. This
research is important because it will add to the nation's expertise about this
important region of the world through advanced training, and will extend our
understanding of how economic development works as a process of negotiation
between different cultural systems. Increased understanding of the cultural
component of development will help planners avoid mistakes based on fundamental
misunderstandings and will be useful in designing programs that have greater
chances of attaining their goals.
