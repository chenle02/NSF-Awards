Dr. Que will investigate the active site structures of hemerythrin, purple acid
phosphates and methane monooxygenase and the extent that the oxo.bridged
binuclear clusters found in the prototypical methemerythrin active site is
conserved in this group of proteins. NMR, EXFAS, EPR, Mossbauer, magnetic
susceptibility and resonance Raman techniques will be applied to study the
active sites. Model compounds will be used as necessary to ascertain
spectroscopic signatures. Proteins containing iron.oxo clusters at their active
sites constitute a subclass of metalloproteins which include hemerythrin,
certain ribonucleotide reductases, purple acid phosphatases possibly methane
monooxygenase. The hemerythrins function as oxygen transport proteins in marine
invertebrates. The ribonucleotide reductases convert ribonucleotides to
deoxyribonucleotides and are therefore important for cell replication. The
purple acid phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate esters while
methane monooxygenase converts methane to methanol. Dr. Que will investigate how
nature can tune the environment of the cluster to perform these different
biochemical reactions.
