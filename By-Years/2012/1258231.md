Evolution is a rapid process that can be studied experimentally in natural
populations, yet we know much more about evolution as the ultimate cause of
change over time than we do about how it works on a day to day basis. This study
will reveal how and why evolution does or does not happen by quantifying the
different factors that can contribute to the way organisms can change over time.
The investigators are studying evolution by transplanting guppies from a portion
of a stream in Trinidad where guppies co-occur with predators and sustain high
mortality rates, into four headwater streams that were previously guppy-free and
predator free. Prior research demonstrated that the lower mortality risk in such
environments causes the evolution of life histories (maturity, number of
offspring produced, lifespan) and other attributes (male coloration, courtship
behavior, neuromuscular performance) within two to ten years. The current
experiments extend that work by reconstructing the pedigrees of the evolving
populations and by quantify differences among individuals in reproductive
success, thus partitioning change over time into nongenetic (environmental or
maternal effects) and genetic effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
involve the participation of many undergraduate and graduate students, and
continued outreach through a public website (cnas.ucr.edu/guppy) and in
Trinidad. The project also strengthens international collaborations with
scientists in Germany.
