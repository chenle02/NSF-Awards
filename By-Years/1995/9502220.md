9502220 Schaefer This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) program. As a CAREER awardee the investigator is
expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his scientific
research project. Gamma Ray Bursts are enigmatic flashes of gamma radiation
which last typically from a second to a minute in duration. When they are
bursting, their brightness varies chaotically, and they are by far the brightest
source in the gamma ray sky. They are seen roughly once a day, from random
directions, and at unpredictable times. Virtually no positive facts are known
concerning the cause of gamma ray bursts, and this is traceable to the
unfortunate circumstances that the distance scale to the bursters cannot be
constrained to within 13 orders of magnitude. The population of bursts might be
distributed among distant galaxies, in an extended halo around our Milky Way, or
in our Sun's Oort Cloud. Until this distance scale question can be solved, gamma
ray bursts must remain one of the biggest mysteries in modern astrophysics. Dr.
Schaefer will attack the distance scale problem from several perspectives with
the goal of finding a solution. In his education activities, Dr. Schaefer plans
to integrate undergraduate and graduate students into the research projects
through opportunities for undergraduate summer work, senior projects, graduate
student summer work, and graduate thesis work. He will also continue public
education activities with amateur astronomers to strengthen professional/amateur
relationships.
