The development of highly parallel computational methods for the solution of
three-dimensional transient partial differential equations representing fluid
flow in porous media and the transport of reactive solutes is proposed. These
methods will focus on large scale three dimensional problems and will have
applications in enhanced oil recovery and restoration of contaminated
groundwater systems. The methods will be implemented, and performance and
scaling issues assessed, using the Connection Machine as the target
architecture.
