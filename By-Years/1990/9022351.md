The principal investigator undertakes to develop a state-of-the-art software
package to compute unsteady, chemically reacting, two-phase, viscous flows in
and around objects of complex shape. Such fluid flow problems arise in
aerodynamics, for example in describing airflow past wings or around entire
planes or missiles. Another area of applications involves the study and design
of internal-combustion engines, jet engines, and turbines. In each of these
applications highly accurate simulations are desirable but expensive to
calculate. The software package to be developed is intended to include accurate
and efficient numerical algorithms, and to cover applications of existing gas
dynamics programs and Navier-Stokes (fluid flow) programs.
