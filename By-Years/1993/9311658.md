9311658 MacKnight Recent preliminary results have demonstrated complex formation
between sulfonated polystyrene ionomers and oil-soluble surfactants in non-polar
media resulting in the formation of a new type of nonstoichiometric
polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant complex which is soluble in some
low-polarity solvents. The proposed research will be devoted to two subjects: an
investigation of complexation between ionomers and oil-soluble surfactants and
the study of the structure and properties of such complexes in non-polar media;
and synthesis, investigation of structure and properties of novel
nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte-water soluble surfactant complexes with a
slight excess of non-complexed polyelectrolyte ionic groups. The study of the
influence of the chemical structure of ionomer and surfactant and their initial
aggregation state on complexation and the structure of the aggregates will
provide a basis for quantitative modeling of ionomer-surfactant interactions in
non- polar media. The experimental approach to the characterization of the
aggregates will include viscometry, sedimentation velocity, dynamic, and static
light scattering as well as x-ray scattering. Differential scanning calorimetry,
dynamic mechanical and dielectric relaxation will be used to determine
properties for these complexes in non-polar solutions and in the bulk. ***
