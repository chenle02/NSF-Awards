By adopting and adapting the Paradigm in Physics curricular materials developed
at Oregon State University, this project is working to improve undergraduate
education in a second-year modern physics course and in a third/fourth-year
quantum mechanics course at the University of Vermont. In addition to using
these course materials, the project is using validated assessment instruments to
measure increases in student knowledge and, through the use of longitudinal
surveys, to assess the evolution of ontological beliefs about modern physics and
quantum mechanical concepts. Dissemination is specifically targeted at other
physics departments in the state of Vermont.
