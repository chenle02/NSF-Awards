This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Professor Andrew Gewirth
will study the electronic structure of molecules on surfaces using STM methods.
In addition, atomic force microscopic methods will be developed to study
electrode surfaces. Both methods will be used in situ. Particular focus of these
studies includes transition metal containing adsorbates on electrode materials.
The development of electronic structure measurements using STM spectroscopic
methods will be accomplished. AFM studies will focus on under potential
deposition (upd) processes in redox active electrolytes. This five year
continuing grant to the University of Illinois for the support of Professor
Gewirth is designed to promote his rapid and effective growth as an independent
researcher in the field of tunneling microscopy at electrode interfaces.
