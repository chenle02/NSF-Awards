This three year project, sponsored by the Joint Council on Economic Education,
will support a nationwide teacher enhancement program whose objective is to
prepare teachers to teach advanced placement economics in the high schools. The
program will take place at four sites (University of California, Los Angeles;
University of Minnesota; Purdue University; Clemson University) and 25 well
prepared teach- ers will be selected from each region to attend a 2 1/2 day
orientation session and a three week summer session. The teachers will learn
both content and instructional tech- niques and will also be prepared to be
teacher trainers so that the regional workshops can be replicated at local
sites. In the second year of the project staff will devel- op a teacher training
manual which can be used in the inservice activities. In the third year the
resources of the Joint Council will be used to help the teacher trainers carry
out in-service programs to disseminate the curriculum locally. The matching
funds provided by the Joint Council on Econom- ic Education constitute more than
122% of the NSF grant.
