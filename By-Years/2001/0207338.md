University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Satellite Reconnect
Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Satellite Reconnect Project is designed to
"reconnect" to the computer science and mathematics research enterprise, two-
year and four-year college faculty who have not had opportunities to keep up
with new research developments. It aims to reinvigorate their careers and
enhance their teaching by exposing them to current research topics in computer
science and related mathematics that are relevant to the undergraduate
classroom. This is being accomplished initially through a series of summer
conferences at DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science, at Rutgers University. As part of the conferences,
participants prepare written classroom materials based on current research
topics and have the opportunity to publish them in the DIMACS Educational
Modules Series. Concurrently, the basic program conference structure is being
replicated at six selected satellite locations around the country, generally
with different research topics, but under DIMACS guidance and leadership.
Through this mechanism, the project aims to establish a community of individuals
and institutions with expertise in and commitment to this type of "Reconnect"
project and concept. The satellite activities are supplemented with an effort to
disseminate the model to the wider community so that this type of program can be
copied at numerous other locations around the
country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
