The computer provides handicapped people in this modern society a tool which can
greatly enhance their chances of independent living in many ways. It permits
them to live more normal lives. This program proposes to utilize special
education majors by teaming them with handicapped students. The special
education majors involved will receive instruction related to the specific
hardware and software required by their teammates. They, in turn, will have the
responsibility of teaching these computer related skills to their partners. This
program will provide all students involved with the basis for further studies in
the area of computing; the special education students will be provided with
important exposure to tools of their trade not normally received in an
undergraduate program and the handicapped with knowledge that will make them
more marketable. Matching funds are available.
