The most fundamental aspects of statistical modeling in speech recognition,
linear Gaussian statistics, have been essentially unchanged in the past 20
years. Fundamental advancement is required if speech recognition is to become a
pervasive technology in a myriad of applications requiring robustness to severe
amounts of noise (e.g., cell phones and in-vehicle automotive applications).
Nonlinear statistical models for speech were first proposed in the early 1980's
when fractals and other such techniques promised great advances in compression.
Since then progress has been slow but steady. Recent advances in various areas
of speech processing, such as pitch determination and speech modeling, plus
staggering advances in computational resources, suggest that these models are
now viable for traditional problems such as speaker recognition, speaker
verification, and speech recognition. Nonlinear dynamics provide a framework
that supports parsimonious statistical models that may overcome many of the
limitations of current hidden Markov model based techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves extending the traditional
supervised-learning HMM paradigm to support a chaotic acoustic model that
incorporates a nonlinear statistical model of observation vectors and then
evaluating the impact of this model on text-independent speaker verification
applications. The primary goal is to understand acoustic variation at the
phonetic level in a more comprehensive and efficient manner. The proposed
research could go far to enhance the potential practicality of nonlinear speech
modeling. In addition, the computational tools and resources to be developed are
expected to enhance the existing infrastructure for Internet accessible speech
recognition, while promoting better understanding of speech in both research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;
