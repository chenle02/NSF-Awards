This project aims to obtain the flame thickness response to stretch,
preferential diffusion, and turbulence. It proposes three specific objectives:
(i) develop an innovative concept of using velocity profiles to define and
quantify flame thicknesses such that they can be meaningfully evaluated with
ease and accuracy; (ii) obtain one-dimensional, adiabatic, premixed flame
thicknesses; (iii) obtain flame thickness response to physico-chemical
parameters for comparison with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the results
from this proposed program may provide a basis for extending the concept to
nonpremixed flames. The velocity profiles and conditional velocity statistics
will be obtained by using laser doppler velocimetry. A counterflow nozzle
configuration will be used to stabilize planar, adiabatic flames. The results
obtained from this proposed experimental study will be valuable because (i) they
will validate a simple method of evaluating the flame thickness which is an
intrinsic property of flames; (ii) they will consolidate numerous definitions in
use presently, thereby promoting unity in its description and usage; and (iii)
they will complement and test theoretical studies on flame thickness. Because
flame thickness has been extensively used in describing behavior of flames
important in flame stabilization and for interpreting turbulent combustion, the
proposed study is of fundamental and practical importance to combustion science
and technology.
