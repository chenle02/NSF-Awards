A major goal of the Department of Physics is the improvement of a topical course
for non-science-majors entitled Physics of Music. This course treats the physics
of motion and waves and investigates such topics as musicians' and physicists'
perceptions of the same sounds, the construction of musical scales, and the
physical attributes of the major groupings of musical instruments. Historically,
this course has been a lecture course with only three short laboratory
exercises. The project is significantly enhancing the course by adding a weekly
laboratory designed to acquaint each student more effectively with the nature of
physics and the interplay between experiment and theory. The laboratory is also
giving each student a more secure, personal familiarity with the physical
phenomena discussed in the course. The new equipment is supporting experiments
on the spectral composition of the sounds produced by various musical
instruments and on the nature of resonance as an important characteristic of
musical instruments. This development is likely to increase the number of non-
science-majors electing physics courses, and is contributing to the department's
response to increasingly strident national calls that science departments give
renewed attention to their offerings for non-science-majors.
