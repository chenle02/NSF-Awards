This award under the Presidential Young Investigator Program provides support
for research in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. The general topic of the
research project is the roles which metal ions play in biological systems.
Research will be pursued on two fronts: exploring the structural and functional
roles of metals in novel gene regulatory metalloproteins and developing the
chemistry of oxygen activating metal complexes containing biological ligands.
The immediate targets are metalloproteins that play key roles in cellular
metabolism of heavy metals, particularly those regulating gene expression or
mediating heavy metal detoxification. In particular, attention will be given to
metalloregulatory proteins which act as metal-responsive molecular switches,
sensing changes in metal ion concentrations and adjusting the expression of
relevant genes. On the second front the activation of oxygen by metal-nucleotide
complexes will be investigated. Of particular interest is the mechanism by which
mixtures of ADP and Fe(II) promote lipid peroxidation by molecular oxygen. Iron
nucleotide complexes will be isolated and characterized, and the mechanism of
activation of oxygen and their utility as epoxidation catalysts will be
explored.
