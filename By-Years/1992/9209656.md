This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Jeanne McHale to pursue a one year
pilot study developing resonance raman approaches to the Stark effect. Past
approaches have used less informative electronic spectroscopic approaches.
Results of Raman studies of this kind will provide structural information which
has been hitherto unavailable. Dr. McHale has developed a productive program in
Raman Spectroscopy and has constructed most of the necessary equipment to do
this kind of work. Funding of this project is timely because it will enable her
to establish herself at the lead of a potentially extremely important new
direction in her research. %%%This proposal builds a research program in the
study of how electric fields distort the structures of molecules. Such
information is important to the understanding of many aspects of biochemical
phenomena and of catalytic processes of industrial significance.
