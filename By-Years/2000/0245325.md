The purpose of this project is to 'rescue' a unique dataset that spans 1913-1960
and that includes information about the demography of subalpine plants in the
Rocky Mountains. The dataset is in danger of being lost because of difficulties
in archiving the original data and the retirement of the last investigator
involved in the project. Over 1000 chart quadrat maps will be archived
digitally; these maps mark the locations and sizes of every plant in 91 1-meter
quadrats. Maps will be digitized and made available to the scientific and
management communities via the Shortgrass Steppe-Long Term Ecological Research
web set. A photographic archive of the original maps also will be prepared. The
resulting database will be valuable to resource managers as well as to the
ecological community. Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive
training in GPS technology.
