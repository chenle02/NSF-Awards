Regulation of endomembrane calcium (Ca2+) transporters, which control the
duration and amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ spikes, plays a pivotal role in
translating a generic cytosolic Ca2+ increase into a specific biological
response. In plant biology, the precise contribution made by endomembrane Ca2+
transporters to the intricate process of Ca2+ signaling has not been delineated.
The working hypothesis addressed in this project is that vacuolar transporters
play a formidable role in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The PI will use the
Arabidopsis vacuolar H+/ Ca2+ exchanger CAX1 to identify molecules that regulate
this transporter. Experiments that perturb vacuolar Ca2+ transporters will
elucidate the role that vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration plays in adapted responses
and assess the spatiotemporal profile of cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients. These
experiments will greatly strengthen our fundamental understanding of Ca2+
signaling in plants.
