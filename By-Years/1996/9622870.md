9622870 Kac This grant supports the research of Professor V. Kac to work on
various problems in representation theory and mathematical physics. He will
study the representation theory of the Lie algebra of differential operators on
the circle as well vertex operators, quantum groups and conformal quantum field
theory. He will also study soliton equations, integral representations of affine
superalgebras and the relationship between reciprocity laws in number theory and
the representation theory of infinite dimensional groups. This is research that
starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to touch both number
theory and theoretical physics. The reasons for these connections are that
algebra can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such
algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular
the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this area of algebra
extensively and this project will study some of these connections at length.
There are also connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across
communication lines.
