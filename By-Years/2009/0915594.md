This award supports the Doctoral Colloquium program at the 2009 iConference to
be held on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
February 8 - February 11, 2009. This workshop will bring together 15
dissertation-stage doctoral students in diverse information and informatics
subfields for one day of presentations, interaction, and feedback with five
faculty members selected from among distinguished information researchers. The
iConference Doctoral Research Colloquium is designed to assist doctoral students
to become stewards of the information and informatics disciplines, by providing
an opportunity for interaction with distinguished research faculty and for the
development of a global cohort group of new researchers. This project provides
support for the travel, lodging and registration of students, plus the
registration for the participating faculty mentors, as well as the direct
expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.
