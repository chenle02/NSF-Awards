Many statistical analyses in the social and natural sciences don't take proper
account of shifts of distributions. This variability can be seen in the shift in
the distribution in stock market, in the income distribution, in the electoral
map, in the levels of a river or of the waves. All the data arising from these
phenomena are considered to be non-stationary. Non-stationary data, as a rule,
cannot be easily modeled and studied. The results obtained by many of the
existing models may be spurious. They may indicate a relationship between two
variables, where one does not exist. In order to apply consistent, reliable
results, the rigorous mathematical tools have to be constructed for non-
stationary data. This research has double scope. First, it will contribute to a
better understanding and modeling of the non-stationarity phenomena and, in
addition, will build new, reliable tools for their forecast and their long term
behavior.

An important technique for establishing limit theorems for nonstationary
sequences and random fields is to approximate them with well understood
structures, such as martingales and ortho-martingales. Motivated by the study of
asymptotic properties of nonstationary evolutions the theory of nonstationary
martingale approximations will be developed. This theory is fundamental for
obtaining new projective criteria for nonstationary stochastic processes and for
random fields that ensure maximal inequalities and asymptotic results, including
the conditional functional central limit theorem and limit theorems started at a
point for multi-indexed evolutions. The processes to be studied are very
general. They include random fields with long memory and therefore they are
useful to model data arising from many applied fields, such as data from
economics, social sciences or engineering.
