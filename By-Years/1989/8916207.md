This award studies of active crustal deformation in southern California, in
research areas that should complement past and future geodetic studies. Previous
work has emphasized analysis of data from with instruments Pinon Flat
Observatory (PFO), along with the development of the techniques needed for high-
quality measurements. The PIs will continue this, focusing on ways to use
existing deformation data, both from PFO and from geodetic surveys, to test
hypotheses about the nature of fault zones. They will continue a detailed
examination of the USGS EDM-network data in southern California, working on the
difficult inverse problem of solving for fault-plane displacements given the
observed line-length changes. This investigation should improve not only
understanding of fault mechanics, but should also prove valuable for planning
future geodetic measurements near active faults. This award falls under NEHRP.
