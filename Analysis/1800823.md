This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Spring Mini
Course in Analysis and Geometry" that will be held February 8-11, 2018 at the
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. The conference
focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic
analysis and geometric analysis. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at: www.math.lsu.edu/~MiniCoures
