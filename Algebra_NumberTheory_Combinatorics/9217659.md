This award supports a conference on Design Theory, Coding Theory, and
Cryptography, which is to be organized by Professor Lindner, at Auburn
University. The combinatorics group at Auburn has been an extremely active
group. This meeting will bring together experts from all over the world. The
organizers will make a concerted effort to bring in minority graduate students
to the conference. The participation of these graduate students will enhance
their abilities to participate more fully in mathematical research. The research
is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be organized. The
behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.
For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the
design of algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete objects, and
this makes use of combinatorial research.
