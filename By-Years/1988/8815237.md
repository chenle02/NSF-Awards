Microbial extracellular polysaccharides are ubiquitous in the epilithon
covering submerged lotic surfaces, yet their significance to carbon transfer in
these ecosystems is unknown. The proposed research will estimate production of
bacterial and algal biomass and the production of microbial extracellular
polysaccharide on wood substrates in the Ogeechee River, a sixth order
blackwater river, and measure the efficiency with which extracellular
polysccharide may be assimilated by nymphal ayflies and by oligochaets.
Assimilation of extracellular polysaccharide will be determined by feeding
studies using 14C labelled extracellular polysaccharides. These polysaccharides
will be purified form cultures of slime-producing bacteria which have been
isolated from wood submerged in the Ogeechee River. Oak dowels in stream-side
flumes will be used as subtrates for microbial colonization. If extracellular
polysaccharides are assimilated by freshwater invertebrates, the contribution of
microbes to invertebrate productivity would be much greater than suggested by
estimates of cellular consumption alone. The assimilation of these products of
microbial metabolism may contribute to meeting detritivore carbon requirements
in many aquatic habitats where cellular microbial biomass is insufficient to
meet detritivore needs. This research should be of significant basic ecological
interest and produce results with meaning for stream management. The student's
mentor is an excellent scientist, and institutional accommodations are good. The
Ecosystem Studies Program recommends support for this doctoral dissertation
improvement project.
