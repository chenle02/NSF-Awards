The recent successful launch of the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere,
Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite presents a unique opportunity to
obtain global measurements of the mesosphere that can be coordinated with
ground-based instrumentation to further our understanding of the dynamics of
this important region. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
requests support for ground-based Medium Frequency (MF) radar measurements using
the Imaging Doppler Interferometry (IDI) technique as implemented on the
dynasonde operating at the Utah State University Bear Lake Observatory. Because
the IDI technique is viewed by many within the aeronomy community as being
controversial, this study will also carry out a detailed analysis of coordinated
meteor wind measurements, as well as undertaking a correlation analysis using
similar measurements acquired with an MF radar being operated at the Platteville
site in Colorado.
