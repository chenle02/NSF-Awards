With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Creary of Notre Dame
University will investigate the mechanisms regarding the novel heterocyclic
compound formation derived from allowing halodiazirines to react with the
xanthate ion. Further, attempts will be made to generate C-centered diazirinyl
anions and to determine their thermal stability. This is of interest as these
compounds are antiaromatic anions. Finally, the project will investigate the
means to expand the scope of the beta-lactam forming reaction that was recently
discovered by the author. Synthetic sequences which are new and yield novel
products of general interest provide scientists with alternatives to new drugs
and materials. This project addresses this point and describes further how these
concepts can be used to generalize the methodology. Namely, a mechanistic
understanding of the reaction will enable scientists to generalize and expand
the scope of the original discovery. Since these heterocyclic compounds involve
nitrogen, they are physiologically significant
