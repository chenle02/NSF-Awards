The Business-Higher Education Forum proposes to stimulate a broad national
discussion and develop a comprehensive vision about how to revitalize American
know-how by improving the inventiveness and productivity of American citizens.
This will be accomplished in the following stages by a task force of Forum
members who represent the nation's major academic and corporate chief
executives: 1) developing a consensus among leaders of business and higher
education regarding educating and retooling the American work force which will
be the framework for a major Forum report to be released on Labor Day 1988. 2)
developing recommendations in early 1989 for Federal, state and local leaders.
This project will provide valuable information on not only elementary,
secondary, and undergraduate education, but also on the training and retraining
of the workforce--topics of grave concern to an increasingly technological
society. The cochairmen of this project are extremely able and can solicit
cooperation from government, industry, and academia. The Forum has a track
record of valuable contributions in related areas.
