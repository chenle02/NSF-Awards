The primary goal herein is to develop effective tools for experimental work in
graph algorithms and theory. The lack of such software and techniques inhibits
the use of efficient but sophisticated graph algorithms and therefore inhibits
basic research in graph algorithms and theory. This includes evaluating current
graph packages, developing software prototypes for new approaches, exploring
object- oriented language issues for describing graphs and graph algorithms, and
exploring efficiency issues such as on-line algorithms, geometric embeddings,
and large data sets. To date, very little of this basic work for graph software
has been done. A second goal is to develop the analytical techniques necessary
for experimental work on graphs. This includes algorithm animation and
performance verification.
