A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system with thermal desorption capability
has been acquired which permits the quantatative identification of complex
organic compounds at low levels in air, water, and soil. This system complements
the inorganic, microbiologic, and radiologic environmental monitoring and
analysis capabilities of the department. Such equipment is vital to the
education of the students in the earth sciences and the environmental sciences
and engineering areas, all of whom receive extensive training in most aspects of
environmental testing and most of whom secure positions with governmental
agencies, private laboratories, environmental groups, or companies directly
concerned with environmental testing and assessment. The relative importance of
organic compounds in the enviromnent is increasing and students should be
provided with the education necessary to identify and assess the sighnificance
of these compounds. The grantee provides funds for this project that are more
than an equal match for the NSF award.
