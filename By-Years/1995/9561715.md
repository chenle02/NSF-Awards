Mechanical engineers have long recognized that the optimum way to match the
performance characteristics of an engine to the drive train of a vehicle is with
a continuously variable transmission; and for more than 100 years, designers
have tried unsuccessfully to develop one which can match the torque capacity,
efficiency, size, weight and manufacturing cost of steppedÃratio transmissions.
In 1989, Epilogics introduced the first fully geared, continuously variable
transmission for automobile and trucking applications. This transmission, called
the IVT, has the potential to satisfy these needs without sacrificing size,
safety or performance. The key technical issue is that of mechanical stresses on
the internal components of the IVT. A thorough and systematic engineering
analysis of operating forces indicates that the most critical component is the
oneÃway clutch. Such clutches in conventional transmissions are cycled only when
changing gears. Nominal lifetime requirements are one million cycles. The oneÃ
way clutch in the IVT, without which the transmission would not work, is cycled
once every revolution of the transmission. The lifetime requiremeilt is 600
million cycles, or more than two orders of magnitude greater than the
requirements of a standard device. The lack of a oneÃway clutch is presently the
key technical barrier to the widespread commercial development of the IVT. The
goal of the Phase I research project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
developing a suitable oneÃway clutch. If successful, Phase II will carry the
development further by building a number of preÃcommercial prototype units and
comprehensively testing them. If a technical solution can be demonstrated,
Epilogics has an industrial partner ready to pursue the initial
commercialization of the technology.
