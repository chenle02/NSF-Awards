One aspect of modern technology is that it is easy to collect data. A very
challenging task is to sift through a large collection of data in order to find
meaningful information. One would like to organize the data, or at least part of
it, in such a way that it is easy to use. Imagine the data as being all images
on the internet, and the "organization" that you seek is being able to map out
which images are those of a specific person of your choosing, subordered
according to the activities in which he or she is engaged. Organizing large
amounts of information in a useful way, or sorting through it and finding pieces
you care about, are tasks that can be transformed, or related to, mathematical
questions. This proposal attempts to address some of these questions. Basic
questions are mathematical analogues of the following: What kind of structure
can I hope to get after organizing the data? How much of my data can I expect to
organize in a useful way? Do answers change if I am willing to "lose" some
information in the process? Will I know the amount data lost? And, last but not
least, can I, in a practical way, access the organized data or a significant
part of it?

In many applications one is given a large data set represented as a subset of a
metric space, such as a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and one seeks to
"faithfully" represent a "large" portion of this data set as a subset of a low-
dimensional Euclidean space. "Faithfully" means in this context that one can
still perform the same data mining tasks on the image of the data portion that
one could on the original data set. This task has thus far received much
attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a wide range
of approaches. The framework of dimensionality reduction also includes data
compression and data approximation. These have applications in many areas of
science. Geometric measure theory and geometric function theory are tools whose
use in this matter has not been fully exploited. A key point is that often the
given data set has some additional geometric structure, for example, has small
Hausdorff dimension (a discrete analogue) or is close to being a union of low-
dimensional manifolds. This allows one to use harmonic analysis and geometric
measure theory to organize the data. This project will study mathematical
questions motivated by this observation. Two basic questions the project will
attempt to answer can be phrased as follows: When is part of a metric measure
space composed of Lipschitz images of "standard" pieces and how does one find
these pieces? When is a collection of points best described as one-dimensional?
