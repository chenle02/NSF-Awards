A US-China Workshop Proposal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this proposal is to organize a US-China Workshop on Multi-Scale
Model-based Simulation in Mechanics and Materials
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed that the
workshop be held in Dalian, China, during 2-4 September 2004. The workshop
consists of sessions in different subtopics of multi-scale modeling and
simulation. The presented papers will be published in the workshop proceedings
and posted on the website. Selected papers will be published in the
International Journal for Multiscale Computational
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The associated local
living costs and workshop fees will be covered by the Chinese
NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The
workshop could make an immediate contribution to the progress of multi-scale
modeling and simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact - Institutions,
researchers, expertise and infrastructure in these two countries could be
identified to promote international joint research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
