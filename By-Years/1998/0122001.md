ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Some Students have Trouble with Maps &amp;
Spatial Representations: an On-line Tutorial for Geoscience
Faculty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an on-line interactive
tutorial which addresses a topic of widespread concern to geoscience educators.
The topic for the proposed tutorial is maps and related spatial representations.
Making and interpreting maps and other spatial representations is central to
most of the geoscience disciplines, yet it is a skill that a substantial
minority of undergraduates struggles with. Most college professors have little
or no professional training in how people learn or think, and they have little
time or infrastructure for professional development as educators on the job.
Cognitive and developmental researchers have extensively studied the cognitive
processes that underlie the comprehension and generation of maps, but few of
those insights have reached geoscience faculty. DLESE has the potential to help
this situation by providing on-line professional development materials, designed
for college faculty, focusing on specific problems or issues that arise commonly
in teaching geoscience concepts and skills. &lt;br/&gt;
