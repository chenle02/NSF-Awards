The Near East has long served as a focus for archaeological investigation,
because its prehistory documents two of the major "revolutions" in human
development. At a time just prior to 10,000 years ago small hunting and
gathering bands began to develop a settled way of life. Group size increased,
ceramic vessels were first manufactured, and the gradual domestication of both
wild plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as goats and sheep
occurred. At a later time period, social units grew larger and became organized
on a hierarchical basis. Temples and large public buildings were constructed,
and the hallmarks of "civilization" such as writing emerged. In their
speculations on how and why this process occurred, archaeologists have realized
that human societies interact closely with and are influenced by the natural
environment, and it has been implicitly assumed that environmental change played
a role. However, just how the environment changed over time and how populations
were affected is unclear. Dr. Frank Hole and his colleagues will conduct
research to address this issue. The team is experienced in collaborative, multi-
disciplinary field and laboratory research and will acquire data to assess
environmental change over time. They will conduct field studies of the
geomorphology and vegetation of the Khabur drainage of northeastern Syria and
establish a regional environmental context for interpretation. They will also
sample sections from prior archaeological excavations to obtain data pertinent
to local environments and economic adaptations across the time sequence. Because
of extensive salvage archaeology in this region, many sites of known age which
contain relevant data are available. These settlements will yield both
environmental and economic information. This research is important for several
reasons. It will provide new insight into the processes which underlie the
development of complex society. It will also yield information on long-term
human-environment interactions in a ecologically sensitive part of the world.
