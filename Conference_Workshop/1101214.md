South East Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON) is a two-day meeting on number
theory, taken in a very broad sense. It is held annually each spring semester at
rotating institutions and offers participants the opportunity to explore new
ideas and concepts. A primary goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among
number theorists and combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly,
informal setting where they can come together. Another objective of SERMON
meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages; SERMON speakers
include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.

The 23rd annual South East Regional Meeting On Numbers will be held on April
16-17, 2011 at the Armstrong Atlantic State University. This yearly conference
will feature 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks
by one or more noted mathematicians. A regional conference such as this
encourages the participation of both graduate students and junior faculty and
allows them to increase their understanding and advance their knowledge in ways
that would otherwise not be available to them. The conference will also allow
students and staff from teaching-oriented universities to connect with their
colleagues from research-oriented universities. Particularly for students, this
will expose them to career paths beyond the undergraduate level.
