Implementation of this grant has allowed Fort Scott to introduce a variety of
ionic equilibrium experiments to the General Chemistry and Basic Chemistry
laboratories. New exercises have been developed that use specific ion electrodes
to measure ion concentrations directly and the calculate equilibium constants.
Demonstrations and exercises have been developed in students trace the progress
of the equilibria as one reagent is added to another. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
