A novel approach to engineering computing in the area of the electric power
transmission systems and other large textured systems is introduced and proposed
for study and evaluation. The approach is novel in various ways. It exploits the
"textured" character of this class of engineering systems by constructing their
model and the associated algorithmic arrangement as one unit. Conventionally
engineers supply the models and problem statement and then experts in numerical
work solve this mathematical programming problem. Strengthening this interface
creates a truly engineering computing approach, where the system is broken up
into optimally sized multiple groups of active and passive elements.
Disjointness and intersection of these groups is then alternately exploited in
iterative parallel processing to solve problems of dynamic or static
optimization or other computations. The computational speedup ranges (on the
basis of preliminary work) into orders of magnitude and it is rapidly increasing
with the size of the system given the appropriate number of parallel processors.
Even serial processing produces very large speedup, however. The proposed
project will 1) refine the concept of textured system, based on the power
system, 2) investigate convergence, computation time, applicability and
accuracy, 3) examine parallel processing considerations including communications
overhead, and explore links with existing computer architectures, e.g.
interconnection networks, 4) evaluate effectiveness and limitations, and 5)
conduct preliminary software development and testing.
