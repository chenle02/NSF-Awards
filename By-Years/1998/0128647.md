This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
technical feasibility for applying a new innovative sensing technology to
rapidly identify and sort aluminum metals from other non-magnetic metals such as
copper, zinc, nickel, and non-magnetic stainless steels commonly found in scrap
metals, particularly metals derived from automobile shredder facilities. The
objective will be to develop an environmentally friendly computerized dry
process which can be situated locally and which can rapidly and cleanly sort
aluminum scrap from mixtures of nonmagnetic metals at low cost. This technology
will replace the large, costly, and environmentally burdensome heavy media
process that is current used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications
for this technology will be sorting of aluminum from automobile shredders. This
technology will significantly reduce the environmental impact of sending these
materials to landfills. The materials recovered can be recycled and sold back to
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
