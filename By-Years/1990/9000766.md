The National Nanofabircation Facility (NNF) at Cornell University has, in its
first twelve years, provided an outstanding research environment for thousands
of graduate students and visiting scientists from universities, government
laboratories and industry throughout the country. Through this REU Site Project,
the faculty, the director and the full-time staff of the NNF, will give
undergraduate students an introduction to this field of science and engineering
and an opportunity to experience this research environment. The selection
process will bring bright young undergraduate students, including minorities, to
the Cornell campus for nine weeks to participate in a variety of research
projects related to microfabrication. They will meet and work with graduate
students and faculty members, attend a short course on the practical aspects of
microfabrication, and observe firsthand the interaction of the several
disciplines that must come together for the successful completion of research in
this field. This is intended to stimulate student interest in nanofabrication
and contribute to the availability of trained professionals in this high
technology area of science.
