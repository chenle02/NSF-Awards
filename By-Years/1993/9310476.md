9310476 Aifantis The work will explore the adaptation of recent methods of
nonlinear physics in interpreting a variety of plastic flow and fracture
phenomena exhibiting pattern formation and periodicity. The occurrence of
dislocation patterns, regularly spaced shear or rotational bands and cracks,
periodic velocity profiles and step- like crack growth in stick-slip fracture,
are some of the examples to be considered from a unifying point of view.
Emphasis will be placed in providing qualitative explanations and quantitative
models for problems that could not be addressed by using standard approaches.
