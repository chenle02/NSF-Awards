The Department of Chemistry is purchasing two FTIR spectrophotometers for use in
General Organic, and Analytical Chemistry laboratory courses and in a new
Environmental Chemistry program undergoing development. The General Chemistry
course is being revised to emphasize real-world connections, to introduce
synthetic and analytic aspects of chemistry and to instill a respect for
environmental concerns. In the Organic and Analytical Chemistry courses, modern
methods of structural characterization are being introduceed that familiarize
students with instrumentation commonly used in industrial and research
laboratories. These instruments are also being used by students engaged in
undergraduate research.
