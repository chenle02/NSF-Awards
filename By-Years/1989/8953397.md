A unique partnership, the New York Science, Technology, and Society Project,
will develop 12 modules for teaching science in grades 7-9, field test them, and
then use a group of forty Resource Agents to disseminate them to teachers
statewide. The partnership is composed of the Atmospheric Sciences Research
Center at State University of New York-Albany, the New York State Education
Department, and the New York Power Pool, a consortium of power companies. This
partnership has already developed award winning elementary-level energy
education units; the middle school units will expand this base to a variety of
areas in life, physical, and earth sciences, with a strong emphasis on
science/technology/society issues. These middle school modules will be
incorporated into the state middle school science syllabus and the Regents
Competency Test in Science. Special attention will be paid to making the modules
appropriate for female and minority students who have traditionally found
science moved away from science during these middle school years. Cost sharing
by the partners will total 210% of the NSF funding.
