South Carolina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with structural health
monitoring with active sensors. The particular type of sensors considered is the
piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
study addresses fundamental aspects of the Lamb-wave interaction between the
PWAS transducers and the host structure. The objective is to develop a
predictive methodologies for optimum design of such sensors. Three main issues
are included: 1. Micromechanical coupling for various Lamb modes, 2. Lamb-wave
tuning with broadband PWAS transducers, and 3. in-situ immittance pf PWAS
transducers and optimal power flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well-balanced
educational enhancement component is embedded in this research
project.&lt;br/&gt;
