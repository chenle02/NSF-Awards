9616773 Sadler This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research proposal for a
pilot study of the relationship between high school courses in physics and
success in college level physics courses. Preliminary work was `egun on a study
of that subject in a few area colleges. However, the investigator proposes to
study the relationships that might be made from existing study sources such as
the NELS:88 survey of 8th grade students in 1988 who have been followed up until
they reached college in 1993. The investigator also suggests that he will
analyze data from the new study of international comparisons which has a sample
of high school physics courses.
