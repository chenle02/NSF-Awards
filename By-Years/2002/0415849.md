&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Nesbitt of the University of Colorado-
Boulder will conduct a research program in molecular spectroscopy consisting of
four parts. 1) Radicals and ions will be investigated by high-resolution
molecular spectroscopy; 2) the technique of slit-jet supersonic high-resolution
spectroscopy will be further developed to enable kinetic studies; 3) state-to-
state reaction dynamics in prototypical 4-atom systems will be investigated with
both crossed jet and slit jet expansion techniques; and 4) the folding dynamics
of small self-folding RNA sequences will be investigated to determine how this
process depends on the conditions and properties of the molecule. Specifically,
in the first task the initial focus will be on the ethyl, isopropyl, and
cyclopropyl radicals as well as on some longer carbon chain molecules found in
the interstellar medium. The initial work on ions will concentrate on the H/D
isotopically-substituted hydronium ion, as well as the protonated methane
molecule. The second set of studies deals with reactions of hydrocarbon radicals
with oxygen to form oxygenated alkyl radicals, while the third set will focus on
the reactions of atoms with vibrationally excited water molecules. This research
will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students, including women,
underrepresented minorities and Native Americans. These students will acquire
knowledge and skills in preparation for advanced studies or entrance into the
scientific/technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
