This project is to host a workshop focused on identifying frontiers for
collaborative research integrating mathematical and computational modeling of
human cognition with machine learning and machine intelligence. The workshop
will bring together leading researchers who are working at the intersection of
the fields. The goal is to initiate dialogue between people working within
different computational frameworks, to identify points of synthesis where new
scientific insights or breakthroughs are most likely, and to identify gaps and
obstacles to collaboration between the two communities. A summary report will be
produced that details the products of the discussion, highlighting prospects
identified for future collaborative research.
