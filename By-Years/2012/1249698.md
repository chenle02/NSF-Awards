Abstract for Proposal number: 1249698&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop
with title: ?Exploring Frontiers in Plant Systems Biology?, to be held in
Raleigh, North Carolina, on the campus of North Carolina State University (NCSU)
at the University Club, in the Fall of 2012. The workshop will bring together US
and international researchers with interests in plant systems biology to
discuss, highlight limitations, and focus on critical questions associated with
feasibility and necessary technological and experimental advances for large-
scale design of plant systems. The main purpose for the workshop is to: 1)
Explore and identify areas of complementary interests, needs, and opportunities
associated with the growing discipline of Plant Systems Biology, 2) Identify the
primary research grand challenges and explore potential limits of the field from
both the biological, computational, and engineering perspectives and, 3)
Formulate funding strategies for future collaborations. A workshop report will
be written and all data and related information generated from the workshop will
be made available to the research community through an NCSU hosted website that
will be created specifically for the workshop. The amount of support for this
proposal is: $48,516.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garie A. Fordyce,
