9414871 Robertson Research laboratories within the South Wing of the seventy
-year old Life Sciences building at the University of Idaho will be renovated
with the support of NSF funds. The renovation will develop four modern
labmratories to meet the modern needs of scientists in the Departments of
Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (MMBB) and Biological Sciences.
The project will address major existing problems with temperature control, dust
and mold contamination, ventilation system noise, antiquated laboratory
furnishings, major deficiencies in electrical and plumbing services, negative
air pressure, and inefficient design of laboratory space. The laboratories,
constructed in 1924, have not been renovated for 26 years and several contain
the original laboratory furnishings. Molecular techniques will be emphasized in
the laboratory for plant systematics and also for vertebrate biology -- both
within the department of biological sciences. A third laboratory in Biological
Sciences is dedicated to cell physiology. The structural characterization of
proteins will be studied in the renovated Microbiology, Molecular Biology and
Biochemistry space.The University of Idaho programs have grown considerably over
the last decade. MMBB has twelve faculty; ten of whom faculty have been hired
since 1986. Productivity in the department has increased significantly and led
to development of a new undergraduate major in Molecular Biology and
Biochemistry. Fifty graduate students are enrolled in departmental programs and
nineteen undergraduates worked on research projects during the 1994 academic
year. A similar impact will be felt in Biological Sciences which has nineteen
faculty, 27 graduate students and five postdoctorals. Twenty undergraduates were
involved in research studies during 1994. The programs emphasize recruitment and
retention of students representing both genders, all ethnic groups, and the
physically challenged.
