Ideas from algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry have contributed to recent
advances in symbolic algebra, computational number theory, and in the effective
geometry of real semi-algebraic sets. In motion-planning and modeling, the
reintroduction of classical methods of elimination theory -- including
multivariate resultants, u-resultants and Chow forms -- have contributed to the
discovery of efficient, and efficiently parallelizable, algorithms. In number
theory, rational points on abelian varieties defined over finite fieldshave
provided a rich new source of groups with arithmetic properties that can be
exploited in the design of new algorithms. Functions on algebraic curves
provided a new source of error-correcting codes with highly desirable features.
This research addresses certain algebraic problems for which the methods of
algebraic geometry have contributed significantly in recent years. More
specifically, the object is to study certain computational problems involving
algebraic curves -- with applications in number theory, cryptography and coding
theory. The project will address those methods which have been used to design
efficient parallel and sequential algorithms for these problems, and will
consider their broader applications in symbolic and algebraic computation.
