This research proposes to use gene sequences from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to
reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the species of the birds-of-
paradise (family Paradisaeidae). The results of this research will be compared
with morphological data collected in previous studies in order to describe and
explain differences and similarities in their rates of change. The phylogenetic
hypotheses will also allow inferences regarding the history of ecological and
behavioral change during the diversification of these birds and thus will
contribute to our understanding of how patterns of diversity within continental
biotas are established over time.
