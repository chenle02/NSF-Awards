9322129 Rieke The 2 micron spectral region contains a variety of indicators
about the atmosphere of Jupiter including absorption features due to hydrogen
and methane, auroral emissions, and reflected light from aerosols. Dr. Rieke
will monitor changes in all of these indicators and search for additional
features due to chemical species created by the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy
(9) on Jupiter.
