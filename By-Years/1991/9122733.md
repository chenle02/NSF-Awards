This research involves an in-depth investigation of the American public's
perceptions of an feelings toward Congress. Popular accounts frequently stress
the public's unhappiness with Congress, but the sources of this unhappines and
variations across the population in levels of unhappiness are seldom analyzed
with care. Given the importance of public attitudes toward political
institutions like Congress, and given the potential for unhappiness to be
translated into reforms with serious implications, such as term limitations, it
is essential that a deeper systematic appreciation of of public sentiments is
obtained. In this research investigation, the researchers employ both a national
telephone survey and intensive focus group interviews to probe systematically
the nature of the American public's beliefs about Congress; beliefs such as what
the institution should be doing, what it is doing, and whether reforms are
needed to bring expectations and reality into line. As such, this research
provides a unique social science data base on perceptions of Congress and its
members. Analysis of these data helps to lay the foundation for a theory of
public attitudes toward, not just Congress, but political institutions
generally.
