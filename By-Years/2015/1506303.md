The goal of this project is to test fundamental symmetries in the
electromagnetic and strong interactions. By doing precise measurements of the
properties of low-mass neutral mesons at Jefferson Lab, this research aims at
understanding Nature by providing clues to some fundamental questions, such as:
(1) Why are quarks confined inside of hadrons?; (2) What are the masses of the
light quarks?; (3) Why is the observed universe dominant by matter over anti-
matter?; and (4) What is dark matter? This project will also offer great
opportunities to engage undergraduate students in cutting edge research. It will
create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to
recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses that are research-
related.

The PI will play a leadership role as a spokesperson for the experiments: (1)
completing data analysis of a precision measurement of the neutral pion
lifetime; (2) optimizing and preparing an approved experiment to measure the
radiative decay width of the eta meson; (3) commissioning and operating a new
pair spectrometer in Hall D and taking data on eta-meson decay in parallel with
the GlueX experiment; and (4) leading the development of the Jefferson Lab "Eta
Factory" program. Measurements of various rare and forbidden decays of the eta
mesons will provide sensitive probes for possible existence of new forces, which
will extend our knowledge to the dark matter and explore new sources of CP
violation needed to explain the matter and anti-matter asymmetry in the
universe. The discovery of such new forces beyond Standard Model would have far-
ranging implications to advance our understanding of nature.
