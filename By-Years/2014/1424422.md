Tax rebellions do not occur in a social vacuum. Taxation offers a blueprint, in
symbolic and concrete terms, for uncovering the fundamental structures of
social, economic, and political life. This research will further understandings
of how the legacies of past social hierarchies contribute to contemporary tax
debates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing ethnographic content analysis of
archival data collected from historical societies and libraries, this project
examines three case studies of rebellions against property taxes. Particular
attention is placed on the relationship between changing social structures and
property tax revolts in the United States. Primary data will be collected from a
wide variety of documentary and media sources and analyzed with qualitative
analytic computer software to test the central tenets of relevant theories.
