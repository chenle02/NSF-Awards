Formation of araB-lacZ hybrid coding sequences normally utilizes the DNA
rearrangement activities of transposable bacteriophage Mu. Fusion events are
physiologically specific: they do not occur during normal growth but are found
at high rates following starvation. This system is a prime example of inducible
genetic changes now called "directed mutation." We have developed a detailed
molecular explanation of the complex series of biochemical events that produce
ara-lac fusions. The cAMP-CRP catabolite sensory system and the CLP heat-shock
protease play essential roles in Mu activation during starvation. PCR technology
has been validated for the detection of rare fusion events, and there is
evidence for no-fusion rearrangements after stress. Thus, the ara- lac fusion
system is one of the best-characterized physiologically regulated mutational
systems. Genetic studies and molecular experiments are outlined here to define
the roles of the cAMP-CRP and CLP systems in Mu activation, to identify
alternative biochemical pathways to fusion formation, and to clarify the nature
of Mu-dependent DNA rearrangements following stress. %%% The results of this
research will provide definitive answers to several issues in the directed
mutation controversy and identify components of the signal transduction network
connecting cellular physiology and DNA biochemistry.
