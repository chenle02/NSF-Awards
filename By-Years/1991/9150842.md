Peer student assisted instruction and mentoring will be developed. This
technique has proved successful in college mathematics courses at this and other
institutions. Mentoring will take place in a bridge class between high school
and college chemistry, and in the general chemistry course for science and
engineering majors. The goals of this program are to increase the number of
freshmen completing chemistry courses, and choosing and completing a major in
chemistry, and to introduce chemical problem solving to inner city high school
students. The latter will include the use of estimates to solve chemistry
problems, and the application of highly interactive mathematics software to
chemistry laboratory and lecture instruction.
