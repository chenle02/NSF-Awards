This research is on the design of test pattern generators for combinational
circuits. Various schemes for LSFR/SR pseudorandom test pattern generators are
being examined. The focus is on finding high quality ATPG algorithms that
require minimal hardware overhead. Several families of not-necessarily
primitive, characteristic polynomials are being investigated with the objective
of guaranteeing that test patterns will be applied randomly to all outputs. In
addition, various partial scan schemes that follow the structural approach are
being studied.
