CTS-0106064&lt;br/&gt;John Lumley, Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PI proposes to adapt the divergence-free wavelet-based dynamical model for the
simulation of a turbulent channel flow. The main goals are (1) to investigate
how effective wavelets are in describing the coherent structure in the near wall
region of turbulent channel flow, (2) to use wavelet bases to construct a low-
dimensional dynamical-system representation for the near-wall region, and (3) to
compare the wavelet and POD-Fourier representations of the coherent structure.
