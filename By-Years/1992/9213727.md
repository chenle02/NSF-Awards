The broad purpose of this work is to understand basic principles and laboratory
robot implementations of sensory-motor control and integration. Such principles
could make it possible to build robots that are more agile and dextrous than
existing robots, and they could provide some insight into human and animal
behavior. The project will use as a conceptual and experimental testbed, the
locomotion of dynamic biped robots that balance themselves actively as they
move. Within this context, the project will explore actively balanced walking
and running, the generation of ballistic maneuvers like those used in
gymnastics, task level control, and the mechanical design of legs for good
dynamic performance. The work will involve the analysis of models of legged
systems, development of control systems and mechanical designs, and experiments
on simulations and laboratory robots.
