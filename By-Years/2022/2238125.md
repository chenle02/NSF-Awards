Biological systems are more than the sum of their parts. Modern high throughput
technologies enable scientists to study biological systems holistically by
measuring thousands to millions of molecular measurements in a single sample.
This new scientific paradigm has accelerated our understanding of complex
biological processes such as embryonic development and cancer. However,
sophisticated analytical frameworks are needed to turn large datasets into
concrete biological insights. This project aims to build general and flexible
algorithms that can reduce large collections of data into smaller biologically
meaningful representations. These representations are concise enough to be
easily manipulated by non-experts yet rich enough to support both the originally
intended analysis and future data reuse. The project will also develop teaching
materials and hand-on activities to educate the next generation of biological
data scientists across diverse education levels and technical
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a highly
customizable Bayesian framework that combines many approaches to interpretable
dimensionality reduction into a single unifying framework by using flexible
mixture distribution priors. Additionally, drawing on rich sources of biological
prior knowledge the proposed method will be capable of both quantifying and
identifying by name specific biological processes embedded in high dimensional
data. In a separate but synergistic goal the project will adapt state-of-the-art
segmentation algorithms to automatically extract genomic features from multi-
sample, base-resolution DNA methylation datasets accelerating downstream
analysis and interpretation. The results of this work can be found at
