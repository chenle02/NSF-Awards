Sonoluminescence occurs when a bubble of air in a fluid bath, periodically
driven by a sound wave, emits light. The major theoretical challenge in
understanding sonoluminescence experiments is to determine how much of the
phenomenon is hydrodynamic, how much is atomic, and how much is chemical. This
proposal is for joint collaborative work between the PI's group and physicists
from the University of Marburg to uncover the hydrodynamic parameters underlying
sonluminescence, both with respect of bubble dynamics and the hydrodynamic
mechanism for the energy focusing.
