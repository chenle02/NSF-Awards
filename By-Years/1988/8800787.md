The Principal Investigator will continue his work on complex powers, both local
and global, and, in addition, continue his work on the so-called Igusa local
zeta functions and zeta distributions. He will concentrate on the prehomogeneous
case, which is interesting in itself and from which one can formulate sharp
conjectures. The theory of theta functions will also be looked at. The author
studies special kinds of zeta functions which have importance in the arithmetic
theory of algebraic geometry. Determining the polynomials associated to the
local factors will receive special attention. Also discussed will be the
convergence, analytic continuation and distribution of the poles of these
functions.
