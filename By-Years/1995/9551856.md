The Biology Department is obtaining equipment to establish a Cell Culture
Laboratory for advanced, undergraduate biology courses in Cell Biology,
Immunology and Hematology, and Investigations courses (1) to enable current work
to be done much more as investigatory research and (2) to enable additional
types of cell culture work to be undertaken. These courses emphasize an
investigative, hands-on pedagogical strategy in which students are introduced to
basic cell culture techniques, then required to design and conduct subsequent
experiments, analyze data, and communicate their results. In Cell Biology,
students are able to propagate their cell lines for investigations into cellular
responses to varied stimuli producing dynamic changes and adaptations in (1)
cell morphology, (2) growth, (3) plating and transfection efficiencies, and (4)
comparisons of serum protein synthesis by primary hepatocyte cultures with
hepatoma lines. In Immunology and Hematology, students are able to address
questions of immune cell (1) activation, (2) surface receptor activation and
signal transduction, and (3) cellular cooperation. A 1200-1400-ft2 Cell Culture
Laboratory is being equipped with four Class II biological safety cabinets, six
CO2 incubators, inverted phase microscopes, centrifuges, and related equipment
to provide a dedicated laboratory for 16-student-capacity laboratories. This
laboratory provides opportunities for approximately 50 upper-level biology
students per year to develop detailed investigations into human and animal cell
biology by greatly expanding the range of techniques currently possible.
