Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is uniquely important to almost
every modern scientific discipline. It provides definitive structural data for
simple molecules as well as complex biologically important systems. Unlike other
spectroscopies, however, NMR suffers from conspicuously low sensitivity--partly
because of the low energy of the (radiofrequency) photons involved, but more
importantly from the small polarizations of nuclear spin systems. The Boltzmann
factor appropriate to typical magnetic moments in a laboratory Zeeman field at
room temperature leads to a fractional excess population in the absorbing state
on the order of 0.0001 to 0.00001. The history of NMR is replete with technical
advances which attack this problem by increasing the applied magnetic field, but
the current state of the physics and engineering underlying magnet design offer
little hope for any further large improvements in the near future. It is the
goal of the research in Professor Waugh's laboratory to obtain significant
improvements (10,000 to 100,000) in signal by lowering the temperature. The
gains to be made are potentially remarkable: at high temperatures the
polarization and hence the voltage sensitivity grow directly as 1/T, suggesting
potentially unlimited gains through arbitrarily close approaches to T=O. This is
a high risk research program as it is technically very difficult to operate NMR
equipment in the millikelvin range. However, the payoff to all NMR justifies the
effort.
