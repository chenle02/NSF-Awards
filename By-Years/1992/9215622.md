The results obtained in this project will provide needed quantitative criteria
for the rational design of pressure tunnels and shed light into the fundamental
hydromechanic interactions occurring during hydrojacking of jointed rock masses.
The results will also aid in estimation of magnitudes of inflow into underground
openings from observed geologic data early in the project. The flow regime due
to dewatering and recharge of the jointed rock mass will modeled to assess the
effect of the hydromechanical properties of the joints and the attitude and
spacing of the joints on the computed magnitudes of infiltration rates into the
tunnel or rates of exfiltrations into the masses. The coupled hydromechanical
rockliner interaction will be studied to assess the effect of topography,
hydromechanical joint properties and level of reinforcement in the liner, on the
head loss across the liner, magnitude of exfiltrations from the tunnel and
initiation of hydrojacking in the mass.
