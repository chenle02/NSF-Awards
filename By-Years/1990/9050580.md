A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer/data system (GC/MS) has been acquired for
use in the undergraduate chemistry laboratories at Whitman College. In the
introductory organic chemistry laboratory, it is being used to separate and
identify organic compounds in complex mixtures such as gasoline. In the advanced
organic chemistry laboratory, several ultra-microscale experiments using GC/MS
detection and analysis of the products have been introduced. In Instrumental
Analysis, the instrument is used to demonstrate the principles and limitations
of GC/MS, and detect and identify trace organic pollutants in water samples. In
the Biochemistry laboratory, students detect and identify therapeutic drugs and
drugs of abuse in body fluids and determine the damage that carcinogens and
chemotherapeutic dugs inflict on DNA. In the newly established Forensic
Laboratory, GC/MS is being used to detect and identify illegal drugs, gunshot
residue, arson evidence, and explosives. The project staff plan to publish the
results of the above experiments. The institution has contributed to the project
in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
