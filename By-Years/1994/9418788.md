9418788 Chisholm-Brause The proposed study is designed to examine the effects of
iron substituted into oxides and clays on metal-ion sorption. The goal is to
elucidate the effects of structural iron over a broad range of solution
conditions. By varying the solution conditions for metal-ion uptake, this
research will examine the effect of iron substitution in minerals for various
sorption processes, such as adsorption to distinct amphoteric surface sites,
exchange at the basal planes of clay particles, and formation of multinuclear
sorption complexes. the proposed research will employ a combination of wet-
chemical experiments, designed to examine macroscopic sorption behavior, and
spectroscopic methods which are molecular level probes of the sorption complex.
This research will focus on use of synchrotron-based x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS).
