&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information science makes the
promise for superfast computation, simulation, and secure communication based on
fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. A critical problem in this field is
how to implement these novel computation and communication models with real
physical systems. The challenge for implementation of quantum computation and
communication is due to the inevitable decoherence (noise) effect inherent in
any real physical systems. In this project, we will develop a multi-facet
theoretical program to attack this main challenge. We will investigate a variety
of physical systems, ranging from nano-scale quantum dots, to micrometer-scale
cavity QED and trapped ion systems, and to macroscopic atomic ensembles. We look
for realistic quantum computation and communication schemes which show inherent
robustness to practical noise in the corresponding systems. We will develop
methods to significantly advance coherent control techniques and implementation
of quantum information in the above physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;
