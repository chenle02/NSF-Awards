This proposal is awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

The focus of the proposed research is to design, analyze, and implement accurate
and efficient numerical methods for flow problems. As is well known,
incompressibility and convection-dominance in flow problems pose significant
challenges to numerical simulators. In this research project, the PI and his
collaborators will develop numerical schemes based on the locally divergence-
free (LDF) finite elements and characteristic tracking to overcome the
aforementioned two major difficulties. The LDF finite elements have strong
potentials for both h-adaptivity (due to the independence of the basis functions
to element geometry) and p-adaptivity (due to the hierarchical structure of the
basis functions). Discrete Helmholtz decomposition and hybridization will be
utilized to decouple resulted discrete linear systems and reduce computational
costs. Higher order characteristic methods are developed for long-term
simulations with increased accuracy. These new techniques will be incorporated
in the discontinuous Galerkin framework to develop fast and robust solvers for
Stokes, Navier-Stokes, convection-diffusion-reaction, and magnetohydrodynamics
equations.

The success of the proposed research will have direct impact on the efficiency
and robustness of a large class of numerical simulators for real world problems
such as groundwater contamination remediation, intracellular protein
trafficking, nuclear waste disposal, oil recovery, weather forecast, and
wildfire control. The new mathematical methods and software modules developed in
this project will provide reliable tools for a wide range of scientific
computing tasks. This project will also provide hands-on training opportunities
for graduate students to gain a wide knowledge base and sophisticated skills to
apply mathematics and computer simulations to a variety of applications in
sciences and engineering.
