This CAREER project investigates how humans and computers can work together to
answer questions. Humans and computers possess complementary skills: humans have
extensive commonsense understanding of the world and greater facility with
unconventional language, while computers can effortlessly memorize countless
facts and retrieve them in an instant. This proposal helps machines understand
who people, places, and characters are; how to communicate this information to
humans; and how to allow humans and computers to collaborate in question
answering using limited information. A key component of this proposal is
answering questions word-by-word: this forces both humans and computers to
answer questions using information as efficiently as possible. In addition to
embedding these skills in question answering tasks, this proposal has an
extensive outreach program to exhibit this technology in interactive question
answering competitions for high school and college students.

This research is possible by a new representations of entities in a medium-
dimensional embedding that encodes relationships between entities (e.g., the
representation of "Goodluck Jonathan" and "Nigeria" encodes that the former is
the leader of the latter) to enable the system to answer questions about
Nigeria. We validate the effectiveness of these representations both through
traditional question answering evaluations and through interactive experiments
with human collaboration to ensure that we can visualize these representations
effectively. In addition to helping train computers to answer questions, we use
opponent modeling and reinforcement learning to help train humans to better
answer questions.
