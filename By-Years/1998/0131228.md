This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
digital video surveillance system prototype. Over the past few years, video
surveillance systems have been moving from analog to digital. The success of a
digital video surveillance system depends on three key enabling technologies:
compression, search and retrieval and network transmission. Existing commercial
systems generally use standard video compression techniques, which often result
in higher memory and bandwidth requirements and jerky object motion. In current
video search and retrieval, the existing systems offer only search-by-time and
no search-by-content. In network transmission, today's systems use relatively
simple techniques that tend to make remote monitoring slow and sluggish. The
company is using a highly efficient compression algorithm that exploits the
special characteristics of surveillance video and is based on a segmentation
technique. This technique, when applied to video search and retrieval, leads to
search-by-content, which is more efficient and effective in practical
applications. Finally the proposed system will employ fast network transport
protocols and scalability techniques to make remote monitoring faster,
uninterrupted by network traffic surges, and to allow display on a range of user
devices.

This digital video surveillance system can be used to maintain the security of
banks, airports, government buildings, corporate sites, homes, and small
businesses. It can also be used to monitor the performance and operating
conditions of machines and equipment.
