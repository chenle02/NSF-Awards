The PIs will carry out an experimental determination of flow laws for
dislocation and diffusion creep of mono- and polyphase aggregates of quartz of
and feldspar which can be reliably extrapolated to crustal conditions. A key
element of this study will be use of the molten salt sample assembly developed
recently by Green and Borch (1989), which provides the stress sensitivity of a
gas apparatus with the capability for high pressure experiments required to
induce dislocation creep in quartz and feldspar. They will check this assembly
by doing duplicate experiments, on diffusion creep in feldspars, in a gas
apparatus. Additional key features of the study are (1) a determination of the
fH2O (H+) dependence of dislocation climb and creep in quartz aggregates, which
should allow one to take account of the previously observed pressure dependence
of hydrolytic weakening in extrapolating flow laws to nature, and (2)
delineation of the conditions where different regimes of dislocation creep in
quartz are dominant and the experimental materials and conditions necessary to
ensure mechanical steady state in each.
