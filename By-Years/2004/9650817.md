This project involves acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
(GC/MS) for use in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology courses, courses
that relate to the interdisciplinary environmental programs at the institution.
This instrument can be operated by students in an introductory or advanced
environmental chemistry or hydrogeology course with a minimum of supervision,
and its incorporation into laboratory coursework is being accompanied by changes
in many pedagogical aspects of the courses. The interdisciplinary nature of the
environmental programs that are in place makes the equipment accessible to
undergraduate students in all environmental science fields including chemistry,
geology, engineering, and biological sciences.
