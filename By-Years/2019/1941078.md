Time perception is a critical feature of behavior, affecting all levels of
perception, action, and cognition. However, timing in the perceptual and
cognitive sciences has historically been understudied. Understanding how this
important facet of everyday life is accomplished requires a multidisciplinary
approach across multiple domains. The Timing Research Forum conferences are
designed to fill this need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support
for US graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to travel to and attend the
2019 Timing Research Forum, October 15-18, 2019. One unique feature of the forum
will be a 'Timing Moonshot' discussion, in which field leaders and conference
participants will define the major problems and research agendas for the next
five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
