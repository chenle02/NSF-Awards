9405123 Lanier The involvement of undergraduate students in faculty research can
play a critical role in enhancing the preparedness of these students to pursue
advanced degrees in the sciences as well as preparation for careers in science
education. This proposal requests funding to support undergraduate research
concerning the sedimentology of the fluvial to mid-estuarine transitions of
Pennsylvanian incised valley-fill deposits from the Douglas Group (Missourian-
Virgilian) of eastern Kansas. The research project involves the acquisition of
drill cores to study the sedimentological details of these paleoestuarine facies
transitions. Given the fine-grained, silty-through-muddy lithologies which
characterize these facies, they form few good surface exposures. However, the
existing outcrops have been analyzed in great detail in terms of their
sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleontology, which will allow for a similarly
detailed projection of this information into the subsurface. Although regional
in its focus, these studies have broad implications with regard to the
sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy of incised valley-fill successions. The
research is ideally suited for undergraduates insofar as it well-defined in its
goals, scientifically significant in its application, and confined in its scope.
