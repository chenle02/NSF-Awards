The Charles A. Dana Center of the University of Texas at Austin, will use a one-
year planning grant to assess the design of standards-based mathematics and
science resources for early childhood educators. The project will produce a
prototype curriculum unit, based on "The Wonder of Water," which was developed
as part of the Texas SSI Family Learning Project. The curriculum will be tested,
revised and re-tested in six early childhood education settings. The results
will be used to produce a plan to field test, research and disseminate the
curriculum regionally and nationally, resulting in a strong resource for early
childhood educators that will enable preschool children to develop an
understanding and appreciation for math and science. By using this product in
settings such as Head Start, a better sense of continuity will be established
between preschool and elementary science and mathematics content.&lt;br/&gt;
