This project designs, analyzes, and implements a k-Cover-Sense-Inform (k-CSI)
framework for heterogeneous and mission-oriented mobile wireless sensor
networks, where connected k-coverage, scheduling, and data forwarding are
jointly considered. It (a) builds a theoretical foundation to achieve connected
k-coverage of a given a region of interest while minimizing the total number of
heterogeneous sensors, (b) designs secure data routing and dissemination
protocols on top of secure scheduling protocols for connected k-coverage while
minimizing the energy consumption due to sensor mobility and their
collaboration, and (c) develops a prototype for k-CSI and assesses its
performance through simulations using network simulator TOSSIM, and
implementation using mobility-enabled MICAz motes based test-beds while
considering various mobility models and a variety of network configuration and
missions. These research efforts are integrated with development of courses on
mission-oriented mobile wireless sensor networks. The project helps recruit
graduate and undergraduate students, especially economically disadvantaged
students, including minorities, and expand the perspectives of K-12 teachers and
high-school students by illustrating aspects of scholarship and methodology
through High School University Seminar Series offered to local school districts
in Long-Island, New York. Results are disseminated through publications in
conferences and journals.
