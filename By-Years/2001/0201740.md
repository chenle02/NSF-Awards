The PI proposes to design, build and test a prototype liquid xenon time
projection chamber (TPC) to observe collisions between weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) and xenon atoms. By the end of the two-year program,
the key technical issues associated with the TPC module of a larger scale will
have been identified and resolved. This new design will be based on a liquid-
xenon TPC that she developed for studying astrophysics gamma ray sources.
