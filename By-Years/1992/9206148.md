In a telecommunication system, the denial of service requests according to
customer type or systems state, even when excess capacity exists, can improve
system performance. Finding good call admission policies is therefore an
important part of system design. The principal investigators (PIs) propose a
probabilistic algorithm to search for call admission policies in
telecommunications systems. Such a procedure decouples policy evaluation from
policy search and in this way allows consideration of problems which seem
intractable using analytic methods. The policies found are expected to yield
insight which will allow useful analytic approximations to be employed. As a
case in point, the PIs considered the M/M/c/c queue with two customer classes.
The search procedure was able to find nearly optimal solutions whose structure
strongly suggested the known optimal policy structure. It is proposed that this
study be extended first to other simple systems which appear frequently at
communications systems models and then to specific problems in the fields of
mobile communications an high speed networks.
