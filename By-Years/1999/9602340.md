Founded in 1837, Davidson College is a private, highly selective undergraduate
liberal arts college in North Carolina. The College has a history of excellence
in preparing students for careers in science, and is included in the -Oberlin
Group+ as one of the 50 liberal arts colleges that contributes significantly to
the training of U.S. scientists. An average of 56 percent of the graduates in
the sciences and mathematics enroll in graduate or professional schools. The
Chemistry program continues to offer an excellent training environment for
students interested in pursuing chemical research. However, the major weakness
in the program is the lack of adequate, safe and functional research and
research training space in the Martin Science Building that houses the
Department. Although structurally sound, laboratories in the 1948 building are
inadequate for current research needs and do not comply with ADA standards. The
National Science Foundation and Davidson College will form a partnership in
renovating research laboratories located on the second floor of the Martin
Building. Work will include renovation, repair, or replacement of laboratory
casework, fume hoods, and fixed equipment. New finishes, lighting, mechanical,
electrical, and plumbing systems are included for the following labs: Organic
chemistry research, Physical and Analytical research, three faculty research
labs, shared instrument rooms and a prep room. Primarily, this project will
locate related disciplines together with shared support spaces, allowing greater
interaction that will foster a convergence of goals for all fields of chemistry.
An exciting and safe research environment will be created, which will encourage
student and faculty collaborative studies, increase the number of student
scholars, and add to the future scientific infrastructure of the Nation.
