This grant provides funding for the electrochemical co-deposition processing of
a conductive nanocomposite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and copper (Cu) which
promises to have ultrahigh electrical and thermal conductivity. The primary goal
of the work is to understand the fabrication process of the Cu and CNT-based
composite and to optimize the fabrication parameters in terms of raw material
selection and deposition control parameters. The process study will address the
selection of the type of CNT, the treatment of the CNTs and the distribution of
CNTs within copper matrix. Characterization will include measuring the
electrical and thermal conductivities, nano/microstructure observation with
electron microscopy and mechanical strength testing. The fundamental mechanism
for the enhanced conduction in the material system will be studied as a function
of the process parameters and resulting
nano/microstructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the new copper-based
material system would significantly impact energy usage in electric motors,
power generators and heat exchangers through its improved conductivity. In
general terms, the results of this research will lead to improvement in the
design and fabrication process of metallic composites by utilizing carbon
nanotubes to achieve desired material properties. The results will provide ways
to minimize the production times and thus reduce the cost to produce
metal/carbon nanotube composites. The proposed work will also contribute to
student training through curriculum renovation and participation in the
research. The investigator also participates in an annual Nano-Camp which
teaches high school students about nanotechnology.
