The winter of 2001-02 in southern California was the driest year since
instrumental records began in 1850. Southern California mountain conifer forests
exhibit symptoms of severe drought stress, including elevated tree mortality,
active insect predation, premature leaf shed, absence of leader growth in early
summer, and anomalous leaf-shed in both evergreen and winter
deciduous&lt;br/&gt;broadleaf species. Drought is also coupled with wildland
fire, which is integrated in the structure, species composition and distribution
of southern California conifer forests. It follows that the rate of drought-
induced tree mortality/dieback must be evaluated in relation to long-term fire
regimes and vegetation dynamics. Because the region is now experiencing rare
conditions of the climate, it is vital to document the state of the forests with
an aerial photographic survey in September, 2002, using as a case study the San
Bernardino Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains where water deficits are
greatest. This research will use stereoscopic aerial photography at a scale of
1:24,000 to assess tree mortality patterns and compare them to 1983 photos in
hand. The photo resolution of &lt;1.0 m will permit the analysis of trees as
small as saplings, 3.0 m tall. The objective of this study is to document and
quantify the spatial pattern of the current forest dieback/mortality episode in
SBM and SJM to test the following hypotheses: (1) drought-induced fire mortality
reflects fire regime and life history traits of ecosystems, and (2) drought
mortality reflects the post-fire successional status of stands in the patch
mosaic, including changes arising from fire suppression. The study is relevant
to other research including air pollution effects on forests, fire suppression
and forest densification, and short-term fire risk to suburban mountain
communities. &lt;br/&gt;
