Synthesis of silicon oxycarbide gels and glasses is achieved through the
hydrolysis/condensation of alkyl-substituted alkoxysilanes. It forms a gel whose
subsequent heat-treatment in an inert atmosphere creates an x-ray amorphous
glass that contains both Si-O and Si-C bonds. The glass is often black due to
the additional presence of a highly dispersed form of polyaromatic, pyrolytic,
and/or amorphous carbon. A primary objective of this project is to characterize,
in detail, the ternary Si-O-C system, and especially to determine the molecular
structure of the excess carbon, its relationship to the oxycarbide network, and
its effect on the thermochemical stability of the glass. NMR, Raman
spectroscopy, and TEM will be used to characterize the glasses. %%%% Oxycarbide
glasses exhibit enhanced properties. Characterization of the glass structure is
essential for future exploitation of these unique glasses. This program is
expected to yield valuable information and possibly to provide a basis for
developing new reinforced composite materials, by sol-gel methods.
