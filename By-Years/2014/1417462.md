This award supports the dissertation research of an Alaska Native PhD student.
Using anthropological methods of ethnographic interviews, open-ended surveys,
and archival research, the project will examine the intersection between the
formal legal definitions of hunting and fishing rights among the Aleuts of
Alaska and local traditional knowledge of these rights. This research will
contribute to a discussion of the relationship between knowledge and power in
the context of resource management and control in Alaska.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are its contributions
to the training of the CoPI, a Phd Candidate and an Alaska Native woman, thus
increasing the representation of this highly underrepresented group in the
social sciences.
