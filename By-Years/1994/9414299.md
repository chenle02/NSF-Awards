This experiment is designed to provide direct observational constraints on the
distribution of melt and the pattern of upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge.
Studies of electromagnetic and seismic wave propaation in the mentle with arrays
of ocean- bottom instruments will furnish measurements that can be inverted to
find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity and conductivity structure
that can be used to test theoretical models of flow. An array of 47 ocean-bottom
seismometers will be deployed for six months on the East Pacific Rise at about
17 degrees south to record teleseismic and regional earthquake sources. P and S
waves, as well as other bady wave phases and Love and Rayleigh surface waves
recorded by the array will be used to probe lateral variations in mantle
structure to a depth of 100 to 200 km and out to several hundred km from the
ridge axis. The mail goal is to establish whether there is a narrow region of
high melt concentration and low seismic velocities directly beneath the ridge
axis and to map its vertical and horizontal extent. Another goal is to constrain
the pattern of upwelling.
