Donnellan&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0208179&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop of the APEC
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation(ACES)
group in is being held in May 2002. The purpose of the workshop is to review
recent progress in several key areas of science and technology related to
earthquake simulations and to formulate goint plans for future progress. Issues
being addressed by conferees include data storage, retrieval, assimilation,
visualization, and manipulation, integrated with capabilities to instantiate
knowledge acquisition and reasoning via models and simulations of nonlinear
multi-scale dynamical earthquake processes. A peer-reviewed proceedings volume
and a peer-reviewed special issue of a journal are being published.
