9627112 Hamilton The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop "Buildings: A
Traveling Exhibit and Permanent Installation with Education and Outreach
Programs". This is a multifaceted project that includes a 5,000 sq. ft. exhibit
that will explore the science, technology, and human perception of buildings.
The exhibit will tell three stories: 1) buildings must obey physical laws to
stay up, 2) buildings are complex operating systems, and 3) buildings reflect
and shape the societies that create them. The exhibit will initially be
developed as a traveling exhibit that will circulate among the member
institutions of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (8 institutions) and
then it will be reinstalled in the new SMM $77 million building. Additional
partners collaborating on this project include the National Building Museum, the
Society of Building Science Educators, Habitat for Humanity International, The
ReUse Center, the Vital Signs Program and the Center for City Building
Education. Special attention will be given to reaching girls and women and the
physically challenged. A broad menu of public programming is planned and school-
linked materials will be developed.
