The goal of the project proposed here is to investigate heterojunction materials
at liquid helium temperatures in a magnetic field. These materials have been
shown to detect millimeter waves in the 100-300 GHz range. Very high electron
mobility samples (>500,00 cm2/Vs) are particular interest. Two such samples have
been received from IBM, and other samples are expected through cooperation with
scientists in the United Kingdom. The project will explore how to maximize the
responsivity of detectors using these materials, as well as attempt to show
mixing in such devices for the first time.
