This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award is designed to investigate the
relationship between reproductive patterns (i.e., whether the species produces
larvae or not) and inbreeding in marine systems. The main hypothesis proposes
that a species without free-living larvae will likely encounter close relatives
as potential mates due to their relatively limited capacity for dispersal. Thus,
the PI hypothesizes that such species without free-living larvae will most
likely demonstrate kin recognition as a means of minimizing inbreeding.
Alternatively, deleterious alleles may already be largely purged from the
population of the direct developer through extensive inbreeding so that
selection against inbreeding may no longer be strong enough to select for kin
recognition and avoidance. Finally, it is also possible that close relatives in
direct developing species mate routinely and produce progeny that exhibit
inbreeding depression. The PI will conduct controlled matings for Crepidula
fornicata and C. convexa to assess whether males and females discriminate
between full-siblings and non-relatives in choosing mates. The experiment will
be repeated forty times for each of the two snail species. The proposed work is
extremely labor-intensive, but will give definitive results.
