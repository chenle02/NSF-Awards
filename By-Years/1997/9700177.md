The objective of this research project is to apply a new experimental
understanding of the flow behavior and strong memory of mesophase pitch, guided
by rheological analysis, to prepare fiber with well-defined model
microstructures that can be examined for the most effective mechanical and
thermal performance. Carbon fibers spun from mesophase pitch, a discotic nematic
liquid crystal, can be heat-treated to realized highly oriented graphitic
microstructures, and thus attain exceptional levels of elastic modulus and
thermal conductivity. While this research focuses on mesophase fiber, the
results should apply to other carbon materials fabricated by pyrolysis through
the mesophase state, e.g., needle cokes for steel making electrodes, thermal
absorption tiles for fusion devices, and composites for thermal conductors and
braking devices. The research project has a balance between theory and
experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the carbon fiber
manufacturing industry.
