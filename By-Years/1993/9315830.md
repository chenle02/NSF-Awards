9315830 Hammer This award supports continued research on Triassic and Jurassic
age vertebrate material collected in the Beardmore Glacier region of the
Transantarctic Mountains. The fossils include Triassic synapsids and the first
Jurassic dinosaurs from Antarctica. This continued funding is required because
of the large amount of material that was collected during the previous field
work and because of the time consuming nature of fossil preparation work. The
collection to date has produced at least five taxa of Jurassic age, including a
new large crested carnivorous dinosaur. Other dinosaur material includes
portions of a prosauropod and teeth of a scavenging carnivore. In addition to
the dinosaur material, other Jurassic animals identified include a pterosaur and
a tritylodont synapsid. Early Jurassic fauna under study is one of only a few
high latitude faunas known and so has considerable paleoclimatic significance.
In addition, because Early Jurassic terrestrial vertebrate faunas are relatively
rare, these fossils could provide significant information about the evolution of
lineages between the Late Triassic and the Middle to Late Jurassic. Preparation
of the Triassic material will follow the completion of the Jurassic material.
