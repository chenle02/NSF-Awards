Every part of modern life is studied using computer simulation. This
includes&lt;br/&gt;-medicine: computer studies of protein folding for designing
new drugs;&lt;br/&gt;-physics: basic estimates of mass and charge are most
accurately obtained via lattice gauge theory;&lt;br/&gt;-business: the number of
bank tellers or grocery checkers that will optimize customer traffic
flows;&lt;br/&gt;-and virtually every area of the social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;In
the face of huge, sophisticated data sets, new algorithms are required to
efficiently and accurately carry out such simulations. At the same time, in this
"anything goes" world, questions of how long an algorithm should be run in order
to do its job must be studied-and answered. A very simple example would be, "How
many times do we shuffle a deck of cards to completely mix it?" The research
supported by this award suggests a host of such algorithms using sequential
importance sampling which are broadly applicable. It also incorporates new proof
techniques from the geometric theory of Markov chains to rigorously pin down
running times. This work addresses those instances when researchers are
sometimes too "fast and loose", which can yield misleading results. The proposed
algorithms can help detect and fix these issues. The project provides research
training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed new research is to design
new algorithms, and analyze widely used existing algorithms for simulation. This
is centered around four main themes: importance sampling where new criteria for
required sample size are developed and tried out in problems of missing data and
contingency tables; developing analytic and geometric techniques adapted from
partial differential equations and geometry (Whitney covers, John domains,
Carlesson estimates) to develop geometric theory of Markov chains; exploring
connections between the generators of Markov processes and algebraic complexes
(Hodge theory) developed by combinatorialists and topologists; the study of
mathematics of shuffling cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
