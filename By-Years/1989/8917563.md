This award will support the operation of a high-pressure research facility
housed and operated by the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the State
University of New York in Stony Brook. The facility consists of two large,
multi-anvil, presses capable of sustained sample pressures in the range 0-30 GPa
(0- 300 kilobars) and temperatures up to 2500K. One of these presses is capable
of being transported and interfaced with the National Synchrotron Light Source
at nearby Brookhaven Laboratory. The facility will be engaged in high-pressure
experiments directed by the Stony Brook team and also by an outside users
community of geoscientists interested in high-pressure research. The equipment
is uniquely suited for the synthesis and characterization of geophysically
important phases found at depth in the Earth's interior.
