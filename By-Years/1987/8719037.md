This award will enable the 1987 Presidential Young Investigators (PYI's) in
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to meet for a Workshop at the annual meeting
of the Council for Chemical Research (CCR) to be held September 20-22, 1987 in
Philadelphia. The purpose of bringing the PYI's to the meeting is three-fold.
The first and foremost objective will be to allow the PYI's for 1987 in
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to meet with the upper research management of
the 38 member companies of the CCR. Hopefully this will give the PYI's an
opportunity to interact with and to develop working arrangements with the
individuals from industry who have the ability to fund the matching portion of
the PYI funding program. The second goal will be to have a one-hour workshop,
conducted by Dr. Theodore Tabor of the Dow Chemical Company, devoted
specifically to the PYI's with a discussion on "How to obtain matching funds". A
third aspect is to provide the PYI's with an opportunity to meet each other and,
hopefully, to develop interactions with one another which will last throughout
their lives.
