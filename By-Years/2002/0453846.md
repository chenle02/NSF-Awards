Because of its associated northward fluxes of heat and salt, the flow through
the Bering Strait is important to the present climate of the northern hemisphere
and paleoceanographic proxy data suggests that it has also been critical to the
paleoclimate of the region. Recent theoretical work suggests that the mean
oceanic conditions in the Bering Strait are only marginally affected by the
local wind and local buoyancy forcing. Rather, the primary (responsible)
forcings are purported to be the global buoyancy field and the global wind
field. Funds are provided to examine this new idea using a hierarchy of models
ranging from simple process-oriented numerical models to ocean general
circulation and climate models. The project's specific goals are:&lt;br/&gt;i.
to determine what role the global wind field plays in determining the flow rate
through the Bering Strait, and &lt;br/&gt;ii. to determine whether the abrupt
warming at the end of the last glaciation resulted in part from the opening of
the Bering Strait (induced by sea level rise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
