The ability of a species to adapt to local variations in habitat is decreased
by movement of individuals from one habitat to another. However, in a highly
mobile insect, the diamond back moth, local variation in resistance to
insecticides occurs. This research is designed to determine the source of this
variation. Is the variation an indication that gene flow (a result of individual
movement and reproduction in the new habitat) is low despite high mobility? Or
is gene flow substantial, but its effects overwhelmed by local variation in
selection for insecticide resistance? Data will be collected by marking moths
and measuring movement, andy by examining genetic variation between populations.
These data will be compared with the use of a computer simulation model. The
results of this research will be important in understanding how species adapt to
variations in their environment, and how strongly divided such populations are
into local, somewhat autonomous groups. Knowing how gene flow affects the
ability of insects to respond to environmental changes will also help
understanding how insects adapt to insecticides, and how the evolution of
resistance to insecticides and genetically engineered plants might be managed.
