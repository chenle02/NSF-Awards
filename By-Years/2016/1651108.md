How do people change their accents after moving to new regions? Mobile people
typically acquire some, but not all, of a new region's dialect features; this
project will investigate the developmental, social, and linguistic factors
determining what kinds of changes occur, and the ways in which mobile speakers
vary their use of accent features to achieve social goals in conversation. This
research will help us understand how words and speech sounds are represented in
the mind as well as the flexibility of language over the
lifespan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project, the largest study of
second dialect acquisition to date, will have several practical applications.
Understanding how accents vary and change over a lifetime is crucial for
improving language- and dialect-teaching pedagogy as well as speech-recognition
and speech-generating technologies. Knowing how mobile speakers are likely to
change their accents can aid forensic and intelligence investigations involving
speaker profiling or judging authenticity in cases of possible voice disguise.
Finally, improved awareness of how speech varies and how this variation is used
by everyone to communicate is key to stemming language-based prejudice and
discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will interview eighty native
speakers of English: forty natives of Toronto, Canada, who relocated as adults
to New York City, and forty natives of New York City who relocated as adults to
Toronto. Both speaker samples will be stratified by gender, age of arrival in
their new region, and number of years living in the new region. Each mobile
speaker will participate in activities along with a friend who is a lifelong
resident of the migrant's current city, including a conversational interview and
a series of reading and judgment tasks. Activities will be audio-recorded,
enabling the researcher to compare spontaneous and read speech as well as speech
associated with different topics and expressed attitudes. Four vowel variables
which distinguish the two cities will be analyzed using appropriate phonetic and
statistical methods. The results of this analysis will be used to evaluate
existing claims and generate new hypotheses about mobility-induced dialect
change and to determine how patterns of variation reflect the social and
attitudinal content of speech.
