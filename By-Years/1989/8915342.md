Dr. Ruth M. Colwill, of Brown University, and Dr. Robert A. Rescorla, of the
University of Pennsylvania, are collaborating in research on the learned basis
of elementary goal-directed behavior. A large proportion of learned behavior of
humans and other animals involves such goal-direction, and its understanding is
central to many psychological processes. Drs. Colwill and Rescorla are using a
widely-accepted model behavioral system in which laboratory rats receive
positive outcomes when they engage in designated behaviors (responses) in the
presence of signals. Such an arrangement can potentially result in the learning
of a variety of relations among signal, response, and outcome. The overall goal
of the project is to explore the nature of the associative relations that are
actually learned. Four types of associative relations have been indicated by the
results of previous research by Drs. Rescorla and Colwill, and will be the
special focus of this project: (a) an association between the response and its
outcome; (b) an association between the signal and that outcome; (c) an
association between the signal and the response; and finally (d) a hierarchical
association between the signal and the response- outcome relation. The
theoretical analysis to be conducted draws heavily on our currently well-
developed understanding of a related learning process, Pavlovian conditioning.
In the past twenty years, our understanding of Pavlovian conditioning has
advanced and changed dramatically, partly as a result of previous NSF-supported
research in Dr. Rescorla's laboratory. It is natural and timely to attempt an
extension of our understanding of Pavlovian associations to the more complex and
intrinsically more important case of goal-directed behaviors. The prospects for
significant advancement are substantial and exciting.
