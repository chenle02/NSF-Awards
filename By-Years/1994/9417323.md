9417323 Turro The focus of the workshop will be to bring together students and
faculty to create hypermedia modules for general, organic, physical and
computational chemistry courses. The participants will come from Cloumbia and
from an external consortium. The modules will will be tested at Columbia,
throughout the consortium and in at least one high school, the Dalton School of
New York City. %%% With this award the Chemistry Division is supporting a
workshop organized by Dr. Nicholas J. Turro of the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University. The workshop will enable faculty and undergraduates to work
together to create hypermedia modules to stimulate systemic changes in the
undergraduate curriculum in chemistry.
