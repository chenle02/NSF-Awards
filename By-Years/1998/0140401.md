This project is an unsolicited submission. The goal of this project is to
develop strategies to enhance the efficiency and utility of retrovirus-mediated
gene transfer. Retroviruses are a widely utilized vector system in current gene
therapy clinical trials, which has resulted in the rapid advancement of
retroviral vector technology. Despite this, retroviral gene transfer efficiency
has remained disappointingly low, hampering the emergence of retroviral gene
therapy as an effective clinical tool. It has been found that charged molecules
greatly influence the efficiency of the gene transfer process. Specifically,
positively charged compounds have been shown to enhance gene transfer, whereas
negatively charged compounds inhibit the process. This project seeks to
accomplish the following: (1) to investigate in detail the mechanism of charged
compound enhancement and inhibition of the retroviral gene transfer process, (2)
to develop a mathematical framework for analyzing the effect of charged
compounds on virus transport and transduction, and (3) to compare gene transfer
efficiency in an animal model using ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy protocols
optimized to enhance the electrostatic interaction between the retrovirus vector
and target cell. To achieve these goals, the investigators will utilize a
complementary set of enzymatic and immunohistochemical assays, molecular imaging
techniques, and cytofluorometric analyses to quantitate various steps of the
retroviral gene transfer process. Engineering analysis of the resultant
biomolecular transport and kinetic reaction data will be used to facilitate the
construction of an integrative model of retrovirus transport.
