This project addresses undergraduate instruction in the areas of machine
dynamics and vibration. It supports implementation of modern modal analysis
equipment and software into the mechanical vibrations, kinematics and dynamics
of machines, and engineering materials courses. A Bruel & Kjaer model 2034A Dual
Channel Analyzer, a Dell 333D personal computer, SMS Star modal analysis
software, and ancillary equipment are involved. The dual channel analyzer
enables students to determine natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping
properties for realistic structures using modern modal analysis techniques. The
SMS Star software, running on the Dell 333D personal computer, is used to
animate the experimentally determined vibration modes to allow visualization of
the vibratory behavior of the structure undergoing the test. Additionally, the
software enables design oriented questions pertaining to structural
modifications to be posed and simulates the results of such changes using 3-D
graphical displays.
