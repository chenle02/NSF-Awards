0221057 Smyth

A sequence of direct numerical simulation (DNS) experiments designed to extend
earlier two-dimensional results to more general ocean flows will be performed.
Turbulence evolution will be simulated in a variety of initial flows in which
density changes in thin layers (compared with velocity) and oscillatory
instability results. The physics of turbulence will be studied in detail, and
turbulence statistics will be compared with DNS of Kelvin-Hemholtz billows, with
laboratory experiments on Holmboe waves, and with turbulent events observed in
the ocean as has been done for Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. Besides adding directly
to the knowledge of oscillatory instabilities in the ocean, diagnostics that
will permit the identification of instability classes (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz or
Holmboe) more clearly in future observational studies will be defined.
