Giovanelli, Riccardo AST 96-17069 Dr. Giovanelli will continue a three-part
observational study to improve the understanding of the distribution of light
and matter in the universe, to provide a large-scale reference frame in the
determination of the deviations from Hubble flow and to improve the accuracy of
estimates of the universal expansion rate. The distances to the galaxies will be
measured mainly by the Tully-Fisher relation. The observations will consist of
surface photometry data for about 1000 spiral galaxies, I band surface
photometry and optical rotation curves of about 750 galaxies, and spectroscopy
of a dozen host galaxies of SN Type Ia.
