If properly realized, the data deluge will be a catalyst for new scientific
discovery that fuels advances in grand challenge questions such as climate and
social-ecological interactions. While federal agencies such as the National
Science Foundation have invested very successfully in repositories,
infrastructure, and tools for data-intensive science, investing in data
solutions is not the same as investing in high performance computing resources
because unlike general purpose compute facilities where the facility can be
separated from the use, it is difficult to separate data from its semantics, so
general purpose solutions only address part of the problem, and a small part at
that. Recognizing the opportunities that could be realized through stronger
integrated efforts, NSF is encouraging a path towards coordinated efforts that
result in satisfying the needs of a broader constituency that strives for
interoperability, harmonization of concepts, protocols, and standards nationally
and internationally. This proposal is a small but fundamental next step towards
building an organization with lasting and significant impact on the broader
community engaged in 4th paradigm research and education.
