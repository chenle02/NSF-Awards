This project will provide laboratory equipment necessary to add a set of fiber
optic application exercises to an existing junior-level elective in Optics and
Electro-Optical Devices. Components being acquired include lasers, positioners,
detectors, fiber couplers, and assorted other laboratory items. The exercises
will illustrate concepts currently covered in the course for which the current
laboratory equipment is inadequate to provide laboratory experience.
