This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the Field Museum of Natural History
for the renovation and repair of paleontological facilities housed in the
Department of Geology. This building was constructed more than 25 years ago and
has not been renovated since 1975. The ARFMP grant of $375,000 and $420,495
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities and will permit the accommodation of multiple
users. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of the quality and range
of research that can be conducted by modernizing the heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning (HVAC), electrical, and plumbing systems; constructing new
workbenches; and moving the Geomagnetics Laboratory and Image Analysis
Laboratory into renovated, larger, dedicated rooms. This award contributes to
the infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the
conduct of paleontological research and for the training of quality
undergraduate and graduate students not only from the United States but also
from many other countries. Students trained in these laboratories, with access
to these outstanding paleontological collections, can benefit from research
opportunities not available at the neighboring universities with which they have
a collaborative relationship, namely, the University of Chicago, the University
of Illinois-Chicago, and Northwestern University. The studies of students at the
Field Museum will complement the programs and facilities at these collaborating
institutions.
