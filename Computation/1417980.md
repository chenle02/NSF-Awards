Many models in the sciences and engineering are solved approximately using
computational methods, and it is necessary to theoretically justify the
reliability of the computed approximations. In addition to providing
justification of the numerical methods, the theoretical analysis often provides
insight for the development of new methods with improved efficiency, accuracy,
and viability. In this project, the investigator and a graduate student will
construct, analyze and implement numerical methods for classes of linear and
nonlinear partial differential equations arising in stochastic financial models,
stochastic differential games, and other applications in finance and
engineering. The overall aim of the project is to develop methods that can be
implemented using current computational software and to derive explicit
estimates of the approximate solutions.

The main goal of this project is to propose robust finite element
discretizations for a class of fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equations and to develop a comprehensive convergence theory. The project
consists of two integrated components: (1) The development of finite element
methods for second order elliptic equation in non-divergence form with non-
smooth coefficients; the building-blocks of the HJB problem, (2) The
construction, implementation and convergence analysis of practical finite
element discretizations for the HJB problem. The work will broaden the
mathematical theory of the finite element method to problems that have been
relatively untouched in the numerical community. The success of this project
will have broad impacts in the mathematical and computational applications of
stochastic optimal control in finance and engineering. In addition, the impacts
of this project are felt though the training of the next generation of
computational scientists, course development, and dissemination to the
mathematical and scientific computing communities.
