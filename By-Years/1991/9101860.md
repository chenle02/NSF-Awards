This project will determine the early Holocene history of the proglacial lakes
in the Great Lake basin to determine their effect on the regional climate. The
age, isotopic, lake.level and pollen assemblage information will strongly
constrain the timing and magnitude of the isotopic signals caused by Laurentide
meltwaters in the North Atlantic and in particular should contribute to
restricting the various hypotheses of Younger Dryas cooling.
