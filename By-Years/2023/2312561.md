Advances in machine learning, coupled with advances in scalable data processing,
have resulted in highly accurate predictions of quantities of interest. Yet,
despite the advances in machine learning and data systems, many data
practitioners cannot easily answer causal inference questions in observational
data settings. This project will build a novel computer system to allow
businesses, academics, and the public to perform effective and intuitive causal
exploration. The main novelty of this project will be an end-to-end, causal data
exploration system that allows users to ask direct, causal questions and
visually experience cause-effect relationships, while the system automatically
optimizes for real-time interactions. Using the system, an office employee can
ask "What would have been the effect on sales last year had we increased
advertising expenditure targeted at women?"; an academic can ask "Did improved
educational attainment cause a wage increase?"; a member of the public can ask
"Did lack of exercise cause my gain in weight?"

This project will develop a scalable, CAusal-RElational (CARE) data system for
end-to-end causal data exploration. CARE will let users experience causality by
allowing explicit, real-time interventions with causal data modeling, do-
calculus querying, and intervention-centric visualization. CARE will accelerate
this broad range of tasks simultaneously by optimizing the underlying data
layout and using emerging hardware (e.g., GPU, TPU) in consideration of user-
specific data access and computational patterns. This project will address three
fundamental research challenges: (1) data modeling - designing a causality-
driven data model for effortless causal modeling and systems optimization, (2)
efficient query processing - rapidly estimating accurate causal treatment
effects for large datasets, (3) declarative querying and interactive
visualization - assisting users in easily expressing their causal queries and
intuitively understanding causality. These research thrusts will be evaluated by
measuring system performance and asking human evaluators about their
experiences. This research effort will enable interactive, low-effort causal
inference, making this crucial analysis tool accessible to all.
