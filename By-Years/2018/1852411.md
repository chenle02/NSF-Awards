This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal
benefits in addition to integrating research and education. This REU Site award
to Western Washington University (WWU) supports the training of nine U.S.
students over a 10-week program during each of the three years of program
duration (27 total students). Students learn advanced statistical and
demographic training in the social sciences and apply their training to original
public health research projects generated in collaboration with international
partners. The REU program provides an experience to undergraduate students that
is typically not available to them at their home institutions. Students from
primarily undergraduate colleges and universities and from underrepresented
groups are encouraged to apply. The primary objective is to train social science
undergraduates in research methodology in a cross-cultural and multi-
disciplinary learning environment. This REU site helps social science students
learn the basic concepts of good science, develop data management skills,
analyze public health data, reach independent conclusions, mentor subsequent
cohorts, and share their findings through the peer review process. This REU site
also provides a unique opportunity to contribute research findings to a nation's
larger focus on health, capacity building, and economic advancement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students work with the Primary Investigators from Western
Washington University, collaborative faculty, and student colleagues to analyze
secondary data collected from regional health centers. With IRB approval,
students learn how to code, clean, and analyze these data using advanced
quantitative regression techniques. Students return to WWU to continue
developing research findings in collaborative lab work and prepare results for
dissemination to professional academic audiences. Intensive training allows
students to contribute a social science perspective to Big Data efforts of the
global scientific community and build U.S. capacity for cultivating diverse and
globally engaged scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
