Electrical conductivity, which depends on ionic fluids, metal or carbon content
and temperature, provides complementary information to properties determined
from seismic or potential field data. Our ability to image conductivity
structure has recently undergone a revolution. This is a project involving high
resolution magnetotelluric (MT) profiling in the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO) and
the southeast Appalachians (SEA). The common element in the two experiments is
illumination of processes in fossil zones of continental collision. The THO
experiment will coincide with an 850 channel COCORP seismic reflection line
across the Williston Basin and will be closely coordinated with the Lithoprobe
transect of the THO. The THO project will focus on the largest known
conductivity anomaly in N. America and on the upper mantle structure of the
area. The SEA experiment will take advantage of the fact that the ocean edge can
amplify MT response to certain structures. It is expected to settle the
controversy about the location of the Alleghanian suture, map the sedimentary
package under the thrust associated with this collision event, provide important
insight into the preservation of retrograde metamorphic conditions in deep
continental crust and estimate the volatile content in (and the presence of
partial melt beneath) very old oceanic lithosphere.
