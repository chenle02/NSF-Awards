This project provides five physiological recording instruments for 120 students
per semester in six laboratory sections of a course in physiological psychology.
The study of the physiological bases of behavior requires accurate monitoring
and recording of physiological responses. The equipment provided for this
project allows the upper division undergraduate students to gain the necessary
hands on experience if they are to grasp the relationship between biology and
behavior and to understand the techniques by which these relationships are
discovered. When not needed for the physiological psychology classes, the
equipment is employed in demonstrations in the introductory psychology classes
and research methods classes. In addition, The equipment significantly increases
the quantity and quality of independent research projects carried out by
undergraduate students doing research in physiological psychology. The award
will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.
