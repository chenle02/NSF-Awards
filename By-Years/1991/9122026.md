This project is concerned with the modeling of cooperative expert consultation
dialogues within a plan-based framework, with emphasis on the recognition of
problem solving and communicative intentions and the handling of negotiation
subdialogues. The research will develop a rich tripartite dialogue model that
differentiates among domain, problem solving, and communicative intentions yet
captures the relationships among them.; beliefs and intentions will be
explicitly ascribed to the participants and each kind of intention will be
recognized incrementally as the dialogue progresses.
