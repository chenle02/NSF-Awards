This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will explore
the chemistry of metal oxide supported complexes containing bridged cyclo-
pentadienyl and carbonyl ligands. The investigators will also reexamine the use
of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl metal complexes as reagents for the activation of
small molecules. The investigators are experienced in the synthesis of ligands
and metal complexes and the infrared techniques that are involved in the
process. The preparation and characterization of supported organometallic
complexes are at the cutting edge of research in the area of heterogeneous
catalysis. This comprehensive investigation organometallic compounds will
significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly minority
institution and will provide innovative scientific techniques to its students in
their professional development.
