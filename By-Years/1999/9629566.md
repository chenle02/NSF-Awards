9629566 Tilman Biodiversity and the Productivity, Stability, and Sustainability
of Prairie Ecosystems Because of deforestation, urbanization, and other
expansions of human land use, species are going extinct at unprecedented rates.
This has raised concerns about the possible long-term effects of the loss of
species on the functioning of Earth's ecosystems. Although there are many
hypotheses about such potential effects, these ideas have almost never been
directly tested under field conditions. Such tests are important not just to
resolve the scientific debate, but to provide society with information on the
likely ecological impacts of the loss of biodiversity. This research will
maintain and monitor a uniquely powerful field experiment in which there is
direct experimental control of plant biodiversity in 342 large prairie-like
plots. This work will determine if and how the productivity of these ecosystems
depends on biodiversity. The effects of biodiversity will also be studied on the
sustainability of soil fertility, and on ecosystem stability. This will provide
a rigorous test of the hypothesized dependencies of ecosystem functioning on
biodiversity.
