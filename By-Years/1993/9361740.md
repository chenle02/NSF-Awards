ABSTRACT -- III-9361740 Wright The PI proposes to use a continuous plasma
pyrolysis process to synthesis metallofullerenes starting with either a liquid
or gas phase hydrocarbon and a metallic precursor (e.g. benzene or toluene plus
a an organometallic compound). In Phase I a plasma torch (2KW), operating up to
100 Torr (argon) and seeded with the appropriate starting materials, will be
used. The use of a continuous plasma process should results in increased
residence times and in better controllability of the process. In phase I, the
plasma technique will be demonstrated and the resulting metallofullerenes will
be characterized.
