Dr. Reeve has recently gained access, through a NATO sponsored collaboration
with Professor K. O. Stetter in Germany, to an archaebacterium that is
hyperthermophilic (grows only within the temperature range of 90 to 115 degrees
Centigrade). These bacteria grow at the highest temperatures known for a living
organism, and it is impossible to carry out genetic approaches to understanding
how the bacterium can grow at these temperatures using current genetic
techniques. Genes from the hyperthermophile AV19 will be cloned into Escherichia
coli, where it may be possible to determine their function and DNA sequences. If
preliminary experiments are successful under this Small Grant for Exploratory
Research they will open up a major field of study that would be more appropriate
for a larger award.
