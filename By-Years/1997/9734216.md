This research addresses the need to consider details of the analog behavior of
digital circuits and interconnect in order to ensure correct functionality.
Specifically it focuses on analysis of timing and noise in deep submicron
circuit designs. All noise sources in a digital integrated circuit are being
considered - coupled and ringing noise on signal lines, power supply noise, and
noise from the circuits The effect of noise on delay is being considered in
performance verification. Because many of the emerging timing and noise problems
are associated with on-chip inductance, techniques for practically extracting
on-chip inductance will be developed. The question of how the complex time-
domain responses that result from inductive interconnect can be used in static
timing and noise analysis is being investigated. Additional explorations are on
using the complex time-domain responses that result from inductive interconnect
for static timing and noise analysis. Other areas of investigation include a
static solution to on-chip power grid integrity analysis and noise
considerations in synthesis and circuit tuning. The educational plan includes
building a VLSI CAD research laboratory, and development of courses in hardware
design using FPGAs.
