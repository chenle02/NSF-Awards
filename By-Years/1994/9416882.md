9416882 Bell This three-year award requests support for U.S.-France cooperative
research in sensory systems between Curtis Bell of the Neurological Science
Institute of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon, and Kirsty Grant
of the French National Research Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-
Yvette, France. The objective of their research is to study neural signals in
the brain of mormyrid electric fish. They will investigate adaptive synaptic
plasticity and its role in controlling sensory input into the brain. This work
extends their previous in vivo studies to in vitro systems which will allow them
to investigate synaptic plasticity and local brain circuitry. The U.S. and
French investigators are physiologists with different and complementary research
experience that are essential to completion of this project. Dr. Bell's
experience has been with in vivo systems whereas Dr. Grant has had extensive
experience with in vitro slice preparations. Their proposed project will advance
our understanding of sensory circuits and local brain circuitry. ***
