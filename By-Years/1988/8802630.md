This grant enables Professor Saltzman to continue his studies of long-term
(e.g, Pleistocene and Cenozoic) climatic changes aimed at developing a plausible
physical mode to account for the mounting geological proxy evidence regarding
the simultaneous time-evolution of many climatic variables (e.g., ice mass, CO2,
and surface temperature) and their spatial distributions. The proposed studies
involve statistical analyses of the relevant time-series records (including
analyses for detection of "abrupt" phenomena and "dimensionality"), as well as
theoretical studies based on both "deductive" physics (using general circulation
models and statistical-dynamical models, where fast-response, equilibrium,
considerations are involved) and "inductive" low-order models (using
qualitative, i.e., "conceptual," physics structured by the theory of dynamical
systems analysis where slow-response, non-equilibrium processes that are not
amenable to direct calculation are involved). This research is important because
it treats our planet's climate as a dynamical system influenced by both external
forcing and internal feedbacks and interactions. This approach is aimed at
producing a comprehensive theory of the climate system.
