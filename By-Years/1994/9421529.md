IBN-9421529 Michael Ferkin Seasonal reproduction is typical of most species of
animals. The mechanisms that underlie seasonal changes are not well
characterized. The proposed research examines a new and unique effect of
prolactin, a pituitary hormone, on reproductive behavior. There is considerable
evidence that prolactin inhibits reproduction. However, recent evidence suggests
strongly that high prolactin levels may be needed for the behaviors and physical
characteristics necessary for males attract females. The apparent paradoxical
role of prolactin will be examined using an unique in vivo model. Prolactin
levels tend to be higher during the long days of spring and summer which
corresponds to the time of year when animals are reproductively active, whereas,
such levels tend to be lower during the short days of fall and winter, and
correspond to the time of year when animals are reproductively quiescent. These
studies will contribute results that can furnish a new perspective on
physiological mechanisms and behaviors facilitating reproduction. They will
provide a context within which we can understand the mechanisms underlying
reproductive behavior and hormone-behavior relationships and the evolutionary
processes leading to seasonal rhythms in reproduction.
