This award allows for research on several intertwined issues related to radar
meteorology, cloud physics, and the transfer of radiation through the
atmosphere. The specific research tasks within the proposal will answer
questions regarding why some raindrops do not fall at their terminal velocities,
how radiation travels through layered dust, and how supercooled water freezes.
These topics have a wide range of application, from improving radar estimates of
rainfall to impacting materials sciences. The research will include
international collaborators and provide educational and training opportunities
for students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will be studying the presence
and impact of correlated fluctuations in cloud and precipitation physics, radar
meteorology, and radiative transfer. Theoretical studies, computer simulations,
and field and laboratory data analysis will be conducted to answer questions
related to five main research topics: deviations of falling raindrops from their
expected terminal speed, radiative transfer through a vertically stratified
medium, coherence in radar backscatter using high resolution and short pulse
data, temporal and spatial correlations of precipitation and their dependence on
scale, and the effects of pressure fluctuations on the nucleation and freezing
of supercooled water droplets.
