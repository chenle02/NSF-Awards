The Department of Geology is purchasing an automated x-ray diffraction system
for use in to solving geologic problems and by the Department of Chemistry for
the identification of transition metal complexs. Students in mineralogy courses
are using the equipment to analyze and characterize mineral unknown. Using
existing clay mineral preparation facilities, students prepare oriented mounts
for clay mineral analysis. Additionally, students undertaking honors and special
studies research projects are using the instrument.
