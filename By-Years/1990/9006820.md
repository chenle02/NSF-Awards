The equipment to be purchased is a 300 kip capacity tension testing machine with
accompanying equipment for data recording and acquisition. The primary use of
the testing machine will be for determining the tension properties (yield stress
and strain, strain hardening strain, ultimate strength, etc.) of reinforcing
bars used in experimental research projects. The tension testing machine will
also be used to test tension coupons from rolled steel sections and tests of
prestressing strands. The range of projects which will make use of this machine
include tests of reinforced concrete frame elements, connections and
subassemblies; tests of steel bracing elements used for either braced steel
frames or as strengthening elements for nonductile concrete frames; and tests of
precast prestressed concrete frame and bridge elements. This equipment will
provide for experimental testing which will advance the knowledge base of
earthquake engineering.
