9311709 Brooks The evolution of large savanna mammals, such as pigs, horses, and
bovids, relates to the human story as both environmental and time/strategraphy
indicators. This proposal will focus on one of the most prevalent large mammals
commonly associated with hominids, the African Elephant lineage. This study will
assess the variation in Elephas recki in order to describe the pattern of
evolution seen in this fossil lineage, and will examine its utility as an
indicator for early hominid sites. The goal is to study how elephants reflect
the long term response of African ecosystems to changing biotic conditions, of
which early human ancestors were a critical part. It will also involve advanced
training of a graduate student. ***
