This research is to support a piggyback seismic experiment to an existing
program PACE (Pacific-Arizona Crustal Experiment) sponsored by the USGS. Seismic
instruments from industry and the PASSCAL array will be utilized in three
deployments for a total of 41 shots by the USGS. The piggyback will produce 2
high- resolution low-fold P and S wave sections: one is a 50 km long dip profile
across the Palo Verde Mountains, the Midway Mountains, the Chocolate Mountains,
and the Chocolate Mountains thrust fault. The other is a 27 km oblique strike
line along the Chocolate Mountains thrust. The goals include delineation of
crustal structure down to the Moho and the relation and properties of the
Orocopia schist formation.
