The RICOLLA project manages inconsistencies in structured databases maintained
collaboratively by an online community. RICOLLA remains fully functional in the
presence of inconsistencies, enabling "resolve-as-you-go" consistency. RICOLLA
allows users to collaboratively resolve certain conflicts while disagreeing on
others. Building Ricolla involves the following technical contributions: a) a
novel architecture that tolerates inconsistency, allows data query and update,
while aiding inconsistency resolution by community members; b) a data model and
interface for explaining the inconsistencies to the users; c) a set of
resolution actions that allow each user to resolve individual data
inconsistencies; d) a resolution policy language for summarizing a set of
resolution actions based on high level criteria; and e) a set of algorithms for
implementing the system on top of a relational database management
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting techniques and prototype
contribute to the infrastructure for the next generation of online databases.
This benefits a variety of online communities who need to collaboratively edit
structured data, ranging from the scientific domain to digital government and
social networks. RICOLLA's evaluation includes as use cases two scientific
communities (biologists and geoscientists) and UCSD students taking database
classes. Direct deployment in teaching serves to both improve students' online
collaboration and collect their feedback for RICOLLA's evaluation and tuning
purposes. Publications, technical reports, software and experimental data
resulting from this research are available at the project web site
