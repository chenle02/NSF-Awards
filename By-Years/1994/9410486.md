Flora 9410486 This is an award to provide support for research on a novel
approach for biological treatment of water containing halogenated organic
contaminants. The process involves use of a mixed culture of anaerobic
microorganisms that are cultivated on a cathode while an electric current at low
potential is passed through the solution. Formation of hydrogen on the cathode
produces reducing conditions at the cathode that can induce the biologically
mediated dehalogenation reaction. Results of this project are expected to
provide knowledge about a process that has the potential of removing pollutants
without producing undesirable byproducts. The mathematical model the
investigator plans on being able to build and calibrated with experimentally
determined data can be used in engineering design of processes using this novel
approach to decontamination of water. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program. ***
