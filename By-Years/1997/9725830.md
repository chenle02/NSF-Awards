Samuel Bowser OPP97-25830 Abstract A dominant member of cold, deep-sea
sediments is a group of giant protozoa, the aggulatinated foraminifera, also
known as forams. For protection, these single-celled organisms encase themselves
in architecturally-elegant shells that they construct by collecting, sorting,
and cementing together sediment grains. The unique occurrence of these giant
cells (greater than one millimeter in size) in the shallow waters of McMurdo
Sound, Antarctica allows for the study of the cellular and molecular aspects of
shell constructions. This project will use novel light microscopic methods to
examine how agglutinated forams secrete and sculpt the adhesive matrix that
binds sediment particular in their shells. Comparative time-lapse photography of
different foram species constructing shells will identify key steps in the
processes that lead to the various shell morphologies. Peptide sequence analyses
of the elastic proteins of the shells will provide valuable insight into the
chemical nature of foram bioadhesives. From a practical standpoint, these
cements have important biotechnological and medical applications. This project
will also continue a study of the effects of collection activities, as well as
natural physical disturbances, in this unique environment. This
interdisciplinary project has implications in a number of fields, including
cellular development, evolution, paleontology, marine products chemistry, and
ecosystem management.
