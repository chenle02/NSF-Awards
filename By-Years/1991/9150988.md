The goal of this project is to provide juniors and seniors with experience in
cellular and molecular approaches to the study of basic issues in development. A
refrigerated microcentrifuge, speedvac, and incubator enable students to prepare
and use RNA probes in an in situ hybridization exercise; dissecting microscopes
allow students to exam aspects of embryonic axis formation; and the regulation
and determination of single cells labelled with fluorescent compounds is studied
using an epifluorescence microscope. In addition, students use the equipment to
carry out independent projects.
