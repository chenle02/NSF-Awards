This project aims to explore the fundamental architectural considerations
involved in designing/operating wireless networks for fast Machine to Machine
(M2M) communication. Current ideas in the M2M space are fundamentally being
driven by ``slow M2M'' applications like electricity-monitoring in the Smart
Grid with their intellectual foundations coming from the now maturing field of
wireless sensor networks. This project advances the field by addressing the
high-performance case of industrial automation with tight real-time operating
requirements and the demand for very high reliability. To do this, the project
will be leveraging new mathematical and conceptual tools developed to understand
decentralized control systems as well as modern approaches to doing
multiterminal wireless networking that better exploit the full potential of the
wireless medium. The techniques used in this project will span networking,
control theory, information theory, wireless modeling, signal processing, and
circuit implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, the kind of "Fast
M2M" technology that this project is developing has the potential to help
invigorate the agile manufacturing sector of the economy. Easily reconfigurable
wireless interconnection in the industrial setting could help high-skill
manufacturing where the United States has a potential advantage over low-wage
countries. In the course of developing this technology, the project will train
students and postdocs in a way that encourages cross-fertilization of ideas
between wireless communication, networking, circuit implementation, control
theory, and information theory. These ideas will also be incorporated into
courses, including new M.Eng. courses aimed at educating technical leaders for
industry. This is the kind of non-siloed education that is essential for
innovation in the future. The project will also broaden participation in the
technical workforce by mentoring female graduate students.
