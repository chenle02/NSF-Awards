9625616 Yang This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for
Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research" competition. The research
will be conducted in cooperation with experts from the Harbin University, PRC,
and the objectives of the project are: to conduct both theoretical and
experimental studies for the design of various passive energy dissipation
systems based on control theories for seismic- and wind- excited structures; to
carry out theoretical and experimental studies for the development of a new
semi-active protective system, referred to as the semi- active hydraulic
momentum damper system (SAHMDS); and to install and test a passive hydraulic
momentum damper system (HMDS) in a full scale building in South West China. The
first two tasks will be carried out mainly at Irvine and the last in PRC with
both groups working together. The benefit of this arrangement is that during the
last decade some passive control systems for seismically excited civil
structures have been installed and studies by Chinese experts who can share
their experiences with the American counterpart. These systems will be tested
for seismic and wind hazards mitigation. ***
