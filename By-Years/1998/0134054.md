0134054 MacRae Arsenic is the only contaminant for which exposure through
drinking water has been proven to cause cancer in humans. The US Environmental
Protection Agency has concluded that the present drinking water limit of 50 ug/L
arsenic is not sufficiently protective and proposes a new limit of 10 ug/L. In
most cases, the arsenic originates in the geologic materials of the aquifer.
While correlations with bedrock types have been made, the factors that affect
arsenic concentrations and speciation in drinking water are poorly understood.
As(III), the reduced inorganic form, is more mobile and more toxic than As(V),
thus speciation affects both the concentration and the health implications of
arsenic exposure.

Microorganisms probably affect As concentrations in groundwater, but the
magnitude and nature of their participation in the arsenic cycle have not yet
been clarified. Microorganisms can affect the chemistry of arsenic compounds in
a number of ways. Laboratory and field studies as proposed in this program will
build on the PI's preliminary data that indicate the presence of arsenate
reducing microorganisms in well water to determine how microbial activities
affect soluble arsenic concentrations. This information will be used to create a
conceptual model of the processes that affect As in groundwater. Molecular
probes will be developed to determine the importance of the isolated arsenate-
degrading microorganisms in situ.

Existing geological data and field data gathered by high school and
undergraduate students will be used to assess whether or not the model derived
from laboratory experiments is supported by field observations. Since the
project requires an interdisciplinary approach, links with microbial ecologists
and environmental microbiologists will be strengthened to support the
investigator's research goals. The research results will form the basis of new
modules in two undergraduate environmental engineering courses. An outreach
program for high school students will also contribute to the collection of field
data.
