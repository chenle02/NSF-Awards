This project will undertake major additions to the Rice convection Model (RCM)
to increase its accuracy. 1. It will add the Rice Open Magnetosphere Model (ROM)
-- a highly mature, physics-based code that ties the RCM to the solar wind and
IMF through the magnetopause. 2. It will add a magnetofriction-equilibrium
relaxation technique to achieve particle and field self- consistency. 3. It will
add an algorithm to take account of internal plasma sources and losses.
