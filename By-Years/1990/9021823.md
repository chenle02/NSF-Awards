This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to North Dakota State University for
the renovation and repair of two adjoining buildings, Ladd Hall and Dunbar
Laboratories, which house that institution's chemical research and research
training activities. These buildings were constructed, respectively, in 1913 and
1963, and last renovated in 1979. The ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $600,000
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities and to foster greater interactions by locating
related research laboratories in close proximity to one another. This project
will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by
providing an upgraded heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system
and by rehabilitating basement research and research training space to
accomodamodate two laser laboratories. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.
Students trained in these laboratories have the benefit of having been educated
in consistently productive programs, including the North Dakota State
University's unique program in polymers and coatings.
