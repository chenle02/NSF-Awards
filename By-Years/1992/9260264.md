This project addresses the general need for efficient, robust systems for
encoding and processing spatial information by developing a prototype
programmable spatial memory system for application in robotic systems and
autonomous vehicles. Frequency and phase relationships between oscillators--
representing objects in the application environment--will be examined as
possible distance and direction encoding mechanisms. This prototype system is
based on a Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) developed by and available
exclusively to Intelligent Reasoning Systems. The HTPE is a general purpose
model neuron that combines analog and digital signal processing capabilities
with low component count, low power dissipation, and high processing speed.
