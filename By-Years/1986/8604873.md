A hollow cylinder shear device is being procured, which will be utilized with
existing equipment to determine the behavior of rock joints under the action of
shearing stresses. The equipment to be purchased includes the hollow cylinder
device, a rotory actuator and controller, a pressure transducer, a triaxial
cell, and a data acquisition system. This unique experimental system will permit
the investigation of the combined effects of pore pressure, confining pressure
and axial stress on the motion of joints in rock masses.
