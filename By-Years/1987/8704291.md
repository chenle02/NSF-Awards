A Prophet system will be implemented on a new SUN workstation, to serve as the
file server and local host. Prophet II will be used for statistical analysis,
interactive graphics, molecular modeling of small molecules, searches of
macromolecular databanks, and other computer-related biological research. The
system will support research in systematic biology, regulatory biology, cell
biology, and other research areas predominantly on lower eukaryotes.
