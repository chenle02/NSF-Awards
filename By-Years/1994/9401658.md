9401658 Cole This project supports a group of American researchers in carrying
out a survey on the state-of-the-art in speech and natural language processing
in the European Community (EC) and in the United States (US). The principal
investigators, in cooperation with a similar team of researchers from the
European Community, define and organize the effort. The objectives of the
project include but are not limited to assessing research that consider
empirical verification of the effectiveness of computerized speech and language
processing, that promotes further development of natural language understanding,
processing, modeling, and of speech analysis, synthesis, and recognition, and
that point to the most salient research opportunities under the present
circumstances in the US and Europe. The project also supports the collection of
information and the writing of a report and its dissemination.
