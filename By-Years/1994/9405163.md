9405163 Geissman Controversial aspects of extensional Cordilleran metamorphic
core complexes includes original dip of detachment faulty the origin of mylonite
and the applicability of the rolling hinge model to describe their evolution.
This project extends results on the South Mountain core complex, Arizona that
indicated shallow initial fault dips, but this core complex formed a relatively
shallow crustal levels and may not be representative. This work is aimed at the
deeper Harquahala, Harcuvar, Buckskin and Whipple detachments. Results will
allow a definitive assessment of large- scale structures associated with these
deep-type metamorphic core complexes.
