The Consortium for Minorities in Teaching Careers (CMTC) requests funds for a
planning grant for the development of a comprehensive proposal that will
increase the number of minority students to enter the teaching profession with
mathematics and science specialties. The consortium is made up of ten partner
institutions of higher education which include Historically Black Institutions
and Hispanic-Serving Institutions that have strong programs for minority teacher
preparation. CMTC was funded by FIPSE to conduct a program for precollege
students who are considering careers in teaching. The present request is
specifically for planning a program for teacher preparation with a strong
emphasis on the preparation of minority teachers. The funds will be used for
travel to meetings in order to plan the comprehensive proposal. Cost sharing by
CMTC will be approximately 25% of the NSF funds.
