The Biology Department's undergraduate curriculum in physiology is being
enhanced by adding new or revised courses in human and comparative vertebrate
physiology to the current offering in animal physiological ecology. The courses
are designed to have a significant research component. The university's goal is
to inculcate in students: (1) a fundamental understanding of physiological
processes, (2) an interest in scientific inquiry, (3) an ability to formulate
and test cogent hypotheses, and (4) proficiency in the use of modern technology
for acquisition and analysis of physiological data. An essential component of
this plan is to use student-friendly, research-grade instrumentation. The
computer-interfaced instruments funded through this project permit students to
examine several simultaneously changing physiological functions in a much more
dynamic and interactive manner than is possible with older analog instruments.
The BioPac physiological data acquisition system and Sable Systems respirometry
system have been chosen for their combined features of ease for student use and
superior research flexibility. Multiple sets of instruments are obtained to
enable us to accommodate larger laboratory classes. These instruments permit
class exercises and student research to be more extensive in design and better
replicated. Students are finding the investigative laboratories to be more
informative and enlightening than the "standard" labs of the past.
