Population connectivity - the degree to which geographically-separated groups
are linked by dispersal - is a critical parameter in the dynamics of marine
populations. Connectivity rates determine colonization patterns of new habitats,
the resiliency of populations to harvest, and the design of marine protected
areas (MPAs). Quantifying exchange rates in marine organisms is, however,
extremely difficult because natal origins of adults are almost invariably
unknown. This lack of knowledge is primarily due to the difficulty of conducting
mark-recapture studies in species that are characterized by the production of
large numbers of small pelagic offspring that suffer high initial mortality
rates. The investigators will employ a multi-technique approach that combines
mass-marking of fish embryos using inter-generational isotopic labeling of
otoliths and paternity analyses based on hypervariable DNA markers to measure
dispersal distances of coral reef fishes. Population connectivity will be
estimated in two species (Amphiprion percula and A. polymnus) over 3 years in
Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. The project involves an interdisciplinary
partnership with expertise in otolith geochemistry, reef fish ecology, and
population genetics.
