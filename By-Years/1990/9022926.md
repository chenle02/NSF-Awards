This project is collaborative with SES 9022601. This research tests a theory of
social control of deviance, the ways in which individuals can influence others
not to commit deviant acts. How people respond to sanctions varies greatly
depending on group context. For instance, community norms reinforce and support
laws, preventing more cases of deviance than are prevented by the legal
sanctions such as prison. Alternatively, peer pressure can contravene laws, as
when college students support each others' drinking, or output norms restrict
productivity. The theory under test here includes both actual and perceived
strength of sanctions, the cost of individual compliance, the cost and
effectiveness of trying to get others to comply or not to comply, and the
perceived likelihood that deviance will be detected. Experiments constitute
direct tests of most of the theory's assertions. Results will help develop this
explicit theory on the operation of social control proces- ses, and will have
applications in law enforcement and informal control situations.
