9710506 Nur The PI will continue his laboratory work on Gas Hydrates to
experimentally measure P- and S-wave velocities, permeability and thermal and
electrical conductivities of hydrates sediments, as well as model elastic
transport properties and strength of hydrates to enable the inversion of seismic
data for estimating free in the hydrate system and below it. They will use the
results to analyze existing marine seismic data with the ultimate objective to
develop a methodology for calculating the amount of hydrate in ocean sediments
from seismic data.
