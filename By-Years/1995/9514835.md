Zoeller 9514835 The ability of organisms to respond to cold environments and to
nurse their young, in spite of the seemingly disparate nature of these stimuli,
actually depends on the activation of the same neurochemical-containing cells in
the brain. The chemical produced by these brain cells is a small peptide called
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which controls metabolism by regulating the
secretion of thyroid hormones. Dr. Zoeller is assessing the ability of these
stimuli to modify the production of TRH in the brain. Additionally, while TRH is
involved in the response to these stimuli, it appears that distinct
subpopulations of cells, all producing TRH, are responsible for each response.
Using molecular tools, identification of these subpopulations is being explored.
The mechanisms involved in organismal responses to the environment and the
energy demands place upon them, is critical to the survival of all species of
animals, as is the ability to care for their young. A greater understanding of
brain mechanisms in these areas will foster our ability to facilitate species
survival in captivity and in the wild.
