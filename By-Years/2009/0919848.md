Keith Nehrke&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: IOS-0919848&lt;br/&gt;Award title:
Integrated Calcium and pH Signaling in C. elegans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major
challenge in physiology is bridging the gap between molecular and integrative
functions, or how processes occurring at the cell level are organized to convey
systems functions. The genetic model organism C. elegans exhibits a rhythmic
behavior that occurs every 45 seconds, and a variety of cell signaling processes
contribute to the behavioral output. The project is designed to exploit the
power of the nematode model system to explore functional interactions between
these processes. The project will also study a novel mechanism for fast cell-
cell communication, which forms the basis for one component of the rhythmic
behavior. The investigators will employ during the course of these studies
fluorescent biosensors to measure cell signaling in live worms, as well as
pharmacology, genetics, and molecular techniques to address how cell signaling
at the molecular level is translated into behavior in live organisms. This work
could potentially transform our view of cell signaling, leading to the emergence
of a new area of study with important implications for how cells communicate
with one another to convey behavior. The project will provide training for two
Ph.D. students and summer research opportunities for several undergraduate
students, with a strong emphasis on minority applicants. As a part of this
project, the investigators will also create and maintain a website that can be
accessed and understood by the layperson.&lt;br/&gt;
