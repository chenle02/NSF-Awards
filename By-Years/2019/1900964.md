This award supports participation in the Houston Summer School on Dynamical
Systems (HSSDS) for graduate students, held in June 2019 at the University of
Houston. The 8-day 2019 HSSDS workshop will bring together approximately 40
graduate students from institutions across the country, along with 10-15
exceptional undergraduates, who will arrive several days earlier and will
receive a series of background lectures giving them some of the tools they need
to attend the main event. The goal of the 2019 HSSDS workshop is to introduce
students both to fundamental techniques and recent progress in dynamical
systems, emphasizing a probabilistic viewpoint. Each lecturer in the 2019 HSSDS
workshop will give students an appropriate bird's-eye view of the area in which
he or she is working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expository talks will present
dynamics from a broad perspective, stressing its applications and connections
with other areas of science. The school will present recent results and
techniques that are not available in textbooks or in a form easily accessible to
graduate students. It will introduce recent developments in probabilistic
dynamics, chaotic dynamics, and dynamics of quantum systems. The 2019 HSSDS
workshop will also include more specialized topics such as statistical
properties of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamics, quantum walks, and dynamics on
flat surfaces and translation flows. Applications of dynamics to the modeling of
complex physical systems will be a major theme. More information can be found
