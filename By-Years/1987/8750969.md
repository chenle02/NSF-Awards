The Physics Department at Rutgers University-Camden will upgrade its present
microprocessor laboratory in order to keep the student laboratory work in step
with the already updated lecture material and the changes in industrial
employment demands. The Department will install fourteen microprocessor
developmental study system units. Each unit will consist of a Motorola
MEK68000ECB educational computer board, video display, cassette transport, and
interconnecting cables. In addition, a network switch, two printers, and cables
will be added for hardcopy of student ouput and system communication. The new
equipment will give the student hands on exposure to the latest 16/32 bit CPU
architecture. The laboratory exercises will illustrate synchronous and
asynchronous data acquisitions and control, 16/32 bit bus architecture, 8/16 bit
I/0 control, higher level assembly language programming and co- processing
techniques with other CPU families. In addition, present laboratory support
equipment will afford the opportunity of using higher level system development
tools such as Pascal, C, trace analyzers, and process emulators.
