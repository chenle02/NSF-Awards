This research takes a multiuser information theoretic approach to investigate
innate theoretical&lt;br/&gt;connections that exist between multiuser source and
channel coding, information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;network security, and
combinatorial tree packing algorithms in theoretical computer science. It
is&lt;br/&gt;of compelling interest to the theory as well as the engineering
practice of network source and&lt;br/&gt;channel coding, and network security,
in emerging wireless technologies.&lt;br/&gt;Addressing broad classes of network
source and channel models with correlation and&lt;br/&gt;cooperation, the
investigators study explicit and precise characterizations of basic
structural&lt;br/&gt;connections between multiuser data compression, channel
coding, network security and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial tree packing, and the
underlying role of common randomness (i.e.,
coordinated&lt;br/&gt;randomization). The research develops information
theoretic principles for associated signal&lt;br/&gt;processing algorithms. It
applies source coding and channel coding techniques for
providing&lt;br/&gt;information theoretic network secrecy in encrypted
communication, and investigates points of&lt;br/&gt;contact between
combinatorial tree packing algorithms and network security.
