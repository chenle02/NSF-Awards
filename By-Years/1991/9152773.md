This project develops a student laboratory for a new Electrical Engineering
Technology course which combines three specialty areas: instrumentation,
microprocessors, and programmable logic controllers. Equipment in the laboratory
includes oscilloscopes, function generators, and personal computers with lEEE
488 bus controller cards to interface with the instrumentation. Programmable
logic controllers and software, microcontroller development systems, conveyors,
and robots also are provided. The culmination of student experiments in this
laboratory is an industrial type project to automatically adjust and test
circuit boards. The students configure and program the equipment so that the
programmable logic controller positions the robot arm, and the microcontroller
adjusts a potentiometer with the robot until a desired voltage is measured, and
the personal computer and instrumentation tests the board to verify operation.
This project is significant within the curriculum because in no existing course
or laboratory are instrumentation, computers, microcontrollers, and programmable
logic controllers interfaced together.
