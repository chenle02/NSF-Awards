A computer-equipped Quantitative Learning Center is being developed; it is led
by a faculty Director, staffed by student peer consultants, and modeled on
Rollins College's Writing Center. In addition, related faculty workshops enable
faculty to redesign or modify introductory courses to include modules on
quantitative problem solving and data handling skills, and to take advantage of
the services of the Center and its Director. The Center emphasizes interactive
and collaborative learning techniques and the teaching of problem solving. This
project is a vehicle for coalescing and institutionalizing many successful
individual and group efforts throughout the campus.
