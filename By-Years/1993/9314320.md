9314320 Neuhauser Univ. Cal. Los Angeles This project in diatom-diatom reactive
scattering theory is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program. Exact, coupled-channel, state-to-state, quantum scattering,
calculations will be carried out for gas phase reactions of diatomic molecules
taking explicit account of all six degrees of internal freedom. Improved
computational methods will be developed, in particular, a time-dependent and an
equivalent time-independent flux-amplitude method, use of absorbing potentials,
and an improved filter algorithm for the accurate computation of eigenvectors
whose eigenvalues lie within a selected range. The first application of the
theory will be to the reaction of molecular hydrogen with the hydroxyl radical.
This research project develops improved computational methods for predicting the
detailed behavior of a very simple chemical reaction. Rigorous quantum
mechanical calculations will be carried out for a four-atom system. The goal is
to obtain a detailed and precise picture of the atomic events that occur. This
fundamental knowledge, which is difficult and expensive to extract from laser
spectroscopy and other laboratory experiments, provides detailed information
that serves to test various simplifying mathematical approximations used for
practical calculations for gas phase reactions of larger molecules. The reaction
of molecular hydrogen with the hydroxyl radical is itself of interest because it
is an important step in the chain reaction that occurs during the combustion of
hydrogen gas.
