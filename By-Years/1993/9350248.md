9350248 McConnell Neurons migrate to unique positions and form specific axonal
connections within the developing cerebral cortex. This Presidential Faculty
Fellow award will allow this investigator to explore the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that control neuronal migration and axonal growth. Transplantation of
developing cells in the cortex will be used to probe the cellular interactions
that mold neuronal function. ***
