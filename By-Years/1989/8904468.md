This is a proposal to acquire a Preparative HPLC System to be used primarily for
the purification of synthetic peptides. The science sections detailed in this
proposal describe the role of peptide synthesis in each investigator's program.
The ability to purify large (mg) quantities of the synthesized peptides by
preparative HPLC is essential for continued (1) Studies on processing mechanisms
of peptide-hormones and conformation of pro-hormone precursor proteins (2)
Studies on the structure of hepatitis B viral antigens (3) and (4) Studies on
the mechanism os nonenzymatic de-amidation of Asn and Gln residues in peptides
and proteins (5) Studies on the effects of snake venoms on hemostasis and the
development of synthetic anticoagulant peptides (6) Studies on the mitogenic
activity of synthetic growth hormone fragments (7) Studies on mitogenic factors
for cultured glial cells (8) Studies on the modification of alkaline phosphatase
in vitro and in vivo.
