This proposal is to determine the relative importance of acyl chains and
phospholipid head groups in the formation of lipid domains in erythrocyte
membranes and model membranes. Fluorescence digital imaging microscopy and
steady state fluorescence polari- zation techniques will be used. Fluorescently
labeled phospholipids which differ in head groups and acyl chains will be
synthesized or purchased, and the distribution of pairs differing in either head
groups or acyl chains will be determined by both techniques. Three results are
possible, and should allow resolution of disparate results obtained by the two
techniques. %%% All cellular membranes contain compounds known as phospholipids,
which have two distinct components: groups which prefer water, because they have
charged parts, and groups which are components of fats. It is not clear whether
the two components are equally impor- tant, or whether one is very important and
the other is less so. Experiments are planned using two quite different
techniques. Both measure the environment of specially labeled phospholipids.
Mixtures of these lipids will be used with model membranes and membranes from
red blood cells, to see if both components contribute equally to positioning in
the membranes or not.
