This planning grant will enable The Indiana State Museum (ISM) to develop "The
Science Behind the History," a program of live interactive video distance
learning that includes multiple components and state-wide partners. The project
is based on "ISM Live!," which uses a satellite van with video broadcast system
to deliver programs from diverse historic settings throughout Indiana.

Intellectual Merit. This project will add scientific components to
interpretations of settings that usually are presented from social or cultural
perspectives, including hands-on experiments at the remote broadcast-receiving
sites. Scientists and historians will both be involved in the activities along
with the audience participants.

Broader Impact. Diverse, multigenerational audiences throughout Indiana will be
reached through this project. In addition, it will provide a new model for
interactive distance learning, as well as help establish partnerships among
educational and community organizations that may lead to other beneficial long-
term outcomes.
