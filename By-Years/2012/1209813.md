This action funds William Ross Waldrip of the University of Arizona to conduct a
research project, entitled "Using volcanic rocks in southern Tibet to understand
continental collisions," during the summer of 2012 at China University of
Geosciences in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Wang Chengshan.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to use the geochemistry of
volcanic rocks erupted during the collision of India with Asia to better
understand deep earth processes during continental collisions.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
