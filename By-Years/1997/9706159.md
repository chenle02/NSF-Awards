It has been a long-standing goal of both the Artificial Intelligence and the
Robotics communities to develop physical artifacts that can act intelligently .
From the Robotics side, the priority has been on the development of mechanical
agents that would exhibit navigation, manipulation, perception, and action
skills, along with the ability to work cooperatively. The results on low-level
control, including sensor uncertainty, limited reasoning about geometric and
physical properties, and skills like object avoidance have proved interesting
and useful, but most autonomous robotic agents still lack the ability to perform
higher level intelligent operations either alone or in concert. This is partly
because of their need to proceed with reasonable expedience, while the known
methods are demonstrably very complex, and therefore slow. It is hoped that
recent results in AI planning, learning, reasoning, and cooperation among agents
will help in bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level
physical execution. The purpose of this workshop is to examine the available
results and research agenda in this `bridging` area, while also establishing
international links between American and Brazilian researchers working in the
same areas and between NSF and its Brazilian counterpart organization CNPq,
which will provide support for the Brazilian participants.
