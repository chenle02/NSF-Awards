This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. John F. Hartwig of Yale University to understand the
efficient cleavage and functionalization of alkane and arene C-H bonds by borane
reagents and metal boryl intermediates and to exploit a new approach to alkane
and arene functionalization. The project aims to understand how boryl groups
create metal centers that are unusually reactive toward C-H bond cleavage and
how the intermediates from C-H bond activation create functionalized products.
The synthetic potential for reactions with functionalized substrates and
polyolefins will also be evaluated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, rhodium
catalysts modified with anionic ligands other than substituted cyclopentadienyl
groups and ruthenium catalysts with pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands will be
studied to identify the features of the catalyst structure that create activity
for the functionalization of alkanes and arenes. As the borylation of small
alkanes can be extended to the borylation of protected, functionalized
substrates and to the borylation of polyolefins, these reactions will be
developed as an important step toward conducting selective functionalization of
methyl groups in a complex molecule and toward generating prototype polyolefins
that contain a variety of functional groups at the termini of sidechains.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directly transforming hydrocarbon bonds into useful
chemicals and pharmaceuticals is a goal of both laboratory and economic
significance. In particular, the conversion of alkanes to linear alcohols,
amines and carboxylic acids is a prominent goal in synthetic organic chemistry.
This work capitalizes on Hartwig's discovery of a catalytic system that
generates linear functionalized products from alkanes in only two steps. This
project also integrates research into a broader educational experience for both
students and postdocs and provides them with training in advanced catalytic
methods.&lt;br/&gt;
