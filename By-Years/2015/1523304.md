Data centers are the core of modern business environments as computation has
been rapidly moving into the cloud in the last decade. Data centers are among
the fastest growing users of electricity in the U.S. consuming an estimated 91
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2013, about 2% of the total electricity
consumed by the US. It is essential that data centers be operated effectively to
improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Due to aggressive
adoption of cloud-based computing, the demands on data centers are growing
rapidly, and both academia and industry will need to rethink how data centers
are designed, built, and operated to be sustainable. This award will support the
organization of a workshop to bring together industry practitioners, academic
researchers, and government stakeholders to discuss the vision, challenges, and
opportunities for sustainable data center research for the next 5-10 years.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of the workshop has the potential for
broad and transformative impact on the US and beyond by finding new ways to make
better use of energy and natural resources in the nation's computing
infrastructure. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early career scholars and
those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to connect them with
a broad community of academic and industrial researchers interested in data
center sustainability.
