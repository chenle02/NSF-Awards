This research will assess the potential of a new method that tightly sandwiches
nonlinear functions by piecewise linear functions, for efficiently finding
solutions to optimization problems with tight feasibility constraints. A common
class of problems in engineering design requires finding and optimizing
functions that, over an interval, fit between narrowly separated lower and upper
bounds. One typical example considers the components of a load-bearing beam or
wire that has to fit into a narrow space between two existing surfaces and is to
be optimized with respect to stiffness. Currently, such problems require
extensive and expensive trial-and-error human intervention. The new theory and
software tools will automate the search and make the trade-off between
tolerances and computational budget explicit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach
can be used in time-sensitive scenarios, such as interactive geometric design
tools, and is expected to free computational cycles for the additional
engineering objectives such as stiffness, heat conduction, uncertainty, cost or
schedule. On a broader scale, the new tools will effectively extend existing
computational geometry techniques to curved paths and surfaces. Tables, tools
and tutorial examples will be disseminate as a part of the open-source SubLiME
software library. The educational initiative will focus on adjusting the
syllabus of undergraduate numerical computing to increase awareness of
optimization problems; and to teach how to formulate and solve such problems.
Aspects of the research to the general public will be communicated via two
exhibitions featuring engineering analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
