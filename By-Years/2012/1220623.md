This research project is an investigation of the role that examples play in
helping learners become proficient in proving mathematical conjectures.
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin and New York University are building
a framework that characterizes the development of example use as students
advance from middle school into post secondary school. Using this developmental
information, the researchers are creating instructional strategies that help
students think about the nature and value of proof as well as how to construct a
mathematical proof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are interviewing middle
school students, high school students, undergraduate mathematics majors in
college, and practicing mathematicians in order to learn how they use examples
in the process of creating a proof or a deductive argument. They are using
teaching experiments to test various strategies on individual students and to
learn more about students' thinking about the process of proving. They are also
using small group instruction to experiment with instructional strategies and
move closer to a future goal of preparing materials for full class
instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating and understanding mathematical proofs
has always been difficult for students, and yet it is a critical foundation for
developing mathematical understanding. Students often cling to the idea that a
large set of examples is sufficient for proving a conjecture true. This
misconception has often discouraged instructors from using examples in teaching
students to prove conjectures. However, examples can stimulate thinking that
guides a student to construct a proof through valid, deductive reasoning. This
project is advancing understanding of how students learn to prove and providing
tested, instructional strategies that teachers can use to help students.
