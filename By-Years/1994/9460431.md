This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is concerned with the
research and development of a hand-held biosensor based on immunoassay
principles. Currently available immunoassay methodologies require sophisticated
equipment and trained laboratory personnel, and can take up to six hours to
complete. Hawaii Biotechnology Group, Inc. proposes to develop a simple device
which can be used in locations ranging from a sophisticated laboratory to `in
the field`. The assay system will be based on standard ELISA technology
performed in a capillary tube, followed by electrochemical analysis. Capillary
modification, immunoreagent generation, and detection methodology will be
demonstrated. Further refinements of the device such as prefilter construction
are expected to increase the specificity of the device. Optimization of the
various components, will be pursued. As a result of the dimensions of the
capillaries used, low level detection is expected. The total assay time is
expected to take 30 minutes and be performed in a semi-automated fashion. For
commercial reasons we are targeting dengue viral diagnostics as our initial
device.
