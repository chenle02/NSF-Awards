Abstract 9528122 Bieber This project uses neutron monitors to measure the flux
of low energy cosmic rays arriving at the top of the atmosphere to: Increase the
understanding of the acceleration and transport of solar cosmic rays; to
identify the mechanisms underlying transient cosmic ray variations; to determine
the causes of solar variations; to describe the nature of turbulence in the
solar wind; and to derive information on large-scale structure in the plasma
which permeates the solar system. This research will be using detectors at South
Pole, McMurdo and on the USCG icebreaker which comes to McMurdo each year. The
ship allows a latitudinal survey of cosmic ray fluxes. ***
