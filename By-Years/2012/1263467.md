The objective of this project is to use a structured hypothesis-validation
approach to identify and mitigate multiple knowledge gaps in technology
transition of the natural fiber reinforced composites, including value
proposition; customer/user-case; demand creation; channel development; revenue
model; partnership strategy; and resource development. Scientific advances for
this research include 1) the systematic study of processing structural- property
relationship of high performance natural fiber reinforced composites; 2) the
transformative investigation of high performance natural fiber composites
processing mechanism in production scale for structural applications. The
combination of forefront material synthesis methods with advanced
characterization and testing technology could provide a foundation for both
understanding and processing of natural fiber reinforced composites with
excellent mechanical and structural properties.

The new class of natural fiber reinforced composites with robust mechanical
properties could play a significant role in addressing current energy and
sustainability challenges. With excellent mechanical properties, these bio-based
composites could provide a sustainable solution to replace chemically treated
wood and petroleum based (fiberglass) composites in many applications, such as
civil infrastructure constructions; building panels and automobile parts. If
successful, this program may result in technology transition of natural fiber
reinforced composites, and increase economic and workforce development in the
nation.
