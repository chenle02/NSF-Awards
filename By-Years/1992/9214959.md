This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. The research project will develop and provide a hierarchic
geographic information system (HGIS) for data storage and manipulation in a
collaborative interdisciplinary research program in the Arctic known as the
ARCSS FLUX Program. This study will investigate linkages between snow,
hydrology, soil processes and biogeochemistry, and vegetation. It will include
information obtained by researchers studying small plots on the ground and
remotely sensed data obtained from aircraft. The HGIS capability in conjunction
with other modeling technologies and techniques will be used to evaluate arctic
system processes, patterns, and the scaling of those factors.
