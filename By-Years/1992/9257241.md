This award supports on-going research efforts on interactive computational
models which incorporate both randomness and nondeterminism in novel ways. A
fundamental goal of the work is to address what is probably the major open
problem in computer science: how randomness and nondeterminism help in
computation. Representative problems in this area are stochastic games, automata
theory and random walks on graphs. Stochastic games model a large class of
problems in optimization called decision problems under uncertainty. Finite
state automata are studied with both nondeterministic and random states in order
to understand the difference between such models and their deterministic
counterparts. New questions about random walks have been formulated on graphs
that are partly controlled by an adversary; in our scenario edges of the graph
are colored and the adversary can control the walk by specifying which color
edge is followed at a given step. Further this award supports ongoing research
regarding the need for a more realistic theory of parallel computation. The
design and implementation of algorithms on parallel machines is combined with
analysis of these algorithms on realistic models. Two algorithmic paradigms will
be restudied: dynamic programming and branch and bound. Emphasis will be on
applications of dynamic programming to problems in DNA sequence analysis and of
branch and bound algorithms to problems in combinatorial optimization. Also a
new look is taken at what it means for a problem to be ``inherently
sequential''.
