Preceding studies have shown that wave-induced anomalous ion heating is
occuring in the Caltech Encore toroidal plasma facility. Wave-induced anomalous
ion heating is not well understood and yet has applicability to plasmas in many
domains, ranging from laboratory to astrophysical. The next experiment will use
advanced plasma diagnostic techniques to determine the physical phenomena
underlying this basic process. The special features of this approach are the
following: (i) the plasma has a confined geometry free of end-walls, is highly
reproducible over a large range of parameters, and has a unique high repetition
rate; and (ii) an advanced diagnostic system (including Laser Induced
Fluorescence) is now available with exceptional space and time resolution, full
computer automation, and the ability to follow the evolution of particle and
waves with the required detail. This program seeks to exploit this conjunction
of technology and physics to obtain a fundamental understanding of how two basic
aspects of plasmas -- particle and wave -- interact.
