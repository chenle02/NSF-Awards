9315122 French This award supports the participation of nine U.S. scientists and
engineers in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Structural Performance of High- Strength
Concrete in Seismic Regions, scheduled for November 1994 in Honolulu, Hawaii.
The seminar is co-organized by Professor Catherine French, Department of Civil
and Mineral Engineering, University of Minnesota, and Professor Fumio Watanabe,
Department of Architectural Engineering, Kyoto University. In addition to the
U.S. and Japanese participants, scientists from Australia, Canada, and New
Zealand, are expected to attend. A large quantity and variety of test data on
high-strength reinforced concrete has become available through recent test
programs conducted in the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway.
These data include information on material development, structural performance,
and construction procedures. The seminar will focus on the design and
performance of high-strength reinforced concrete structures located in seismic
regions. Participants will exchange recently acquired data, evaluate the data,
and develop rational design recommendations. In the process, deficiencies in the
database and future research needs may be identified.
