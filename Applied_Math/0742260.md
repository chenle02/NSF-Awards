This award supports participation in the International Conference on Hyperbolic
Problems: Theory, Numerics & Applications, to be held at the University of
Maryland, College Park, in June 2008.

The conference, the twelfth meeting in a bi-annual series, brings together
researchers, students, and practitioners with interest in the theoretical,
computational, and applied aspects of hyperbolic time-dependent problems. Topics
of the conference include the study of nonlinear wave patterns in multiple
dimensions, passage from microscopic to macroscopic in models for particle
dynamics, theory and simulation of interfaces, and application of transport
theory in complex environments including scattering in random media, biological
applications, and traffic flow.

The organizers encourage participation by junior researchers and members of
groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The meeting provides an
excellent opportunity for junior and senior participants to exchange ideas and
to learn about recent research in emerging areas of theory, application, and
numerical simulation connected with nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations.
Conference proceedings will be published.
