This project will improve our understanding of the "European Unemployment
Problem". Many economists have reported that there have been persistent
differences between the U.S. and a group of Eurpean countries in unemployment
since about 1970. Unemployment has been substantially higher in Europe than in
the U.S., and many scholars have suggested that this difference is due to how
European labor market institutions handled the global economic shocks of the
1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, looking at employment rates rather than
unemployment rates tells a different story. The difference between the U.S. and
Europe does not first appear in the 1970s, but appears to persist throughout the
post-WWII period. The cause appears to be the differential evolution of the
service sector employment rate, which has grown in the US while remaining
largely stable in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
determine the role of various factors in creating this difference. The PI will
conduct further data analysis to better document the differences across
economies, he will develop theoretical models to study how employment in
different sectors of the economy has changed over time, and he will use the
models to evaluate how factors such as taxes, productivity, and unionization can
account for the differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will therefore
improve our fundamental understanding of labor market outcomes and how policy
decisions shape employment rates.
