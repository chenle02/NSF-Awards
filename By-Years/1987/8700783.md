Peter Li and Andrejs Treibergs both have very strong research reputations
arising from their work in partial differential equations. The techniques they
have been using have proved very powerful in the study of manifolds. In the
current project Professor Li will continue his investigations into the effect of
curvature on the space of harmonic functions on a manifold. More specifically he
will study the underlying geometry via estimates of the first eigenvalue of the
Laplacian. Professor Treibergs will work on problems concerned with the
realization of surfaces with prescribed curvature. In particular he will try to
establish existence results under integral conditions weaker than those
previously employed.
