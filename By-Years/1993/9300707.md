9300707 Smith The present research program is for providing laboratory data for
atomic and molecular collision processes that occur in the earth's upper
atmopshere. Even though collisions have been studied for decades, many of those
needed for atmospheric modeling have not been investigated. In those instances
where laboratory studies have been performed, the data taken have often been
those of most interest to the atomic and molecular physicist, rather than those
of greatest use to the atmospheric modeler. In particular there is a need for
accurate total cross section data for atmospheric species in the collision
energy range relevant to the atmosphere. These data are required for modeling
the atmosphere's response to precipitation of energetic particles in the auroral
zones and for understanding the behavior of the upper ionosphere. This program
directly addresses this need. Specifically, the researchers propose to continue
experiments on electron impact ionization of molecules and collisions of keV-
energy O,O+,H,H+,He and He+ with atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen. ***
