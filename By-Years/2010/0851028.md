The oxidation of sulfide minerals plays an important role along the seafloor in
the energetics of redox-dependent organisms, and is a significant chemical
pathway for the cycling of transition metals and sulfur from oceanic crust to
seawater. In addition, in situ pulverization and mining of seafloor sulfide
deposits create large amounts of reactive sulfide mineral grain surfaces whose
rapid oxidation generates local acidity, potentially affecting sensitive oceanic
biota. Thus, determining rates of sulfide mineral oxidation in seawater has
merit to improve our understanding of these processes. In this project, a
scientist from the University of California-Riverside would investigate the
rates of abiotic oxidation of pyrite and chalcopyrite in synthetic seawater over
a range of relevant chemical and physical conditions through the use of initial-
rate batch reactors and longer-term mixed-flow reactors. This research would
provide insight into (1) the quantitative effects of mineral surface area, pH,
salinity, temperature and oxidant concentrations on rates of oxidation; (2) the
nature and stability of the oxidation products; and (3) whether the mineral
surface oxidation reactions limit the actual dissolution rates seen in nature.
Results from this research would also enhance scientists? abilities to model and
interpret data on sulfide oxidation in other geologic and geochemical settings
than is currently possible. One African American graduate student and one Native
American undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this
project.
