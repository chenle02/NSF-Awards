In Drosophila embryos, salivary glands arise from a thickened placode of cells
in the ventral part of the labial segment. After the placode forms, its cells
are invaginated to form a simple tubular gland. Within three hours the cells of
the gland are already differentiated and producing abundant, secreted products.
This simple example of organogenesis provides opportunities to examine the
interaction between genes that establish the overall pattern of the embryo and
those that direct tissue specific development. Dr. Beckendorf's experiments have
focussed on the role of embryonic pattern forming genes in choosing the location
of the salivary placodes and initiation salivary gland development. The goal of
the current proposal is to identify additional genes that act downstream from
the pattern forming genes to direct the morphogenesis and differentiation of the
glands. Three independent approaches will be used to identify these new genes:
analyzing enhancer trap lines, screening deficiency mutant embryos for salivary
defects, and searching for downstream targets of the transcription factor
encoded by the for head gene. These methods should identify a new set of genes
that will help him characterize specific steps in salivary development. Because
of the short time between initial determination and differentiation, he hopes
eventually to identify many, if not all, of the intervening steps in salivary
development.
