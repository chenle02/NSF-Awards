This SBIR Phase II project is to develop a simple and robust on-line technique
for measurement of solids loading and gas flow rate of gas-solid mixtures. The
technique employs an extended throat venturimeter for which the pressure drop
across the throat and the pressure recovery across the diffuser are measured.
The research includes experimental testing of such a venturimeter for air at
ambient conditions over a range of gas velocities, solids loadings, and particle
sizes. Numerical modelling of this two-phase flow will provide a framework for
predicting the performance of the device and extending its operation to
different conditions. A simple, robust device of the type being developed is
needed for on-line monitoring and control of gas-solids processes, especially
under conditions of high temperatures, high pressures, and high solids
concentrations. The device may find use in any number of coal or minerals
processing applications.
