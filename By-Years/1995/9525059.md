9525059 Waite This is an award to support research, the objective of which is to
determine the parameters for design of electron beam radiation processes to
treat wastewater and intermediate products of treatment system components.
Specific examples of research to be investigated include use of ionizing
radiation of the electron beam for modification of process residuals to improve
their biodegradability when subjected to aerobic and anaerobic digestion,
processing of anaerobic digester supernatant fluids to improve their
biodegradability and to reduce their disruptive effect when recycled to the
treatment system for additional exposure to biotreatment processes, improvement
of sludge dewaterability by modification of their fluid properties and
acceleration of biostabilization processes such as composting and soil
injection. The project involves an initial workshop to be conducted in January
of 1997 conducted in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency for
guidance in conduct of the pilot and engineering-scale research. Electron beam
radiation has been found to be effective in disinfection of sludges produced
during treatment of domestic wastewater. The ionizing radiation of a beam of
energized electrons has been shown to be effective in destruction of organic
compounds of pollutional significance. Indications are that electron beam
radiation could be utilized productively within existing wastewater treatment
plants to improve the efficiency of other treatment system components. This
project will utilize an existing 1.5 MeV electron beam accelerator located at
the Miami-Dade Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia Key to obtain engineering-
design parameters. This engineering-scale operation will be guided by results
from pilot-scale research using a 4 MeV linear accelerator being installed at
the University of Miami's Laboratory for Pollution Control Technologies. ***
