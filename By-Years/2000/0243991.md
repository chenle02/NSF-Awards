This award supports a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site that will be a part of the National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN)
established by NSF in 1994. The REU Site will provide a ten week summer research
experience at each of the member institutions for 12 student participants per
year at Cornell University; 10 student participants per year at the University
of California Santa Barbara; 8 student participants per year at Penn State
University; 6 student participants per year at Howard University; and 12 student
participants per year at Stanford University. Students are recruited from
colleges and universities throughout the United States with a focus on
sophomore-level and junior-level students and with an effort to attract students
from smaller non-research universities and students from underrepresented
groups. The program provides students with an opportunity to do research in the
fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Students will work on independent
research projects using the advanced fabrication resources available through the
NNUN with opportunities for research collaboration with faculty and students at
each of the five-member NNUN institutions. This REU Site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.
