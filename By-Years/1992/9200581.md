Adams Recent research has revealed that the minimax and least- squares
optimality criteria are inappropriate for many digital signal processing
applications. Minimax and least-squares optimization problems are subsets of a
more general (and much more important) class of problems which are referred to
as peak- constrained least-squares (PCLS) optimization problems. PCLS solutions
are needed for many digital signal processing applications, but PCLS research is
still in its infancy. The objective of this research is to develop new concepts
in digital signal processing that are based on PCLS optimization. Techniques
from the theory of mathematical programming are being used as the basis for this
research. Three categories of design algorithms are being developed: 1. new
multiple exchange algorithms; 2. extensions of conventional quadratic
programming algorithms; and 3. extensions of Lawson's algorithm.
