Measurements of acoustic wave propagation beneath the seafloor provide critical
data for understanding the physical properties of marine sediments and crustal
rock. Such information can be used to examine the composition and alteration of
such material. Historically, most studies investigating the acoustic properties
have used either seismic or laboratory techniques. Although useful, such data is
often inaccurate for extrapolating to significant depth in the sea-floor. With
the advent of sonic logging in the Ocean Drilling Program, some high-resolution
acoustic data has become available. Because of the complexity of lithology,
structure, geometry and available equipment, most measurements have only been
able to determine compressional wave variations. The present project would adapt
and modify for use on the JOIDES Resolution available industry equipment for
measuring shear wave velocities and waveforms. This in situ data can be combined
with routinely measured compressional velocities to completely characterize the
acoustic properties of drilled sediments. The principal investigator is a
promising young scientist who is fully qualified to undertake the proposed
project. This award represents his first NSF research support.
