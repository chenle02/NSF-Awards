The Geology Department is purchasing equipment for use in an atomic absorption
laboratory. This facility significantly improves the training of students in
various geochemistry and hydrogeology courses in the undergraduate curriculum.
In courses in hydrology and environmental geochemistry, students learn to use
this equipment as part of comprehensive water sampling and analysis projects.
Students in mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry courses make use of this
instrument in the analysis of rocks and minerals; these analyses complement
existing equipment (electron microprobe and x-ray diffractometer). Students in
lower-level courses, and in related upper-level courses, benefit from
demonstrations and/or supervised use in limited laboratory projects. In
addition, this equipment is made available for student research related to
independent study and Senior Thesis projects, and is available to students in
other departments through cooperation with CMU's interdepartmental Water Studies
Center.
