The study will involve the use of oxygen and carbon isotopes of foraminifera to
reconstruct the history of climates, polar ice sheets, and oceanic conditions
during the last few million years of Earth's history. The research will focus on
the role of Antarctic climates in causing oceanographic changes that have
resulted in evolutionary changes in the microfauna and microflora. The research
will have an impact on the understanding of past and future carbon dioxide
changes in the Earth's atmosphere.
