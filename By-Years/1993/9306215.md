This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant, made in the Chemistry Division
will allow Dr. Macklin to gather preliminary results and develop a research
proposal dealing with the development of a technique for assay and chemical
studies of aqueous biological substances by microscopic Raman electrochemical
spectroscopy. The technique involves making micro-Raman measurements on
extremely small quantities of biological materials adsorbed onto a
microelectrode. The effect of variables such as solute concentration, electrode
surface,electrode potential, electrode material, pH, and excitation intensity
and frequency on Raman intensity will be studied. %%% This microchemical Raman
spectrochemical technique could lead to the development of biosensors for the
assay of extremely small concentrations of amino acids and small polypeptides,
