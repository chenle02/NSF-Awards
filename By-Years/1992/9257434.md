Tricia A. Ferrett (Carleton College), is the recipient of A NSF Young
Investigator award for studies in Experimental Physical Chemistry. Her project
involves the use of synchrotron radiation to induce fragmentation of small
molecules by excitation of their core electrons. Prof. Ferrett will assemble a
time-of-flight mass spectrometer and timing circuitry to permit simultaneous
detection and energy characterization of two or more fragmentation products. By
controlling the incident photon energy and the type of molecule to be
irradiated, Prof. Ferrett will elucidate systematic features of fragmentation
pathways. This is important because excitation of core electrons as a starting
point for fragmentation leads to different pathways than those activated by low
energy photons, and detailed knowledge of the new pathways translates to an
improved understanding of chemical bonds in general. %%% Prof. Tricia A. Ferrett
(Carleton College), will use X-rays to induce small molecules to fall apart. By
measuring simultaneously the energies of several fragments, Prof. Ferrett will
develop an increased understanding of the detailed way in which the absorption
of the X-rays leads to molecular disruption. Particular molecules to be studied
are of general importance in the chemistry of the atmosphere and chemistry at
catalytic surfaces.
