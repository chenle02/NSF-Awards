This award will provide support for participants to attend "Deep Learning for
Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA): Real-Time Discovery at Scale", a three-day
workshop that will be held October 17-19, 2018 at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. The purpose of the workshop is to catalyze the creation of a
community whose expertise is at the interface of two of NSF's 10 Big Ideas:
Harnessing the Data Revolution and Windows on the Universe. Domain experts
attending this event will inform the design of a roadmap of future
collaborations to accelerate convergence between these two disparate frontiers
of science and technology to fully realize MMA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
