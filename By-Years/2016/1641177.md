The Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS)
program is an undergraduate-to-graduate bridge program designed to broaden
participation in the atmospheric and related sciences. The program is built
around research, mentoring, community and multi-year ongoing support for
underrepresented students. This proposal will continue to provide genuine
research opportunities, mentoring, community and personal guidance for the next
generation of leaders in the atmospheric and related sciences. The students will
be involved in field campaigns, taught to produce peer-reviewed journal
publishing, training in scientific computing and data science, and provided
student support. The SOARS program will be expanded to other institutions to
increase the number of students within the geosciences and STEM disciplines.
