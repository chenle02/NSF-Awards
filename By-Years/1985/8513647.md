Group travel support is provided for the Fourth International Conference on
Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for Chemical Process Design. The travel
funds will allow 16 US academic and industrial researchers to reach the
conference site. Those supported include eight invited presenters of papers and
eight young research workers. The first three conferences have produced highly
desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government workers in
this vital area for chemical process design and simulation. The meetings have
also become the most important gatherings for workers in this field from all
over the world. Finally, each conference has produced important collections of
papers in their proceedings.
