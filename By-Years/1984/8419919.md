The phenomena of restricted diffusion and partitioning of large molecules in
assemblages of spheres is studied. Past investigations have used porous media
which contain only cylindrical pores. However, porous media of interest to many
engineering applications is better represented as assemblages of uniform
spheres. Uniform silica spheres with diameters of 40 to 200 nm have been
fabricated. Further, spheres have been compacted at four pressures, resulting in
pellets with a mean pore size ranging from 8 to 96 nm. Due to the sphere
uniformity and the known surface chemistry of silica, these pellets are ideal
porous media models. Diffusion coefficients for a number of macromolecules in
several solvents are measured in the project using pellets of varying
porosity/sphere size. Since the observed partitioning effect is due to both size
exclusion and adsorption, adsorption measurements on uncompacted spheres are
made. This allows the 'backing out' of the relationship between the
molecule/pore size ratio and the partition coefficient. This is compared to a
partitioning theory that is developed and past experimental and theoretical
expressions arising from work with cylindrical pores.
