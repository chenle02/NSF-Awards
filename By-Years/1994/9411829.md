9411829 Shapiro, Lynda P. This project, conducted by the Oregon Institute of
Marine Biology, will provide for institutional planning activities. The facility
has undergone a recent expansion, resulting in a doubling of resident faculty,
an even greater increase in support staff, and a four-fold increase in active
research programs. The expansion has also resulted in augmentation of graduate
program, and increased use of laboratory facilities by visitors. The increase in
active, funded research programs has carried with it an increase need for
reliability in support of these programs. Specifically, the project will aim to
develop a logical Long- Range Planning Document that will allow the institution
to plan and articulate a program based on new and innovative ways to support and
promote research and education. The Document will guide future growth, and allow
the use of existing space more efficiently and appropriately relative to plans
for growth. There will be two inter-related aspects: 1) As a prerequisite to
long-range facilities planning, faculty and staff, with the aid of a
Facilitator, will develop a long-range Plan for Research and Education at OIMB.
This plan will articulate the needs and expectations of new faculty, and will
document a guideline for future growth. 2) The Facilities Plan will be based on
a thorough study of present needs and future plans, and architectural studies of
all buildings. The product will be recommendations for more efficient use of
space and further recommendations based on improved laboratory safety and
access, with cost estimates and prioritization of recommendations.
