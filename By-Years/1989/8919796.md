The cerebellum is a part of the brain that is involved in maintaining
equilibrium and coordinating movement. Specifically, it is involved in
synchronizing the activity of various muscle groups. This function is
accomplished in part by neurons within the cerebellum called local circuit
neurons whose structure and function are poorly understood. The intent of this
research project is to study the cellular physiology and synaptic circuits of
two nerve cells (Purkinje cells and basket cells) that contribute to local
circuits within the cerebellum. A greater knowledge of this physiological and
anatomical organization of cerebellar circuits will provide a basis for
understanding how these circuits control movement.
