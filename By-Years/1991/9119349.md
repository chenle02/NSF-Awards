The overall objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of
the evolution of a family of "jumping genes" called "P elements" in Drosophila
fruit flies, with particular emphasis on the mode and frequency of mating-
independent, horizontal transfer of these elements between evolutionary lineages
of the flies. One major focus is to investigate whether a species of parasitic
mites can act as a vector for interspecific transfer of P element genetic
material. A second major focus is the comparison of P elements from a
representative sample of Drosophila species, in order to study the frequency and
pattern of P element transfer during the evolution of this family of flies. The
methods to be employed rely heavily on modern molecular genetic techniques.
Mixed species population cages will be used for the study of interspecies
transfer. The proposed work has potential significance for better understanding
the origin and evolution of jumping genes and the evolutionary significance of
horizontal transfer. It may also provide fascinating new insights into molecular
coevolutionary relationships between parasites and their hosts.
