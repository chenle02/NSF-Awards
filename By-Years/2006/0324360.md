Studies of the circulation and energetics of the California Current System (CCS)
off central and southern California will be carried using the extensive set of
ocean current measurements from shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler
(ADCP) observations made on the quarterly cruises of the California Cooperative
Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) from 1993 to 2003, together with
additional measurements including hydrography, surface drifters, and satellite
altimetry. By exploiting the sampling strengths of the various datasets,
features of the circulation will be revealed that are not resolved by most
historical measurements. The significance of these features can also be
ascertained due to the repeated nature of the sampling. This proposal will focus
on addressing three questions about the CCS off southern and central California
for which direct velocity observations are essential: 1) the seasonal and inter-
annual variability of the flow at 500 m (the traditional zero velocity surface
used by most hydrographic studies of the region); 2) the structure and dynamics
of the Undercurrent, the Southern California Eddy and the variable inshore
flows, and their role in the heat and nutrient budgets of the CCS; and 3) the
mesoscale eddy field, its seasonal and inter-annual variability, its energetics,
and its role in establishing property distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
