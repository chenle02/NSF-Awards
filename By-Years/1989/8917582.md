The hypersensitive response of plant cells to pathogenic microbes and viruses
is a rapid, local necrosis accompanied by transcriptional activation of defense
genes. These phenomena are the primary bases for disease resistance in higher
plants, yet the host-pathogen recognition process that initiates them is not
understood. The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the biochemical
events that trigger the hypersensitive response of tobacco to Pseudomonas
syringae pv. syringae. Previous work has shown that initiation of
hypersensitivity is marked by the activation of a plasma membrane
potassium/proton exchange. Recent work by the applicants suggests that the
exchange and hypersensitive responses are induced via a transmembrane signal
transduction pathway that includes a calcium influx mechanism. They have also
identified a GTPase that is associated with plasma membranes isolated during the
hypersensitive response. The specific objectives of this research are to purify
and characterize the plasma membrane GTPase and to determine whether it
functions as a G-protein in the proposed signaling pathway. The possibility that
phospholipase activation is required for induction of the hypersensitive
response and, if so, how this relates to calcium influx and the plasma membrane
GTPase will also be investigated. The experimental system is well developed and
includes plasma membranes isolated by two-phase aqueous partitioning, a tobacco
suspension-culture system, and Tn5- induced bacterial mutants that do not induce
the potassium/proton exchange or hypersensitive responses. The results of this
research will enhance our understanding of the biochemical signaling events that
follow a plant's recognition of a microbial pathogen that subsequently gives
rise to the plant hypersensitive response. This knowledge may facilitate the
development of new mechanisms to promote disease resistance in crop plants. This
work will also contribute to our fundamental understanding of signal
transduction and plasma membrane biochemistry in plants.
