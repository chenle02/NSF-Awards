9711914 Alfano A two day workshop entitled Advanced in Optical Biopsy and
Optical Mammography occurred April 24-25, 1997 at the City University of New
York Graduate Center. The meeting was jointly organized by the New York Academy
of Science and the New York State Center for Advanced Technology in Ultrafast
Photonic Materials and Applications at the City University of New York. The goal
of the symposium is to advance the understanding and development of biomedical
instrumentation for optical methods of cancer detection. Optical biopsy and
mammography are promising new techniques for determining whether or not a tissue
is cancerous without using invasive techniques. An analysis of the spectrum of
light emitted from optically excited tissue allows investigators to detect
physical and chemical changes in tissue and determine if the tissue is normal,
benign, or cancerous. Because they are minimally invasive, and use non-ionizing
radiation to detect diseases with high sensitivity and accuracy, these new
techniques may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Funding from
the Foundation defrayed partial travel expenses for the U.S. participants who
prepared and delivered scientific presentations at the meeting where
approximately 80 persons attended. Information presented at the conference is to
be disseminated in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, thereby
making the results of the meeting available to a wide audience. ***
