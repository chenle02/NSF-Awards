Most multicellular organisms, like humans, form from a single cell. By contrast,
the social amoeba forms a multicellular body by aggregating individual cells
from a small area. This difference allows the investigators to evaluate genetic
conflicts within an organism more easily than if they had to find new mutations.
The investigators will characterize the genetic variation in cells in a natural
habitat, and will then investigate how these cells interact when they come
together in a multicellular individual. They will evaluate how often some cell
lines dominate over other cell lines, forcing them to die.

How cells interact with each other is an important question that bears on many
fundamental problems in biology. For example, cells that escape the control of
other cells and continue to divide characterize cancer. Programmed cell death is
an important mechanism for ridding an organism of cells in the wrong place or
that have certain kinds of defects. When the social amoeba forms a fruiting
body, some cells die while others live. Understanding the process whereby some
cells escape the process of programmed cell death, and perhaps force other cells
to die is of potential relevance to mechanisms for understanding cancer, and
human developmental diseases.
