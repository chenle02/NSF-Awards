This award will develop foundations for autonomous airborne robotics, ultimately
to be based on the cloud. This work has the potential to develop new frameworks
and theories for distributed autonomy in networked vehicular networks/systems.
The development of novel solutions for robust decision making in vehicular
networks in conjunction with airborne autonomous systems has the potential to
greatly improve the safety and quality of life of human users.

Three research directions will be investigated over the duration of this
project: (i) co-optimization of cyber-physical elements, (ii) autonomy tasks and
(iii) cloud platform. The fundamental research will focus on the concrete
example of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), whereby including all three research
thrusts. This project aims to study airborne cloud-based autonomy in networked
road surveillance networks, i.e., to perform complex tasks relating to
perception, planning, and learning.
