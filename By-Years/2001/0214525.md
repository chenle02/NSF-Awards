This award is to analyze sediments from Lake Bosumtwi to generate a record of
tropical West African hydrologic variability back to 3000 years with decadal
resolution. In addition, the first tropical record of atmospheric radiocarbon
change between 10,000 and 25,000 years will be
produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous field work has secured laminated core
material back to about 25,000 years at Lake Bosumtwi. A variety of proxy
indicators of climate will be analyzed from these sediments to produce a
paleohydrologic time series. Charcoal from terrestrial plants will be dated from
the varved layers to generate a D14C calibration curve for radiometric dating.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timing of droughts and the natural variability of
droughts to this region (West Africa) are important. Better understanding of how
the hydrologic history of the region relates to similar records from other
regions will advance our overall knowledge of the climate system and allow us to
answer many questions regarding interrelationships between low and high latitude
and marine and terrestrial climate interactions. The true shape of the
atmospheric radiocarbon variation during glacial to deglacial times will be an
important advancement for radiocarbon dating.
