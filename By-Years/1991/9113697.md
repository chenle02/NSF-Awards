This award establishes a new ion beam facility which will be used to address
issues in materials research at the University of Pennsylvania. A unique
opportunity exists to apply ion scattering to a variety of exciting materials
problems, some of which involve new kinds of experiments which advance the
state-of-the-art ion scattering techniques. A major aspect of this research is
the determination of chemical composition and its variation near interfaces and
in thin films. This new ion beam facility extends across a wide range of
research programs, which include studies of the distribution of dopants in near-
surface regions of polymer based electrolytes and conducting polymers, the
composition profile across interfaces in polymers (welding) and at polymer
surfaces (adhesion, surface, modification), the progression of the
transformation of thin films of polymer precursors to boron-based ceramics,
epitaxial growth of thin layers (metal, silicide, and metal on ceramic),
hydrogen on and near the surface of metals, and surface and interface studies of
surface active impurities in metals and ceramics (interface embrittlement).
