Visualization tools are being developed to allow the scientists, teachers and
students to view and manipulate representations of the ocean floor directly on
the screens of their desktop computers. Many different types of pictures can be
examined, including maps, perspective views, pseudocolor imagery, shaded relief
diagrams and 3-D stereograms. The raw data from which the views are created
include bathymetry from multibeam and phase intererometric sonars and
backscatter from side-looking sonars. Using electronic communication over
Internet, the users connect from their computer (the server) into a client
computer at Columbia University to begin the visualization session. The client
returns to the user with menus and dialog boxes for the purpose of selecting the
display type, map boundaries, color tables, fonts, data files, etc.. Moments
later the representation appears in a window on the user's screen with
computations run in the client computer. The user, given a responsive, intuitive
and interactive interface, is liberated from the chores of locating and
maintaining large complex databases and software code. The users find their work
accelerated by an immediate response to a query and by a greater depth of
understanding from advanced graphic representations of very large datasets.
