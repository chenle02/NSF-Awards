Professor Shafer is developing a foundation for probability that accommodates
the diversity of its uses in the normative and descriptive sciences. This
foundation goes against the grain of established interpretations of probability,
but it revives many older insights. It incorporates insights from pure
mathematics, where the fundamental role of martingales and filtrations in the
theory of stochastic processes is well recognized, as well as insights from
applied statistics, where the appeal of conditional methods has conflicted with
the established interpretations. The basic idea of Professor Shafer's study is
that probability should be founded not on measure theory but on the classical
picture of a fair game of chance, where probabilities are simultaneously fair
prices, reasonable degrees of belief, and, in some cases, long-run frequencies.
The applications of probability are diverse because there are many ways of
relating practical problems to this classical picture. Professor Shafer's
approach to probability implies a new understanding of statistical models. These
models no longer represent merely frequencies or merely beliefs. Instead, they
represent a relation between certain facts about the long-run and the knowledge
of the observer. The project involves several different kinds of research.
Alternate axiomatizations of the classical picture need to be explored and a
variety of theoretical issues in statistics need to be related to the proposed
new foundation. The ideas need to be related to the historical development of
probability and to established debates about the meaning of probability in
statistics and science. This project promises contributions to the foundations
of probability important both for philosophy of science and for mathematicians
interested in probability and statistics.
