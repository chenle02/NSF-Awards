This workshop on molecular modeling will bring together students and researchers
from the United States, the Czech Republic and Poland. The proposed meeting will
focus on a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field that brings together
important areas such as computational chemistry, materials science,
biotechnology, solid state physics, and molecular graphics. The co-organizers of
the workshop are Dr. Jerzy Leszczynski from Jackson State University, Jaroslaw
Burda from Charles University in the Czech Republic and Waclaw Sokalski from
Wroclaw University of Technology in Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
objective of the meeting is to establish an interdisciplinary forum where
leading experts representing recently emerging methodologies will meet with
scientists interested in their applications in biological and material sciences.
Minority students and post-docs from Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU) will be invited to makes presentations at this workshop.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a timely meeting on a rapidly progressing field of
research in computational chemistry that also contains an aspect of student
training, as this is not an area traditionally taught in the graduate school
curriculum. This project also fulfills the program objectives of bringing
together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
