At Misericordia, Discrete Mathematics is a core course which involves the
innovative approach of the mathematical programming language ISETL to teach
according to a Piagetian- based theory on how students learn advanced
mathematical ideas. The institution has also been utilizing a new approach for
teaching Calculus which was developed by Dubinsky and Schwingendorf of Purdue
University. Under this project, these computer-based innovations are being
extended into Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations,
Numerical Analysis, and Statistics. The addition of PC terminal capabilities
have made these curricular improvements possible.
