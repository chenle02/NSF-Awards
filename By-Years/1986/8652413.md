Professor McGervey and a staff of three master secondary school physics teachers
will offer an intensive three-week course of instruction focusing on topics in
physics and physical science. The instructional format includes lectures,
laboratory work, and group discussions. During the following academic year,
Prof. McGervey will visit each participant in his or her home school. In
addition, there will be monthly meetings of all project participants held at
various locations throughout northern Ohio and a full weekend program at Case
Western Reserve University. The participants will be 25 middle school and high
school physics or physical science teachers. They will be selected from among a
significant number of physics teachers in northern Ohio who need upgrading in
their knowledge of fundamental principles of mechanics, wave motion, optics,
thermal physics, electricity and magnetism, and nuclear radiation. The
evaluation plan calls for (1) subject matter testing of the participants (2)
questionnaires exploring the opinions of participants about the match between
their needs and program emphases; (3) questionnaires administered at the end of
the project year that evaluates the project's impact on the participant's
students; (4) evaluations by supervisors of the participants. The program is
well designed and has produced numerous satisfied customers during the past two
years.
