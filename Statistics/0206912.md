The objective of the proposed 5-day international conference is to highlight
the major trends in several areas of nonparametric statistics. Among the areas
included are: smoothing methods, functional data analysis, data mining,
nonparametric model building, nonparametric inference, resampling, spatial
statistics, computation statistics, high dimensional data, dependent data, and
censored data. The application areas feature medical research, bioinformatics,
analysis of microarray data, analysis of evolutionary data, cancer research,
AIDS and HIV research. To achieve this goal the members of the organizing
committee were selected with the idea of having as complete a representation of
the important trends in nonparametric statistics as possible. Indeed the
committee consists of some top people in the field. More information can be
found in http://www.psu.edu/~npconf/. By bringing together researchers from the
USA and Europe, the conference is expected to facilitate the exchange of
research ideas, promote collaboration and contribute to further development of
the field. New researchers have been encouraged to attend with preference being
given to them-as well as members of the underrepresented groups-for support. Six
issues (one volume) of the Journal of Nonparametric Statistics have been made
available to host papers that will be presented in the conference with the
conference organizers serving as guest editors.
