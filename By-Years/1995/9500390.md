9500390 Patterson This award supports a new concept in precision metrology, the
Extreme Ultraviolet Optics Measuring Machine (EUVOMM). The goals for this system
when used to measure optical surfaces are a diameter range of 250 mm with a
lateral accuracy of 3.3 nm rms, and a depth range of 7.5 mm with a depth
accuracy of 0.33 nm rms. This can be achieved using design and integration of
several precision engineering and optical technologies: precise motion control,
reduction of systematic errors in heterodyne interferometry, and atomic force
microscopy as the sensing probe. The tasks supported by this award are: system
optimization, study of the scaling of elastic mechanisms, and implementation of
the analysis results in an experimental high-precision slide drive system. This
work will complement, and is in part be supported by, work at Lawrence Livermore
Lab's Manufacturing Technologies Program. This research will provide the
technical basis for fabrication and testing of diffraction limited optical
systems operating in the ultraviolet or soft x-ray region. This will lead to a
new generation of instruments for research and fabrication in the semiconductor
industry. ***
