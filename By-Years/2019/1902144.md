Certain types of highly symmetric algebraic structures, such as quadratic forms
and division algebras, have been ubiquitous in mathematics and its applications,
playing important roles in such diverse fields as multiple-antenna wireless
communications, efficient representations of spatial rotations, gauge symmetries
of theoretical physics, and Galois representations in number theory. While our
understanding of these structures has become quite rich, many fundamental
questions still remain. This project will employ and develop new tools from the
rapidly growing field of arithmetic geometry to deepen our understanding of
these algebraic structures. The principal investigator will be involved in the
training of students and the organization of conferences in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will study the interplay
between torsors for linear algebraic groups and field arithmetic, with the aim
of developing refined versions of period-index type problems for the Brauer
group and related notions for other classes of algebraic structures. Doing this
will also involve extending both the scope and applicability of "field patching"
and related methods, building on prior work of the investigator with
collaborators to produce new local-global principles for wider classes of
objects as well as for more general fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
