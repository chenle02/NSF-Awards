This project is purchasing a network of six graphics workstations that, together
with existing Macintosh and DEC computers, serves as the basis for new course
developments in the area of computational chemistry within the undergraduate
curriculum in the chemistry department and the Pharmacology Program of the
biological sciences department. The new computers are being used in courses in
Freshman chemistry, organic and advanced organic chemistry, biochemistry,
polymer chemistry, computational chemistry, and upper-division pharmacology
courses and are being used to support undergraduate research projects in the
academic year and the summers. The capabilities of this new instrumentation
makes it possible to communicate to students the reality and excitement of
modern developments in chemistry and to involve these students in exercises and
projects that will give them "hands-on" access to these computational techniques
as an integral part of our undergraduate curriculum. Thus far, experimental
courses in this area have been very enthusiastically accepted by students and
give students a set of skills that serve them in graduate and professional
schools and careers in the bulk chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
