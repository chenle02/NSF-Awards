Under the joint support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and
the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program, Prof. Holmes and Prof. Blank of
the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities investigate how excited state relaxation
processes impact the rate of excitonic energy transfer and diffusion in organic
semiconductors. This work is directed at better understanding the complex
relationship between the molecular excited state dynamics and the observed
exciton diffusion length (LD) and aims to provide design principles required for
a substantial enhancement of LD in materials and devices such as organic
photovoltaics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has potential impact in
the design of excitonic organic devices, including improvements in the
efficiency of both light emission and conversion of sunlight to electricity,
which has a direct impact on the critical issues of energy conversion and
consumption. This project also provides interdisciplinary research opportunities
for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.
