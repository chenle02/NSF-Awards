This Innovation Corps project proposes technology that will develop a functional
handheld prototype to be used in animal studies and in clinical trials for
photodynamic therapy (PDT) of pre-cancers of the skin. The bench prototype will
address a large area (2 cm x 2 cm) prototype that responds to clinical needs.
The PI and her team anticipate that the breakthrough in the illumination
delivery offered by the prototype device will enable a targeted treatment of
pre-cancerous conditions of the skin with PDT in a dermatology office. The
treatment to be offered will be complementary to the current FDA approved
treatment for AK that consists of illuminating the whole anatomic area. In
addition, the dosimetry calculations of PDT will critically benefit from the
known illumination provided. PDT, a minimally invasive procedure, will be a key
to lowering the cost of healthcare; by promoting a more effective treatment,
increasing patient compliance (which is key to lowering healthcare cost) for
early screening and early treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
proposed technology will improve the current skin PDT treatment by making it
more effective, ultimately reducing the number of patient visits needed. For
oral cancer, the proposed optical devices will make the treatment cheaper,
faster, minimally invasive and more comfortable for the patient, by targeting
light to the lesion and not requiring any shielding procedure.
