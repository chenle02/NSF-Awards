This research addresses the need for a more flexible, versatile and
multifingered robotic hand to augment the dexterity of a robotic arm. Its
objective is to complete a unified approach to the analysis of dexterous
manipulation, and the design of robotic hands based on this functionality. The
research is implemented by applying techniques in differential as well as
computational geometry, nonlinear control, symbolic computation, dynamical
system theory and free motion planning. With dexterous manipulation as the
primary goal, criteria for robotic hand design are developed. The project has an
experimental component whereby the design concepts are implemented on existing
actuators. This research is expected to impact several fundamental issues in
robotics, including nonholonomic motion planning, coordinated control, grasping
and task planning, geometrical modeling and finger kinematics and actuator
design.
