This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Stephen Wong of
Lehigh University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Kazumasa Yokota for
12 months at the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) in
Japan. Wong and Yokota will apply Wong's designs for cooperative artificial
intelligence (AI) systems to develop a prototype to test this new class of
computers. For contemporary AI, the basic mechanisms of reasoning and problem
solving remain bound to a single, monolithic conception of knowledge and action.
In order to solve more complex problems, AI systems will need to coordinate
their problem solving techniques, developing collections of interactive,
cooperative knowledge-based processes. ICOT's world- leading research on
parallel inference computing and logic programming will complement Wong's model
design of a cooperative AI system and facilitate the development of an
operational cooperative AI system.
