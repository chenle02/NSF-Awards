Dr. Martin Poenie will be recommended for a Presidential Young Investigator
Award. His research interests are in the area of signal transducton across the
cell plasma membrane and ionic regulation of cellular processes. He has been a
leader in development of fluorescent indicators and instrumentation to image
calcium ions in single living cells. The Presidential Young Investigator Award
will support the further development of these techniques and their application
to important problems of cellular regulation.
