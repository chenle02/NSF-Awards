This research will be to carry out an analytical and experimental program to
study a fractal-based representation of tolerances for discrete part
manufacturing processes. A fractal- based representation does not replace the
current view of tolerance control in engineering design and manufacturing.
Instead, such a representation extends current tolerance synthesis and analysis
practices by providing a means of determining the physical interaction of the
product design and manufacturing process variables. A novel representation of
the experimental data in terms of Karhunen-Loeve expansion will be developed as
a means of studying the fractal or integral nature of shape profiles of the
workpiece specimens. The experimental data and Karhunen-Loeve representation
will also supply information for comparisons with analytical models of the
manufacturing processes.
