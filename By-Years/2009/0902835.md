Nof 0902835&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are
provided to support two related foci of this project ? analytical studies of
ocean circulation and paleo-oceanographic estimation of transport variability.
The analytical focus in this proposal will be to develop a time-dependent
version of the steady state models of flow through Bering Strait previously
developed by the PI. In parallel with this physical oceanographic work, the co-
PI will analyze diffuse spectral reflectance and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) data
as proxies for sediment provenance, and grain size variation in samples taken
from both sides of the Bering Strait (BST) as a proxy for paleo-current
strength. Together, they will then compare periods of high and low global wind
fields with weak or strong Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to
periods of strong or weak flows at the BST. They already have one excellent
example for the success of such an approach. About 5000 years ago the Southern
Ocean winds weakened significantly and, simultaneously (geologically speaking)
the flow through the BST increased and the AMOC weakened, in an excellent
conceptual agreement with their preliminary analytics. Their cross-discipline
collaboration will benefit physical oceanography by providing ?natural
experiments? that are otherwise unavailable, and benefit paleo-oceanography by
providing dynamical explanations for the past oceanographic changes observed in
proxy data.&lt;br/&gt;
