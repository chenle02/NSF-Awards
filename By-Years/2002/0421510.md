0421510&lt;br/&gt;Ravelo&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of California Santa Cruz provides funds to establish a cutting-edge
stable isotope analytical facility for environmental research. It includes
support for the acquisition of three new mass spectrometers plus new front-end
systems for sample preparation and separation, and adds capabilities for
undertaking natural abundance, isotopically-enriched and compound specific
analyses of organic material to the existing two systems that will continue to
serve requirements for mineral-phase analyses. The broader impacts of the
acquisition include a strong commitment to involve students, researchers and
visitors at many levels in research undertaken at the facility. In addition, the
instrumentation will be managed as a regional shared-use facility, open to
researchers from throughout UCSC and outside, and it will be used to study a
wide array of projects with compelling societal relevance (e.g. climate change,
pollution). UCSC is providing 30% of the project cost from non-federal funds.
This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
