The current technique of coronary angiography requires the injection of a
contrast agent into the coronary artery; this procedure is expensive and
potentially hazardous theoretical analysis shows that by taking the difference
between X-rays at two different energies, and by using an appropriate contrast
agent and signal processing techniques, coronary angiograms can be obtained
using intravenous injection. This proposal is to test the feasibility of the
approach without the development of an X-ray tube that is able to handle the
necessary high electron currents. The proposed approach is to generate images of
phantoms using low electrode currents (form the Brookhaven Dynamitron electron
accelerator) and using averaging to compensate for the low current. If the
preliminary results are promising, and follow-up work is successful, a safer and
lower cost angiographic technology will result.
