Abstract McKinnon 9601964 The PIs have requested an Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) program support for the development of a molecular
beam/mass spectrometer (MB/MS) system in order to obtain measurements on high
temperature gas-phase processes so that detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms can
be elucidated, and also to measure high resolution electronic spectra of
unstable species created in these processes. The instrument consists of a
reactor section, an ionizer section, and a mass analyzer section. The reactor
section, where the high temperature species are generated, will make available a
low pressure burner, a flow reactor, and a shock tube as sources of these
species. The ionizer will employ both electron impact ionization and
photoionization techniques, while the mass analyzer will make use of both
quadrupole and time of flight methods. This instrumentation will be used
primarily in the elucidation of the mechanisms of aromatics oxidation and to
provide input to carry out detailed chemical kinetic modeling (DCKM) of these
oxidation processes. ***
