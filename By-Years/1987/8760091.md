The feasibility of producing electronic circuit boards, flexible circuits, and
integrated circuit packages using ink jet technology will be evaluated. If
successful, this method could be interfaced with computer aided design systems
to produce rapid turnaround of prototypes. Packaging is currently one of the
pacing items in most custom circuit development. Application to four specific
circuit processes will be evaluated: integrated tape automated bonding,
conventional integrated packaging, flex circuits, and printed boards. The
feasibility of producing the above will be examined using a variety of materials
(both conductive and masking) and substrates. If the project is successful, a
Phase II proposal will be submitted.
