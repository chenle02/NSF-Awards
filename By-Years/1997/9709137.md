University of California, Los Angeles Regional differences in technology are
conventionally explained by variation in the pace of innovation. Yet production
varies also as a result of imitation and firm entry and exit. The proposed
research will address four objectives. These are to measure the extent of
regional differences in production techniques in the U.S. across a series of
closely defined industries, to examine how variance in regional production
technology moves over time, to estimate the relative importance of the four
major factors influencing regional technology over space and ,finally, to test a
series of hypotheses linking technical change, technological variety and
economic performance. Descriptive measures of performance and a multivariate
analysis of variance will be used to test numerous specific hypotheses
surrounding induced innovation and evolutionary accounts of technical change.
