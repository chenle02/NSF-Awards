The goal of this research project is to investigate a number of topics in the
intersection of geometry, the analysis of nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDE's) and general relativity (GR). These topics share a common
theme: to investigate solutions of the global Cauchy problem for the Einstein
equations for physically interesting situations and to describe the asymptotics
of these solutions. To do this, problems in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry
have to be solved, and the study of the curvature and geometric quantities
especially along null hypersurfaces is required. Recent results obtained by the
principal investigator (PI), extending work by D. Christodoulou and S.
Klainerman, prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Einstein
vacuum (EV) equations in an asymptotically flat setting under more general
conditions leading to borderline estimates. The latter indicate that the
conditions in the PI's main theorem are sharp in so far as the assumptions on
the decay at infinity on the initial data are concerned. Moreover, the new
results describe the asymptotic behaviour for these more general situations.
These new results together with the geometric and analytic theories used and
developed in the proof provide the tools required to further investigate
physically interesting solutions of the EV equations for asymptotically flat
initial data. Thus, the PI plans to compute the asymptotics of spacetimes
allowing non-isotropic mass. This will follow in a straightforward manner from
the results obtained in the PI's work. It will make it possible to later on
attack another main problem, namely the investigation of angular momentum at
null infinity for more general settings. Aiming at this latter goal, this
project will study the Cauchy problem for the EV equations in three specific
cases, applying the new tools and results to these unexplored situations in
order to describe the asymptotics of the corresponding solutions of the EV
equations.

General relativity, as a unified theory of space, time and gravitation, is
based on and extends Newton's theory of gravitation as well as Newton's
equations of motion. The laws of GR are the Einstein equations, linking the
curvature of spacetime to its matter content. Exploring these equations will
lead to a better understanding of the universe. To unravel the complex interplay
between geometry, analysis and physics is one of the richest challenges in GR.
This project aims to investigate this interaction. Along the way, the
mathematical tools developed promise to bear fruit in the analysis of the many
structurally similar nonlinear PDE's. The proposed research studies
asymptotically flat systems. Isolated gravitating systems such as binary stars,
clusters of stars and galaxies can be described in GR by asymptotically flat
solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations, as they can be thought of as having
an asymptotically flat region outside the support of the matter. It is very
important to understand the asymptotics of such systems also in view of
gravitational radiation. And the well-known experiments to detect gravitational
waves are based on the analysis of such asymptotically flat systems.
