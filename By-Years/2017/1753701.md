This project will advance our understanding of using technologies of the brain
in interpreting the senses. The project will engage in public participation in
discussions regarding the development and use of brain machine interface
devices. The study will identify how these technologies are brought to market,
and experienced by individual users. It will be of interest to patients,
doctors, policy makers, scientists and technology developers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together social studies of
science, the neurosciences and translational medicine to investigate the ways in
which brain machine interface (BMI) devices are being developed. It will explore
questions about what subjects see when using BMI devices? What does it mean for
a BMI device to "work"? The study will trace how institutional relationships
involved in the production of a BMI device (i.e. the academic military-
industrial complex) manifest in individual, perceptual experience. The project
will use phenomenological and experimental methods that include computational
modeling, psychophysics and behavioral tasks, as well as interviews and
ethnography. By combining institutional ethnography and critical
phenomenological methods in the context of the neuroscience the result will
contribute to our understanding of the processes of embodiment.
