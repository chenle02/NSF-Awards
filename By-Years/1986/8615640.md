A major impediment to the development of dependable biomedical and other
biological interface devices is the definition of a "biocompatible" interface.
Industry recognizes that interdisciplinary university researchg programs can
address these impediments. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Biosurface Science represents a opssible approach for a research program.
This project is studying the feasibility and viability for a possible
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biosurface Science as a
joint effort of the University of Buffalo and Montana State University. Studies
are addressing the possible organizational, operational, and policies
alternatives for a joint center. The research interests of companies and the
potential for industrial support are also being studied.
