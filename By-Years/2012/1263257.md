The University at Buffalo (UB) REU site addresses the important topic of
Ecosystem Restoration from an interdisciplinary perspective. Although ERIE-REU
participants are drawn primarily from engineering undergraduate programs, the
interdisciplinary program includes faculty participants from eight academic
departments across two campuses. While diverse in scope and methods, the ERIE
research projects share a place-based focus on the ecological recovery of the
lower Great Lakes and Western New York regions. During the ten-week program,
formal training in research methods supports individual projects organized into
three interdisciplinary themes: lake and river restoration, groundwater
restoration, and sustainable engineering applications. Biweekly group meetings
and field trips allow students to share ideas and methods across disciplines,
including discussions related to the ethics and values of ecological
restoration. In a final culminating experience, ERIE-REU students present their
projects to a diverse academic and professional audience. Students are also
encouraged and supported to engage in post-REU conference presentations. ERIE-
REU participants are recruited from a diverse set of partner institutions,
including undergraduate colleges with a high proportion of underrepresented
groups and regional Native American communities.
