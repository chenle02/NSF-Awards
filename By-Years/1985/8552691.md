This research focuses on robotics and automated manufacturing. In robotics,
emphasis is on the design and control of advanced manufacturing hands. A current
project is to develop a hand that will be intelligent enough to work with people
rather than replace them. This will entail an exploration of partnering,
cooperation, and learning. In automated manufacturing, sensor-interpretation
strategies are being investigated to improve the dialogue between CAD and CAM.
In particular, methods are developed for extracting information from sensors in
the manufacturing process and that information is used to update a manufacturing
knowledge base that will assist designers.
