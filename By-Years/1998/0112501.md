ITR Small Proposal&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0112501&lt;br/&gt;Blum,
Rick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transmit and receive antenna arrays used to form
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels have shown great potential in
isolated, single link communications without cochannel
interference.&lt;br/&gt;Provided the same number of transmit and receive
antennas are used, recent research has shown that capacity scales linearly with
the number of transmit antennas. This result has created an
incredible&lt;br/&gt;flurry of interest among researchers. While these MIMO
systems have received extensive study for cases without cochannel interference,
cases with cochannel interference have received much less&lt;br/&gt;attention.
Further, new simulation results indicate that cochannel interference can
significantly degrade the overall capacity when MIMO channels are used in a
cellular system in the same manner in which&lt;br/&gt;they are used for cases
without interference. The investigators study the properties of MIMO systems
with&lt;br/&gt;interference to develop new methods of using MIMO which adapt the
transmission scheme to the interference environment. These new methods, called
stream control algorithms, transmit several different streams, each one using a
different transmit weight vector. The maximum number of streams that can be
transmitted is equal to the minimum of the number of transmit and receive
antennas. The exact number of streams chosen depends on the current sensed state
of the interference environment. Preliminary results indicate that significant
performance gains can be achieved in this manner. Using the well developed
theory of power control, distributed algorithms are being developed to control
the number of streams employed in a cellular system with cochannel interference.
The use of space-time coding is also being studied in conjunction with stream
control. Wireless channels with frequency selective fading, various correlation
structures, and other practical degradations are being studied.&lt;br/&gt;
