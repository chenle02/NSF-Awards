This project involves the porting of a simulation and game development immersion
(SGDI) program to Second Life. The SGDI program focuses on the local and
national need to attract more students, especially women, to computer science-
related fields, including computer programming. The project leverages a number
of different local partners. Second Life is a 3D, massive multiplayer, web-based
virtual world, where residents create identities, objects, and environments for
social interaction, business, education, and enjoyment. By moving the entire
program into Second Life, students across the country are able to access SGDI
through a social interactive gaming-type environment. Project activities focus
on expanding enrollment; transitioning the existing program to Second Life; and
promoting the project, especially through the League for Innovation. The primary
audience is twofold: high school students and community college students. This
project also includes an emphasis on attracting women to the STEM-related
discipline of computer programming.
