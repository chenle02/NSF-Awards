The objective of this proposal is to increase the resolving power and the image
acquisition speed, of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy by about an order
of magnitude (to 5-10nm). Resolution in conventional photoactivatable-
localization microscopy is limited by the localization precision, which, in turn
is proportional to 1/sqrt(N), where N is the number of collected photons. In the
proposed approach, we can achieve localization precision that is proportional to
1/N. This is achieved by: (1) reduction in the effective size of the point-
spread function (PSF) as a result of a novel grating system, (2) increase in the
number of detected photons due to interference with a high intensity reference
wave and (3) utilization of phase information in addition to the intensity of
the signals using a novel optical correlator for optical
filtering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit arises from the potential
acquisition of fluorescence images with macro-molecular (sub-5nm) resolution
enabled by a relatively simple addition to conventional confocal microscopes.
The transformative nature of the proposed technique is a result of the higher
resolution and faster imaging, which will elucidate the fundamental interactions
between proteins and sub-cellular nanostructures with unprecedented spatial and
temporal resolution. Such mechanistic understanding will prove to be essential
for future advancements in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this project include (1) training of the scientific workforce via an innovative,
inter-disciplinary course, (2) recruitment of under-represented students via a
hands-on demonstration module to be utilized at 3 large outreach events, and (3)
widespread dissemination via commercialization of the subject technology.
