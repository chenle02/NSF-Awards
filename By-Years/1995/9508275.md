9508275 Owen Faculty members in the Department of Statistics at Stanford
University are researching computationally intensive statistical methods aimed
at problems in approximation, prediction, classification and integration in high
dimensional settings. Roughly 97.5% of the award will help to support the hiring
a computer support professional, whose duties will be to maintain and improve
research computing facilities. Roughly 2.5% of the award will be used to help
improve the hardware on which the research is done. Both components of the award
are matched by University funds.
