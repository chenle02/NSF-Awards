Mathematical modelling of complex systems often considers two general classes
of systems analysis, termed linear and non- linear. Most biological systems have
properties that make them non-linear, which makes them very interesting but at
the same time very difficult to model. This symposium is designed to involve
engineers and biologists, in considering some of the current issues and state-
of-the-art approaches that can be useful in both identification and analysis of
biological linear and non-linear systems. This conference will serve as an
important cross-disciplinary fertilization that will have impact on biology and
biomedical engineering, in both basic and applied aspects.
