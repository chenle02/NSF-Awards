The principal investigator will conduct research on three topics concerning
probability theory: (a) large deviations for vector-valued functionals of Markov
chains and processes; (b) large deviation for non-Markov stationary processes:
(c) law of the iterated logarithm for Banach-space valued functionals of Markov
chains. Large deviation theory is a branch of probability theory involving
limits of random variables. It is well known that in certain idealized cases,
where the random variables are independent and identically distributed, that the
average of the sequence converges to the average of the individual random
variable (in terms of statistics, that the sample average converges to the
population average). Large deviation theory shows that the probability that the
sample average deviates from the population average by a small amount is
exponentially small as the sample size increases. The principal investigator is
working in the much more difficult case of dependent random variables, whose
dependence structure follows a Markov process. There are many applications of
this theory to statistical mechanics and queueing networks.
