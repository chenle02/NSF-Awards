Pilot Project: Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering Course at
University of Texas at AustinAn introductory course in the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering is being developed whose primary goal is to
reduce freshman attrition by fifteen to twenty-five percent. The major
objectives of the proposed course are development of: 1) problem solving skills;
2) a better understanding of the relationship between calculus and physics and
electrical and computer engineering; and 3) an understanding of the use of
computers in problem solving. In addition, the instructional material prepared
for this course will be suitable for a textbook that can be used not only at The
University of Texas at Austin, but also in similarly structured courses in other
departments of electrical and computer engineering. A pre-post experimental
design is being planned for the assessment of the course.
