Yazgulyami is a severely endangered Pamiri (Southeastern Iranian) language,
spoken primarily along the Yazgulyam River in the mountains of eastern
Tajikistan. Recent history has seen the encroachment of Tajik culture and the
concomitant death of several neighboring Pamiri languages. This project has two
primary aims, one descriptive and one theoretical. Firstly, this work will
create a living language corpus of Yazgulyami speech composed of annotated audio
and video recordings alongside a multilingual dictionary. Additionally, this
research will examine and formally model the syllabification of consonant
clusters. In Yazgulyami, up to three consonants may begin a word. Previous work
on the language suggests that these clusters may be polysyllabic, creating
syllables composed entirely on consonants, like pt and zv. If this is the case,
Yazgulyami is one of the very few languages that allow vowel-less syllables.
Languages like this raise the question of what makes up a syllable, an important
empirical question. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In pursuit of these two goals, speech
data will be collected from a Yazgulyami village in eastern Tajikistan. A
variety of stories, conversations, and songs will be recorded, including poetry
and language games, which will supplement acoustic analysis of word-initial
syllables. Poetry and language games (e.g. Pig Latin) often refer to syllables,
giving the researcher an opportunity to access native speaker conceptions of
syllable boundaries. Empirical findings from this study will be formalized
according to contemporary phonetic and phonological theory, addressing the
underlying as well as surface realization of these syllabic
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a needed
documentation of a swiftly changing language in an understudied region of the
world. Moreover, the project will enable a graduate student to collaborate with
an endangered speech community on the description of their language while
producing a theoretical analysis of a rarely attested sound pattern.
