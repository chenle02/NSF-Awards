A Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) instrument will be
purchased and used for real-time, in-situ measurements of concentrations and
fluxes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in particular, terpenes. These
compounds play an important role in the tropospheric photochemistry of forested
regions. In situ concentrations and flux measurements carried out with the PTR-
MS coupled to the eddy covariance method will be compared to measurements using
gas chromatography coupled to relaxed eddy accumulation. Extension to ecosystem
scale fluxes will be attempted. The PTR-MS will also be used for in situ
measurements of oxidation products of terpenes. In addition, the PI will
collaborate with the research group of Prof. John Seinfeld at Caltech on
laboratory studies of VOC oxidation processes by using the PTR-MS as a product
analysis tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
