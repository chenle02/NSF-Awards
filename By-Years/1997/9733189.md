Professor Sabre Kais of Purdue University is supported by a CAREER grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop and apply
renormalization group, finite-size scaling, and the pivot method for calculating
electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The long term goal is accurate
predictions of atomic and molecular properties at low computational cost. Novel
educational ideas include updating the content of undergraduate and graduate
curricula, incorporating interactive group projects into courses, and
introducing conceptual tests during lectures. Performing highly accurate
calculations of molecular properties obviates the need for many mundane or even
hazardous chemical experiments. It also allows for the exploration of regions of
potential energy surfaces and transient species not routinely accessible by
experiment. The use of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques in
chemical education provides information on student performance, motivation, and
understanding.
