9530668 Claffy NSF would like to foster a robust multiple provider network
environment where IP providers can secure sufficient and useful understanding of
workloads imposed by their customers. NSF will use this workshop to bring
together those who use high speed network equipment with those who design it.
The recent deployment of the vBNS (very high speed Backbone Network Service), an
NSF cooperatite agreement with MCI for an OC-3 wide area network connecting the
NSF supercomputer centers, will also provide an ideal platform to investigate
statistics collection and analysis technologies.
