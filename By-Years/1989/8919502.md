This proposal outlines an ambitious application of decision analysis to an
important national problem. The proposed research has two distinct parts: (1) to
perform a decision analysis of the management of commercial nuclear waste, one
alternative being a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; and (2) to conduct
research on methodological issues inherent in considering strategic governmental
decisions, such as siting nuclear waste repositories. The combination of these
two tasks allows the former to be used as a case study for the latter. In
principle, the application of decision analysis could make significant
contributions to public decision making. But in practice, this approach rarely
is applied to significant problems. Although the obstacles to implementation are
considerable, the past work of the principal investigators demonstrate that the
task is not impossible. Their prior work on the nuclear waste repository is a
classic example of good decision analysis. Moreover, this earlier work has had
an impact, not only in the science policy community, but also on some
participants in the political process. The investigators' record of
accomplishments in previous NSF funded research is exceptional. Not only have
they produced excellent academic research, they have demonstrated an ability to
address important public policy issues in a way that enhances the level of
public debate. In all, the potential payoff from this project is very high.
