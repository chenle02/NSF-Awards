residential Young Scholars program in mathematics for 48 students entering the
11th and 12th grades. Students are taught to reason rigorously and precisely
while experiencing the excitement of mathematical discovery. Students receive
classroom instruction in number theory, discrete mathematics,as well as
programming in Mathematica. An honors seminar examines philosophical and ethical
issues as well as career options. Students will be provided a license for
Mathematica and a modem to take back to their school. All students will develop
collaborative projects which build on ideas learned during the summer. ***
