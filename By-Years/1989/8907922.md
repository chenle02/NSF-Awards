Determination of the direction and magnitude of stresses within the oceanic
crust to constrain models for the forces driving the plates is a principal
objective of the next ten years of the Ocean Drilling Program. Although
observations of stress-induced wellbore breakouts with ultrasonic televiewer
wellbore scanning have provided indications of the directions of the maximum and
minimum principal horizontal stresses in these ODP boreholes, no direct
measurements or estimates of stress magnitudes have been made. Recent
theoretical developments applied to sites on land can be extended to holes
drilled in the oceanic crust to allow constraints to be placed on the magnitudes
of in situ stresses based on the presence or absence of breakouts and other
wellbore failure phenomena, and from constraints imposed by the frictional
strength of the crust. This project will estimate magnitudes of in situ stress
by re- analyzing existing borehole televiewer data. Breakouts will form when the
difference between the circumferential stress concentration and the radial
stress at the borehole wall exceeds the strength the rock. Constraints can be
placed on the stress magnitudes if breakouts occur and if the strength of the
rock is known. Corrections will be made for thermal effects and pore pressure
effects. Laboratory measurements will be made of the tensile and unconfined
compressive strength for rock from the depth at which observations of tensile
cracks or breakouts are obtained.
