This proposal is for the acquisition of an X-Ray powder-diffractometer for the
characterization of intermetallic compounds, thin film and superlattices. The
diffractometer will be used in research related to high temperature and field
superconductivity, the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism, reentrant
superconductivity, oscillatory magnetic states that co-exist with super
conductivity magnetic field induced superconductivity, epitaxial growth,
superlattices and ceramic thin films. In addition, this instrument will be
operated as a facility to support a variety of other research efforts within the
University.
