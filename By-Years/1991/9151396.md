To attract more students into the sciences the Biology and Chemistry Departments
united their efforts to institute a modern advanced biochemistry laboratory
course that provides a dynamic view of these sciences and opportunities for
undergraduate research. The acquisition of centrifuges, electrophoresis
equipment, and a polymerase chain reaction temperature cycler allows laboratory
exercises to focus on contemporary projects and techniques that have
sophisticated applications, yet are easily within the capabilities of an
advanced undergraduate. The equipment is also used for other laboratories and
for independent student research.
