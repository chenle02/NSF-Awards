The proposal requests partial support for a conference organized in honor of
Kenneth Kunen, to be held between 3 and 5 of April, 2009 in Madison, Wisconsin.
The conference centers on the subjects of mathematics where Kunen has
contributed, including set theory, set-theoretic topology, model theory and loop
theory. The intellectual merit of the conference is that it will reassemble a
number of internationally distinguished speakers in these fields who will speak
on the current research. In addition to this, a special issue of the journal
Topology and its proceedings is planned to accompany the conference. The meeting
will attract researchers from the whole region, including those from
undergraduate institutions.
