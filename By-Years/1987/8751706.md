This two-and-one-half year project involving teachers, university faculty,
parents, students, retired teachers, and school district personnel will
significantly enhance the mathematics background and pedagogical skills of
thirty-two underprepared eighth-grade mathematics teachers in a predominantly
minority urban school district. Throughout the duration of the project, City
University of New York (CUNY) faculty and master teachers will provide the
participants with mathematics instruction in areas relevant to the curriculum.
During the academic year, participants will also practice and improve their
teaching techniques in a Saturday Mathematics Academy attended by eighty
underachieving students and their parents. On a rotating basis, they will teach
the students, observe their colleagues' teaching, and advise parents on ways in
which they can support learning at home. Retired teachers will serve as mentors
for the participants and will assist them in translating their experiences from
the Saturday Mathematics Academy into their regular classrooms. The evaluation
will involve participants, their students, and their students' parents, and, at
the end of the project, a dissemination meeting will be held for administrators
from other interested school districts. The project is a collaboration between
City College and New York City School District 10, which are contributing
$286,478 in cost-sharing. Its combination of extensive instruction in content
with regular opportunities to practice newly learned teaching techniques
provides a model for significantly improving the qualifications of underprepared
teachers that could be replicated by other urban school districts.
