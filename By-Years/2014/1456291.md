The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high
precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In
optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses
are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost
and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded
plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative
carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow
use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used
today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as
advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and
biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical,
optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable
optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily
lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green
manufacturing.

This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded
graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon
wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we
now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level. The process
development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high
precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones
and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our
understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.
