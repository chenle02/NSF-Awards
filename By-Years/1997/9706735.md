9706735 Thomas One of the fundamental problems in early Paleozoic plate tectonic
history of the Americas is where and how much the west coast of South America
has interacted with the east coast of North America. One of the ways to test
possible interactions of the continents is by testing lithostratigraphic
correlations of Cambrian and Ordovician rocks. Thomas' study will do exactly
that: compare and contrast the potential correlation of early Paleozoic
sediments in the southeastern US with those of northwestern Argentina. The
results will go a long way toward evaluating whether the correlations of these
rocks permits a transfer in the Early Paleozoic of the Precordillera from
Laurentia to Argentina .
