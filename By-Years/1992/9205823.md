The principal investigator will do fundamental analytical research on the nature
of chemical zoning in metamorphic porphyroblasts, and will develop detailed
models for the processes that produce both prograde and retrograde zoning. The
data will be used to constrain theoretical models for garnet zoning as a kinetic
monitor of metamorphic heating and cooling rates.
