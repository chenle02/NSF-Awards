Myxococcus exhibits multicellular gliding movements that are highly coordinated.
Coordination spans the range of few to many thousands of cells. While growing, a
dozen cells may associate and move as a cohort. In fruiting body development,
many thousands of cells move coordinately. The aim of this project is to work
out the cellular and molecular basis for movement coordination. Despite the
apparent complexity of their movement, myxobacterial cells have the structural,
chemical and genetic simplicity of Gram-negative bacteria. Previous work on
Myxococcus had distinguished two motility patterns called "adventurous" and
"social". This project will seek to identify many of the genes that control
social motility. The motors responsible for gliding movement have not yet been
uncovered in any of the gliding bacteria. A new way to find the genes that
specify gliding motors is proposed. One gene, the mglA gene, is known from
previous work to be essential for all gliding and to couple adventurous and
social motility. Mutants defective in this gene are unable to move under any
conditions. Experiments are proposed to define the function of mglA on the
pathway that regulates cell movement. Multicellular movements are particularly
important in the embryonic development of vertebrates, but little is known about
how they are organized or regulated. Myxobacteria offer a realistic way to begin
to investigate this general problem.
