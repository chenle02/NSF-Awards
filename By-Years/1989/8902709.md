This research, to be undertaken at Fermilab, will study the photoproduction of
high pt jets in the Wide Band photon beam, with photon energies up to 500 GeV.
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that high energy photons couple directly
to the constituents of nucleons. However, this process has not yet been seen
directly. Since there are only two underlying QCD subprocesses, theoretical
predictions for jet photoproduction are well-understood. In addition, Dr.
Corcoran will study the spin dependence of hadronic interactions in Fermilab's
200 Gev/c polarized proton beam. Despite theoretical predictions to the
contrary, spin effects have persisted to high energies, and interesting results
are expected in the first data from this unique beam line. Interactive
activities include teaching an undergraduate physics course and conducting a
high energy physics seminar series highlighting women physicists. This project
furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women
to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science
supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and
engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers
employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
