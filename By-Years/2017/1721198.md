The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held
December 8-9, 2016 at the Hilton Hotel, San Francisco, CA. The Workshop will
address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary
compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in
various devices. It will allow scientific exchanges among leading scientists
working on beyond graphene 2D materials and devices to help promote future
collaborations and address common challenges. The Workshop is expected to play a
key role in addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in 2D material and
device research and identifying new directions for research. The research
discussed at the Workshop is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs and
disruptive technologies that can have great societal impact in the future in
many areas such as sensing, communications and health.
