With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota in Duluth will acquire a
500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the characterization of relatively
small molecules prepared in organic, inorganic and organometallic synthetic
studies; and b) structural biochemical studies, such as the study of protein
kinase inhibitors from natural products and the elucidation of the folding
pathway of cytochrome c.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry.
