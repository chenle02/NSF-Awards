Packed bed multitube reactors are used in chemical processes such as partial
oxidation, chlorination, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. The multitube
arrangement facilitates heat exchange, to improve process selectivity and
stability by reducing temperature variations in the catalyst beds. The PI is
planning to design packed-tube reactors using a data- based transport function.
The function will be constructed from measurements of temperature responses to
localized wall and particle heating under laminar and turbulent flow conditions.
Packed-bed reactors will be simulated numerically by combining the transport
function with the local kinetics of the given process. The experiments and
correlation studies will be continued to establish the transport function to
practical accuracy for several geometries. Numerical methods and software for
the approach will be developed for high-performance parallel computers and will
be tested on chemical process examples. The research will provide a database for
computer-aided engineering of packed-tube catalytic processes. The approach also
has potential applications to other kinds of reactors and separation systems.
