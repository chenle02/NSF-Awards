This award provides funds for an REU Site in Archaeology sponsored by the
University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. Ten students will be offered an intensive
eight week experience at an on-going long-term archaeological research project
and fieldschool at Dust Cave, a deeply stratified Paleoindian to Middle Archaic
site near Florence, Alabama. Students will reside with staff in a tent camp near
the Cave and participate in coursework, learn basic laboratory and analytical
methods, and be exposed to an array of topical specialties including lithic
technology, geoarchaeology/geomorphology, zooarchaeology, and archaeobotany.
Each student will develop, carry out, and report an individual research project
under staff direction. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.
