WEATHERBIRD II is a general purpose research vessel owned and operated by the
Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc. The 1993 schedule for R/V WBII has
a total of 151 operating days, of which 144 are in support of NSF-funded
research. The scientific cruises are scheduled to commence in early May, prior
to that the vessel will be in a US shipyard undergoing a major conversion and
refit. Bermuda is the site of one of the two U.S. JGOFS funded time- series
stations, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). This program is
scheduled for 55 days and is in the fifth year of a five year program. There are
sixteen research groups who will conduct their research on an ancillary basis
with the BATS program. In addition to the BATS cruises the WBII will support the
biweekly Hydrostation S sampling program, which has been conducted for the past
38 years. The WBII is part of the UNOLS fleet that supports oceanographic
research. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or
fishing vessels. NSF supports the operation of a variety of these vessels
specifically dedicated to oceanographic research and operated by universities
and research institutes around the country.
