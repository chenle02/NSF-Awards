Mixing and water mass modification in overflows play a strong role in the
strength of the oceanic thermohaline circulation and hence they are potentially
important in climate. However, these processes are sub-grid scale in most ocean
circulation models and so must be parameterized. Most parameterization schemes
are based on the dynamics of steady currents but oceanic plumes are in fact
subject to forcing at a variety of scales from tidal to synoptic to seasonal.
The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the effects of time-
dependent mixing in overflow plumes using data from three Red Sea cruises and by
conducting process studies in idealistic and realistic 2D and 3D nonhydrostatic
models. The results will improve parameterizations which are needed to represent
overflows in models of the ocean general circulation and climate. This project
will form the basis of the PhD thesis for a female student.
