The design of feedback laws for systems characterized by complicated nonlinear
dynamical behavior is a challenging research task which has attracted an
increasing interest in recent years. Advances in nonlinear control theory will
substantially improve the design of control systems for light-weighted robot
arms, for autopilots and guidance systems of highly maneuverable aircrafts,
increase the flexibility and energy efficiency in the regulation of chemical
plants, facilitate the real-time reconfiguration of a control system after the
occurrence of a failure. Among the many problems which must be confronted, a
most important one is the desing of feedback laws achieving tracking of
prescribed exogenous commands and rejection of exogenous disturbances. The
approaches to the problem of tracking/rejection of exogenous inputs in a control
system depend upon the model chosen to describe the family of exogenous inputs
which are expected to affect the system. If no model is available, an appealing
strategy -which revealed itself very powerful and attractive in the case of
linear systems- is to base the design on the worst possible situation. For
instance, in the frequency domain, the feedback laws are designed so as to
minimize the maximal amplitude of the frequency response to the exogenous
inputs. This research project would contribute to the extension of these design
methodologies to systems described by nonlinear mathematical models. Using
methods and results from the geometric theory of control systems, the theory of
differential games and the qualitative theory of dynamical system, the purpose
of the research is to establish sufficiently general results about existence and
actual design of feedback control laws achieving attenuation of unmodeled
external disturbances.
