Integrated studies of issues in managing research and human responses to global
climate change will be done. While the elements of the work interact, for
expository and administrative convenience, the project is divided into two broad
activities: An integrated assessment, focusing particularly on uncertainty, and
studies of public understanding and communication. While global climate change
issues are important in their own right, they are prototypical of a class of
issues in science, technology, and public policy in which: 1) there are a
significant number of different elements whose interactions cannot safely be
ignored in planning research, performing policy analysis, or formulating policy
responses; 2) uncertainty involving these elements and their interactions is
large and unlikely to be fully resolved before potential impacts would be felt
and policy choices will have to be made; and 3) public understanding of these
scientific and technical issues is of central importance and improved risk
communication is essential to better public policy.
