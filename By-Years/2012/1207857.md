This award will support research activity at Thomas Jefferson National
Laboratory in Newport News, VA. The PI plays a significant role in a major new
experiment known as GlueX (presently under construction, with data taking
expected within three or four years), whose focus is the study of meson spectra.
The theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), predicts not
only the existence of mesons that have been observed over decades of
experiments, but also exotic states that are made up of quarks, anti quarks and
gluons, as well as glueballs - states made up entirely of gluons. GlueX is
specifically designed to help search for such states. The PI has primary
responsibility for specific hardware: diamond radiators, photon tagger
microscope, and photon collimator, all of which are essential for achieving the
full scientific potential of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence
of so-called exotics and glueballs is a widely expected consequence of QCD, but
as with any theory, confirmation is an essential component in our understanding
even of non-exotic matter. Graduate student participation is an important part
of the activity, both for the success of the project and for training of future
scientific leaders. The hardware development has also engendered important ties
with local companies.
