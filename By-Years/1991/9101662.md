Study of chemistry and circulation of thermocline waters in Indonesian Seaway
during glacial/interglacial transitions. isotopic and faunal analyses of high
sedimentation rate sequences to decipher the record of past 20 k.y. to determine
the timing and nature of changes in hydrographic patterns. AMS dating on key
samples will provide absolute chronology. A small exploratory award is made to
prove the validity of the method.
