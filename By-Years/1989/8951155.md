A generic, "hands-on" control laboratory has been developed, built, and tested.
The laboratory uses control system hardware to investigate undergraduate level
topics in control theory. A prototype system is being integrated into junior and
senior level control theory programs as laboratory courses. Resources are made
available to fully equip the hands-on-control laboratory. The lab equipment
includes both analog and digital controllers. The digital controller is an IBM
AT or Mac II, along with A/D and D/A boards. The purpose of the computer is to
provide an easy medium to implement a set of control instructions or algorithms
into the system at a high programming level. The computer serves to acquire
data, and graphically present the results. Three experimental setups use an
analog servo motor position controller to demonstrate modeling techniques,
sampling and observer design. The generic laboratory set-up is designed to allow
the investigation of a wide variety of processes such as motor control, a three-
degrees-of-freedom robotic arm manipulation, an inverted pendulum, and the
control of temperature and tank water level in a solar energy system.
