This is a fundamental engineering research proposal which addresses the issues
of providing an exo-skeleton and artificial muscle system for a disabled
individual. For example, a person can place their arm into an outer arm shell,
and with very little effort the exo-skeleton arm will carry out movements as
directed by the person. Sensors inside the exo-skeleton determine even a slight
movement of the persons arm and provide power as necessary to effect the
movement of the real arm as directed by the individual. Thus, is principle, if
this project is successfully completed, severely disabled individuals should be
able to regain a significant degree of mobility, so long as they still have at
least some mobility to direct the exo-skeleton.
