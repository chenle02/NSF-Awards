This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the ability of a device technology currently in development to prevent the
intrusion of infection-causing microorganisms into surgery sites via the
airborne vector. The research to-date conducted on working prototypes during
bench studies and cadaver surgeries corroborates the hypothesis that the device
dramatically reduces the presence of microorganisms and airborne particulate at
surgery sites versus control groups. SBIR Phase I funding will allow additional
research to be conducted in order to demonstrate the device's effectiveness in a
clinical trial of 63 surgery procedures. Affirmative Phase I results will lead
to the anticipated goal of Phase II research to determine if the device can
effectively reduce the incidence of surgical site infections in high-risk
surgeries during a larger multi-site trial.

The broader impacts of this research are the potential reduction of surgical
site infections and the contribution to a better understanding of the vectors of
infection. Patients contracting an infection during high-risk procedures face
considerable hardships, and evidence shows that elderly, less affluent, and non-
urban populations are more likely to succumb to an SSI after prosthesis implant
surgeries. The cost of treating surgical site infections developing after high-
risk surgeries is greater than $1.7 billion annually and is projected to grow
rapidly through the year 2030. The technology under development can potentially
reduce cost to the healthcare system and prevent human suffering caused by such
infections.
