This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop innovative blue and green lasers based on multi-pass second harmonic
generation (SHG). It utilizes a simple Galilean telescope to solve many of the
problems associated with this promising technical approach. The goal of the
Phase I feasibility study is to develop a multi-pass SHG laser with 20
milliwatts of output power and excellent beam quality. The proposed lasers are
expected to be 2 to 5 times more reliable than argon ion and frequency-doubled
Nd:YAG lasers (20,000 hours mean time to first failure vs. 4,000 to 10,000
hours). In quantity, the parts for the proposed lasers would cost about $625
(vs. several thousand dollars for a frequency-doubled YAG laser).

The commercial applications of this project are in bio-instrumentation (light-
induced fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, capillary electrophoresis, DNA
sequencing, and confocal microscopy), semiconductor inspection (photomask
inspection, wafer alignment, confocal microscopy, and wafer process monitoring),
and reprographics (high-speed laser printers, video CD storage, and medical
imaging and diagnostics).
