9705623 Confrey Quest Mulitmedia Math and Science, Inc. of Ithaca, NY is
developing a complete precalculus course to be delivered initially on CD-ROM in
a Netscape container. The product has an emphasis on problem solving and
modeling using families of functions and transformations. Computer-based
quantitative tools and a rich set of interactive diagrams are available and
complement the product's use of multimedia resources, including text, graphics,
video, photographs, animations, and sound. The product is derived from
precalculus materials which have been tested and used with secondary school and
undergraduate students as well as preservice and inservice secondary teachers.
