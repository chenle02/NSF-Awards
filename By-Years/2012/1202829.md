High-throughput Screen to Characterize and Understand the Role of Synaptic Cell
Adhesion Proteins in Neurons

Many proteins control and affect the billions of connections among neurons in
the brain. At the simplest level, the mapping of such neuronal interactions
dictate how we learn, think, and remember. Moreover, when certain proteins are
altered, neurological diseases can result ranging from learning disorders to
memory impairment. This work will integrate high-throughput imaging technologies
to characterize and systematically understand the role of certain synaptic cell
adhesion proteins in neurons. For each protein, high-throughput microscopy
methods will be used to image and quantify the cell morphology, visualize
calcium signalling, and correlate the protein location with other neuronal
markers having known functions. The results and broader impacts of this work may
shed fundamental insight on how the brain is wired and how different neurons
connect to and recognize each other.

The postdoctoral fellow, from a materials science and engineering background on
the development and use of massively parallel scanning probe tools, will gain
extensive experience in neurobiology, molecular biology, large-scale data
analysis, and neurobiology in the context of imaging calcium signalling within
cells. In addition to scientific training, the fellow will mentor undergraduate
students in how to conduct research. Educational outreach activities such as
teaching classes about recent scientific advances, writing web articles about
biology intended for a non-science audience, and designing museum exhibits
highlighting the intersection of biology and engineering will help engage public
awareness.
