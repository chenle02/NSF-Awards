This proposal relates to initial into the development of a novel new
lithographic process which is capable of generating submicrometer
microlithographic images. The proposal relates to a process of impregnating a
non-radiation sensitive polymeric resist coating with a non-reactive, gaseous
photoactive material, imaging said composition using a variety of exposure
sources, removing the unreacted photoactive material, leaving of latent image is
then developed, preferably using oxygen reactive ion etching. The major benefit
is that this process does not require a radiation sensitive resist, nor does it
use multiple coatings; and it involves little or virtually no additional
processing compared to standard photoresist processing. It is capable of
providing submicron image dimensions in a top layer imaging process. The tone of
the process can be either positive or negative, depending on the sequence of
processing steps. This process is useful for imaging with ultraviolet, deep-UV,
X-ray, electron-beam, and ion-beam radiation. It is potentially useful for the
formation of resist images on semiconductor and electro-optical substrates, as
well as printed circuit board, innerlayer, optical disc, and litho plate
preparation.
