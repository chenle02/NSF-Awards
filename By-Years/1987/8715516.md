The destruction of hazardous liquid wastes by means of incineration is a viable
technique that requires careful monitoring of emissions and combustion
efficiency. Modeling efforts in the past have been limited by the absence of
fundamental information on the heat, momentum, and mass transfer mechanisms
controlling the heating, vaporization, mixing, and combustion of the liquid-
waste sprays encountered in real systems. This research effort concentrates on
the fundamental processes governing the energy, mass and momentum exchanges
between the liquid- and gas-phases, as well as on the chemical reactions
involved in the destruction of hazardous liquid wastes. Two distinct geometries
are investigated: one consisting of parallel streams of droplets in a channel
flow, and another consisting of a swirl-stabilized centerbody reactor. A number
of aspects controlling the efficient destruction of hazardous liquid wastes are
examined, such as the effects of droplet size distribution, multi-component
(fuel-doped) liquid- waste streams, secondary atomization, reactor geometry,
efficient flame propagation, and turbulence, among others. The current lack of
information has resulted in overly conservative and economically unattractive
designs. The results of this program will be useful in the design of more
efficient, safer, and economic liquid-waste incinerators.
