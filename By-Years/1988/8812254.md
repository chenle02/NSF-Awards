The relationship between deterministic and random processes in the mechanisms
of evolution in nature has been a fundamental feature of modern evolutionary
biology since the early 1930's. The tension between Sewall Wright's and R. A.
Fisher's views of mechanisms of evolution has been extremely important in
shaping much of the theoretical and field work in evolutionary biology. This
tension stems basically from their differing interpretations of the relative
roles of deterministic selection and random genetic drift. In the period since
1950, the primary foci of interest in the tension between selectionist and
neutralist interpretations have been in the controversies surrounding: 1) Ernst
Mayr's concepts of founder effect and genetic revolution in speciation, 2) the
selectionist interpretation of microevolution at the phenotypic level,
represented by the Oxford School of ecological genetics, and 3) Motoo Kimura's
neutral theory of molecular evolution. Under this grant, Professor Provine will
examine in detail the two major schools at opposite ends of the spectrum in this
debate: the Oxford School of ecological genetics and Motoo Kimura's neutral
theory of molecular evolution. The first represents a deeply selectionist (i.e.
deterministic) interpretation of evolution in nature and the second a deeply
neutralist (i.e. random) interpretation. Professor Provine will also examine the
history of the interplay between ideas about natural selection and random drift
by focussing upon the controversy over Ernst Mayr's concepts. Finally, the study
will trace the rise of attempts to synthesize neutralist and selectionist
interpretations, in regard to both microevolution and macroevolution. This study
promises greatly to enhance our understanding of how scientific theories
develop, interact with their competitors, and finally themselves evolve in the
scientific process of selection of the most viable explanation for natural
phenomena. Thus the study will contribute to the history and philosophy of
science as well as to the understanding of contemporary evolutionary thought.
