The primary objective of this research is to generate squeezed state light via
intracavity four-wave mixing in a resonant atomic vapor, and to verify the
quadrature noise squeezing of this light through optical detection. A method is
proposed to generate squeezed states, a phenomenon which has yet to be
physically observed, using degenerative four-wave mixing. This phenomenon has no
classical analog and is a pure quantum effect. This research is experimental in
nature to prove the theory and, if successful, could be significant in important
applications. There are profound implications in the field of communications,
computing, and spectroscopy.
