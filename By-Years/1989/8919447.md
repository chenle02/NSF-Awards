The ability of some freshwater and marine microalgae to ingest particulate food
is a remarkable and ecologically significant behavior. Despite the important
implications of this behavior for the flow of energy and nutrients in plankton
communities and for the survival strategies of the algae, there has been
relatively little experimental work to establish constraints on this behavior
(i.e., maximum ingestion rates), to examine the potential physiological benefits
to the mixotroph (e.g., acquisition of C,N, or P), or to determine the
competitive advantage that this behavior might confer on the alga. This project
will continue research to obtain baseline data on this important, but generally
overlooked, group of free-living protists. Goals for future work are to continue
to examine freshwater and marine isolates of mixotrophic algae in laboratory
culture for their ability to consume particulate food. In addition, a survey of
10 lakes of varying trophic status and several environments in the North
Atlantic Ocean will be conducted for the presence and abundance of mixotroph
algae, and the rates of bacterial consumption by these species. Project fundings
will contribute to ecological theory and the knowledge base with potential
application to water pollution control.
