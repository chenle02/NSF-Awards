Yang This is a supplement to provide a Research Opportunity Award (ROA) for a
faculty member at an urban undergraduate minority institution. The visiting
faculty member is studying the caching behavior of an interval Newton method for
solving large systems of nonlinear equations. Both analytical and experimental
techniques are being used to determine the caching behavior of several
algorithms for solving systems of equations. Caching behavior is being studied
on both existing vector computers and on the new cache organization that has
been designed by the principal investigator.
