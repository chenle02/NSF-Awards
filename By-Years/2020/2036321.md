This MRS Symposium will focus on current and emerging strategies for bioinspired
synthesis and manufacturing of materials. Over the past 3 decades, biological
materials have been an area of intense study owing to their precise control over
molecular chemistry and hierarchical assembly that gives rise to unique emergent
properties. Tremendous progress has been made to understand the structure-
property relationships within such materials; however, production at scale
remains a critical challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
