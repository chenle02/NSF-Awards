This award will help support the Seminar on Stochastic Processes. This seminar,
now in its twelfth year, provides an opportunity for dissemination and
discussion of research in the areas of Markov processes, potential theory and
stochastic analysis. The seminar is to be held at the University of Washington.
This award will provide partial travel support for women, minorities, recent
Ph.D.s, and graduate students, who may not otherwise have been able to attend
the conference.
