9451126 Dural This project will supplement the chemical engineering curriculum
by adding laboratory experiments which will expose the students to two major
areas: air pollution control and industrial waste water purification. The first
experiment will demonstrate removal of volatile organic compounds from
contaminated air by activated carbon adsorption. A fixed bed adsorption unit
currently being used to demonstrate helium/nitrogen separation will be replaced
with the air pollution experiment, and modified to enable the removal of multi
component pollutant mixtures. The second experiment will demonstrate renovation
of industrial waste streams by reverse osmosis. A pilot scale reverse osmosis
system will be designed and used to purify a simulated aqueous process stream
containing a mixture of contaminants. The system will permit the students to
examine the process variables such as applied pressure, feed concentration,
temperature, and feed flow rate on solute rejection and water recovery while
they are gaining hands-on experience with a widely used waste treatment method.
