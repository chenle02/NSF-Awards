A composite allochthonous super terrane now constitutes much of western
Washington, British Columbia and southern Alaska. Paleomagnetic and
paleobiologic data suggest that the western part of this terrane was assembled
in equatorial latitudes and that during Late Cretaceous - early Tertiary time
the composite terrane moved northward toward its present position along the
western margin of North America. Several hypotheses concerning the tectonics of
final emplacement will be tested in this study. These are that Late Jurassic to
earliest Cretaceous deformation within the terrane was a response to sinistral
oblique conver- gence, that early to mid-Cretaceous deformation was dominantly
convergent and that the onset of dextral transcurrent deforma- tion began in
late Cenomanian time. Strata of the Middle Jurassic to late Cretaceous Tyaughton
basin should record these postulated events in faults of small displacement.
This study will determine the paleo-stress by analysis of macro and micro
structural data from younger units and subtracting results from successively
older units. By this back-stripping, a history of paleostress will be obtained
that will allow hypotheses to be tested.
