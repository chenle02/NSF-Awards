The brains's basal ganglia are involved in the control of motor and cognitive
functions. The striatum, their primary input structure, receives excitatory,
glutamatergic input from virtually the entire cortex. The striatum is composed
of two histochemically and connectionally distinct compartments, the patch (or
striosome) and matrix regions. In the adult rat, the cortical inputs to the
striatum are segregated such that deep-layer cortical cells, particularly those
from the pre-limbic areas, project primarily to the patch neurons, and
superficial-layer cortical cells, particularly those from the agranular motor
regions, project primarily to the matrix neurons. The mechanisms by which
different inputs from the cortex segregate into the patch and matrix
compartments are not known. The goal of this research planning grant is to
provide a foundation for studying the mechanisms underlying the segregation of
cortical afferents to the patch and matrix compartments within the mouse
striatum. To accomplish this goal, the developmental time course of the cortical
inputs to the mouse striatum will be determined. It is hypothesized that axons
from mouse cortical neurons of the deep and superficial layers first project
homogeneously throughout the striatum and only later restrict themselves to the
patch and matrix compartments. This hypothesis will be tested by using a
fluorescent carbocyanine dye to trace cortical axons to the patch and matrix
regions of the striatum in the developing and adult mouse. The mouse will be
used in these experiments to facilitate future studies employing genetic
manipulation of the glutamate system. These results will lay the foundation for
a series of experiments investigating the overall hypothesis that glutamate,
acting through NMDA receptors, influences the segregation of corticostriatal
innervation into the patch and matrix compartments.
