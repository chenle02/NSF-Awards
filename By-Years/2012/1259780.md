Major themes of the International Conference on Cognitive and Neural Systems
(ICCNS) are: How does the brain control behavior? How can technology emulate
biological intelligence? The conference is aimed at researchers and students in
experimental and theoretical cognitive science and neuroscience, neural
networks, computer science, neuromorphic engineering, artificial intelligence,
mathematics, and physics. It includes invited lectures by distinguished
scientists and engineers (with good representation of female scholars), and
contributed lectures and posters by students and experts on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a changing
world. There is an emphasis on enabling young scientists and students to present
their work.
