Accurate reference pole information from stable cratonic areas are critical in
paleomagnetic interpretations of rotation and translation. The fact that the
Colorado Plateau has rotated with respect to the North American craton affects
the reliability of one-third of the paleopoles used to define the apparent polar
wander curve. The amount of rotation is not well defined, and recently acquired
evidence suggests that two rotations, rather than one, occurred; both of these
factors limit the accuracy with which the Colorado Plateau paleopoles can be
corrected to be representative of North America. Omission of these one third of
North American paleopoles leaves uncertainties and gaps in the apparent polar
wander curve. This project will sample three formations from which important
poles can be acquired with relative ease and minimal uncertainty. These are the
Early Permian Cutler Formation of the Colorado Palateau and the Late Jurassic
Morrison and Middle Triassic Santa Rosa Formations of the craton. Acquisition of
these poles addresses the amount and number of rotations of the plateau and the
lack of data from certain time periods.
