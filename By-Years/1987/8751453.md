The Cincinnati Museum of Natural History is moving from a long established site
to a new 175,000 square foot facility in a rehabilitated downtown railway
station. The opening permanent exhibition, "Cincinnati: The Pleistocene Legacy,"
will comprise 20,000 square feet of natural history exhibits that present in
depth the geologic, climatic, and biological phenomena of the Ice Age in Ohio.
In addition to large scale, dramatic "walk-through exhibits" and dioramas and
substantial use of collections, a large number of interactive exhibit components
will illustrate different features of the Pleistocene period. NSF support be
concentrated on these interactive components and on work to insure effective
handicapped access for the entire exhibit. This highly regarded project will
cost $2.8 million, matching NSF funds seven times over. It will generate an
annual audience of 875,000 visitors including more than 120,000 school group
visitations.
