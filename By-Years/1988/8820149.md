The principal investigators have proposed a novel idea of using nonlinear 2-d
thin film to obtain circuit integration via reversible nonlinear interface as a
computing element (optical gate). The investigators have already demonstrated
these concepts by designing a thin film binary half-adder which has great
potential for extending the work to both memory and crossbar designs and hence
to more complex computing circuits. Ion or laser-enhanced chemical vapor
deposition or similar techniques will be used to fabricate these novel
structures, which involves the placing of strips of different material on the
same horizontal plane to the order of 10-50 micrometers.
