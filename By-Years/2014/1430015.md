This proposal to fund a research training cruise on the University of
Minnesota's R/V Blue Heron for early career scientists from the Great Lakes
basin. The proposed work will have two goals: 1) teach early career lacustrine
scientists how to acquire, plan for,&lt;br/&gt;and manage cruises aboard UNOLS
ships, possibly having some impact on the long-term decrease in requests for
ship time on UNOLS ships in general; and 2) expose members of the Great Lakes
scientific community, which has an abysmally low submittal rate of proposals to
NSF requesting UNOLS ships, to UNOLS and the academic fleet. This project
mirrors the successful Chief Scientist training program that Dr. Claire Reimers
at Oregon State University has run on ocean-going&lt;br/&gt;ships such as the
R/V Wecoma, New Horizon and Endeavor.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit
:&lt;br/&gt;The training cruise envisioned herein will allow early career
scientists to collect seed data&lt;br/&gt;and test hypotheses for future
proposals to NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;This proposal intends to
educate the next generation of researchers about the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of
UNOLS. This type of outreach between UNOLS and potential users is not only
important for&lt;br/&gt;the broader scientific community, but doubly important
for the Great Lakes community which&lt;br/&gt;seems resistant to using assets
like the UNOLS fleet.
