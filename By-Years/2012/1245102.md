Rapid fabrication machines like laser cutters and 3D printers are becoming
essential to designers seeking to quickly iterate on product prototypes. When
designing for these machines, people typically sketch on paper while in the
early stages of design, and later, laboriously enter their work to a Computer
Aided Design (CAD) tool. However, current design software is hard to use, has a
steep learning curve, and its user interface is typically poorly suited to the
exploratory nature of rapid prototyping. These problems impose a barrier for
many people: students, DIY Makers, and occasional rapid fabrication machine
users may be locked out completely. This team's proposed innovation is embodied
in a sketch-based design tool called Sketch It, Make It. The tool's paper-like
interface lets designers move from idea to CAD without foregoing the advantages
of sketching. The team's prototype employs a dozen unique sketch-based
interaction techniques that enable designers to work roughly, without requiring
precision before details are known or relevant. Whereas most current work on
sketch-based modeling focuses on recognizing entire drawn scenes, this software
recognizes small portions at a time, incrementally. User testing with our
prototype suggests this conversational form of recognition works well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent explosion of low-cost rapid prototyping
hardware echoes a similar explosion of desktop inkjet and laser printers in the
1990s. That desktop printing revolution enabled millions of citizens to produce
documents of all types without the aid of costly graphic design and printing
experts. Similarly rapid fabrication hardware has potential to "democratize" the
production of manufactured goods, but only if citizens have tools that enable
them to design. Sketch It, Make It (and the sketch-based interaction on which it
is based) has the potential to reach several customer segments. First, is a
growing population of digital fabrication users who employ laser cutters and
other CNC equipment like 3D-printers need more appropriate software to design
products. Second, the team sees educational and business applications for the
underlying sketch recognition engine that drives Sketch It Make IT. For example,
a sketch-based tool could recognize and simulate an engineering student's
diagram. By making design more accessible to a greater segment of the population
the team aims to empower people to take an active role in designing and creating
the world around them.
