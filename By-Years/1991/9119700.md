The principal investigator has proposed to employ a relational database for
bacteriophage T4. The T-even bacteriophages have been a key model system in the
development of molecular biology, from the original demonstrations that DNA is
the genetic material and that it functions through an mRNA intermediary to
studies of protein assembly and discovery of the first prokaryotic introns. Now,
the ability to analyze and interrelate vast quantities of data is becoming an
increasingly important aspect of genetic research, and a number of aspects of T4
again make it highly qualified as a model system for testing and initial
implementation of the complex relational databases being developed for this
purpose. The investigator will place much of the current data on T4 (e.g.
sequence data, 2-d protein maps) into a relational database, working together
with both the broad, closely-knit T4 community and with researchers at NCBI and
JIPID who are working intensely on database development. The principal
investigator will continue to work to integrate new data, resolve discrepancies
and make the database available to all interested parties through electronic
network FTP.
