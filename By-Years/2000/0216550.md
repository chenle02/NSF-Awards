0216550&lt;br/&gt;Mussa-Ivaldi&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to design
and develop a specialized robot manipulator with a state-of-the-art augmented-
reality display. This development project is a collaboration of world-leaders in
engineering, robotics, virtual-reality, motor system neuroscience, and
rehabilitation; affiliated with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC),
Northwestern University, the University of Illinois in Chicago and Barrett
Technology Inc, an advanced robotics company based in Cambridge, MA. This system
will be a natural extension of technologies that are currently employed at RIC's
Robotics Lab.&lt;br/&gt;
