Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used
to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
insolution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry of the University
of Virginia to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. Included among the areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following:
1) Synthetic methods and total synthesis of organic compounds 2) Chemical models
of biological systems 3) Structure elucidation/synthesis of natural products
able to mediate chemically interesting tranformations/effects in biochemical
systems.
