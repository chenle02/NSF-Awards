9415716 Buffler The objective of the study is to image the offshore part of the
Chicxulub K/T boundary impact crater, off Yucatan in the Gulf of Mexico. Deep
penetration seismic reflection, wide-angle seismic and refraction measurements
are planned. This is a joint project with the British BIRPS program in the same
area. The PIs will deploy an array of OBSs in two key areas. The data will help
determine the thickness and lateral extent of the melt sheet and basement uplift
associated with the impact. ***
