Drs. Feinman and Abramson are continuing and expanding their elegant studies of
the biological processes underlying learning and memory. Their approach is to
use an animal with a relatively simple nervous system, and, to study the
simplest types of associative learning. The choice of learning model is the eye
withdrawal reflex of the green crab: Eyes are drawn back into the shell in
response to almost all strong stimuli. Like protective reflexes in higher
organisms, it can be modified by experience. Even these animals with primitive
nervous systems can be taught to respond to a previously neutral stimulus by
associating it with a strong stimulus that elicits the response. This
association of stimuli, or Pavlovian conditioning, is one of the most
fundamental processes in animal learning. The relatively simple organization of
the nervous system makes it possible to investigate the role of
neurotransmitters (chemical communicators between nerve cells) in terms of their
relation to behavior and the organization of the nervous system. The
similarities an differences between learning in simple invertebrates and in
higher animals can yield important insights into the molecular, cellular and
organismal processes which underlie learning.
