This project will compare and contrast the magnetospheres of the Earth, Jupiter
and its satellite, Ganymede. The study will provide a theoretical framework for
understanding the roles that are played by the different sizes and rotation
rates of the three objects. The project will involve analytic theory, data
analysis and numerical simulations using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. One
of the important issues to be addressed is the role of magnetic flux tube
interchange, which has been observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere but may or may
not play a role in the Earth's magnetosphere.
