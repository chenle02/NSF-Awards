This award supports a Postdoctoral Fellow?Dr. Douglas Kowalewski?in developing a
regional climate model for the McMurdo area of Antarctica. The project addresses
one of the most interesting questions in Antarctic science: how stable is the
East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS)? The answer is critical to interpreting records
of global climate change from marine sediment cores, as well as modeling sea
level rise associated with global warming. Evidence from the McMurdo Dry Valleys
has been interpreted to indicate that the EAIS has been stable for up to
fourteen million years. However, the ANDRILL marine sediment cores collected
just 100 km offshore support a much more dynamic ice sheet that includes
complete loss of the Ross Ice Shelf, potentially requiring a dynamic EAIS. This
apparent contradiction led to a new hypothesis: perhaps these records are not
contradictory at all? Maybe climate varies dramatically across this region on
scales of tens of kilometers? The hypotheses will be evaluated by a mesoscale
climate model to characterize variations in regional climate. The work is being
performed at the University of Massachusetts.
