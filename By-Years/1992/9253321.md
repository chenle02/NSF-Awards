During this 30-month project four modules will be developed for use in staff
development to enhance the teaching of elementary school science. The materials
will include a set of learning guides and interactive videodiscs to present
theory and rationale and to model innovative approaches to curriculum and
instruction. The modules will focus on innovative instruction (constructivism,
cooperative learning, and learning styles), curriculum emphases (thematic and
STS), equitable teaching, and alternative assessment, and will incorporate the
nature of science and technology, major science concepts, classroom management,
educational technology, and the interrelationship of science and mathematics.
This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement Program because it is
designed to produce high quality materials for staff development in the
effective teaching of elementary school science and will utilize NSF-funded
curricular materials, thus enhancing dissemination of these materials. Non-NSF
cost-sharing is approximately 20% of the amount requested from NSF.
