9322449 Millis This project is one of four in a coordinated campaign that
involves investigators from the University of Arizona, Lowell Observatory,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and NASA Ames Research Center. The groups
will deploy portable, high-speed CCD systems to four sites spaced in longitude
around the globe for the purpose of recording an epochal series of collisions of
various subnuclei of Comet Shoemaker- Levy 9 with the planet Jupiter. The
objectives of the observations are to obtain images of all faces of Jupiter in
several passbands immediately prior to the encounters, to record the flashes
produced by the incoming bolides as seen in light reflected off the Galilean
satellites, to document the changes produced in the planet's appearance as a
result of the impacts, and to record the evolution of affected belts and zones
as the planet settles back to equilibrium.
