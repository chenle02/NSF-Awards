With this award from the Major Reseach Instrumentation (MRI) program, the NSF
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, the University of Delaware will
acquire an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). An XPS measures the binding
energy of the electrons from the chemical elements in a sample. These data
provide identification of the chemical composition of the material. Hence, XPS
is a principal method for the study of surface chemistry, reactivity, and
composition. It is a basic analytical method across a broad spectrum of science
and engineering (STEM) disciplines. This acquisition will be a critical resource
for the State of Delaware. It will serve other institutions in Delaware
including Delaware State University, an HBCU. The instrument will be open access
and remotely accessible broadening its availability. It will be used in
undergraduate and graduate level courses to train the next generation of
scientists in state-of-the-art analysis techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially
in areas such as studying (a) fuel cell performance; (b) photovoltaic materials;
(c) catalyst characterization; (d) geomicrobiology; (e) orthopaedic materials;
(f) magnetic materials; (g) solid state ionics; (h) functional biomaterials; (i)
atmospheric and analytical chemistry; and (j) membrane design.
