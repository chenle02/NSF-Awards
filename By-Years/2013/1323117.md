Indianapolis / City as Living Laboratory (I/CaLL) is a city-wide civic
collaboration engaging in cross-sector research that builds on prior research in
informal science learning in public settings. It extends research in place-based
and service learning traditions, and uses the city itself as an informal science
learning (ISL) environment for Science and Engineering for Environmental
Sustainability learning outcomes. This project is creating place-based science
learning experiences as part of public spaces in Indianapolis and establishes
the next generation of urban science museums that increase opportunities for
learning. The project will develop a self-sustaining program for art/science
collaborations as they inaugurate city-sanctioned changeable installations at
I/CaLL sites. Data from the project will be used to inform ISL professionals at
museums throughout the community and around the country. Thousands of volunteers
and their families will help create I/CaLL spaces, engage with communities, and
serve as research participants connecting with science learning through site
development. The unprecedented scale of this project provides a full measure of
informal science service learning at a city scale, offering data that can change
how science learning is measured, how people from all walks of life develop
science literacy as part of their social public experience, and embodying the
concept of the city as a living science learning lab. Broader impacts include
the development of the city as an informal science learning environment that
will become a new standard for thinking about what cities as cultural units can
become as we build a resilient Science and Engineering culture for Environmental
Sustainability.
