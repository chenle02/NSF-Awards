9415428 Olgac A control strategy incorporating position feedback with a designed
time delay is used for dynamic suppression of structural vibrations. The delay
in feedback leads to an effective vibration absorber which is tunable in real
time over an extended frequency range. The piezoelectric actuation and vibration
absorption techniques are combined to exhibit high amplitude fidelity over a
wide bandwidth. The new vibration absorber is of immediate use in machine tool,
aerospace and microprocessor disk storage industries. Pratt and Whitney is a
cosponsor of this GOALI project in view of a need to eliminate high frequency
gear box oscillations. Piezoelectric actuation with delayed resonator techniques
are specially suited for such implementations. ***
