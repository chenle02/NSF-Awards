With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Ryan S.
Winburn and John R. Webster of Minot State University will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer. The research projects to be undertaken with this instrument
include a) examination of instrumental factors affecting the accuracy of
Rietveld quantitative X-ray diffraction; b) structure solution of materials; c)
quantitative mineralogical analysis of volcanic rocks as part of petrologic
research; d) determination of structural parameters of volcanic rocks; e)
quantitative mineralogical analysis and determination of structural parameters
in solid solutions for heavy mineral separates from North Dakota sandstones; and
f) clay mineralogy of river embankment slopes to determine correlation with
stability.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have a strong
impact in geochemistry.
