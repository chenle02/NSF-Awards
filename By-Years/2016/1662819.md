Radiotherapy is one of the most effective and commonly used modalities for
cancer treatment. Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to eradicate cancer
cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue as much as possible. However,
if unaccounted for, internal organ motion during radiation delivery may lead to
underdosing of cancer cells or overdosing of normal tissue. Organ motion is of
particular concern in the treatment of lung and abdominal cancers, where
breathing induces large tumor displacement and organ deformation. A recent
technological innovation is a new generation of radiotherapy systems equipped
with on-board magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners providing a real-time
high-contrast movie of the patient's anatomy during radiation delivery. This
research will develop the methods to enable use of real-time imaging to control
the progress of radiation delivery in order to correct for any dose discrepancy,
thus allowing treatment plans to actively adjust to anatomical changes. If
successful, the research will provide clinicians with real-time organ-motion
management tools that have the potential to improve the delivery efficiency and
radiation dose conformity for MRI-guided radiotherapy, leading to higher rates
of disease control and fewer side effects for cancer patients, thus improving
their quality of life after treatment. The project will provide support for a
graduate student who will benefit from the multi-disciplinary research
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research employs medical-image processing
techniques to infer the time-dependent state of the patient's anatomy from the
stream of MRI sequences and to estimate the cumulative delivered dose in real-
time. Using the inferred anatomical information, a stochastic model will be
developed to project the immediate future trajectory of the anatomical motion.
The cumulative dose estimation and the projected anatomical trajectory will be
integrated as feedback and feed-forward control signals, respectively, into a
stochastic control problem, which will be solved dynamically to (re)optimize the
radiotherapy plan over the remainder of the treatment session. The control
approach will be tested on clinical cancer patients previously treated with MRI-
guided radiotherapy at a collaborating cancer center to quantify the anticipated
improvement in plan quality and delivery efficiency. The project also provides a
foundation from which to quantify the value of real-time MRI information.
