Proposal DMS-0401328&lt;br/&gt;PI: Peter Sternberg (Indiana
University)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Singular structures arising from variational
problems &lt;br/&gt; in materials
science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal
focuses on a study of singular structures that arise in&lt;br/&gt;the solution
to various variational problems modeling materials. These&lt;br/&gt;structures
include Ginzburg-Landau vortices in models for
superconductors,&lt;br/&gt;blister patterns in models for thin film delamination
and segregation&lt;br/&gt;patterns in models for diblock copolymers.
Mathematically, all of these&lt;br/&gt;models involve singular perturbations of
nonconvex variational problems. The&lt;br/&gt;tools that will be brought to bear
include ideas from Gamma convergence and&lt;br/&gt;a careful examination of the
second variation of the energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal
involves an investigation of material behavior based on a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical
study of the energy&lt;br/&gt;associated with various physical configurations.
The materials to be studied&lt;br/&gt;include superconductors and related
devices, thin films which have been laid&lt;br/&gt;on top of a substrate for
manufacturing purposes, and diblock&lt;br/&gt;copolymers--soft "designer"
materials formed by two self-segregating species&lt;br/&gt;of molecules. Based
on the principle that materials naturally configure&lt;br/&gt;themselves so as
to expend the least amount of energy possible, one brings&lt;br/&gt;to bear
mathematical tools from the calculus of variations so as to
better&lt;br/&gt;understand the behavior of these materials.&lt;br/&gt;
