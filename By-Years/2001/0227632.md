The project will investigate aspects of unbalanced dynamics relevant to the
tropical and extratropical atmosphere. Unbalanced motions, by definition, result
when the balance between major geophysical forces (e.g., the pressure-gradient
and Coriolis forces) is perturbed. The adjustment, or reestablishment of
equilibrium, is accompanied by transient motions and/or wave propagation, such
as gravity waves, inertial instability, etc. Dr. Dunkerton (Northwest Research
Associates, Bellevue, Washington) will extend the analysis of inertial
adjustment (resulting in zero potential vorticity in the adjusted region) from
axisymmetric 2D flow configurations to non-symmetric 3D flows perturbed by
Rossby waves in the winter hemisphere. Dr. Dunkerton will also investigate the
triggering of deep moist tropical convection by gravity waves and other
transient motions that are excited in the balance-restoring processes. The role
of SST gradients and curvature in forcing the tropical Hadley circulation will
also be analyzed. The project will advance our understanding of fundamental
dynamical processes operative in atmosphere, and contribute to improved modeling
of dynamical interactions between the hemispheres, triggering of deep
convection, and ocean-atmosphere coupling (via the Hadley circulation).
