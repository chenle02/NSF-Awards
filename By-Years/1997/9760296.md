*** 9760296 Taylor This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore a novel electrochemical process for final surface finishing
of superalloys. Non-traditional machining technologies, such as electrochemical
machining (ECM) and electric discharge machining (EDM) , provide near net shape
machining of these and other difficult to machine materials or for applications
with complex shapes, such as dies, molds, and aircraft parts. However, after ECM
or EDM processes, time-consuming robotically controlled precision or manual
polishing is required to do the final surface finish. Phase I will demonstrate a
modulated reverse electric field process for final surface finishing. A model
tool and die geometry, made from a commercially important superalloy, will be
utilized to study electrochemical parameters critical to the quality of a
finished surface. The electrochemical process is expected to achieve a surface
finish less than 20 microns. Final finishing processes account for at least 25%
of total processing time and in the case of manual finishing are operator
specific. This novel process will find applications aerospace, automotive, die
casting, and hot forging industries. ***
