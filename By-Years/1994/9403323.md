9403323 Emlen Males in natural populations of the dung beetle Onthophagus
acuminatus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) occur in two discrete forms: those larger
than a "critical" size have a pair of large frontal horns, a deeply indented
prothorax, and wide heads with an upturned frontal lip while males smaller than
the "critical" size lack horns, have a smooth prothorax, and a narrower head
without frontal lip. The developmental basis of this morphological dimorphism in
males will be investigated by examining larval hormonal and growth processes
that underlie horn expression and other developmentally linked traits correlated
with horn morphology. %%% Effects of (proximate) developmental mechanisms on
directions of (ultimate) phenotypic evolution will be revealed by the research.
This study of condition- or environment-sensitive expression of developmental
morphology sets the stage for greater understanding of the relationship between
microevolutionary change and macroevolution. Such knowledge enhances our
appreciation of the Earth's biodiversity and how it came into existence.
Generally, studies of insect developmental patterns have potential for guiding
safe but effective biological control strategies. ***
