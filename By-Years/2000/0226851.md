CADRE: NETwork-computer for Computer Architecture Research and Education
(NETCARE)

This award provides support for NETCARE (NETwork-computer for Computer
Architecture Research and Education), an infrastructure supporting a repository
of computer architecture tools, to be managed by a consortium of three
universities: Purdue University, University of Wisconsin and Northwestern
University. NETCARE will use the PUNCH network computing software developed at
Purdue University, to provide the user interface, manage the repository of
architecture tools, and perform high-level scheduling and dedicated resource
access control. Condor, a resource management system that uses idle CPU cycles
of networked workstations, developed at the University of Wisconsin, will be
used to perform low-level scheduling and management of resources. NETCARE will
be universally accessible through conventional World Wide Web browsers and will
provide software tools and computing resources for the computer architecture
research and education community.
