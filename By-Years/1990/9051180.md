The Shannon Point Marine Center is developing innovative programs in
undergraduate teaching and student research in marine science, for students at
Western Washington but also students from local community colleges. Revisions in
the Marine Algae course emphasize ecological physiology and experimental
phycology by the application of modern techniques to study the biology of marine
plants. Radioisotopes and fluorometry are being used as tools to study organic
carbon, nutrient, and energy cycles as well as algal biomass and growth. The
Marine Ecology course is applying radiotracers to study feeding and energy
transformation in invertebrates. Workshops are being run to train community
college faculty and students, WWU science majors and independent study students
in the use of radioisotopes and fluorometry as tools in scientific investigation
of marine systems. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
