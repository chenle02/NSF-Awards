9512456 Sutton This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation) Award is
to partially fund the development of a materials characterization facility with
emphasis on testing in an aggressive environment. The long range goal of the
research involved is life-prediction methodologies using mathematical models
which incorporate accurate material parameters. Much existing data shows that
safety throughout the lifetime of a structure is extremely sensitive to the
environment, however except in very special cases there is inadequate ability to
predict how safety changes as structures age. This facility will contribute to
providing better experimental data in this area. ***
