The objective of this project is to enhance learning of concepts and problem-
solving skills by engaging students with hypermedial tools throughout the
curriculum. A microcomputer- based laboratory consisting of student workstations
networked with a server are incorporated into the introductory core curriculum
courses (Diversity, Ecology/Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, and
Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology), a research methods course, upper
division elective courses, and non-major's courses to enhance the teaching of
major biological concepts and scientific problem-solving skills. Interactive
object-oriented software (utilizing a Macintosh interface) serve as the platform
to address learning of concepts through a) computer databases, b) simulations,
c) computer-based data collection exercises, and d) data analysis exercises of
laboratory or field-collected data. Problem-solving skills are addressed with
hypermedial tools that provide a) database support, b) graphical support, c)
statistical support, and d) productivity support.
