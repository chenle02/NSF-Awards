Technical abstract: The condensation of ferrofluids in both zero and applied
fields is of fundamental and applied interest. It is proposed to investigate the
following aspects of this field: 1) Phase separation in zero magnetic field; 2)
new structure induced by an externally applied magnetic field, and 3) Glassy
behavior due to competing interactions and disorder in the system. The study is
guided by searching the relation between geometry, structure, and dynamics and
understanding the effect of frustration on the physical properties of the
system. Results from this work will not only improve the existing technology but
will also lead to new directions and greater potential for future applications.
Nontechnical abstract: A ferrofluid/magnetic colloid is a system consisting of
magnetic nanoparticles (typically 100 in diameter) suspended in a nonmagnetic
solvent. It has wide industrial applications such as vacuum feed- throughs,
shaft seals used in computer disk drives, mechanical power transmission, etc.
However, many of the fascinating aspects of the physics of ferrofluids have not
been worked out. Amazingly, mechanisms governing many phenomena observed in the
system are intimately related to some fundamental questions in condensed matter
and statistical physics. It is planned to carry out a comprehensive
investigation of structure, dynamics, and magnetic properties of ferrofluids
with emphasis on understanding the interplay between geometry, structure, and
dynamics. Results from this work will provide new directions for improving the
existing technology and will lead to even greater potential for future
applications.
