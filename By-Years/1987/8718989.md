The primary aim of the proposed research project is to use logic programming to
prototype high-level language compilers which produce highly optimized code for
sequential and parallel machines. The proposed areas of research are: (1)
program analysis based on abstract interpretation, (2) optimized code generation
for sequential and parallel logic programs, (3) compile-time and run-time
garbage collection, (4) graphical debugging and profiling, and (5) compilation
of extensions of Prolog in which unification is replaced by constraint solving.
The research is focussed on logic programming languages, but the techniques
developed may also be applicable to other programming language paradigms.
