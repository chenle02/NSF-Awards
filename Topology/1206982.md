We describe ideas and approaches to three projects. The first is to find surface
subgroups for certain natural classes of groups: the fundamental group of a
negatively curved rank 1 locally symmetric space, or more generally of a closed
negatively curved manifold; a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is
connected; or the mapping class group of a compact surface. The second project
is to count "virtual immersions" of a geometrically finite open 3-manifold into
a closed hyperbolic 3- or 4-manifold, with an aim toward assembling these
virtual immersions into a virtual immersion of a more complex 3-manifold (and
inductively counting the number of such immersions). The third project is to
develop the theory of degenerate complex structures (with something like
measured laminations), and use this theory to prove bounds for renormalization
of quadratic-like maps, and to provide a sufficient condition for a finite
subdivision rule to be conformally realized, with an eye towards proving the
Cannon conjecture.

One of the fundamental jobs of the mathematical researcher is to classify the
objects that we have defined. A manifold is a space with some number of
dimensions, with no boundaries or edges but which is finite in extent. Examples
of two-dimensional manifolds include the surface of the Earth and the surface of
an inner tube; the two-dimensional manifolds have been classified since the
early twentieth century. Recent results including the work of the proposer have
made it possible to classify three-dimensional manifolds as well; this
classification is made possible by finding two-dimensional objects within the
three-dimensional manifold that divides it in such a way as to elucidate its
structure. Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a much deeper understanding of the
three-dimensional space that we live in.
