I. The Principal Investigator, David Eisenbud, will support the
travel&lt;br/&gt;from the US of participants in the International Workshop on
"Algebra&lt;br/&gt;and Geometry' to be held at the University of Hyderabad,
India, 7-12&lt;br/&gt;December, 2001, website
&lt;http://202.41.85.102/icag.htm&gt;. The main&lt;br/&gt;themes of the Workshop
will be Commutative Algebra and Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, Computational
Algebraic Geometry, and Quantum Algebra.&lt;br/&gt;In each of these topics there
will be one or two survey talks&lt;br/&gt;and several research talks. Plenty of
time will be reserved for&lt;br/&gt;discussions between the participants, and it
is expected that new&lt;br/&gt;collaborations and research associations between
Indian and&lt;br/&gt;US mathematicians will come from these
contacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;II. In recent years both US and Indian
mathematicians have made&lt;br/&gt;major contributions to the fields of
Commutative Algebra, &lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry, and Quantum Algebra. These
three fields&lt;br/&gt;increasingly use tools from Computational Algebraic
Geometry&lt;br/&gt;to check conjectures and to aid research. They also
contribute&lt;br/&gt;tools which are used in the computational systems that
underly&lt;br/&gt;robotics, cryptography, and other national applications of
&lt;br/&gt;strategic interest. The proposed conference will foster
&lt;br/&gt;collaboration in these fields between the US and Indian communities.
