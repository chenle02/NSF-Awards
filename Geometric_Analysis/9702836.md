9702836 Yau This project deals with research in complex geometry. More
specifically, the investigator is to pursue the classification problem for
Cauchy-Riemann manifolds, the complex Plateau problem, and the problem of
estimating integral points in tetrahedra. The problem of estimating the number
of integer points in tetrahedra has applications in number theory as well as
algebraic geometry. In particular, such an estimate can be ussed to find better
primality testing and factoring algorithms. The complex Plateau problem is a
fundamental problem in complex geometry: it seeks to describe those manifolds
that can arise as the boundaries of complex domains.
