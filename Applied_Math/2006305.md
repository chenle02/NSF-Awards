Queueing theory is a branch of applied probability and operations research that
studies waiting lines. The research in this field is well-motivated by real-life
applications where resources can be allocated based on predicted waiting times,
for example in call centers, health care, and cloud computing. Traditionally, in
controlled queueing problems, it is assumed that the parameters of the
underlying random models are known. In this project, the investigator will
account for uncertainty by assuming the more realistic case where the parameters
of the model are unknown. The project will generate policies that are easy to
implement and broadly applicable for queueing network models under uncertainty,
which will lead to better performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the
project aims to develop new mathematical tools and techniques for these
problems. The models in this project stem from real-world problems and the
results will impact both applied probability and operations research. This
research project will support under-represented minority groups and train both
graduate and undergraduate students.

This research project is on the asymptotic analysis of controlled queueing
systems under heavy traffic with uncertainty about the parameters of the model.
Two types of uncertainty are considered: Knightian and Bayesian. In the
Knightian case, the decision-maker considers a worst-case criterion to be
minimized by taking into account a class of models. The asymptotic analysis is
performed using a limiting stochastic game, where the involved players are the
decision-maker and an adversary player. In the Bayesian case, the decision-maker
has a prior belief on the parameters of the model, which is continuously updated
by observing the system. Here, the learning aspect of the optimization problems
is of interest. The exploration/exploitation nature suggests a connection to
multi-armed bandit problems. The research objectives are: (1) to develop a
comprehensive theoretical framework that builds uncertainty about the queueing
models into the diffusion scaling heavy traffic regime, balancing between
capturing uncertainty and robustness, and attaining easy-to-implement policies;
(2) to consider simple policies, which are known to be asymptotic optimal in the
case without uncertainty, and to examine their performance under uncertainty;
and (3) to combine the following streams of research: queueing theory, diffusion
approximations, uncertainty, and learning, and moreover, to develop new
mathematical results beyond what is known in each stream considered separately.
