Lead is a trace metal that has historically been emitted into the atmosphere
through human activities such as coal burning and the use of leaded gasoline
followed by deposition into the ocean. Once introduced into the marine
environment, lead is dispersed via currents and removed by biota and other
sinking particles. This century-scale growth of lead emissions followed by a
decline upon the phase-out of leaded gasoline is one of the great global
geochemical experiments. In this study, researchers at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology will analyze archived seawater samples to improve our
knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability of lead concentrations and
lead isotope ratios. This data will yield new insights into the sources and
transport of lead and other metals, document the time-evolving human footprint
on the ocean, and assist with validating models.

Broader Impacts: The study will improve our understanding of factors influencing
lead chemistry in the ocean and provide educational opportunities for graduate
and post-doctoral students in the biogeochemistry of this element.
