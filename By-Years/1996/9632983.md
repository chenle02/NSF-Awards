9632983 Roemmich Support is provided to continue the high-density, eddy
resolving eXpendable Bathymetric Thermometer (XBT) transects in the Pacific
Ocean. The XBT network is designed to observe the modes of variability in ocean
circulation on annual to decadal time scales and on space scales from that of
boundary currents and fronts to ocean basins. A principal objective is to
explore the role of the time varying ocean circulation in climate variability
through redistribution of heat and salt in the upper kilometer. Quarterly XBT
transects on board commercial ships will be conducted for an additional three
years and a data archive will be accessible via the World Wide Web. The Analysis
will focus on the transport of mass, heat and salt by ocean currents and on the
interpretation of observed variability using a variety of complementary data
sets like satellite altimetry, broadscale XBTs, air-sea fluxes.
