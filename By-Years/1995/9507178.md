Non-Technical Summary IBN 95-07178 Evolution of Social Systems Robert R. Warner
The objective of Dr. Warner's research is to employ a new approach to the study
of the evolution of social systems. He will use a well-known marine fish (the
bluehead wrasse) as a model system. Initially, the study employs a mathematical
modeling technique in which the decisions of one group (e.g., subordinate males)
act as inputs to the decision-making process in another group (e.g., females)
and vice-versa. In this way, Warner will explore how several groups interact and
resolve conflicts; the social system is an outcome of this resolution. Secondly,
he will quantify an important part of the model by using DNA techniques to
relate effort in producing gametes to resulting paternity. This is particularly
important to know in situations where gamete competition occurs. Lastly, the PI
will test the predictions of the model in a series of manipulative field
experiments. These will include (1) studies of allocation of energy by males
between gamete production and defense; (2) a test of the hypothesis that
courtship behaviors can indicate local safety; and (3) studies of allocation of
aggression by males.
