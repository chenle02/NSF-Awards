The direct synthesis of high temperature materials by combustion can proceed in
different fashion depending upon the phases of the reactants. When one reactant
is a gas and the other is a compact powder, the process is termed filtration
combustion. Various analyses of solid-solid combustion and an initial analysis
of the planar counter-flow mode (ie., the reactant gas velocity and the
combustion wave move in opposite directions) have already been completed. The
current research will extend this to include the co-flowing and diffusional
modes of filtration combustion. Additionally, the following topics will be
addressed: transient modes of propagation (stable and unstable), nonadiabatic
effects, two-step kinetics, effects of melting of the reactant, densification
during reaction, and application of adaptive pseudospectral methods to
numerically modelling multi-dimensional flame propagation. Self-propagating high
temperature synthesis is an innovative method for fabrication of ceramic and
metallic materials. The theoretical study, to be performed in collaboration with
the Chernogolovka Institute of Structural Macrokinetics as part of the US-USSR
Cooperation in the Field of Basic Scientific Research Program, will yield
insight into the complex phenomena involved. The results will aid in explaining
past observed behavior and designing future experiments necessary to make the
process competitive.
