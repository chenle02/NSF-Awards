In the early universe, massive galaxies grew rapidly through intense bursts of
star formation, and then quenched (abruptly stopped forming stars at high
rates). Principal Investigators Papovich and Marchesini will use the Second
Florida Multi-Object Imaging Near-Infrared Grism Observational Spectrometer
(FLAMINGOS2, F2) on the Gemini-South Telescope to conduct a census of these
distant massive galaxies and study the underlying physical processes that
transform the galaxies from star forming to quenched. The team will participate
in Warrior-Scholar boot camps at Texas A&amp;M University, which assist students
as they transition from active military service to higher education. In
addition, the team will mentor a summer student selected from the Tufts
University Visiting and Early Research Scholars Experience Program. This program
has a partnership with Historically Black Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
team are using their custom built near infrared blue filter (centered at 2.0
micron) and red filter (centered at 2.3 micron) in order to be sensitive to the
4000 Angstrom/Balmer break for galaxies at redshifts 3 &lt; z &lt; 6. The team
will conduct the 0.5 square degree F2 Extragalactic Near-IR K-Split Survey
(FENIKS). The survey will image three deep legacy fields, the Cosmic Evolution
Survey, the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey â€“ South, and the Ultra Deep
Survey. The team will study the stellar populations and supermassive black holes
in massive (log(M/Msun) &gt; 10.9) galaxies and determine when galaxies first
begin to quench. The team will also identify and study hundreds of extreme
galaxies with intense nebular emission, which are important in the context of
galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
