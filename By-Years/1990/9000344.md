The Organic Synthesis Program is funding this research. Dr. Meyers will continue
his very fruitful development of new methods for synthesizing optically active
materials. Many of the molecules used in treating diseases are optically active
and this work has the potential to provide new routes for their synthesis.
Metalation of chiral formamidines using butyllithiums, followed by alkylation
with various electrophiles, gives C-C bonds adjacent to nitrogen in very high
enantioselectivity. This process has now entered the advanced stage whereby
complex alkaloids and other nitrogen-containing substances are being explored.
Future efforts will center on quaternary carbon derivatives and attempts to
reach a number of spiroisoquinoline alkaloids in high enantiomeric excess. A
search for more efficient and readily available chiral auxiliaries will also be
undertaken to increase the % ee's of the quaternary alkylated products. In
addition to the quaternary carbon stereocenters, asymmetric total syntheses will
be attempted at suitable targets of biological importance. Other studies will
focus on mechanistic aspects of this process using Li-NMR, molecular modeling,
and isotopic derivatives in an effort to clarify the nature and reactivity of
the organolithium intermediates. Finally, mechanistic information, already in
hand, has provided a clue that facile resolutions may be accomplished as an
alternative means of reaching these optically active amines.
