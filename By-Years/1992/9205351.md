This award will provide funding to upgrade an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
and to make improvements in the sample preparation facilities of the X-ray
fluorescence laboratory in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at
Washington University in St. Louis. The upgrade will allow this facility to
achieve state-of-the-art analytical capability for the analysis of major and
trace elements in rocks and minerals at a fraction of the cost of purchasing a
new instrument. The XRF laboratory is run as a departmental facility open to all
members of the Washington University community and to regional users from other
midwestern universities and colleges, including members of the PEW Consortium of
undergraduate institutions.
