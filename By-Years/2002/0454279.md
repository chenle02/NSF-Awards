Effective, Large-scale Storage Infrastructure for CMU Researchers
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Investigators at Carnegie-Mellon University
will build a prototype large-scale storage infrastructure from cost-effective
components and explore computer science and applications research with this
equipment. Researchers will acquire approximately 100 Terabytes of storage; it
will be deeply instrumented to acquire information on workload, faults,
administrative tasks, power and other parameters to support research on fault
tolerance and self-management. Applications, including network intrusion
research, design and testing of circuits, and nanotechnology will provide
realistic workloads as well as be supported to enable advances in these research
areas. Broader impacts of this include creation of cost effective storage
architectures to support data intensive science and engineering
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
