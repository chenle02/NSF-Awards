PROPOSAL NO.: 0230023&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Nix,
Stephan&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Florida Atlantic University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
The Bridge: Connecting Basic Math and Science with Engineering
Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will design
and plan the implementation of an engineering systems core for all Florida
Atlantic University engineering students that will use the engineering science
fundamentals to bridge mathematics and the basic sciences with discipline
studies and design. The systems approach will use the&lt;br/&gt;framework of
mathematical modeling to bring the engineering science fundamentals to life,show
the integrated and nterconnected nature of the seemingly disparate parts of an
engineering problem, demonstrate how common the fundamentals are to all
disciplines, and to expose students to the value of modeling and systems
analysis in the design process. We believe that a well-integrated, carefully-
managed, and practice-oriented systems core will result in measurable and
significant improvements in the understanding of engineering science
fundamentals, mathematics knowledge and skills, engineering design creativity
and acumen, student retention, and performance on the Fundamentals of
Engineering examination.&lt;br/&gt;
