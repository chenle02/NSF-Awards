It is proposed to investigate the role which collisional processes play in
modifying the interaction of radiation fields with atoms. The techniques to be
used involve the derivation of a transport-type equation which accounts for both
the atom-field and collisional interactions. Work on the inclusion of
polarization effects and velocity-changing collisional effects will be combined
to obtain a comprehensive theory of line shapes in four-wave mixing. It is
proposed to explain pressure-induced extra resonances in a unified manner using
conservation of energy arguments, with applications to four wave mixing, quantum
beats and photoionization. Studies will be undertaken of the interaction of
radiation fields with trapped atoms, including transient responses, radiation
emitted and the role of collisional processes on the atom-field interaction.
