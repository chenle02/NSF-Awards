9423575 Meirovitch The project will develop a comprehensive approach to the
problem of mitigating the effects of earthquakes on structures through passive
and active controls. The passive control through base isolation and damping
materials will be considered. The active control represents digital nonlinear
control in the presence of stochastic disturbances. it is proposed to study a
combination of the passive and active control schemes to achieve best
performance. The plan is to combine analytical developments with practical
considerations, such as computational burden and sensor and actuator technology,
to design and implement structural control. ***
