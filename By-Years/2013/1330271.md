This engineering education research project will develop the software and high
school curricula to teach programming using mobile devices that will allow
students to walk around and interact with each other as they develop programs
for virtual robotics competitions. The project is driven by the hypothesis that
a mobile, collaborative programming platform will improve learning outcomes in
designing, generating, and evaluating algorithmic knowledge. The hypothesis has
been subdivided into four measurable outcomes focusing on learning, transfer of
programming knowledge, engagement, and procedures. Both learning and system
development are addressed in the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, are to
fundamentally change how students learn computer literacy. Rather than sitting
at a computer to develop programs, students actively move around and interact in
the task of preparing for robot competitions. This work may engage a more
diverse group of students in learning the basics of programming, a key skill for
the 21st century workforce.
