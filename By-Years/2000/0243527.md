This project increases the availability of materials and resources for pre-
service and in-service professional development to better prepare teachers for
serving students with and without disabilities within a standards-based
mathematics curriculum. Building on the lesson study approach and utilizing the
case method, this project develops five modules of professional development
materials. Each module consists of at least two three-hour multimedia case
studies of teaching events involving students with disabilities in mathematics
classrooms as well as activities that guide users in their interaction with the
case materials. Each module focuses on one of the five NCTM content standards
(number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, data analysis and
probability), integrates one or more of the five process standards (problem
solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections and representation) and
highlights key issues that need to be addressed in broadening the preparation of
teachers of students with a variety of disabilities. By focusing on individual
differences, this project will highlight aspects of teaching standards-based
mathematics curriculum for all students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
have an impact on participating teacher educators and teachers, helping them to
acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes to more effectively support students
with varying needs and strengths. The publication and dissemination of the
professional development materials will benefit teachers and teacher educators
nationwide. As a result of improved classroom practices this project hopes to
impact a larger number of students, including students with disabilities, so
that they will achieve standards-based learning outcomes in mathematics. This
project will also make important contributions to the knowledge base about how
to effectively prepare teachers to support students with different abilities and
disabilities in a standards-based curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
