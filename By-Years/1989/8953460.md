This two-year project provides intensive training in mathematics, technology,
and the effective integration of microcomputers and calculators in the
mathematics classroom for sixty teachers in grades 4- 6 from the New York
metropolitan area. The training will reach well beyond the funding period
through the commitment by Hunter College to institutionalize the program. The
project will convey a sense of excitement about the nature of mathematics,
promote imaginative presentations of traditional and new concepts, and provide
guidance for practical and attractive applications of mathematics. The project
also has a heavy minority focus, and will cultivate an awareness of the special
problems faced by minority groups in large metropolitan areas. The participants
will develop activities aimed at alleviating some of these problems.
