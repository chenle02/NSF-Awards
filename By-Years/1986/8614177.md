Basic biochemical equipment will be provided toward the development of an
integrated laboratory for high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, computational biochemistry, computer graphics, and molecular
modeling of biological macromolecules. The equipment will be used in the Center
for Biomolecular Structure and Design at Purdue University. State-of-the-art
techniques in structural biology will be applied in a regional and university
facility. Core research will involve the development of new NMR probes and new
methods for understanding the nature of enzymatic action. Model systems
involving transition state analogues of enzyme complexes will also be analyzed.
One and two dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR data will be used with
computer modeling to define three dimensional architecture of biological
macromolecules in solution. These studies should lead to the design of new
compounds binding to proteins. A wide variety of other biological studies will
also be supported. Computational calculations of the motions or dynamics of
proteins will supplement the experimental measurements to provide a better
understanding of protein function.
