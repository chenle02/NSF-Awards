9505897 Gray The Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign will purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
several research projects, including in particular: i) Stephanie B. Alexander,
Curvature, topology and interior size of Euclidean hypersurfaces and Riemannian
manifolds with boundary. ii) Douglas C. Bowman, Algorithms for q-series
identities. iii) Nick B. Firoozye, Image Segmentation via Wiener's Theorem and
Wavelets iv) John W. Gray, Object-Oriented Category Theory v) Joseph Rosenblatt,
Computational studies in phase retrieval.
