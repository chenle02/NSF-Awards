In this project, the PI will continue his on-going research on the analysis and
algorithm development for the numerical solutions of a certain class of
nonlinear PDE particularly those from gas dynamics and the Hamilton-Jacobi
equations as well as their modified form in the presence of noise. The research
results will be useful in fluid mechanics and stochastic optimal control
problems.
