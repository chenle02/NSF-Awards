International Prices, Costs and Markups&lt;br/&gt;SBE/SES 0820468:
Gourinchas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions of how markets function and the
limits to arbitrage are central for many areas in economics. In the context of
international economics, these questions take the form of determining whether
markets separated by country borders are more or less segmented than regional
markets within a country. The empirical literature that attempts to answer this
question faces two important challenges. First, empirical tests require that the
goods compared are identical. Second, without data on costs or profits, it is
difficult to ascertain whether evidence of price segmentation indicates varying
mark-ups or differences in manufacturers' or retailers' costs across different
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both limitations are addressed in this project.
The PIs use a new confidential dataset with detailed product-level (UPC or
barcode) information from one of the largest North American food and drug
retailers, with stores located in the United States and Canada. The dataset
contains weekly data on 6347 goods sold in 250 US stores (in 19 states) and 75
Canadian stores (in 5 provinces), between 2004:1 and 2007:6 (178 weeks). Since
the dataset contains information on prices, quantities sold and cost of goods,
the PIs can decompose variations in relative prices across locations into their
local relative costs and relative mark-up components.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides new data, the PIs propose to estimate the economic
importance of the border using a new methodology, borrowed from the treatment
effects literature, namely a regression discontinuity design. This design
exploits the precise location of stores and their distance to the border.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary results indicate significant differences in
the behavior of prices within the United States, within Canada, and across
cross-border pairs. The median of the absolute price gap is twice as large for
cross-border stores as compared to within-US pairs. The estimated border effect
over time is found to co-move closely with the US-Canada nominal exchange rate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These finding are important for understanding the sources
of fluctuations in real exchange rates, the transmission of monetary, fiscal and
technology shocks across countries and the impact of nominal exchange rate
movements on relative prices and consequently on the adjustment of external
balances.
