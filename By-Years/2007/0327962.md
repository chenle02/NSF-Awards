SUMMARY

This study focuses on the effects of combustion conditions, various additives,
and pre-processing steps on the formation of fully dense, graded, and random
porous structures derived from nanopowdered reactants. The investigation covers
the effects of particle size, mixing procedure, and the topology of the
resulting particles in the reacting mixture on reaction kinetics and the
microstructure of products. Several exothermic reactions have been selected for
these studies including aluminum/titania, aluminum/niobia, aluminum/nickel, and
aluminum/silicon/nitrogen. Both thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning
calorimetry (TGA/DSC) and nonisothermal techniques are used to evaluate reaction
kinetics of these reactions. In addition, a new combustion diagnostic method
using a gated, intensified CCD camera and a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy
(LIBS) instrument is used to analyze dynamic temperature profiles. Simultaneous
combustion synthesis and uniaxial densification in systems consisting of
reactive nanopowders, such as aluminum, silicon, nickel oxide, or niobia, is
investigated. Comprehensive studies of the effect of protective coatings and
other particle surface treatments on their reactivity, combustion wave
characteristics, and the morphology of resulting products are performed. Also
done are fundamental studies of the formation of nanostructural materials with
graded composition and/or porosity. The dynamics of combustion processes in both
volume combustion (VC) and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS)
regimes in the presence of external forces and/or internal gasification of
additives are modeled mathematically.

Broader impact Experimental research studies, by development of new and faster
response techniques, should lead to better understanding of reaction kinetics in
condensed phase systems. In addition, the research should enhance the knowledge
of the formation of structural materials under strongly non-isothermal
conditions. Findings from these research studies should be beneficial to
materials science, combustion, and reaction engineering communities. This
project provides research opportunities for an existing REU Sites program that
serves tribal colleges. It also underlies cooperative efforts with Germany and
Poland.
