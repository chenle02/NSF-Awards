9711063 Liu This action is to provide travel funds for six US researchers to
attend the Okushiri Tsunami Workshop '98, to be held in Hakodate and Okushiri,
Japan, 12-16 July 1998. The workshop is being organized by Dr. Fumihiko Iamamura
of Tohoku University, Japan. This is the third international workshop focusing
on the runup of a tsunami onto a coastline. The first workshop was held at
Catalina Island, CA in 1990, the second at Friday Habor, WA in 1995, both being
supported entirely the National Science Foundation. The Okushiri tsunami
workshop also marks the fifth anniversary of the 1993 devastating Hokkaido
tsunami. Major topics to be discussed are: (1) Runup of a tsunami around an
island, (2) Tsunami generation by landslides and tectonic movements, (3) Local
tsunami runup, and (4) Disaster prevention and reconstruction. The PI will
establish close communication, via Internet electronic mail, with US tsunami
researchers who are unable to attend the workshop. ***
