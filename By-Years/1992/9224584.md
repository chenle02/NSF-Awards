This award will support a research-oriented workshop on the state of
quantitative research on gender and women at the aggregate level. The primary
objective of the workshop is to promote improved data production, availability,
reliability, comparability, and use through increased international
collaboration. The workshop, which is being organized by Professor Gloria Young
of American University and Ms. Ana Isabel Garcia of the Mujeres Latinoamericanas
en Cifras Project in San Jose, Costa Rica, will consist of two parts: an
informational part where experts from various regional organizations will
present reports on the current state of quantitative research on gender and
women, and a second part where participants will discuss the quality of data and
strategies to improve it, as well as ways to increase international
collaboration on the production and use of aggregate data on gender and women.
