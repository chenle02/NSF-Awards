This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops a novel,
double-pane window insulated with a sheet of the company’s proprietary super-
insulating aerogel. This aerogel window can achieve a center-of-glass U-factor
of 0.18 BTU/h/ft2/F (1.02 Watt per square meter per Kelvin) and could enable
cost-effective energy savings of 1.2 quadrillion BTUs by 2030, reducing the $20
billion in energy lost each winter in the U.S. In addition to this $3-5 billion
annual market for the aerogel, this work also extends to other markets, such as
transparent doors for refrigeration and ovens, and solar thermal receivers for
process heat (~180 °C), where each represent significant opportunities for
energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions (a $3.3 billion opportunity in
commercial freezer and refrigerator doors, and a $3.0 billion opportunity in
industrial process heat for solar thermal). By 2050, this new material
technology could offset over 1.5 billion tons per year of carbon dioxide
emissions and enable revolutionary designs for more efficient transparent
insulation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project
addresses key technical barriers for inclusion of super-insulating aerogels in
window insulated glass units, focusing on two main risks. This project will: (1)
demonstrate scaling of aerogel sheets to window relevant sizes with adequate
optical and thermal properties, focusing on producing the 14” x 20” standard
test size in the window industry; (2) demonstrate the durability of the aerogel
using materials with these same dimensions for windows, which require 20+ year
product lifetimes. This award will explore key cost drivers for manufacturing
aerogel, create aerogel-insulated window designs, and test a full-scale (greater
than 4 square feet) window prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
