Within this project, five schools that have already been active on the web are
developing, adapting, and testing curricular material using World Wide Web
protocols. The effort has five main goals: (1) Develop and test Internet
accessible curriculum databases using web-based SQL database technology; (2)
Link diverse academic communities in a collaborative learning environment; (3)
Develop new teaching paradigms such as Physlets and Just-In-Time-Teaching; (4)
Evaluate cognitive gains of media-rich and multimedia-focused curricular
material; and (5) Lead curriculum development workshops for physics faculty at
summer and winter meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers and
then organize more extensive national and regional workshops. The project is
adopting a common set of industrial strength commercial tools built around
System Query Language, SQL, database servers. The curriculum database created
will have sufficient generality to be easily replicated at other institutions.
As a result of this project students and instructors will be querying the
database using HTML forms that are designed to meet school specific educational
goals. A formal assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken.
