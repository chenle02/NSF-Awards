One of the interesting aspects of the organisms inhabiting our planet is their
obvious non-random distribution. Giraffes, for example, are found in Africa, and
not South America. This non-random distribution represents a by-product of
biotic evolution coinciding with the earth's geological development. Dr. Jay
Savage, at the University of Miami will study the causes of present
distributions of the Central and South American biota in general, and of four
groups of amphibians and reptiles in particular, using specialized biochemical
and analytical techniques. By determining the evolutionary relationship among
closely related species that have restricted ranges, and then comparing the
pattern of these relationships to hypothesized patterns determined by the
geological history of the region in question, the relevant causes of their
distributions can be determined. Specifically, Dr. Savage will determine the
historical relationship between Middle and South American. As such, this study
will lend important insights into the evolution of this region, both
biologically and geologically.
