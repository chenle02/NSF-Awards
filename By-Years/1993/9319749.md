A principal objective of this mathematical sciences project is the development
of methods for the systematic design of feedback laws leading to the ability to
shape, or at least influence, the steady state response of systems exhibiting
complex dynamical behavior. In particular, the research program focuses on
feedback design methods for problems of asymptotic tracking, disturbance
rejection, and output regulation for nonlinear distributed parameter systems. A
primary objective of this mathematical sciences project is the development of a
methodology to systematically control or influence nonlinear effects which arise
in a variety of physical phenomena. This goal is motivated in part by problems
in combustion control, where nonlinear effects actually can improve mixing and
hence can , in principle, improve the engine performance of automobiles, for
example. Another example of the potential impact of nonlinear control in flluid
flow problems is in the control of instabilities in aerodynamic applications,
which have been experimentally shown to greatly influence stall and lift
behavior of aircraft and which are known to lead to reduction in the life cycle
of aircraft parts. Other applications are to active noise control of various
devises, such as compressors.
