This investigation will study the effect of wind forcing on the mesoscale
circulation of the North Atlantic. A linear (harmonic) shallow water numerical
model of the North Atlantic will be implemented and forced with monthly averaged
winds from 1984 to 1986. The results of the model will be compared to a current
meter record in the central/eastern North Atlantic.
