This project continues research on shared virtual memory for multicomputers and
further research on fault tolerant, real-time, parallel systems based on shared
virtual memory. Such a system will be called persistent shared virtual memory.
The system research is based on the principal investigator's previous research:
shared virtual memory for multicomputers, concurrent real-time methods for
checkpointing, garbage collection, main-memory transaction processing. Design
methods for persistent memory management for a large class of multicomputers are
studied and a persistent shared virtual memory system for the Intel iPSC/2 and
iPSC/i860 multicomputers will be implemented.
