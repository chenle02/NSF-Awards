This award supports a 2-year renewal program to continue research on the
physical and structural properties of the Siple Dome ice core. This work will
include continued monitoring of the core relaxation process, additional
examination of the volcanic ash and dust record preserved in the Siple Dome core
and its relationship to the timing and distribution pattern of widespread infall
of tephra in the Byrd core, and possible climatic implications, additional thin
sectioning of ice from below 800 m to obtain a more accurate picture of the
response of the deeper ice to increased deformation and elevated temperatures,
and measurements of total air content in the basal debris-bearing ice to
evaluate mechanisms by which debris is incorporated at the bed. Especially
intriguing are ongoing attempts to resolve the climate record at Siple Dome and
to refine the time scale. Currently, we are working to obtain the best possible
depth-age scale that utilizes annual layer counting based on visual stratigraphy
and ECM in conjunction with the gas record. Many climate-related records from
the Siple Dome core have recently been presented showing a possible hiatus at
approximately 680 m and a potential major climatic event at around 720 m.
However, the layer structure in the Siple Dome core shows reversed inclined
layering as high as 559 m and evidence of disturbed and steeply inclined
layering in deeper ice. It is critical that we determine whether this kind of
structural disturbance has resulted in discontinuities in the climate record or
is some other structural artifact that has not impacted the continuity of the
record. In addition to conducting further visual examination of the core, we
plan to prepare vertical thick sections in several regions of disturbed ice
structure to determine if the crystal structure reveals evidence of deformation.
Until this is complete, we will not know how deep into the core a continuous
climate record exists.
