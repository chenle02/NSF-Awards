9625796 Clarke This project is to examine the small scale electronic
interconnect damage processes of electromigration voiding and interfacial
decohesion which affect the reliability of integrated electronics. These are
highly localized phenomena which are affected by temperature (from Joule
heating) and stresses. The length scales are much smaller than those of standard
mechanics experiments and therefore new experimental techniques are required.
The proposed measurements are based on the shift and broadening of both the
Raman lines of silicon and the R-line fluorescence of sapphire as a function of
temperature and stress. By exciting the spectra with a finely focussed laser the
local temperature and stress can be measured. A novel micromechanics test will
also be used to measure fracture resistance of interfaces. ***
