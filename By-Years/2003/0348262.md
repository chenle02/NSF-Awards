PI: Lai IBN-0348262 Regulated cell proliferation is essential for normal
development of all organisms. Negative regulators play an important role in
various cell cycle checkpoints to block cell proliferation. Studies on such
negative regulators have greatly advanced our knowledge of cell cycle control
and developmental mechanisms and represent a key area of future research in this
field. Dr. Lai's laboratory has recently discovered a novel family of Mats
proteins, whose function has not been previously studied. The Drosophila Mats
(dMats) gene is essential for early development. Loss of dMats function in
somatic clones results in cell over-proliferation and dramatic outgrowth in
mosaic flies. Importantly, this highly conserved Mats gene family includes two
human Mats genes, hMats1 and hMats2. When introduced into Drosophila Mats
mutants, hMats1 can rescue the cell over-proliferation phenotype, which
indicates that the growth inhibitory function of Mats has been conserved in
evolution. In this project, Dr. Lai plans to elucidate the role of dMats in
regulating cell proliferation through more detailed mutant analysis as well as
characterization of dMats expression during the cell cycle and normal
development. Moreover, mechanisms by which the dMats protein acts to inhibit
cell proliferation will be investigated through molecular and genetic
approaches. Results from this study are expected to shed new light on regulatory
mechanisms that control cell proliferation and development. Because Mats is
highly conserved in evolution, elucidation of its role in cell cycle control
using the Drosophila system will help in understanding how Mats function is
required in higher organisms such as humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
