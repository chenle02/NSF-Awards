This research follows previous successful NSF-supported work that investigated
the nature of thrust-type plate boundary tectonics. In the present research, the
roughness of the plate boundary at subduction zones and its control of the
maximum size of thrust earthquakes is to be studied. This may be more important
than subduction rate and plate age as controlling factors proposed previously.
Also, based on evidence that seismic moment release increased in the few decades
before four large California earthquakes, seismic moment will be investigated
prior to large subduction zone events. Both subjects bear on the estimate of
earthquake risk and hazard. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
