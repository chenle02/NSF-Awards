This research project concerns the development of mathematical tools for
analysis on metric measure spaces (spaces with well-defined notions of distance
and volume), inspired by basic tools used in ordinary Euclidean space. The work
has implications for many fields of mathematics, including dynamical systems,
harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations. One useful measurement in
geometric analysis is the so-called Besov energy. This project will explore
links between the nonlocal Besov-type energy in a compact metric measure space
and local energy encoded in the space, as measured through a well-connected
super-space that sees the compact space as its boundary. The work aims to use
these links to explore how non-local energies are transformed by well-regulated
changes in the metric, or distance. Parts of this project will be done in
collaboration with graduate students and other early career mathematicians, thus
also providing training of the future STEM workforce.

In this project, the principal investigator will develop the potential theoretic
tools related to Besov energies by using Gromov hyperbolic fillings of the
compact metric measure space so that the compact space is realized as the
boundary of the Gromov hyperbolic space. Such a Gromov hyperbolic space is of
controlled geometry, and by exploiting this control, the principal investigator
will seek to gain control of the nonlocal energies and to obtain information
about how these energies are transformed by quasisymmetric maps. The project
will also augment the potential theoretic properties of Besov energy by
developing the perspective of fractional p-Laplacian (nonlinear versions of the
fractional Laplacian).
