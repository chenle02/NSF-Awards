Motivated by the recent discovery of a possible connection between sudden
changes in active region magnetic flux at the solar surface and the onset of a
solar flare or coronal mass ejection, a coordinated study of the five best
events will be undertaken to elucidate the physical underpinning of this
connection. The unprecedented coverage of these events includes magnetograms
from the Big Bear Solar Observatory, the Michelson Doppler Imager, the Mees
Solar Observatory, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, and coronal data
obtained by EIT, TRACE and Yohkoh. The second part of this effort will identify
a set of events with high quality data coverage and associated coronal mass
ejections, to determine the nature of the statistical basis of this connection.
The results of this study will enable the community to establish space weather
forecasting tools by monitoring photospheric magnetic field evolution, such as
rapid flux emergence or cancellation, and the sudden acceleration of shear
flows.
