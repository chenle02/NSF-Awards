The maize genome probably contains between 50,000 and 100,000 genes clustered in
hypomethylated gene rich regions. We have developed a new method for purifying
these regions, and we will explore its use in identifying gene function. This
will be accomplished by sampling gene-rich portions of the genome that are
chemically distinct from the gene poor regions, and then displaying them on
microarrays (DNA chips). These microarrays will then be queried using
representations of the DNA corresponding to mutated genes from a large
population of maize plants that carries transposable elements (jumping genes).
We have previously developed one such population (the Maize Targeted Mutagenesis
population) with prior funding from the Plant Genome Research Program. By using
computational methods, we will combine the data from the two different resources
to create an index of maize gene function, represented by maize seed
corresponding to each mutated gene. We anticipate making thousands of entries
into this index, allowing maize geneticists to systematically determine the
functions of indexed genes.
