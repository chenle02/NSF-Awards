This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of California-Davis, studying the effects of infertility on the
status of women in a Tanzanian society of Africa. The proposal will test the
hypothesis that infertile women will undergo marital stress because of divorce,
lack of resources, and general lack of prestige, subject to the women's'
position in local kin networks. In addition the proposal will look at the role
of children's labor in their mother's general status position. Methods include a
survey sample of a complete village, more in-depth interviews of a stratified
subsample of women of the village, and a time allocation study. This research is
important because Africa has a very high population growth rate and is known as
containing societies in which the group welfare is promoted above that of
individuals. This sort of fine-grained research will tease apart the causes of
high and low prestige among women as they relate to the number of children they
have. The advance in our knowledge will be useful to population planners who
must design policies to limit reproduction which are acceptable to the local
population. In addition it adds to our expertise about this important region of
the world.
