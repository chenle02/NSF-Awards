The objective of this research is twofold. The first objective is to develop an
automated dimensional inspection system for manufactured objects. The second
objective is to develop an intelligent inspection planning environment. These
two objectives will be addressed from several interdisciplinary perspectives and
at several levels of automation technology, ranging from the facility automation
to information and decision automation. Automation efforts, including coordinate
measurement machines (CMM), and computer numerical control (CNC) machines at the
facility level, computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
systems and integrated databases at the information level, and artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies at the decision-making level, are proposed to
facilitate the integration of automated inspection in flexible manufacturing
systems.
