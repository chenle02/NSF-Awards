The investigators propose creating a statistical model of engineering education
that identifies difficult student stages for entry into the field. The study
would use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including
records of all degree-seeking undergraduate students for 9 institutions. They
say that the proposal is intended to identify the "holes in the pipeline for the
production of professional Engineers. It will provide an estimate of how big
each hole is and how it developed. The intent of the study is to pave the way
for increasing retention of minorities in engineering. This project is co-funded
by the ROLE program in the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication
and the STEP program in the Division of Undergraduate Education.
