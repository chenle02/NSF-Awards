In this Research at Undergraduate Institutions project, funded by the Chemistry
of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Rachel N. Austin from
Bates College will test the hypothesis that Pb(II) binds to metallothionein-3
(MT3), a brain specific isoform of metallothionein, with greater affinity than
Zn(II) binds to the same protein. Furthermore, the project will test the
correlated hypotheses that Pb(II) can displace Zn(II) on physiologically-
relevant timescales and that Pb(II)-saturated MT3 has a different unfolding
energy than Zn(II)-saturated MT3. Studies will determine the binding affinity of
lead to MT3, the kinetics of metal exchange, and the temperature at which Zn7MT3
and Pb7-saturated MT3 unfold. Quantitative information obtained from the work
will provide an intellectual foundation for hypotheses about the role of MT3 in
lead exposure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead exposure, especially during childhood,
has many profound effects on development and learning. Yet the chemistry that
occurs when lead enters the brain remains poorly understood. Metallothionein-3
is a small, brain-specific protein that is closely related to other proteins
whose function is understood to be, in part, to bind to toxic metals to detoxify
them. It is not known whether MT3 performs this function in the brain or whether
it can bind lead ions tightly. This work will determine whether lead does in
fact bind to MT3 and whether it does so in a manner that would imply that this
chemistry is important in biological systems exposed to lead. New information on
the fundamental chemistry between MT3 and Pb(II) may help elucidate the
biological basis of lead's impact on development. The project also provides a
vehicle for involving undergraduate students in high-quality research that
connects to larger societal concerns. This project overlaps directly with
community outreach efforts centered at Dr. Austin's home institution, which is
located in an old mill town with a heavy burden of lead-containing housing
stock.
