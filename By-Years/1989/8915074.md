This award will partially support a bi-national conference on industrial
integration between the United States and Mexico. The conference, sponsored by
the Center for Growth Studies of the Houston Area Research Center on the U.S.
side and by the Centro de Investigacion Para el Desarrollo (IBAFIN) on the
Mexican side, will examine the extent of bi-national integration between the two
countries in a number of important industries, assess industry plans for further
integration, and develop policy recommendations on how industrial integration
between the two nations would be more effectively pursued. The conference will
have three major outcomes: (1) preparation and presentation of detailed analyses
of integration in six significant industries; (2) policy recommendations on
industrial integration between the two countries; and (3) the publication of a
volume of conference papers in English and Spanish. Thus, the project will
inform the general public in both nations, and internationally, about how
intimately integrated the industrial structures of the United States and Mexico
are becoming, and the opportunities for economic growth that could be achieved
through additional integration.
