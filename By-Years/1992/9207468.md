This X-Ray facility will provide a rotating anode x-ray generator with
accessories, a four-circle diffractometer and a two-circle diffractometer to
scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Research projects
include studies of self-assembled biomaterials, polymer liquid crystals and
copolymers, small angle x-ray reflectivity of thin complex fluid films, wide
bandgap semiconductors, thin film and bulk ferroelectric oxides. This facility
will provide a much needed high intensity source for material characterization
and will complement facilities to be provided through the new Materials Research
Laboratory being established at the University. This facility is being made
available to all qualified users, and will provide first-hand experience to
students and faculty.
