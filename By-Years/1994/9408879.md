9408879 Yuan The quantum ramifications of chaotic scattering in several model
atomic and molecular systems is investigated. New mechanisms for the formation
of long-lived collision complexes, e- He+ periodic orbits, phase space
structures corresponding to chemical bonding and isotope effects on HeRh2+ near
the metallic tip of an electron field microscope are studied in using a variety
of semiclassical approaches. ***
