This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in April 1989, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research on projects
in Analytical, Inorganic, Organic, Physical, and Biochemistry, under the
direction of a faculty member in the School of Chemistry. Each student will be
associated with an individual faculty member who has an active research program
in an area of interest to the student. The participant will learn by work on
their own project, and by observation of other members of their research group,
how to attack a research problem from design through execution and
interpretation of experiments. Projects are designed to give the undergraduate
scholars maximum flexibility in their experimental approach and will allow an
individual to work as independently as he/she is capable of. Regular research
conferences and oral presentations (two during the ten weeks) will serve to
acquaint every participant with the nature of all the other projects and provide
a basis for individual discussions throughout the summer.
