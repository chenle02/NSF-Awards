The Second International Assessment of Educational Progress (IAEP) will assess
the mathematics and science achievement of 13-year-olds in 20 countries. Most of
these countries will participate in an optional geography probe and about two-
thirds will participate in an experimental performance assessment for 13-year-
olds. A third option, a 9- year-old assessment of mathematics and science, will
be implemented by about two-thirds of the participants. In addition to the
cognitive assessment, background information will be collected from students and
school administrators. Representative samples of about 2,000 students from about
100 schools will be drawn at each age. The assessment will be administered using
standard procedures in March, 1991 (or in September, 1990 for countries which
follow a March through December school schedule). The results will be reported
in March, 1992, one year after data collection.
