9553548 Mark Wilson This project will build on former work (creating SEPUP
materials and assessments) and conduct research on the implementation of the
embedded assessment component. Questions to be answered in the project are: (1)
How can technology assist teachers with assessment implementation? (2) How can
teachers use the full assessment system with maximum efficiency? (3) What are
the most effective means of providing professional development in using and
adapting the SEPUP assessment system? (4) What is the impact of the assessment
system on teachers' professional development? The project will develop: (1)
materials for teacher discussion; (2) adapt computer and other technologies for
use in classrooms; (3) design teacher support and professional development
strategies; and (4) field test and evaluate the first three.
