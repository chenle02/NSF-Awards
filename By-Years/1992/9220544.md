The University Wisconsin is requesting funds to add 12 new 2 and 4 year
colleges and universities to its state wide higher education network which
already comprises over 30 institutions. The proposal requests partial funding
for participation in NSFNET through an additional connection with CICNET, the
regional network attaching to NSFNET in the Wisconsin Area as well as partial
start- up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support to
facilitate the fullest possible participation. The educational institutions that
will participate include: Cardinal Stritch College, Concordia University,
Marshfield Medical Research and Education Foundation, Mount Senario College,
Northland College, Viterbo College, Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical and
Adult Education, Chippewa Valley Technical College, Moraine Park Technical
College, Wausheka County Technical College, and Western Wisconsin Technical
College. The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET
access for a broad variety of entities engaged in education and research. This
cooperative network will provide gateways to regional, national, and
international networks and will be consistent with their standards. It will
further the institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development
through a well-educated workforce, accessible training opportunities, and
research and development partnerships. Another goal of the network is to
facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between institutions,
including those outside the state. The universities need greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
