This proposal is a renewal of NSF grant ECS-8314488 on a Study of Nonlinear Wave
Plasma Interaction. The experiments will concentrate on laboratory studies of
two dimensional and time dependent plasma sheaths in DC and RF plasmas. Specific
attention will be paid to the understanding of sheaths associated with Plasma
Source Ion Implantation (PSII), a technique the PI's have recently begun to
develop. Experiments will take advantage of previous emissive probe diagnostic
development which allow plasma potential measurements with good spatial and
temporal resolution. Studies of the spatial and temporal characteristics of DC,
pulsed and sinusoidal sheaths will be conducted. Experiments will build on
recent results which indicate that one-dimensional descriptions of sheaths
cannot explain the self-consistent plasma potential far from electrodes or
plasma potential dips near positive electrodes in filament produced plasmas.
Continued development of PSII, which implants ions by applying large negative
pulses to materials immersed in plasmas, requires an understanding of both two
dimensional and pulsed sheath effects. Laboratory experiments will be combined
with small scale efforts on computer modeling of experimental results. This
renewal proposal will concentrate on laboratory studies oftwo dimensional plasma
sheaths - one example of nonlinear plasma structures. Sheaths are non-neutral
plasma regions that are almost always present at plasma boundaries and are
sometimes found disconnected from boundaries, i.e. double layers. They are among
the oldest known phenomena in plasmas yet many important aspects of them are
poorly understood. They play an important role in many commercial devices and
applications, and hence investigations of sheath phenomena can have considerable
economic impact.
