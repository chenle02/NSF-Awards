This study will investigate the microstructure of human concepts, with a focus
on how concepts expressed by sentences are constructed from lexical meanings
plus structural principles. Building of Jackendoff's framework of Conceptual
Semantics plus Pustejovsky's work on event structure and the generative lexicon,
the project will investigate a number of interrelated problems concerning how
word meanings are internally structured in the minds of language users: the
linking of characters in an event described by a sentence syntactic positions in
the sentence; the internal organization of noun meanings, including properties
of form, function, and origin of objects described by nouns; the factoring of
object and event concepts into independent dimensions; and the semantics of
rights and obligation. In addition, the project will investigate "principles of
coercion," whose effects are to add to sentences certain elements of meaning
that are not overtly expressed in words. Such principles are heavily involved in
simplifying apparent ambiguities in words, as well as in understanding language
in context.//
