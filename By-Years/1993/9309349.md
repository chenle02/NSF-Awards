9309349 Gaillard This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to gain a fundamental understanding of the fate of trace metals in freshwater
sediments. The investigator plans on using an approach that involves both
experimental and mathematical modeling of the problem, assessing the extent to
which trace metals could be buried permanently in sediments or remobilized into
overlying waters under natural conditions. The experimental work involves
determination of trace metal distributions in interstitial waters and bulk
sediments and on the measurement of trace metal binding to sediment particles
and authigenic particles. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in
response to NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program Announcement and
Guidelines. Results are expected to provide a more fundamental understanding
than now exists of phenomena that are associated with the processes by which
trace metal constituents of sediments in lakes and streams can pollute the
overlying water. This in turn can lead to an improvement in predicting the
behavior of trace metals in sediments and potentially find application as a
prognostic tool for assessing the release of metals from polluted sediments.
