An undergraduate ergonomics laboratory is being introduced in the Industrial
Engineering department at Marquette University. Through this experimental
training and the electromyographic measurements carried out in a simulated work
environment, industrial engineering students learn the problems associated with
cumulative trauma disorders. The education of industrial engineers in this
laboratory addresses not only the well-being of the workers but also the
reduction of the costs of occupational injuries, such as low back pain and
cumulative trauma disorders, which include the common carpal tunnel syndrome.
Study of the redesign of the workplace through ergonomic intervention reduces
the incidence of these injuries and enhances industrial productivity.
