0431782&lt;br/&gt;Rosen&lt;br/&gt; The 2004 Northeast Probability Seminar will
be held at the City University of New York Graduate Center from November 4 to 5,
2004. This is a fairly new annual seminar designed to focus on probabilists in
the Northeastern United States. It will provide an opportunity for junior
researchers in the area to meet and interact with more senior researchers in an
informal setting. It will also provide all attendees the opportunity to hear
about exciting new research in probability. Funds will primarily be used to
assist with travel for junior researchers and members of underrepresented
groups. &lt;br/&gt;
