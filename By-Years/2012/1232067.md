Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to combine thin film inorganic and organic solar cells for higher conversion
efficiencies (&gt;15%) and better stability. The approach is to utilize a
multiple gap arrangement of inorganic and organic thin film cells, coupled with
a novel photonic-plasmon structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
&lt;br/&gt;1. A multiple-gap cell arrangement to harvest the solar
spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;2. An inorganic layer as the first, high-gap cell, to remove
the damaging ultraviolet and blue photons. &lt;br/&gt;3. The use of a novel
periodic photonic-plasmon structure, designed using rigorous scattering-matrix
simulation, to optimize photon absorption. &lt;br/&gt;4. The use of organic
materials with long wavelength absorption&lt;br/&gt;5. The use of stable contact
and hole and electron-transport materials &lt;br/&gt;6. Unique measurement
apparatus and analysis for degradation under varying intensities, light spectra
and controlled atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;7. Utilizing easily scalable, roll-to-roll
(R2R) nano-imprinting techniques for photonic-plasmonic
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The technology can be
easily transferred to manufacturing using R2R techniques. The solar panels can
be molded into the structures of buildings or onto windows. The project will
educate graduate and undergraduate students, mentor a post-doctoral scientist,
and recruit minority and women students. The research will be incorporated into
a new PV course at Iowa State. The solar cells, and a demonstration movie, will
be exhibited at the Des Moines Science Center. Simple kits to build organic cell
devices will be developed for high school students. An industrial company,
Lightwave Power, is the GOALI partner and they will develop manufacturing
techniques.
