The sense of smell is very important for behavior and food selection, but we
still know very little about how olfactory information from the nose is handled
by the brain. One model system that has been very useful in studying the sense
of smell has been the crayfish, because these aquatic animals use their antennae
as 'noses' of very high sensitivity for compounds dissolved in the water. Recent
discoveries in many invertebrates, including crayfish, have shown some aspects
of brain organization in olfactory areas may be similar to olfactory parts of
the brain in mammals, so they provide useful comparative experimental subjects
for examining functional properties of this common anatomical organization. This
work will utilize electrophysiological recordings from individual neurons, or
nerve cells, within the olfactory part of the brain of crayfish. These neurons
form local small networks that show oscillatory activity when stimulated. Here,
the temporal properties of the input signal traffic and of the local networks
will be recorded to determine where particular kinds of synchronous patterns of
activity originate, how the neurons are selectively stimulated by certain
patterns of input and how they are functionally coupled together, and what may
be the importance of periodic bursts of activity.&lt;br/&gt; Results will be
important not only to understanding olfactory integration, but also to
understanding mechanisms for olfactory-driven behaviors, and to computational
and cognitive neuroscience for analyzing how synchronous and patterned neural
activity in networks may have a function in developing memories. &lt;br/&gt;
