Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0905891&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Kevin E. Wortman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator
intends to study four basic problems&lt;br/&gt;about the large-scale geometry of
arithmetic groups: "classical&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups" such as SL(n,Z),
"S-arithmetic groups" such as&lt;br/&gt;SL(n,Z[1/p]), and "function-field-
arithmetic groups" such as&lt;br/&gt;SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field. The
first problem is to&lt;br/&gt;identify the Dehn function for SL(n,Z) if n &gt;
3. Second, to&lt;br/&gt;determine for which m a given function-field-arithmetic
group is&lt;br/&gt;of type FPm. Third, to develop a theory of fillings
for&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups that is inclusive of all types of
arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;groups, and that includes the first and second problems
stated&lt;br/&gt;above. Fourth, to verify what is conjectured to be the
first&lt;br/&gt;dimension of the cohomology of a function-field-arithmetic
group&lt;br/&gt;that is infinitely generated. In addition, the PI intends to
use&lt;br/&gt;the knowledge learned from the problems above to
further&lt;br/&gt;investigate the finiteness properties and word metrics
of&lt;br/&gt;"universal lattices", such as SL(n,Z[t]).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What
all of the problems above include is the study of arrays of&lt;br/&gt;numbers,
called matrices. Being able to understand the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;of matrices
is a fundamental problem in mathematics that has&lt;br/&gt;applications to most
fields of science and economics. As&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians have done in the
past with great success, the PI&lt;br/&gt;intends to study the arithmetic
associated with matrices by&lt;br/&gt;bundling the equations they represent into
a single geometric&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;
