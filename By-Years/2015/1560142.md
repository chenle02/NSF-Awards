North Dakota State University will conduct a summer research program to engage
30 undergraduate students in collaborative, interdisciplinary research in STEM
Education. This project will foster collaboration through faculty and peer
mentoring and cohort building activities. REU participants will learn
qualitative and quantitative research methods, scientific communication skills,
and become familiar with career paths in STEM Education. The ultimate goal of
this project is to promote the matriculation of talented students to graduate
programs in what is referred to as discipline-based education research (DBER).
This project builds on a prior NSF award that has produced publishable results
in the area of DBER. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project REU students
will be able to select from a wide variety of undergraduate research projects
that pose important questions about the nature of assessment, reasoning, and the
impact of learning assistants, crossing many STEM disciplines. The students will
prepare for their research experience by reading and discussing assigned papers
and participating in IRB training (both done online) before they arrive at the
REU site. The benefit of this prior, virtual mentoring will be twofold; the
students will receive essential training in education research, an area that may
not be familiar to them and they will begin to build relationships with their
research mentors. During the project the students will participate in a well-
structured professional development seminar through which they will address
ethical practices, careers in STEM, and pathways to graduate school. Formative
evaluation will provide feedback necessary to refine the project each year
through information gathered from entrance and exit surveys, the Survey of
Undergraduate Research Experiences, the Experimental Design Ability Test, and
interviews with students. Summative evaluation activities will include REU
student exit interviews, an exit survey, and tracking of students' career
trajectories through follow-up surveys.
