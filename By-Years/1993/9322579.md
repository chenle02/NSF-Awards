Proposal: 9322579 ABSTRACTDate: 01/20/94 PI: Maitland Jones, Jr.Institution:
Princeton University This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
continuing work of Professor Maitland Jones Jr. at Princeton University to study
carbenes and nitrenes and their carborane derivatives. Synthetic and
spectroscopic studies will be conducted to examine the importance of precursor
chemistry in the current methods used for making carbenes, to elucidate a new
carbene 'zipper' reaction, and to generate novel strained bridgehead olefins
which will be stabilized by adamantyl groups. Focal points of this research are
the exploration of the chemistry of carbene and nitrene substituted carboranes,
labeling experiments to elucidate carboranylcarbene rearrangements, and
reactions toward aza- and silacarboranes. High spin carboranes incorporating
several carbenes and/or nitrenes will be synthesized and studied for their
properties. Dehydro-o- carboranes will be used to form hydrocarbon addition
products. In this project Dr. Maitland Jones will conduct synthetic and
spectroscopic studies on a spectrum of carbenes and nitrenes including those
that contain a carboranyl substituent. His research is directed to improve
current methods for generating these highly reactive species and to expand their
application for syntheses of new strained olefins and unsaturated carboranes.
Fundamental synthetic and mechanistic information will be obtained from these
reactive intermediates that crosses the boundaries between organic and inorganic
chemistry.
