Although active noise control by means of destructive interference of sound
waves has been studied for several decades, inherent difficulties associated
with the method have precluded its use on a large scale and 3-dimensional
sources. The lack of success for large noise sources stems from a lack of
knowledge of how the surface acoustic intensity of the noise source is altered
with the addition of multiple active sources. This project removes this
limitation by developing a research tool that uses sound intensity prediction
and optimization programs. For a given noise source, the tool provides the
guidelines for choosing the optimum number and position of active sources to
give the largest sound power reduction possible. Recent development of
affordable adaptive control systems using solid state electronics makes it
possible to use active noise control as a feasible alternative to more
conventional noise control treatments. The project's analysis is supplemented by
an experimental activity which culminates with the demonstration of the active
control method on a large turbo-machine. ***
