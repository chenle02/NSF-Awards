Marion Jenkinson is an adjunct curator of birds at the University of Kansas, and
presently serves as Treasurer of the American Ornithologists' Union. Dr.
Jenkinson has organized a symposium entitled "Modernization of the
Ornithological Collections of Neotropical America", sponsored by the Collections
Committee of the American Ornithological Union. The symposium is to be held in
conjunction with the Fourth Neotropical Ornithological Congress in Quito,
Ecuador, in November, 1991. Collections in Latin America were discussed at the
Third Congress in 1987, and the proposed meeting will focus on the curatorial
needs created by the recent explosion of biodiversity survey and inventory
projects in the Neotropics. This symposium affords an opportunity to disseminate
information on the newest curatorial technologies for preserving specimens, and
to establish international collaborations for coordinating collecting and
curating efforts. A proceedings volume will be published and distributed at no
cost to Latin American participants in the symposium, and to natural history
libraries in the region. Preserving natural history collections in tropical
regions is critical because of the high rate at which habitats are being
destroyed, and species are becoming extinct. These museum specimens will provide
the sole means of studying many life forms, and their preservation is critical
to future generations of researchers.
