This award is for support for a two year continuing grant to study the
cosmogenic in-situ carbon-14 trapped in the GISP2 core. Total amounts of
carbon-14 activities in the carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) phases
will be studied using previously developed techniques. New techniques will be
developed for the measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations in ice using wet
and dry extraction methods and of carbon-14 activities using a dry extraction
procedure. By studying the total carbon-14 activities in ice samples of known
age information on the dependence of retention of both atmospheric carbon
dioxide and in-situ carbon-14 activities on the ambient temperatures will be
determined. The proposed studies will provide an algorithm for using the hybrid
carbon-14 chronometer (hybrid because carbon-14 is derived from two sources),
and should allow accurate carbon-14 dating of other ice cores.
