The research is a renewal of a grant by The National Science Foundation to
Professor S. M. Bedair, North Carolina State University, to investigate the
potential of laser enhanced metallorganic vapor deposition to selectively
deposit epitaxial films of compound semiconductors on gallium silicon
substrates. The previous award by the Foundation to Professor Bedair was a
Special Creativity Award. During the previous grant several significant
accomplishments were made, e.g., establishment of the experimental conditions
for selective epitaxy and direct writing of single crystals of gallium arsenide,
aluminum gallium arsenide, gallium arsenic phosphide, and indium gallium
arsenide on gallium arsenide and silicon substrates, growth of compound
semiconductors by laser-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at the lowest
reported temperatures (250oC), and growth of superlattices using chemical vapor
deposition without gas switching. The research during this continuation period
will emphasize the following: thermal processing during laser-enhanced chemical
deposition, study of effects of thermal stress on the quality of the films,
study of gas dynamics during growth, study of doping behavior and electrical
properties of the films, and low temperature deposition, direct laser writing
during deposition. The research is relevant to maskless writing and growth of
optoelectronic devices, and advanced epitaxial growth of integrated optical and
electronic materials. Optoelectronic materials will impact communications and
optical processing devices which are important to the economic competitiveness
of the United States. Students are receiving excellent training under the grant
for careers in research on these vital materials.
