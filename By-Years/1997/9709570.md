9709570 Doddington The objective of this activity is to continue an effort in
the area design projects for persons with disabilities and expand this work by
utilizing an existing capstone engineering design course. During the course of
this activity the investigators will explore mechanisms to offer custom design
service to health care agencies throughout the state of Florida. Examples of
recent design projects include: (1) a page turning device to enable spinal-
injury patients to scan through periodicals and paperbacks, (2) custom bathing
assist equipment for handicapped individuals, (3) a baby carrier to
appropriately restrain low-birthweight babies during transportation to prevent
injury in case of an accident, (4) touch adjustable desks and tables to aid
wheelchair users in public places, and (5) a simple and reliable door opener for
persons with limited mobility and strength. ***
