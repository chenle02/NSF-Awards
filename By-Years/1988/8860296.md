Holographic passive tracking is absolutely vital for any architectural
daylighting function. Photics has invented a viable passive tracking hologram
which will track and diffract the suns light into the interior ceiling of a work
area. The hologram will be designed to use the combination of transmitted and
diffracted light, which will produce the maximum illumination in the work area.
