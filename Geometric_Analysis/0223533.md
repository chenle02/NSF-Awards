DMS-0223533 Shing-Tung Yau

This award provides partial support for mathematicians from underrepresented
groups and other junior mathematicians without other means of support to attend
a Geometry and Topology Conference on May 3,4, and 5 at Harvard University. The
first day of the conference will emphasize Karen Uhlenbeck's leading role in
mentoring women in Mathematics and feature four female speakers from a well
known leader in the field to other more junior mathematicians. There will be
several poster session during the conference including one on "Women in
Science." The second and third days of the conference will feature lectures from
twelve eminent Geometers and Topologists. Further details about the conference,
