This applicant will study the DNA-binding regulatory AraC protein in E. coli,
which works by opening a loop of DNA to permit transcription. Specifically, she
plans to use biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of zinc in the
AraC function. This work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr.
Robert Schleif at Johns Hopkins University.
