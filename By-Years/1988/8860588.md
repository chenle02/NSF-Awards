This research is to develop numerical methods that will take into account
multiple inferential sources for imaging a complex geological region. The thrust
is to combine several techniques and apply them concurrently to the same earth
volume in order to increase their individual powers of resolution. Potential
commercial applications are to oil, gas, thermal energy and mining prospecting,
and a number of other fields that require nondestructive imaging.
