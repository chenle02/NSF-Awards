This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years to support a
wireless system to allow science students to use laptop computers in the field
to communicate their real-time data to the school and thus to the other student
researchers.
