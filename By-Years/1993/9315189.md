9315189 Johnson This award supports travel expenses of Markes Johnson,
Department of Geology, Williams College to visit China and participate in joint
research with Rong Jiayu, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, on
Silurian rocky shorelines. The researchers will collaborate on a joint field
study of a rocky shoreline of Silurian age near Guiyang, China. The fundamental
value of an ancient rocky shoreline is its unambiguous position marking the
boundary between ancient land and sea. Many practical applications in
paleogeography may be derived from this starting point, including the evolution
of rocky-shore communities through geologic time. This project will be the first
time an ancient rocky shoreline will be studied in China.
