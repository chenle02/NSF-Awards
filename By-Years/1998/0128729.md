This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research and
develop the missing link in current virtual prototyping systems for computer-
aided design (CAD). This missing element is the human hand. Current virtual
prototyping strategies involve mice or other low-dimensional point-like
interaction mechanisms. By adding life size, real-time interaction at the level
of the human hand, virtual prototyping becomes significantly more valuable
because of the higher order information available to the user. Interaction
methods like grasping, pushing, sculpting as well as force feedback data can
provide designers with critical product related information not usually
available until a physical prototype has been built. Building on Immersion
Corporation's existing SOLID infrastructure for real-time interaction with NURBS
geometries and kinematic assemblies, the firm proposes to both research and
develop numerical techniques necessary for true interaction with realistic
models as well as the interaction paradigm itself. This innovation has great
potential for all designers who build and prototype products that humans
interact with. The introduction of interaction at the level of the human hand
will leverage existing infrastructure at Immersion Corporation for intellectual
property, product evaluation and marketing. The result will be an efficient
transition to a product with a large existing market of designers and engineers
from a significant cross-section of industry.
