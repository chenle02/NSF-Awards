The explosive popularity and exponentially increasing scale of the World Wide
Web has severely stressed the Internet's content-delivery infrastructure. This
stress has begun to expose the inefficiencies and limitations of the Web's
traditional client-server architecture. A progression of new mechanisms and
alternative architectures have recently appeared, including content delivery
networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, and peer-to-peer overlay networks, such as
Napster. Despite the rapid deployment and global use of these architectures,
however, little is understood about their behavior in many cases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research project are threefold. First,
the effectiveness of existing Internet content-delivery architectures will be
quantitatively analyzed, specifically focusing on (1) cache infrastructure, (2)
content-delivery networks, and (3) peer-to-peer networks. Second, based upon
these measurements, the design of new or enhanced architectures for Web content
delivery will be explored. Third, new designs will be implemented, deployed, and
measured. One particular focus will be the design and implementation of adaptive
systems that make heavy use of self-measurement and on-line algorithms, e.g., to
dynamically optimize request routing, content placement, or the topology of the
peer-to-peer overlay network. Overall, the hope is to increase the understanding
of content-delivery architectures and to develop new content-delivery mechanisms
that greatly improve the behavior of the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
