The objective of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
(GOALI) award is to use structural information of system components to improve
prediction of reliability and failure in complex systems. The results of this
project are expected to be of great benefit to the auto industry. In particular,
improved reliability and failure prediction of manufacturing tooling systems
will lead to more efficient and effective maintenance planning and reductions in
tool failures. This, in turn, will lead to improvements in product quality and
reduction in cost. Lab-enhancement and on-site studies will provide real-world
experience and problem-solving skills for engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project deals with efficiently
extracting material micro-structure characteristics and incorporating them into
system reliability models to improve the accuracy of failure and reliability
prediction. The new methodology will be applied, as an example, to the autobody
manufacturing system of ultra-high strength steels, which is currently of great
interest to the automotive industry but faces challenges in failure prediction
and reliability analysis of manufacturing tool systems. Statistical methods will
be developed to analyze and extract the micro-structure statistical
characteristics and features of workpiece and tool materials that determine the
strength competition and tool damage processes. In addition, a physical-
statistical model that incorporates the extracted micro-structural features will
be developed to describe the tool degradation process. Based on these, a
reliability model of the repairable multi-component manufacturing tool system
will be obtained. The research results will be implemented and validated through
a three-stage process, including lab tests at the university lab, experiment and
model validation using industry tryout, and validation and implementation in
real manufacturing processes.
