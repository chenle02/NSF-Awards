Eight 4-processor compute engines, a central monitor workstation and associated
hardware shall be aquired and used in a specially developed 32- processor
multicomputer including custom hybrid instrumentation and performance monitoring
features which will be dedicated to support several research projects. These
include: * Active Memory Hierarchy (AMH) Architecture and Software Development.
* Portable Performance Monitoring. * Portable Parallel Programming Environment.
* Parallel Algorithm Development. * Low Latency Multicomputer Interconnection
Network. These interdisciplinary projects bring together faculty and students
from Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computational
Engineering and Computer Science with a common purpose of accelerating CFS
applications. The instrumentation will provide a common platform or hub around
which key research issues involving performance optimization, parallel system
instrumentation and monitoring, parallel algorithm and program design and
parallel programming environments can be synergistically pursued.
