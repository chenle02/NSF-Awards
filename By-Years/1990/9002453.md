A new aerosol process for producing nanometer scale ceramic oxide particles with
controllable degree of aggregation was tested in Phase I of this project. During
Phase II, the process will be extended by generating different nanometer size
crystalline materials (titania, zirconia, etc.) and developing reliable
techniques to control the degree of aggregation. The investigation will
incorporate a study of continuous processing, testing for improved sintering
characteristics, and economical evaluation of the process. It is expected that
the nanometer scale ceramic particles produced by the proposed process will find
numerous applications in engine components, machine parts and high temperature
gas turbines.
