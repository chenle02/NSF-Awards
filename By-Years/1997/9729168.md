This research is to develop a high level, semi-automated process for validating
models. The approach is based on the principle of modeling the environment
surrounding the system that the model represents. There are four objectives: 1)
developing initial sensor models with high-level graphics- based tools that
allow one to concentrate on the system mathematics to insure sensor model
correctness, 2) refining sensor models over time into a library structure, 3)
exploring automated mechanisms for requirements capture and processing and
linking the model validation system to specification requirements, and 4)
creating a goal tree based test planning system to guide the selection of and
development of model tests. Validation of VHDL models of DSP algorithms is being
done under this research.
