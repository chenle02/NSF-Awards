This two-year award for US-Spain cooperative research in crustal anatexis and
magma evolution involves David London, University of Oklahoma, and Drs. Fernando
Bea (University of Granada) and M. Dolores Pereira (University of Salamanca) in
Spain. The goal of the collaboration is to combine field/geochemical analysis
with experimentally derived results. London and his students will be engaged in
electron microprobe analyses and in tests of the experimental results, and Bea
and Pereira will continue their utilization of inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICPMS) and alpha-track mapping to study the distributions of
petrologically important trace elements. Field locations in Spain are ideally
suited for the application of experimental studies to natural granites.
