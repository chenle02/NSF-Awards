The Uncertainty Repository Project is creating an online repository that will
enable faculty from a number of universities and engineering disciplines to
integrate uncertainty concepts with their traditional courses. The set of
courses that can be impacted by the project is very large. Because the concepts
of uncertainty are critically important in research and industry and because
these concepts are traditionally taught in undergraduate curricula, the
uncertainty repository project fills a critical need. The repository consists of
teaching materials dedicated to uncertainty. These materials include examples of
uncertainty that are commonly encountered in industry. The applications range
from manufacturing variations to decision-making under uncertainty. In addition
to the on-line materials, the project will provide a computer-based learning
environment in which students will be presented with worked out examples and
practice problems that have interactive components. Instructors will be able to
easily find examples applicable to the courses that they are teaching and this
enables faculty unfamiliar with uncertainty to be able to integrate the concepts
into their teaching.

The investigators are evaluating how well the repository fosters uncertainty
literacy. Evaluation efforts will meansure non-deterministic thinking among
students. It will also measure faculty familiarity with uncertainty. Because the
project evaluation is performed in collaboration with industry there is a great
assurance that the project will address the concepts that are critical to
engineers in industry. The project is providing a direct link between the
idealized classroom teaching environments common in many universities with the
uncertainty engineering reality faced by industry engineers.

This project is producing students capable of integrating model uncertainties
into design problems and who are able to perform uncertainty analysis in a
number of settings and a variety of engineering courses. The program is also
helping faculty develop greater skill and knowledge in uncertainty analysis so
they are better able to integrate these concepts into their courses.
