The focus and central theme of the 1991 Symposium on the Interface of Computing
Science and Statistics will be on a variety of critical applications of
scientific (including statistical) computing and the research challenges that
they present. Sessions are planned on computational genetics, medical imaging,
and labelled point data, which arise in evolutionary biology as well as imaging.
Another application area will be engineering, including speech recognition,
satellite imaging, and software engineering. The meeting will be held in
conjunction with a Workshop on Computational Molecular Biology. The Symposium
and Workshop are being held in Seattle, Washington on April 21-24, 1991. The
Symposium is organized to capitalize on the natural synergy that the Workshop
offers as well as on the technical strengths in computing and engineering at
Boeing and in biostatistics, computer science, engineering, and medicine at the
University of Washington. A series of technical tutorials on computer science
topics will be offered to encourage statisticians and other applications-
oriented participants to learn about key ideas and new technologies that are
needed for interface work.
