The 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, ACM
MobiCom 2018, will be held between October 29 and November 2, 2018, in New
Delhi, India. MobiCom is dedicated to addressing the challenges of mobile
computing and networking, and has emerged as one of the leading conferences
covering networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the
convergence of mobile computers and wireless networks. MobiCom attracts world-
leading researchers and practitioners to attend and present their work and
attend panels and keynote sessions. In addition to the regular conference
program, MobiCom 2018 will include a set of workshops, panels, research
demonstrations, and a poster session that includes the ACM Student Research
Competition (SRC). This year again, MobiCom plans to feature both a mobile app
competition and a student career fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF travel grant
will help increase representation and participation of United States-based
graduate and undergraduate students at this conference, and enable sharing of
information and preliminary research results among participating students.
Participation of top conferences like ACM MobiCom is an extremely important part
of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers, and exposing them to leading edge
research in the field. The award will enable graduate students to attend the
main MobiCom 2018 and the associated workshops. The travel awards will target
first-time attendees and under-represented minority students, since attending
conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often
have limited travel funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
