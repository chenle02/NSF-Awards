This Science in Developing Countries award will support the research
collaboration of Professor Mark Ashbaugh of the university of Missouri,
Columbia, and Professor Raphael Benguria of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica
de Chile. The project aims to solve conjectures related to the mathematical
dimensions of circular drums. The researchers propose to develop good bounds for
the ratio of the first overtone to the fundamental tone in "warped" drums, which
span a closed curve in three- dimensional space. They will also consider other
types of surfaces, such as a piece of a sphere's surface, which are of great
importance to the geometry of curved surfaces. Through techniques used in
earlier collaborations, the investigators will examine bounds for ratios o other
tones as well, in order to improve existing bounds and perhaps obtain the
optimal bound, along with the shape that gives the optimal result. The research
is expected to yield substantial contributions to the general area of eigenvalue
bounds for differential operators. The u.S. side will gain from continued
collaboration with a Chilean expert in this area. The Chilean side will benefit
from continued direct participation with a U.S. counterpart.
