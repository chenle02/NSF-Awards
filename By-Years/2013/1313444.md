This is a theoretical project to calculate three-dimensional models of brown
dwarf interiors and atmospheres, where rotation and convection are included, as
well as the interaction between the interior and overlying stratified
atmosphere. The model will address observational data which are consistent with
the presence of clouds, chemical disequilibrium, and temporal variability. The
research will predict infrared spectra, lightcurves and vertical mixing rates
for comparison with observations, including directly imaged giant extrasolar
planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training a graduate
student for his or her Ph.D., incorporating the numerical code in the graduate
and undergraduate courses that the PI teaches, and dissemination of the results
to the scientific community and general public.
