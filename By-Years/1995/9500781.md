This award supports work on three main problems: (1) Resolutions of Weyl
modules; (2) Intertwining numbers; and (3) Canonical resolutions of
determinantal varieties. All of the above problems involve the use of the
characteristic-free representation theory of Gl(n) investigated by the principal
investigator over the past years. The third problem involves methods of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry as well. Many different algebraic
objects can be represented as algebraic sets of transformations of other
algebraic objects. Through these representations their structure can be
determined. This project is concerned with the representation theory of nxn
matrices. This study has applications throughout mathematics and mathematical
physics.
