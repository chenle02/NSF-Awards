The State University of New York College at Plattsburgh will purchase equipment
and software to automate and upgrade an existing manual x-ray diffractometer. A
microprocessor controller, diffracted beam monochrometer, microcomputer, control
and data collection software, minerals database, and search/match software will
permit fully automated collection and analysis of x-ray data. The upgraded
facility will be used to improve instruction in courses in x-ray
crystallography, x-ray analysis, water quality analysis, and soil analysis. In
addition, the upgraded x-ray diffractometer will be used by undergraduate
students in independent research projects. SUNY, Plattsburgh will match the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
