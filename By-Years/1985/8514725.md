A workshop dealing with new directions in thermal engineering research will be
conducted. Thorough understanding of the heat and mass transfer and fluid flow
processes associated with the various existing and new materials processing
techniques is essential in process modeling and can be instrumental in improving
the variety and quality of products while reducing their costs. The study of
transport phenomena in process modeling thus may pay big dividends in vitalizing
our economy and may enhance the competitive edge of the American industry. Such
studies, however, require expertise in two different scientific disciplines:
material science and thermo-fluid science. A workshop for transport phenomena in
materials processing will identify current and future problems of interest, and
will make recommendations for the promotion of more efficient interaction
between the material science and thermo-fluid communities.
