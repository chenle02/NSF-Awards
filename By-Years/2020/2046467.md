This project will increase understanding of the evolution of the parent-
offspring conflict through an integrated set of research and education
activities. This conflict is a striking paradox that is pervasive across the
tree of life. Parents must balance the investment of limited resources between
provisioning their offspring during early development to increase their chances
for survival and maturation, and reserving resources for their own survival and
future reproduction. The primary research aim of this project is to investigate
the adaptations that regulate the parent-offspring conflict across diverse
species. Moss plants are an ideal system to study this conflict since their
offspring remain physically attached to and nutritionally dependent on the
parental plant throughout their lifespan and the structures involved in the
parent-offspring conflict vary across species. The research and education
activities undertaken in this project will provide training and learning
opportunities for a diverse group of students. The education components of this
work will bring undergraduate students into the field and behind the scenes of
natural history collections during an engaging May-term course at the University
of Tennessee - Knoxville (UTK), where field collections and specimen-based
research will be essential components of the class. Experiences and data from
the course will then be used to build educational modules and activities for
UTKâ€™s grades 3-12 education programs, on campus natural history collections, and
local public botanical gardens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use an
innovative and integrated approach that incorporates comparative analyses of
functional morphology, physiology, and evolution using field-collected plants
and natural history specimens to understand the processes that have led to
diverse adaptations for regulating parental-offspring resource allocation across
species. An interconnected set of hypotheses examining functional morphology and
physiology will be tested comparatively using sets of diverse moss species to
deepen understanding of the influence of the parent-offspring conflict on
survival, fitness, and ultimately evolution of plants. This project will also
generate a robust, globally sampled moss phylogeny in order to reconstruct
patterns of morphological evolution and test for correlations between structures
influencing the parent-offspring conflict. This research will lay the groundwork
for future biodiversity studies in mosses, and will improve our knowledge and
understanding of parent-offspring relationships broadly across
plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
