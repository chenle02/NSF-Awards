The Department of Chemistry is acquiring rheometry equipment for the development
of the undergraduate polymer science laboratory courses. Students in the polymer
science course are using the equipment to measure the influence of antioxidants
in the cross-linking of rubber and flow activation parameters in polyethylenes.
The equipment is being used in numerous undergraduate research projects
including the characterization of poly(arylene ether)s and the degradation of
vinylidene chloride oligomers.
