This project is for the workshop to be held at the University of Maryland in
October 1989 for the definition phase of the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling)
initiative. The workshop will be for the observational aspect of the boundary
layer problems. This workshop complements the first one held in February 1989 at
the San Diego Supercomputer Center for the theory part of GEM. The interested
scientists will get together to asses the status of the observational and
experimental techniques. Then small subgroups will coordinate observational
programs with already planned (in the San Diego workshop) theory campaigns. The
combined efforts of these workshops will result in community formulated plans
for the GEM initiative.
