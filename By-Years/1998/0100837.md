The purpose of the proposal is to study the geometry of algebraic varieties and
their invariants from different points of view. In particular the investigator
and his colleagues study the structure of fundamental groups and universal
coverings of algebraic varieties, the problem of placement of singularities,
restrictions on the concentration of singular points in special fibers of the
fibrations of algebraic varieties. In the latter case the goal is to develop a
sufficiently simple method which can be generalized to the case of arithmetic
family of curves. The study of the Galois groups of functional fields is going
to provide with an alternative approach to the problems of birational geometry.

The investigator suggests to continue a broad scope of research in the area of
algebraic geometry with potential applications to number theory and theoretical
physics. Of special interest is the study of a formula that provides nontrivial
estimates for a number of solutions in equations similar in form to the famous
Fermat equation..
