This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will attempt to resolve
inefficiencies in the processing of health insurance claims. A total of 8.3-18.1
billion transactions, including eligibility verification, claim submission,
etc., are performed annually in healthcare with only 30-50% of them being
electronic. These paper-based transactions in claims processing result in
system-wide inefficiencies which lead to inaccurate claims assessment, delayed
settlements, losses due to fraud, litigation, regulatory non-compliance. The
proposed innovation brings to bear a newly-emerging set of health-care IT
standards coupled with the ubiquitous cellular mobile platform to provide an
integrated solution throughout the payer-consumer-provider healthcare value
chain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to mitigate inefficiencies in
collaboration with a health insurance company that is a thought leader in claims
processing, by integrating innovative mobile technology and applying it in a
manner that circumvents any significant reworking or replacement of existing
claims processing systems. Health care costs are approximately 16% of GDP, and
represent a meaningful drag on our nation?s economy. If this proposed approach
is successfully deployed, it promises to address a significant barrier to the
efficient delivery of healthcare with the United States.
