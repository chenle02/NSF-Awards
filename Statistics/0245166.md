The funding is for the "Fourth International Workshop on Objective Prior
Methodology," to be held June 15-20, 2003, in Aussois, France. The principal
objectives of this meeting are to facilitate the exchange of recent research
developments in objective prior methodology, to provide opportunities for new
researchers, and to establish new collaborations which will channel efforts into
pending problems and open new directions for investigation. An important
consequence of this meeting will be to further crystallize objective prior
methodology as an established area for statistical research. Most of the funding
will go towards expenses of new researchers. The meeting will be organized to
actively encourage participation of new researchers and underrepresented groups,
and to provide opportunities for the initiation of international collaborations.
