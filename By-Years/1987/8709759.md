This research combines experiment and theory in a continuing effort to
formulate and test new approaches to the electronic structure of diatomic
molecules. A key element is the recognition of natural groupings of electronic
states into "super-states" (supermultiplets, superconfigurations, and channels)
which reflect an approximate factorization of a complex, many-body system into
weakly interacting sub-systems. A well chosen zero-order model can be useful in
assigning, fitting, and interpreting a spectrum, but its greatest value lies in
its revelation of interrelationships between observables, states and molecules.
The beauty of molecular electronic structure lies in the simplicity and
periodicity concealed beneath the complexity of a spectrum or in the enormous
differences between the electronic level diagrams of two intuitively similar
molecules.
