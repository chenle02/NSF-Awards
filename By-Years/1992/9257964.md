The focus of this research is on the development of innovative VLSI design
methodologies that will facilitate the next generation of high performance
signal processing and computing systems. A variety of analog, digital, and mixed
signal circuitry will be implemented for use in high performance computing
applications including object recognition, smart sensors, adaptive neural
networks, and programmable analog filters.
