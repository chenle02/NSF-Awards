Abstract:

***************************************************************

This project is concerned with a number of mathematical problems which arise
when quantum particles are used to process and/or transmit information. The P.I.
plans to continue the analysis and refinement of models of noise; these are
important in both quantum communication and error analysis in quantum
computation. Work in quantum communication includes a proposal which may resolve
the long-standing question of whether or not entangled inputs can enhance the
capacity of quantum channels to transmit classical information. The P.I. also
plans to construct new classes of error correcting codes as prototypes for codes
which can be designed to deal with those errors to which a particular
implementation of quantum computation is most vulnerable. Such codes could be
combined with other techniques to reduced the overall code length. The P.I. will
also consider a random Hamiltonian approach to the analysis of the efficiency of
a proposed scheme for adiabatic quantum computation. Finally, the P.I. plans to
continue the study of metrics in information geometry, and their connection to
measures of purity, relative entropy, and distances between states.

It has now been established that quantum particles have the potential to provide
the basis for vastly more powerful computers, and new methods of secure
communication. Although building quantum computers remains a formidable
experimental challenge, the feasibility of several methods of quantum
communication and encryption have already been convincingly demonstrated.
However, it is also clear that all practical instrumentation is imperfect and
subject to noise and errors. This is not surprising; dealing with noise has long
been an important facet of classical communication. However, quantum information
devices are subject to a much larger and more complex variety of errors arising
from noise. This gives rise to new mathematical challenges. This proposal deals
with a number of these questions. Effective methods of dealing with noise are
essential to the success of the nation's ability to exploit the power of quantum
theory for next generation of computers and cryptographic protocols.
