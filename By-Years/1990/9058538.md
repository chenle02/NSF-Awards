This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on aerosol
dynamics involved in laser-induced as well as conventional chemical vapor
deposition. The application is to ceramic superconductors. The role of transport
processes in laser-induced deposition will be examined through numerical
modeling. This will be complemented with experiments involving light scattering
and electrical mobility techniques. The research will enhance the ability to
control processing parameters to improve and extend the properties of advanced
ceramics.
