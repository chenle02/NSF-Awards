In this proposal, we will outline a broad research plan for the utilization of
methods from operator theory, dilation theory, and interpolation theory to study
a number of issues in robust control and nonlinear systems design. We will be
particularly interested in extending the $H^\infty$ control methodology to
nonlinear systems in order to find an applicable nonlinear robust synthesis
theory. We will also discuss further extensions of our to $\mu$-synthesis as
well as distributed $H^\infty$ control.
