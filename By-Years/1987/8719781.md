The incoherent scattering which arises from inhomogeneities in the radio
refractive index of air (at, say 50 MHz) comprises an existing technique for
determining the three components of the field of motion at various heights in
the atmosphere. The objective of this research is to test the ability of a
competing technique--an interferometer--to measure winds in the atmosphere. An
interferometer, suitably configured, will be located adjacent to an existing 50
MHz device near Plattville, Colorado. Both devices will sense common volumes of
the atmosphere in both troposphere and stratosphere, thus providing a new and
unique basis for determining the suitability of this technique as a remote
sensing device for air motions. Dr. Adams, the Principal Investigator, is well
qualified to perform these experiments; he constructed a similar device
(2.66Mhz) for measuring mesospheric winds. I recommend support as a two year
continuing grant at the requested budget level.
