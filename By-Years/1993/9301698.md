Phytoplankton pigments have been used extensively to monitor standing stocks
and rates of production and loss within algal communities. Chlorophyll-derived
pigments that are formed during zooplankton grazing have also been used as
tracers for the fate of phytoplankton. Recent advances in chromatography
technology have revealed that phytoplankton pigments actually comprise a suite
of related pigments and that some of these compounds appear to be uniquely
associated with grazing by protozoa. This project with its simple, well-
controlled experiments will evaluate pigment transformation and degradation by
marine protozoa. It's been hypothesized that kinds and amount of pigments
produced are related to grazer species and phytoplankton species, and that post-
elimination processes such as detrital ingestion and photo- oxidation are
important modifiers of pigments. A critical issue in the use of pigments as
biomarkers is the degree to which pigment transformations mirror transformation
of organic carbon. The ultimate goal of the project will be to develop a tracer
which can be used to address several important ecological questions of upper
food web dynamics.
