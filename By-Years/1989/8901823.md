This award will allow an anthropologist at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill to receive technical training in geographic information systems and
remote sensing. This training will be used to help analyze information gathered
about agriculture, ecology and economics in two communities in the Peruvian
Andes. The research seeks to understand how peasant populations use strategies
such as field dispersion, storage and exchange to buffer production risk due to
drought, frost and crop pests. This award will allow the investigator to analyze
data on regional environmental variation that has been available but that he was
not trained to use. The research that this training activity supports is
important because the understanding of peasant survival strategies is critical
to the dealings between the U.S. and societies which have large peasant
populations. The training is also valuable in itself to increase the technical
expertise of social scientists.
