This research studies the dynamics of redundant multibody systems which have
superfluous degrees of freedom. It represents a significant step forward in the
development of sophisticated models for the study of a wide variety of physical
systems such as robots, manipulators, chains, space structures and biosystems.
The principal research questions addressed are: What is the optimum motion of
the system to minimize energy expenditure; What configuration will minimize the
internal forces and movements and; What movement will accomplish a given task in
the least time for constant energy expenditure.
