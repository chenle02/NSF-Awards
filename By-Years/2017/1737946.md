The nation faces a shortage of skilled technical professionals in occupations
that require a high level of knowledge and skills in advanced technical fields,
but may not require baccalaureate degrees. According to the National Research
Council, the mathematical sciences are part of most every aspect of everyday
life; and even in old-line industries, the role of the mathematical sciences has
expanded. While specific mathematical competencies vary with the demands of
different occupations and professions, the need for such competencies in the
skilled technical workforce is without question. This conference will explore
what mathematics is needed and the steps the STEM education enterprise should
take to ensure students can successfully develop the requisite mathematical
competency and fluency.

With regards to intellectual merit, the "Needed Math: Advanced Technological
Education Conference" will bring together three groups of thought-leaders to
establish and propose a set of common mathematics concepts and skills that are
pre-requisites for education and employment of technicians in STEM-related
careers in biotechnology, information/communication technology, and advanced
manufacturing. Conference attendees will represent three communities that have a
stake in needed mathematics: math educators and researchers; community college
faculty; and STEM employers. The charge to attendees of the conference is to (1)
characterize specific mathematics skills that employers in those domains look
for; (2) identify the unifying math concepts that underlie those skills; (3)
propose needed action to take to teach those concepts effectively to students in
grades 7-14; (4) synthesize recommendations and results in an edited set of
Conference proceedings; and (5) disseminate conference deliverables to a wide
audience in a variety of veues and in a variety of formats. In terms of broader
impacts, the conference intends to provide guidance to groups of stakeholders
with regards to the teaching and learning of mathematics in support of
developing and sustaining a diverse workforce of skilled technical
professionals.
