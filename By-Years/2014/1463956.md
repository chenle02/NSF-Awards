TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $4,000 are
requested to provide for partial support (travel, registration) for
approximately 10 junior faculty, post-docs and students to attend the day-and-a-
half TDPOLY Short Course on ?Polymer Glasses? to be held Feb. 28-March 1, 2015)
under the auspices of the Division of Polymer Physics (DPOLY) of the American
Physical Society (APS) in conjunction with the Society?s March 2-6, 2015 meeting
in San Antonio, Texas. The purpose of the short course is to provide an advanced
survey of the present state of knowledge of polymer glasses. It is designed for
advanced graduate students, faculty and industrial researchers who are working
in the general area of polymer physics and who have a need to deepen their
understanding of glass-forming polymers and their extensive applications.
