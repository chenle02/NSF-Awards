Observers are amazingly proficient at identifying human faces under different
viewing conditions and across time. However, such variations are not intentional
attempts to change the appearance of an individual. With funds from NSF, Dr.
Michael J. Tarr and Yi Cheng are investigating how disguised faces are
recognized. That is, are we equally good at recognizing someone when they try to
hide their identity? And if not, can we train observers to do better? The
investigators are addressing these questions by exploring the perceptual
mechanisms used in recognizing faces that have been disguised. They use an
innovative combination of computer graphics, computational modeling, human
psychophysics, and neuroimaging to study the underlying cognitive and neural
mechanisms used by human observers to achieve the invariant recognition of
individual faces. This project will also identify the conditions under which we
are prone to fail in recognizing a familiar face, because of how it has been
disguised. Given such information, the goal is to develop training protocols
that improve observers' ability to identify those individuals who are attempting
to mask their identity. The intellectual merits of this research arise from
improved understanding of human face recognition abilities, particularly in a
rarely studied domain.

Broader impacts of this project include the creation of a standardized "face
database" available to the scientific community, consisting of multiple races
for use in both behavioral and computational studies. Broader impacts also
include increased knowledge of how to train observers (and possibly
computational algorithms) to detect disguised individuals. This research will
also involve several Brown undergraduates interested in pursuing scientific
careers.
