The human deoxy-uridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase gene will be isolated by
cDNA hybridization and then characterized. Additionally, the protein product
will be analyzed for possible phosphorylated isoforms and molecular weights and
isoelectric points determined. The expression of the gene in peripheral
lymphocytes as a function of the cell cycle will also be measured. %%% The
dUTPase enzyme has been associated with a number of cellular processes: DNA
replication, cell replication and cell death. An understanding of gene structure
and expression as well as more insight into the structure as related to function
of the encoded protein in human cells will be fundamental to any understanding
of human cell viability.
