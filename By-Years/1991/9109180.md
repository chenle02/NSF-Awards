This research is to devise and evaluate solutions for the automation and
integration of mold and die finishing. A comprehensive system, where a multi-
axis Computer Numeric Control (CNC) Machining Center is to be used to perform
all the operations from rough milling to final grinding and polishing of molds
and dies, is to be developed. This is based on an unified system of tool path
planning and generation from an initial data base of bi- cubic surface patch
description. This approach will aim to provide a means to automatically generate
final grinding, polishing and in- process surface roughness inspection
toolpaths, directly from a three dimensional surface or solid computer model
thus avoiding the need to build a physical model. Many industrial products are
manufactured by processes that utilize dies and molds. These are currently
manufactured by manual techniques that are time consuming, labor intensive and
expensive. This research will attempt to automate this process thus improving
the productivity and competitive ability of the manufacturing sector.
