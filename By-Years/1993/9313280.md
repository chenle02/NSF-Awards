9313280 Gabrielse This award provides funds to permit Dr. Gerald Gabrielse,
Department of Physics, Harvard University, to pursue with Dr. Wonho Jhe,
Department of Physics, Seoul National University, Korea, for 36 months, a
program of cooperative research on antiproton studies and mass spectroscopy. In
this research, antiprotons produced in LEAR, the high energy accelerator at
CERN, Geneva Switzerland, are trapped and stored in thermal equilibrium at 4.2
K. Subsequently, the inertial masses, magnetic moments, and other properties of
antiprotons and protons may be compared. The collaborators are highly respected
researchers in the field of the proposal. In addition, Dr. Jhe has available to
his research group, in Korea, facilities for producing negative hydrogen ions
which can be loaded into the antiproton trap and used in comparisons of
antiproton and proton properties. The use of negative hydrogen ions rather than
protons in these experiments will greatly reduce a number of large experimental
errors. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.- Korea
Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project is supported
by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). This project adds an
international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under NSF Grant No.
