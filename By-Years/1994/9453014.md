9453014 Holmes The New Orleans Public Schools Urban Systemic Initiative proposes
a major and profound change in the entire K-12 science, mathematics, and
technology program. Five themes serve as the foundation for the plan of action.
The themes are: (1)Student Achievement; Assessment; (2)Pedagogy and Teaching
Practices; (3)Schools and District Culture; (4)Policy and Governance; and
(5)Partnerships and coordination with External Agencies and Stakeholders. These
themes will generate specific changes that will affect students, parents,
teachers, and other staff member in the system. The major changes are as
follows:integrated hands-on science, mathematics,and technology for all
students; learning experiences that connect all content areas through the use of
spiral, interdisciplinary, multicultural, standards-based thematics units; a
computer in every classroom in every school; a mentoring and internship
opportunity for every student; algebra by eighth grade for every student; a
comprehensive professional development program for classroom
teachers,counselors, principals, others administrators, and staff; a team
approach to manage the district; realignment of policies and resources to
support mathematics, science, and technology; and expansion of the consortia of
stakeholders. These reforms will be phased in five years of the plan. At this
point all schools will be in the program, leaving two years of funding for the
opportunity to make refinements and improvements.
