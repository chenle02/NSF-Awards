9310802 Olmstead This research involves the use of systematic and population
level genetic analyses to study three endangered species of Puerto Rican
amphibians. Both mitochondrial and nuclear genes will be sequenced, and museum
specimens of extinct populations will be used in the analysis. %%% Many
amphibians, including toads, are declining at an alarming rate. Active,
multifaceted conservation programs are in effect for several species, including
the endangered Wyoming toad, the threatened Puerto Rican crested toad, and
boreal toad populations in Colorado. Populations of all these species are
declining, and there are on going efforts to monitor each species' populations.
Unfortunately, the monitoring programs are occurring with little or no
information on genetic variation within these species. Genetic data are
important to any conservation and restoration effort because they provide
information on genetically unique populations and sibling species as well as
information on lack of genetic variation and increased risk from inbreeding. ***
