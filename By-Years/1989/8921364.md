Many countries have experienced difficulties managing commodity export booms and
fail to follow a savings path that is consistent with the life cycle-permanent
income hypothesis. Having estimated the size of the booms and busts and then
using these estimates to test the life cycle hypothesis for Botswana and Kenya,
it appears that Botswana saves boom income, which is consistent with the life-
cycle hypothesis, while Kenya does not. Among the questions suggested by these
findings are: (1) Is there a precautionary demand for savings in Botswana, and
can the findings for Botswana be explained by a precautionary demand for
savings? (2) Can the results for Kenya be explained by liquidity constraints or
by myopic behavior? The purpose of this research is to provide answers to these
questions. Models will be refined and tested empirically in order to address
these issues. The research is important because it will provide a clearer
understanding of why countries respond to boom times the way they do and how
public policy might mitigate the effects of commodity induced booms and busts in
developing countries.
