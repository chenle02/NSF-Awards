The primary objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
condensed matter theory between Vojko Vlachy of the University of Ljubljana and
A.D.J. Haymet of the University of California is to investigate ordering in
colloid solutions, asymetric electrolytes, and the structure of polyelectrolyte
solutions. Colloid solutions contain suspended particles that do not settle out
and are not readily filtered. Such studies could have immediate and important
applications in processes in electrochemical energy conversion and desalination.
The co-investigators have complementary experience in a number of theoretical
techniques relevant to the problem. Together they will perform computer
simulations aimed at predicting the physical behavior of these solutions. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
grants are composed principally of Yugolsav dinars and made to the principal
Yugoslav institute. Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a
modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
