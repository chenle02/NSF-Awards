Abstract To be able to understand a person's work history, it is necessary to
take a broad perspective, and view movement among jobs as part of an extended
process that also involves the person's schooling, and the links between school
and work. In addition, a full understanding requires an identification of the
precise effects of such structural variables as the type of community in which a
person grew up, type of school attended, industry in which adult work-life
began, and so on. Data with which to link career lines to educational and work
structures are available in the National Child Development Study. It includes
virtually every child born in England, Scotland and Wales during the first week
of March, l958. Information about this cohort was periodically obtained over a
period of 23 years. Included is very diverse and complete information pertaining
to their health, mental abilities, schooling, work, etc. Thus, the data
correspond -- for a national sample -- with a period from birth through the
completion of formal schooling and their entry into the labor force. Using path
analytic and differential equation methods, the investigators will be able to
link education and work, and show the effects of structural variables across
these institutions. The results will be important in the development of
comparative (i.e. United States and Great Britain) sociological theories of the
life course.
