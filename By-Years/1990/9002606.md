This project is concerned with the representation theory of general linear
groups and their quantizations. The principal investigator will investigate the
Hecke algebras associated with Weyl groups in an effort to extend the work on
q-Schur algebras and apply it to other groups of Lie type. This research is in
the general area of the representation theory of finite classical groups. One of
the main applications of group theory to other mathematical and scientific
fields is in representation theory, and finite classical groups are a primary
source of finite simple groups.
