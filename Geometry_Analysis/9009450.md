The principal investigator will study the implications in mathematical physics
of the minimal representation of SO(4,4), completely integrable systems using
"pairs of Hamiltonian operators," G-invariant differential operators on the nil-
cone, and Lusztig's basis theorem. The project to be undertaken by the principal
investigator involves techniques from group theory and will have consequences in
mathematical physics. A group is an abstract algebraic concept which simply
involves a collection of numbers or variables and a prescribed manner of
combining them which obeys certain rules. The integers with the operation of
addition is an example of a group. By the 1970s mathematical physicists
understood that relationships between subatomic particles could be described
using the group theory which had been studied for many years by algebraists.
