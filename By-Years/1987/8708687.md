It has been shown that by increasing the temperature of tumors and cancerous
tissue, their growth rate decreases and the abnormal tissue can even be killed.
The problem arises as to the best means to increase the temperature of an
abnormal internal tissue without damaging the surrounding normal tissue. One can
focus electromagnetic radiation which has a sufficiently low frequency that it
will heat the tissue, but will not ionize the tissue molecules. Micro-waves and
infra-red rays are examples of non-ionizing radiation. The material interactions
between the radiation and the body are very important and complex. Thus, it is
necessary for an engineer to solve some rather difficult differential equations
in order to properly predict the best manner of focusing the radiation. This
research will seek to use a mathematical approach to optimize the means of
focusing non-ionizing radiation.
