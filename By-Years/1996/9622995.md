Lichtenbaum The investigator continues his researcn in the closely related areas
of motives and motivic cohomology. Having given a definition of mixed m otives
over an algebraically closed field, he extends this definition to motives over
an arbitrary base scheme. He then studies the relationship between the motive of
X relative to Y, the motive of Y relative to Z, and the motive of X relative to
Z. Using his definition of motivic cohomology in terms of motives, the
investigator searches for a proof that this definition satisfies most, if not
all, of the "axioms" proposed by Beilinson and himself. In particular, the
Kummer axiom and the "finite dimensionality" axiom seem to be accessible.
Finally, having already defined for each variety a homology motive in the
category of mixed motives,the investigator studies possible definitions of
motives corresponding to cohomology, Borel-Moore homology, and cohomology with
compact supports, and explicitly computes these motives in the case of curves.
The investigator also studies Poincare and Alexander duality for motives. This
proposal constitutes fundamental research into the basic structures of algebraic
geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated curves in the plane that could be defined by polynomial
equations, generalizing the classic conic sections known to the Greeks. Nowadays
the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and
topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
