This research involves the development of a method for making reliability
assessments for large complex electric power systems. Preliminary analysis has
shown that the method is very computationally efficient compared to existing
techniques. Availability of this method would enable utility planners to analyze
larger numbers of alternative plant expansions and system conditions, minimizing
the possibility of overlooking favorable options and making more secure
tradeoffs that avoid local minima traps.
