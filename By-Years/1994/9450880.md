The Department of Chemistry is purchasing computer equipment to upgrade the
control interface of two computer-controlled instruments: a FT-IR and a mid-
field FT-NMR. These two instruments find heavy use in our project-oriented
laboratories at the sophomore, junior, and senior levels. Throughout the program
students undertake extended multistage laboratory projects requiring them to
display a growing independence. In the sophomore year, which is the primary
beneficiary of the project, the students select a multistage synthesis from the
original current research literature to investigate. Examples of recent projects
are synthesis of a pheromone of the western pine beetle, and of a model compound
for the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. Both the number and sophistication of IR
and NMR spectra are increasing with the new interfaces; sophomores are able to
run their own 2 - D NMR spectra by the end of the year, and students in the
upper-level laboratories use the full capabilities of both instruments in
characterizing compounds prepared in their projects.
