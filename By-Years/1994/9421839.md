This award is an Accomplishment-Based Renewal of a previous research award on
computer systems that perceive and model their environment and take actions in
that environment to achieve and maintain goals under management, but not
detailed step-by-step supervision by humans. These computer systems, which might
be robots or only pieces of software, are called autonomous agents. In this
research program, the focus will be on reacting appropriately to commonly
occurring situations (telo-reactive behavior), attention to multiple goals,
planning, and learning.
