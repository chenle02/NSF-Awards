Everyday human action is strikingly complex. In the course of accomplishing our
everyday goals and intentions, we move rapidly about the world contacting an
enormous array of diverse objects for different purposes, with few pauses to
demarcate where one action ends and the next begins. Despite such complexity,
when we observe others in action, we readily process the complex motion stream
with little conscious effort. As yet, much remains mysterious about the
cognitive mechanisms that enable such skilled processing of dynamic human
action. One intriguing developmental question is how infants even make a start
at identifying distinct acts within the continuous motion stream. This research
will pursue two primary goals. The first is to investigate whether infants
possess skills for identifying individual actions within the continuous motion
stream, and the second is to discover how they might do so. The research will
advance knowledge on several fronts. For one, the research will provide new
information about basic action-processing skills that are fundamental to
children's social and cognitive development. As well, the research will lead to
the development of new methods that may ultimately assist in understanding and
detecting deficits in action processing; for example, such deficits may be a
factor in autism and certain forms of brain damage acquired later in life.
Improved understanding of the nature of such deficits may make it possible to
design more effective interventions for such individuals, hence improving social
and cognitive outcomes.
