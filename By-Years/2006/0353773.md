James Madison U. continues operation of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. Ten students are supported for a 10-week summer
research experience every year. The REU Site involves faculty from five academic
departments in the Center for Materials Science at JMU. Student recruitment
focuses on primarily undergraduate institutions, and on the early stages of the
undergraduate's career. Students work with JMU faculty members on projects
raging from scanning probe microscopy to computational modeling of the growth of
materials and their behavior. Students also participate in sessions designed to
enhance their communication and presentation skills, and in group social
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
