LOMOLINO DEB-9707204 The proposed study will assess the effects of fragmentation
and the potential benefits of corridors on the diversity of small mammals
inhabiting old-growth forests of the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington.
The investigators will study and characterize the differences in mammalian
communities inhabiting continuous old-growth, fragmented old-growth, riparian
corridors of old-growth, and second-growth forests. The investigators will study
patterns in species richness and species composition and investigate how these
patterns are influenced by landscape connectivity. This information has, and
will continue to contribute, to the development of a species-based, hierarchical
model of biogeography. The results of these studies will provide information
critical to conserving native communities in these ancient temperate
rainforests. Because many of the mammal species studied serve as prey for other
vertebrates, including spotted owls, this study will also provide important
information for endangered species management and the use of forests as a
resource in the Pacific Northwest.
