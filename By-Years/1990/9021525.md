To eliminate the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanics, and Native Americans
in mathematics and related fields at the collegiate, graduate, and professional
research level across the nation, we propose to establish a broad consortium of
more than 200 colleges and universities-each working locally to achieve this
goal. In addition, we will establish more than five residential research summer
institutes that will prepare talented minority undergraduates for graduate study
in mathematics and, ultimately, for academic and professional careers.
Approximately 10,000 minority undergraduates will be involved in consortium
programs at the end of five years. One thousand of these will be enrolled in
programs explicitly designed to attract them to advanced studies in mathematics.
Professional organizations, in particular the Mathematical Association of
American, will be intimately involved with this project to ensure that the
advancement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in mathematics is
established as a legitimate and central responsibility of mathematicians and
mathematics departments.
