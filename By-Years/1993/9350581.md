SSC-9350581 University of California-Berkeley Berkeley, CA Morrison, Frank H.
"Summer Science Camp-MESA Project Summary" This proposal is for a summer Science
Camp grant to help support and academic year mathematics, Engineering, Science,
Achievement (MESA) Program at the University of California, Berkeley. The SSC
grant would be specifically used for instructional support for 60 Bay Area 7th,
8th and 9th graders in the SSC-MESA Project and as part of the MESA Saturday
Academy. Program participants will reflrct the rich cultural and ethnic
diversity of the Bay Area which includes African Americans, Chicano/Latinos,
American Indians, and Puerto Ricans. The primary objectives of the proposed SSC-
MESA Project are to introduce students to engineering and science concepts,
demonstrate how academic course work relates to their future, how science and
engineering relate to the world around them, to become informed and actively
involved in the education of their children. The summer program will be held for
6 weeks June 21-July 31, 1993, June 20 -July 31, 1994 and June 19-July 30, 1995.
To meet its objectives, the SSC-MESA Project includes morning mathematics and
communication courses, afternoon engineering and science projects a "shadowing"
program, where students will meet with mentor scientists and engineers. The
academic-year program includes; 1) a Fall-1993 and Spring-1994 Saturday Academy
(9 sessions each semester); 2) after-school math and science workshops for
students who attend MESA schools and 3) evening and Saturday meetings that
provide parents and students with information on college entrance requirements,
financial aid, the transition from middle school to secondary school, and career
options in science and engineering.
