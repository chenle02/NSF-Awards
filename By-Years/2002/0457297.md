This RUI experimental research program focuses on a research project at the
frontier of modern nonlinear optics/photonics that will actively involve
students, with special focus on the study of light propagation in two-
dimensional (2D) optically induced photonic lattices. The project will explore
new concepts and fundamental issues related to light propagation in 2D
optically-induced photonic lattices, as well as on controlling light by light in
such lattices for light guiding and routing. Furthermore, these studies in
optical periodic systems will have strong impact on other areas of sciences,
ranging from solid state physics to photonic crystals, and to Bose-Einstein
condensates trapped in periodic potentials. Training of undergraduates in this
important field of research is an essential component of the program.
