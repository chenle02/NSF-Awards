Nontechnical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at advancing the
understanding of unconventional superconductivity: a remarkable phenomenon
pertaining to complete loss of resistance at relatively high temperature. This
activity capitalizes on novel experimental capabilities for optical nano-imaging
developed by the PI. The integration of research and education within this
project aids the preparation of highly skilled personnel with expertise spanning
condensed matter physics, optics, scanning probe microscopy, and materials
science. The PI is committed to broaden participation of groups currently
underrepresented in graduate education by engaging undergraduates from
institutions with a large fraction of students belonging to these groups. This
project contributes to the enhancement of infrastructure for research and
education at Columbia. Nano-optical instrumentation developed by the PI supports
multidisciplinary activities at Materials Research Science and Engineering
Center at Columbia and The City College of New
York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of high-
Tc superconductivity in iron-based materials demonstrates that this phenomenon
is not restricted to the copper oxides, as once thought, and is likely to be
much more generic. This breakthrough calls for an exploration of the optical
properties of iron-based superconductors. Infrared spectroscopy, the principal
experimental method employed by the PI, allows one to probe fundamental
characteristics of superconductivity including the energy gap and the superfluid
density. Another goal of the project is to investigate the normal state, from
which superconductivity emerges. This project is focused on the exploration of
prototypical BaFe2As2 and NaFeAs compounds with various dopants. Systematic
studies of NaFe1-xCuxAs are needed to elucidate the origin of the elusive
insulating state in these materials and of the enigmatic superconductor-
insulator transition. Nano-optical methods are utilized to verify the uniformity
of the studied specimens. A combination of nano-IR imaging with simultaneously
performed scanning magnetic force microscopy measurements probing local
superconductivity is well suited to uncover previously unexplored real-space
aspects of the interplay between superconducting and density wave states.
