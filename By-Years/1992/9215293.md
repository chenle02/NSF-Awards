This project addresses three problem areas in the theory of algorithms and
computational complexity, with the goal to increase knowledge about the power
and limitations of various computational models for solving specific problems.
(1) The first part aims at deriving lower bounds for the computational
difficulty of computing Boolean functions by circuits. (2) The second part deals
with the analysis of on-line computational problems, that is, problems where the
input is provided as a sequence of requests and an output response must be
produced as the sequence is being received rather than after all requests are
known. The aim in a particular situation is to develop an algorithm whose
performance compares favorably with the best off-line algorithm for the problem.
The focus of the work is to develop tools for analyzing the structure of on-line
problems and to use the structure to determine how good an on-line algorithm is
possible. (3) In the third part, problems in distributed computing are
considered. The goal is to develop an understanding of two basic issues in
coordinating a set of loosely linked processors: what kind of agreement can be
reached among processors in such a system, and how can resource scheduling be
efficiently performed.
