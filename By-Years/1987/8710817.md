This Research Initiation Award is made under the National Science Foundation
Research Opportunities for Women Program. The objective of the investigation is
to study the structure of Group IV-VI semiconductor heterostructures and
superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The emphasis is to relate the
structure of these materials to their physical properties and potential device
performance. The microstructure, crystallographic structure, and defect
structure will be characterized using transmission electron microscopy and
computer-assisted image simulation. The initial studies will be made on lead
telluride- lead europium selenium telluride superlattices and heterostructures,
but other IV-VI chemical systems will be investigated as the research
progresses. The defects will be related to the electronic, magnetic and optical
properties of the superlattices and heterostructures.
