This project aims to develop new efficient maximum-likelihood soft-decision
decoding algorithms for linear block codes and convolutional codes. The approach
used here is to convert the decoding problem into a search problem through a
graph which is a trellis for an equivalent code of the transmitted code.
Algorithm A*, which is widely used in Artificial Intelligence search problems,
is used to search through this graph. This search is guided by an evaluation
function f defined to take advantage of the information provided by the received
vector and the inherent properties of the transmitted code. This function f is
used to drastically reduce the search space and to make the decoding efforts of
these decoding algorithms adaptable to the noise level. Preliminary results
indicate a possible breakthrough in the decoding of linear block codes.
Successful application to convolutional codes should make possible the use of
maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoders for large constraint length
convolutional codes in practical communications systems.
