The University of Missouri at St. Louis is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced
research chemists. The program will support 11 students and will distribute the
research students between the summers of 1987 and 1988 as well as the academic
year. Research activities will include the following: o Cyclopentadienyl
Complexes of Palladium and Platinum o Compounds with Single and Double Bonds
Between Silicon Centers o Preparation and Characterization of Aqueous Lanthanide
Dipicolinate Complexes with Chiral Para-Substitents o Molecular design of Novel
Anticancer Folate Inhibitors using Computational Chemistry and Molecular
