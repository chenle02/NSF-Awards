In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Robert W. Field of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his graduate student and undergraduate
student colleagues are investigating the ways in which electrons and nuclei
interact in Rydberg molecules. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Field
and his group is to develop a better understanding of the physics of molecules
in which the outermost electron is barely bound to the ion-core. The team
explores how energy is transferred between the weakly bound electron and the
nuclei in the ion core of these interesting quantum-mechanical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of core-nonpenetrating Rydberg molecules
(BaF, CaF, NO and NO2) will be produced with low energy using a buffer gas
cooled molecular beam source coupled with STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic
Passage) and/or ASTRO (Adiabatically Focused Stark-mixed Rydberg Orbitals)
excitation. Intra-Rydberg transitions will be probed using Chirped Pulse mm wave
Spectroscopy. Experimental results will be compared to state-of-the-art
theoretical methods.
