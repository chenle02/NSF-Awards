The SUNY-Albany detection network now consists of thirty direction finders
recording most of the cloud-to-ground flashes from Maine to Florida and as far
west as the Mississippi River. Several research projects will be conducted to
better understand the meteorological and physical characteristics of lightning.
These include, for example, the luminosity characteristics of triggered and
natural lightning, the physical characteristics of lightning in the "Lake
effect" snowstorms and in the regions of moisture convergence and cyclonic
surface vorticity in severe storms, and an evaluation of the reported positive
lightning ground flashes recorded throughout the year by the network.
