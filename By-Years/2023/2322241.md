The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance the understanding of predicting
default risks for borrowers that lack traditional access to loans and credit.
The project will result in a digital platform that efficiently underwrites
borrowers for small dollar loans using an innovative technical approach. The
project will allow any lender to use the platform to efficiently make small
dollar loans, sparing traditionally under-served borrowers from costly
alternative financial products. This technology helps financially vulnerable
households maintain stability when financial emergencies strike.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops more
effective ways to underwrite small dollar loans for traditionally underserved
borrowers. Nearly half of the adults in the U.S. lack a prime credit score that
is sufficiently high to allow them access to loans and credit. Traditional
lenders are hesitant to lend to applicants with lower credit scores, due to a
perceived higher risk of loss. The systems and information that are used to
generate credit scores have limitations that can prohibit credit-worthy
borrowers from receiving small dollar loans. The project will investigate
alternative methodologies of underwriting small dollar loan applicants. The
research will test these alternative methodologies and compare them to
traditional credit scoring as a determinant of credit risk, and by extension,
loan application approval. Upon completion, the project will demonstrate that an
alternative underwriting methodology can generate lower default rates and more
equitable lending decisions for small dollar loans when compared to traditional
credit scores.
