The principal investigator proposes to study a number of current problems in
Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry that have a strong connection with fully
nonlinear elliptic equations such as Monge-Ampere equations or mean curvature
equations. In particular the PI will attempt to extend his study of complete
hypersurfaces of constant curvature in hyperbolic space, especially in the
convex case, to the constant curvature simply connected Lorentz space forms,
namely Minkowski space, de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space. The PI will
also study boundedness and monotonicity properties of positive solutions of
semilinear elliptic pde's, especially in the so-called supercritical case.
Global boundedness fails in general but the PI will attempt to show monotonicity
of solutions in a uniform neighborhood of the boundary. He will also explore the
closely related problem of uniform boundedness of semi-stable solutions. There
is a close connection of this problem with the open Bernstein problem for stable
minimal hypersurfaces. Finally the PI is interested in the totally degenerate
complex Monge-Ampere equation described by Mabuchi, Semmes and Donaldson, which
arises in the study of geodesics in the space of Kahler potentials in a fixed
Kahler class.

This project is aimed at developing new analytic techniques to solve problems
in geometry, physics, biology and astronomy where the underlying physical and
geometrical equations can be described by elliptic partial differential
equations. Such techniques have been extremely successful in problems which
model curvature phenomena or use curvature flows as an analytic tool. These
methods have broad applications in pure and applied mathematics, especially
quantum physics and cosmology, image processing, optimal design and
computational biology.
