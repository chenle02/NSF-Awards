Professor Galvez performs experiments investigating the optical phenomenon of
superfluorescence. Superfluorescence is a collective effect in which an ensemble
of particles emit stimulated, coherent radiation. Although this effect has been
known for some time, it has been difficult to observe in a fundamental form.
Galvez and his group will carry out measurements of superfluorescence in the
small sample (Dicke) regime, and in a high field regime where superfluorescence
may be destroyed by dynamical chaos.
