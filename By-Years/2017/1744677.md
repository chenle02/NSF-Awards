The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to lower
costs and increase the diversity of biofuels, chemicals, and therapeutics that
can be produced by engineered cells that are used as 'living factories' in the
biomanufacturing industry. Because cells are alive, they accumulate mutations as
they grow. These mutations often reduce or even eliminate a cell's ability to
make the product it was designed to manufacture. This project aims to
commercialize technology for diagnosing what 'failure' mutations accumulate in
these cells during production in large bioreactors. This capability will provide
biotech companies with valuable information that they can use to re-engineer
cells to prevent mutations from leading to losses of product yield. Thus, it has
the potential to speed the progress of many new, renewable biomanufacturing
processes from early R&amp;D test stages to economically viable commercial
production at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project centers on
technology that provides diagnostic reports on the genetic stability of cells
used in biomanufacturing through a combination of advanced next-generation
sequencing and software workflows. This process can identify mutations that lead
to a loss of production in a cell population while they are thousands of times
rarer than can be detected by standard methods. Mutations that are rare when
cells are grown at small scale will become dominant when cells are grown at
larger production scales. Many such potential future failure mutations can be
profiled in one small bioreactor using this technology. Comprehensively
identifying failure mutations earlier in a R&amp;D pipeline in this way such
that they can re-engineer cells to prevent these problems before scale-up will
save companies developing these processes time and money. This project explores
the commercial viability of a service that provides these 'stability reports' to
biomanufacturing companies in order to allow them to more rapidly overcome
research and development obstacles related to mutations.
