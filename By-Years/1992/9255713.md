A year-long physics curriculum for high school students designed to develop and
integrate conceptual knowledge within problem solving contexts will be
developed. Students will interact with other students and teachers in using
concepts to analyze and solve goalfree, open-ended problems, in exploring the
meaning of concepts through inquiry and hands-on activities and in organizing
their conceptual knowledge in ways that highlight the major ideas in physics.
The proposed curriculum will be action-oriented, consistent with constructivist
epistemology, and will illustrate the power of applying concepts than formulaic
approaches to solving problems. The modules will cover the standard topics in
high school physics courses and can be used as supplements to other approaches
or as a stand-alone curriculum. The materials will consist of a terse student
reader, module activities, hands-on/inquiry activities, and a teachers manual
which contains the above plus information on preconceptions and suggestions for
using other materials. This project is based both on successful pilot project
which evaluated the approach in four ethnically diverse high schools and on
cognitive research on learning and problem solving. **
