This project is a component of the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE).
The P.I. will collaborate with other TIWE investigators to study the vorticity
balance of the upper ocean near the crests of the Pacific tropical instability
waves and the thermohaline fine structure of the front separating cold
equatorial water from warmer water to the north. A depth- cycled CTD and an
Acoustic Doppler Profiler will be used to sample the temperature, salinity, and
velocity fields, in conjunction with deployment of an array of satellite-tracked
drifted and a thermistor chain.
