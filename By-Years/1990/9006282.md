The major goal of this research is to investigate fundamental science
associated with processing and molecular structure of compound semiconductor
quantum dots embedded in glass matrices. Quantum dot structures having nanometer
size clusters of semiconducting materials (for example, cadmium telluride,
gallium arsenide, or indium phosphide) are formed by classical thermal
treatments of glasses supersaturated with the semiconducting material, and by
depositing the semiconducting materials from the vapor phase onto glass with
controlled pores. Time and temperature parameters for deposition are determined
using thermal analysis techniques, such as differential scanning calorimetry and
differential thermal analysis. The materials are being characterized using small
angle x-ray scattering, electron microscopy, magic angle sample spinning nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
