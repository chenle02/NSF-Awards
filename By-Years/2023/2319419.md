The 7th Eastern Conference In Mathematical Finance (ECMF), hosted at North
Carolina State University in October 20-22, 2023, contributes toward the ongoing
research and education goals in the field of financial mathematics. The meeting
is conducted with a workshop-type atmosphere to encourage interaction between
junior and senior researchers. This is a 3-day program with presentations on
recent developments in the field and offering structured discussion for possible
new research directions. This conference will emphasize teaching and the role of
financial mathematics in North Carolina, with the program including a special
session for student talks and posters. Support for this conference will enhance
participation from junior faculty and under-represented groups, with the goal of
contributing toward their career visibility and providing an opportunity for
interaction with a broader group of researchers.

The scientific focus is on financial risk management, system risk, applications
of machine learning, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and financial data
science. The post-2008 regulatory measures for counteracting systemic risk, such
as centralized clearing counterparties and increased capital requirements, are
perhaps being circumvented by financial innovation in blockchain databases for
cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges. Understanding of risks posed by
decentralized finance is of critical importance as the role of cryptocurrency
expands globally. In general, quantitative finance in that past decade has seen
a seismic shift away from parsimonious models toward the larger, more complex
models of machine learning. For example, the computational power of deep neural
networks has proven to be very effective in the development of data-driven
methods for computing financial benchmarks. The questions and analyses of these
types of quantitative finance technologies are the main theme for this 7th ECMF.
