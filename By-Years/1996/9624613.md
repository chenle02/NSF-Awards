CTS - 9624613 Michael Tsapatsis U of Massachusetts Amherst ABSTRACT The proposal
research deals with the preparation of mesoporous molecular sieve films using a
surfactant liquid crystalline template. The existence of liquid crystalline
mesostructure allows for a processing strategy similar to polymeric liquid
crystals. An induced macroscopic ordering of the mesostructure may result in
macroscopic perfection of the inorganic structure. Flow and magnetic fields will
be used to induce ordering and obtain oriented mesoporous molecular sieve
membranes and films. Spectroscopic and microscopic characterization of the film
structure will be performed and related to the processing conditions. The
potential impact to the project is strong in separations, catalysis, sensors,
and advanced electronic, magnetic and optical materials. The educational plan
includes new undergraduate and graduate courses in materials characterization
and mathematical modeling. Undergraduates will be involved in research and
trained to formulate and solve open-ended problems.
