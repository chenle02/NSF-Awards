This exploratory research is comprised of two distinct parts. The first and main
part considers estimation of a binary choice model. This is a statistical model
where the dependent variable (the one researchers are trying to explain or
predict using observed explanatory variables) can take only two values. For this
model, there are three values applied researchers are interested in estimating.
One is the set of the parameters of the prediction function, which can be used
to predict outcomes. The other values of interest are choice probabilities and
marginal effects. The former provides researchers with the probability of
observing a value of the dependent variable as a function of observed
explanatory variables, and the latter determines the effect of a change in the
value of the explanatory variable on this probability. Existing estimation
either cannot simultaneously estimate all values of interest, or they require
very strict assumptions on the relationship between the dependent and
explanatory variables. In contrast, the procedures developed in this research
project do not impose strict assumptions, yet enable joint estimation of the
three values of interest. The second part of this research involves the
estimation of a censored regression model, which is a statistical model where
the dependent variable is never observed to take a value exceeding a fixed
constant, referred to here as the censoring point. Many data sets encountered in
applied work exhibit this model's features. This research project develops a new
procedure which enables estimation of the prediction function in the region
beyond the censoring point. This cannot be done using existing methods without
stronger assumptions.
