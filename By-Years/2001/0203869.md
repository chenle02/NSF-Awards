TITLE: Software Innovations for Liquid Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We
propose to bring the advantages of custom logic to low-volume but high-
performance applications by semiautomatically generating custom logic, deployed
in reconfigurable logic. By coupling (hard-or soft-core) commodity processors
with reconfigurable logic, an application is essentially offered a liquid
architecture, where the definition and implementation of the computer's
instruction set, its coprocessors' functionality, and its supporting structures
can be easily changed. These architectural changes can improve performance by
supplying instructions and efficient implementations for frequently occurring
operations, by changing the size or policies of caches and other supporting
structures, and by dynamically exchanging speed for power-savings where
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With proper software support, liquid
architectures can improve the performance of many kinds of applications, ranging
from high-performance, scientific calculations to low-power, embedded systems.
Our research aims to develop the software infrastructure and methodologies
needed to facilitate execution of applications on liquid architectures,
addressing the following issues:&lt;br/&gt;
