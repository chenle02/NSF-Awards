Prof. Mahalingham at UC-Riverside has developed a subgrid-scale model for
describing combustion of mixture of gases produced by pyrolysis in a typical
forest wood fire. This model, combined with controlled experiments, provides a
basis for understanding the spread of wildfires. Similarly, the University of
Coimbra in Portugal has developed an active research program in this area, and
Portuguese researchers recently visited the labs in California. This award
supports a short visit by the PI to Portugal to share research ideas as to
develop a more active collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both California and
Portugal have suffered serious damage from wildfires in the past year, and the
two universities (UC-Riverside and Coimbra) have undertaken research to
understand better the mechanisms of fire spread and blow-up. The trip will not
only enable the PI to share his ideas and techniques but also to gain access to
recent European developments in this field. A better understand of these
mechanism can promote control of fires, which are a serious social problem.
Also, with the expectation that the visit will lead to future collaboration,
there is potential to involve American students in cooperative research and
exchanges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
