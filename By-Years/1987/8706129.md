Pathogenicity genes of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola have been
identified, cloned and partially characterized. They are located in ca. 20 kb
region. At least some loci in this region control the interaction of this
bacterium with non-host plants as well. DNA sequences from this region are
conserved and interchangeable among several pathovars of the "syringae" group of
the fluorescent phytopathogenic Pseudomonas. Expression of two regions in the 20
kb segment is activated upon inoculation of the bacteria onto plants. We propose
to characterize these regions in detail, identify other regions that may be
plant-induced and determine the nature of the plant factors that mediate the
activation process.
