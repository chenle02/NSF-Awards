An award is made to Pace University to acquire a quantitative real-time gene
expression monitoring system for use in undergraduate research and teaching.
This equipment will support the participation of undergraduate students, with a
focus on women and underrepresented minorities, in biological research. Research
training utilizing this equipment will allow students to design, execute, and
analyze research projects at the cutting edge of biological research in areas
that have not yet been fully explored. Additionally, this equipment will allow
for the development and testing of a flexible genetics and molecular biology
curriculum that is proven to enhance student learning and can be implemented by
any institution to facilitate student engagement in discovery-driven research
projects.

The students and faculty using this equipment will be answering research
questions in a broad range of areas, including how cells divide, how fish and
bacteria responds to stress, how viruses survive in the host, and how an
organism responds to changes in diet. The answers to these questions will
increase students' understanding of basic aspects of ecology, evolution, cancer
biology, cell biology, developmental biology, immunology, and microbiology.
Moreover, this equipment will support original research to further the
understanding of how genes are regulated, thereby providing insight into a
variety of biological systems.
