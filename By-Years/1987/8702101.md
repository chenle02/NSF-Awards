Kinetics of Phase Separation in Partially Miscible Polymer Blends: This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. This research project
involves a study of the initial correlation lengths and subsequent development
and growth of two phase morphology within the spinodals of partially miscible
polymer blends using small angle neutron scattering. The process will be
investigated as a function of the molecular weight of the polymers and the
interactions between them. The result will be used to evaluate current theories
of phase separation. The project is under the Direction of Professor Robert A.
Weiss, Chemical Engineering Department and Polymer Science Program, University
of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268, U.S.A., and Professor R. W. H. Sargent,
Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology, London SW7 2 BY,
England. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,
international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if
applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance
of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
