This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Occidental College to acquire a Raman spectrometer
with laser and variable temperature capability for use in the following research
projects: 1. The determination of the mechanistic role and structure of various
complexes present during electrophilic aromatic alkylation, chlorination and
acylation-related reactions; 2. The effects of metal-ion binding on the
secondary structure of calmodulin and other regulating proteins; 3. The
photochemical reactivity of furocoumarins (psoralens) toward unsaturated
compounds, such as thymine residues in DNA; 4. A mechanistic study of the
photochemical reactivity of flavins by laser-induced photo-CIDNP technique. 5.
The synthesis of bimetallic transition-metal complexes containing carbon-carbon
triple bonds. Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational
transitions in molecules. The information obtained sometimes complements that
obtained from an infrared study and provides valuable structural information.
Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a
powerful solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample
photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise quality. Raman
spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies of condensed-phase chemical and
biomolecular systems.
