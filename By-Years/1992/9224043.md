Most people have a standing decision to be tolerant or intolerant. Researchers
concerned with tolerance have generally assumed that people rely on these
established beliefs when reacting to disliked groups. Yet outburst of
intolerance and repression are part of the United States' historical landscape.
Why have these outbursts occurred? This research investigation provides a
possible explanation for these fluctuations in tolerance. When people feel
threatened, which is likely when an unpopular group bursts onto the political
scene, a natural response is anxiety. These feelings of anxiety may subsequently
result in political intolerance. Preliminary results from a series of pretest
studies corroborate the relationships among threat, anxiety and intolerance:
people's perceptions of a group's belligerence and treachery result in increased
anxiety and, hence, increased intolerance. But how are these threat perceptions,
shaped? The investigators will examine the impact of threat on tolerance by
studying variations in how the media and political and legal elites present
unpopular groups and their ideas. To examine these concerns, the researchers
present video stimuli to people in a series of experiments developed in three
phases. Phase I involves creating realistic videos about the two most frequently
chosen least-liked groups in the pretest studies: racist and pro-choice groups.
Four videos for each group will contain combinations of the two experimental
manipulations: high and low versions of the probability of the group coming to
power, and threatening and reassuring versions of the group violating the norms
of proper, orderly behavior. They will also create video segments that have
legal or political elites priming abstract democratic principles. Phase II
consists of manipulation checks to ensure that the videos actually manipulate
the intended qualities. Phase III involves conducting the full experiments. In
the first experiment, subjects will be randomly assigned to a video presentation
that includes the normative violations and probability manipulations. The second
experiment will use these videos with the democratic norms segment added to
them. The third set of experiments will examine variations on these basic
experiments, including placing tolerance in an electoral context, varying the
length of media coverage, and varying the nature of exposure to news stories
about the group. The model of political decision making they develop potentially
has wide application in the areas of media priming and framing effects,
controlled and automatic processing of information, and affective and cognitive
reactions to political stimuli.
