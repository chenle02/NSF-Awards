In this project ("The Kinetics of Isomer-Specific Oxygen Exchange Reactions of
Optically Active Alcohols as a Function of Acid-Catalyzed Racemization") in the
Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Margaret V.
Merritt of the Chemistry Department at Wellesley College will determine the rate
constants for oxygen exchange for isomers as a function of racemization of a
series of chiral alcohols. These detailed kinetic studies will enhance the
understanding of reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates in these and
related systems. The rate constants for oxygen exchange as a function of
racemization of a series of chiral alcohols will be used to probe the structural
features that lead to asymmetric solvation of carbocation intermediates and to
investigate the structure of water within the solvation sphere. The mechanistic
conclusions will be based on the microscopic rate constants for three competing
processes at the alpha carbon atom and the oxygen isotope effects for these
processes. The three competing processes being studied are substitution (O-18
exchange) without inversion, substitution (O-18 exchange) with retention, and
inversion without substitution.
