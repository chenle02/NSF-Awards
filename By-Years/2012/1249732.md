This is a project to study subtropical gyres, which are lower-tropospheric
cyclones occurring between 12N and 30N in northern summer, especially in the
western North Pacific. They are larger than tropical cyclones (TCs), and
sometimes contain TCs that form within them and propagate cyclonically around
them. The work will investigate the origin, climatology, structure, and dynamics
of the gyres, and study their spatial and temporal distribution and their
contribution to precipitation and TC genesis. The project begins by determining
an appropriate set of criteria to define subtropical gyres, so that an automated
process can be used to create a record of them, to be used to determine their
spatial and seasonal distribution, typical size and duration, and variations
associated with El Nino and events and the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Next, the
research will focus on the structure, evolution, and dynamics of subtropical
gyres. In addition to the observational record, the research will use
simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to examine the
contributions of various physical mechanisms to gyre evolution, including the
surface wind response to diabatic heating associated with convection within the
gyre, and the subsequent enhancement of surface heat exchange on the western
side of the gyre.

Research on subtropical gyres has societal value given the association of the
gyres with TC formation. Typhoons forming within subtropical gyres pose a threat
to the coastal regions of East and Southeast Asia, and the work performed under
this award may contribute to better understanding and prediction of these
storms. In addition, the project supports a graduate student and thus
contributes to the next generation of researchers in this scientific area.
