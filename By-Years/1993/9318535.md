OPP-9318535 Kane Development of climatic models has intensely highlighted the
fact that almost all of the important processes controlling climate are
interactive and that it is vital to understand the linkages between these
processes; for example, what is the role of the hydrologic system in connecting
atmospheric and terrestrial processes. As a component of the ARCSS LAII Flux
study, the objective of this project is to improve the understanding of the
linkages between atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems; specifically,
this means developing a quantitative understanding of the energy and mass
transfer processes of the hydrologic regime. A primary component of this study
is a field measurement program to quantify the water balance of watersheds that
are physically quite different (for example, watersheds in the Foothills
compared to those on the Coastal Plain) and an energy balance of the entire
region from the Arctic Ocean to the Brooks Range. One goal is to develop a
physically based, spatially distributed hydrologic model that, when combined
with the results of cooperating LAII researchers, can be coupled with the
biogeochemical processes of a watershed. Other goals are to develop an
understanding of the mechanisms which impact snow distribution and a working
model of lateral and vertical fluxes of water and energy in the entire Kuparuk
watershed. ***
