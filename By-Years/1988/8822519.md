8822519 Payne The principal investigator will conduct research in applied
mathematics in the general area of partial differential equations. The specific
areas are ill-posed problems, isoperimetric inequalities and maximum principles,
St. Venant and Phragmen-Lindelof problems, stability studies, and overdetermined
systems. Among other problems, the principle investigator will study the
question of convergence of the steady flow of a viscous flow in a pipe to fully
developed pipe flow under relatively arbitrary entry conditions. He also plans
to derive St. Venant type results in classical elasticity that are meaningful in
the neighborhood of the Poisson's ratio equal to 1/2. A third investigation will
deal with stability studies in a convection problem for a thermomicropolar
fluid, and still another will attempt to derive an explicit rate of convergence
of the flow of a micropolar fluid to Navier-Stokes flow as the interaction
parameter tends to zero. He will continue his attempts to stabilize ill-posed
problems against errors in geometry (a necessary prerequisite to the numerical
treatment of such problems), and will apply a new approach to the study of
overdetermined systems to an assortment of problems for which the maximum
principle is inapplicable.
