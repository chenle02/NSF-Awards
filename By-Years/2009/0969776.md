The objective of this research project is the conception of a new
micromanufacturing process that emulates the material removal mechanisms that
characterize micro electro-discharge machining. It will not require the use of
electrodes and will not be limited to conductive materials only. The process
will use ultra-short laser pulses focused in a dielectric slightly above the
workpiece surface - instead of electric discharges between an electrode and a
conductive workpiece - to create plasma whose explosive expansion facilitates
material removal. The work will involve a substantial experimental component
focused on the physical realization of the process. In addition, process
characterization will be performed through the use of embedded micro-sensors to
measure the temperature and stresses just below the source of the shock waves
created by the plasma. The theoretical work will focus on the modeling and
control of plasma properties and on the investigation of the physical principles
that govern the laser-induced plasma-assisted process with emphasis on plasma-
matter interaction and the material removal mechanisms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new processes will offer unique capabilities not
achievable by other currently existing competing methods for the manufacture of
micro-scale components and features with high relative accuracy and complex
geometries in a wide range of engineering materials. It will also entirely
circumvent problems and costs associated with tool manufacture, wear and
compensation in micro electro-discharge machining and the complexities of
conventional laser processing. Real time process monitoring of the newly
developed process through the use of embedded micro-sensors will offer an
unprecedented instantaneous insight into the thermal and mechanical responses of
the material during processing. This monitoring technique, once successfully
realized, will also be applicable to other micro- as well as macro-scale process
monitoring tasks.
