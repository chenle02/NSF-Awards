Machine learning is increasingly used in systems common in daily life -- from
search engines to online education to smart homes. Through interactions with
their users, these systems learn about the world to improve efficiency and
performance. Building effective and robust Human-Interactive Learning (HIL)
systems, however, requires a framework that simultaneously integrates models of
human behavior with the design of machine learning algorithms, because user data
is only an indirect mapping, mediated through the human decision-making process,
of the knowledge the system aims to elicit. This project takes an
interdisciplinary approach to developing effective techniques to design human-
interactive learning systems.

This project explores how humans provide data and how learning algorithms use
this data in an integrated framework that encompasses three aspects. First, the
project develops models of the user decision process, formalizing how observable
user actions map to the underlying knowledge the system aims to acquire. Second,
these models inform the design of the interface that connects the user and the
learning algorithm to suitably trade off the quantity and quality of the data
acquired. Third, the user model and interface motivate new machine learning
settings and algorithms to maximize learning efficiency. By developing an
integrated framework for the three interconnected components for building Human
Interactive Learning Systems -- human decision models, information-elicitation
interfaces, and learning algorithms -- this project will impact future designs
of widely-used systems such as non-web information search, recommendation, and
online education.
