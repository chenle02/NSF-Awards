9628552 Metcalf The Trinity terrane, in the eastern Klamath Mountains of
California, lies between an early Devonian subduction-related trench and an
immature early Devonian volcanic island arc, and constitutes the largest
exposure of ultramafic rock in North America. However, lithologic and
geochemical data are complex, with disparate implied tectonic environments. The
project will test three current models to explain these rocks (single section of
oceanic lithosphere, back-arc basin or a variant such as a supra-subduction zone
origin). The main goals are to determine the age and duration of magmatism,
determine the petrogenesis and tectonic setting of the mafic intrusive
complexes, and to attempt to identify ultradepleted mantle that is coeval with
the mafic-intrusive complexes as predicted by the favored model. Results have
the potential to provide a unifying explanation for all lower Paleozoic
lithotectonic elements in the eastern Klamath Mountains in which all three
terranes evolved doing a single convergent margin tectonic episode.
