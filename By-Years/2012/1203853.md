Lewis and Clark Community College (L&amp;C) is developing a STEM-based outreach
program using hands-on activities for the design and construction of trebuchets.
Project activities include constructing STEM-based learning objectives for the
trebuchet competition, expanding an existing trebuchet contest to a broader and
diverse number of high schools, building collaborative relationships with
schools of engineering at regional universities, arranging strategies for
tracking the enrollment histories of engineering students, and building
partnerships with regional industries to support STEM-based engineering and
engineering technology programs. L&amp;C is expanding the level of participation
of high schools to at least 25 schools (and 80 teams). Collaborating partners
are the Schools of Engineering at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville
(SIUE) and Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology (MST). Industrial
partners include Covidien Pharmaceutical and Boeing (both of St. Louis). A
freshman-level course to introduce students to engineering is also being
developed. The project consults with leaders of a related project at Sierra
College (CA) and their NSF/ATE Center for Applied Competitive Technologies.
