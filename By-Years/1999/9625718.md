9625718 Pilinis Atmospheric aerosol particles consist of solid and liquid
multicomponent phases. Some aerosol chemical constituents are sulfate, nitrate,
ammonium, sodium, chloride, water, soot, organic matter, and dust. These species
are not distributed evenly among particles of different sizes. As a result, the
physical, chemical, and optical properties of particles of various sizes may
differ. The nonhomogeneous distribution of chemical species within aerosol
particles of different sizes are factors which currently introduce uncertainty
into models which attempt to quantify direct forcing effects by atmospheric
aerosols. Research conducted under this award will support the development of an
aerosol model which accounts for the major processes that shape the size
distribution and composition of atmospheric particles. Aerosol optical
properties, including single scattering albedo, phase functions, asymmetry
factors and upscatter fraction will be calculated for use in column radiative
transfer models. The radiative transfer models will be used to calculate the
direct aerosol forcing over shortwave and longwave radiation fields. The PI will
evaluate the model by comparing model results with measured aerosol
concentrations and aerosol optical properties. Once tested, the model will be
used to estimate the effects of uncertainties in model input parameters to
direct forcing due to aerosols. *** ATM-9625718
