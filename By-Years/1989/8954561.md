This project will design, develop, and evaluate an innovative summer institute
for secondary science teachers that integrates regional resources into graduate-
level science modules. The modules will be developed by teams involving
university scientists, inservice teachers, and science educators. The modules
will be taught by the scientists and carry the appropriate science-department
rubric. The teaching institute will involve 150 secondary school teachers from
Montana and the Rocky Mountain region over three years. Project outcomes will
include sixteen modules in biology, chemistry, earth sciences, and physics
developed and tested by special cooperative developmental teams, and an
institute model for cooperative course development between university science
departments and their college of education. The Rocky-Mountain Institute model
will be disseminated to about a half-dozen other universities geographically
distributed throughout the country. An amount equivalent to 41.6% of the NSF
award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
