The Convex C1 is a very fast state-of-the-art "mini-super computer" that
utilizes a pipeline vector processor and a memory cache to achieve a high level
of computational throughput. The C1 will allow the students and faculty to
pursue a wider range of problems using the best of current methods and to
complete the studies at a reasonable rate. This award from the Division of
Materials Research and the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help
the Departments of Chemistry and Physics of Wake Forest University purchase an
upgrade of their Convex C1-XP computer. This upgrade will be used to study
problems in the following areas: 1. Nonlinear condensed matter systems 2.
Electronic structure calculations for solids and surfaces 3. Point defect
structures 4. Parity violation and chirality in atoms and molecules 5.
Deterministic and stochastic phenomena in non-equilibrium chemical systems. 6.
Quantum chemical studies of short-lived and weakly bound molecular species.
