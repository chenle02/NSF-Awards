This project uses a closed-loop, servohydraulic system to enhance the quality of
laboratory instruction in three required undergraduate courses in the School of
Civil Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology: Materials of
Construction, Physical Properties of Soils and Rocks, and Experimental
Structural Analysis. The equipment provides these classes with a state-of-the-
art, computer controlled system capable of applying cyclic loads, and allows the
students to perform critical and innovative experiments on conventional and
emerging materials. The new experiments emphasize tests involving fatigue and
cyclic behavior of conventional and new engineering materials such as plastics
and high-strength fiber-reinforced composites. Repair and rehabilitation methods
and the testing of connections are included in the experimental program.
Students are also exposed to techniques for field testing of soils that are
important to geotechnical site assessments. The system is similar to state-of-
the-art equipment that students will most likely encounter in industry after
graduation.
