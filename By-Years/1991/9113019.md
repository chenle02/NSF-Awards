ABSTRACT The development of the expression of definite versus indefinite
reference in Finnish, a language which lacks articles, will be studied by
examining narrative data collected from 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year-old native
Finnish-speaking children and adults. This data will be compared to similar data
from speakers of article-bearing languages (English, German, and Spanish), as
well as one non-ariticle-bearing language (Turkish), to determine how and the
degree to which Finnish, a Language which expresses definiteness in a variety of
ways, influences the child's acquisition and use of this semantic/pragmatic
category. In comparing the acquisition of article-bearing and non-article-
bearing languages, this research will also provide further insight into the
basic Operating Principles that children bring to the acquisition task. This
research also begins to fill the gap of discourse-oriented studies on the
acquisition of Finnish, focussing on a much larger age range than previously
dealt with as well.
