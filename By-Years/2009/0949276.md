This project is supporting the updating of Lehigh University's laboratory for
argon-argon and uranium-thorium-helium dating. These techniques for dating
minerals (termed "noble-gas thermochronology") are relevant to the geosciences
because they allow estimates to be made of the time and temperature history of
rocks over the range 50 degrees C to 500 degrees C. This is an important
temperature range that has bearing on many geological processes, as heat is an
important driving agent for many geologic processes (e.g. ore and oil formation)
and in turn many of these processes cause temperatures to change within the
Earth (e.g., due to erosion in mountainous areas). Noble-gas dating techniques
are also used to determine precise ages for geological materials, such as
volcanic ashes and lavas, thus allowing calibration of the age of sedimentary
sections that contain records of biological evolution, climate variations, and
other environmental changes, over a range from 50,000 to more than 500 million
years. Knowledge of time and temperature is critical to the understanding of
Earth resources, natural hazards, and the basic functioning of Earth systems.

The laboratory upgrades are contributing to research infrastructure by
facilitating greatly simplified and higher-purity sample preparation, full
automation of both the helium- and argon-dating systems to permit higher sample
throughput, and improvements in pumping and gas clean-up that will improve the
precision of individual analyses. These upgrades are supporting studies of
mountain and landscape development in Tibet, Alaska, Central America, and
Mongolia by researchers at Lehigh University, as well as collaborative studies
with industry and academic researchers at other institutions. These upgrades are
providing more ready access to the laboratory by graduate and undergraduate
students, exposing more students to modern methods of geological research, thus
contributing to teaching and learning.
