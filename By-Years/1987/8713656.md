The dynamical and chemical evolution of hot gas in elliptical galaxies will be
studied. Gas ejected from orbiting stars in these galaxies is heated by mutual
dissipation and supernova explosions to about 10 million degrees Celsius. Late
in the evolution of massive elliptical galaxies for current supernova rates,
this gas is trapped in the deep potential wells of the dark halos and slowly
cools into the centers of galaxies, emitting observable soft X-rays.
Investigations of what combinations of dark halo structures and supernova rates
are consistent with observed X-ray luminosities will be carried out. An
evolutionary calculation of gas flow that matches observed X-ray luminosities
would establish the total amount of gas that cooled into the galactic center.
Knowledge of the total mass ejected from evolving stars provides a good estimate
of the total stellar mass in the upper main sequence beyond the current turnoff.
The total amount of matter that cooled into the galactic core is limited since
it must not distort the observed stellar surface brightness. With this
constraint, the evolutionary calculations can be used to infer quantitative
information about the initial mass function of the galactic stars, the history
of supernova activity, and the amount of primordial gas present after galactic
formation or added afterwards. Preliminary calculations will be verified, based
on likely stellar and supernova properties, that indicate massive ellipticals
were swept clean shortly after formation by supernova- driven galactic winds
which later turned into cooling flows with relatively little matter flow into
the galactic cores. In addition, the chemical enrichment and abundance gradients
in the winds and cooling flows will be calculated. These metallicity gradients
will provide information about past supernova activity. These studies will also
be extended to low mass and dwarf ellipticals and to hot galactic flows in
spiral galaxies which are believed may tend to be winds rather than cooling
flows.//
