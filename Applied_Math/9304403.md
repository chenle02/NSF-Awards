This work involves five problems on the mathematical theory of motion of
continua: 1. Motion of an incompressible fluid with free boundary and surface
tension. The PI plans to show that the initial value problem is well-posed. 2.
Existence for all time of solutions to the equations of motion of an
incompressible Neo- Hookean material in two space dimensions. 3. Existence for
all time of solutions of the equations of motion of an incompressible material
in three space if the initial data are small. 4. Existence for all time of
solutions to the equations of gas dynamics with small initial data in three
space. 5. Existence for all time of solutions to the equations of motion of a
perfect fluid in three-space. This study will broaden our understanding of the
mechanisms of motion of liquids, gases, and deformable solids and complication
that may occur such as formation of shocks and singularities. The dynamical
study of the continua forms to theoretical basis for many areas of mechanical
engineering and aerodynamics.
