This Ocean Sciences Instrumentation development project will develop a timed-
release telemetering data capsule for use on moored and bottom-mounted
instruments such as current meters. A goal for the project is the ability to
attach one or more data capsules to instrumentation for long-term deployment. A
capsule's controller will compress, encode, and store data collected by the
instrument. At some predetermined time, the controller will activate a release
enabling the capsule to rise to the surface, whereupon it will transmit the
stored data ashore via a satellite communications link. Various data encoding
and telemetring schemes for a micro-computer based controller will be developed
and interfaced to a choice of existing data recorders. Instrumentation mounting
assemblies and capsule release mechanisms will also be developed and field
tested. The use of such data capsules will provide logistic and scientific
advantages over present systems that require the entire instrument package to be
retrieved before data is collected. In remote geographical areas where data is
sparse and expensive to collect, long-term instrumentation could be deployed
with the scientist being able to receive data periodically. Not only would there
be an indication that the instruments were working properly, but there will also
be the option of progressively analyzing data and altering experimental design
based on received information. Data capsules also enhance the possibility of
using expendable instrumentation that have certain economical advantages.
