The objectives of this proposed research are twofold: 1) to investigate the
impact of high spatial density dynamic measurement and rotational degrees-of-
freedom measurement on dynamic structural modification, 2) to develop an optimal
degrees of freedom in the experimentally derived dynamic model. This work will
result in a more informationally complete dynamics model which should be able to
predict the response of proposed modifications on the structure. The
modifications to the structure will be realized by synthesizing a structural
element that generates the desired response based on prescribed design goals and
constraints. Results from the field of structural optimization will be applied
to the experimental dynamics model to make the design trade-offs.
