This effort deals with the use of a crystal, Lithium Niobate, for use in
lightwave technology as it relates to the ability to impress information, or
modulate a lightwave or to steer a lightwave among various chosen paths. This
research will address fundamental questions involving the guiding of a lightwave
in channels or waveguides produced in the crystal by indiffusion of lithium.
