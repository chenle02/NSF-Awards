In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, funded by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. James Farrar (University of Rochester) will conduct
spectroscopic studies of singly and doubly charged ions, prepared by a novel
laser vaporization method in clusters with controlled numbers of polar solvent
molecules. Combined with ab initio quantum calculations, these experiments will
reveal specific features of solvent dependent charge transfer processes. %%%
Clusters, in which a molecule is surrounded by only a few weakly associated
neighbors, represent a unique state of matter with properties between those of
gases and liquids. Prof. Farrar (University of Rochester) has developed a new
method of preparing clusters with an electric charge and a closely controlled
cluster size, and will use lasers to study how the properties of the cluster
change as the number of molecules in the cluster increases. This will provide a
beautifully detailed, step-by-step picture of how solvents affect properties of
the dissolved material. The results are of fundamental importance to our
understanding of how and why solvents influence chemical reactivity.
