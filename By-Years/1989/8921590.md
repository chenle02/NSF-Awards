With this award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program Dr. Joseph T. Hupp will assess the various factors which govern the
light-induced transfer of electrons between the metal centers in molecules which
contain two metal atoms. The information to be gained will provide a deeper
understanding of processes which are important in the conversion of light energy
to chemical energy and in biological electron transfer. The goal of the project
is to assess directly various superexchange contributions to intervalence
charge-transfer reactions in bimetallic complexes. The modulation of electronic
interactions by changes in distance, temperature, solvent and external orbitals
will be investigated. The experimental strategy will involve the synthesis of a
variety of new polypyridyl ligands designed to modulate the distance of
separation of the two metals, and of a variety of new bifunctional crown ether-
containing ligands designed to modulate intervalence charge transfer by forming
inclusion complexes with either aromatic molecules or with simple closed-shell
cations.
