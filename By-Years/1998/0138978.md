The Department of Bacteriology and the Graduate School of the University of
Wisconsin Madison will provide opportunities for summer research projects for
undergraduates in microbiology, molecular biology and related fields. Students
from colleges with limited opportunities for research and members of groups
underrepresented in science are especially encouraged to apply. The main goal of
the program is to attract and stimulate motivated students to pursue careers in
research, while providing them hands-on experience. Participating students will
work as part of a dynamic research team investigating a basic problem in
cellular or molecular biology. Students will become familiar with research
techniques of microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology using
modern equipment and facilities. Students will attend professional seminars and
make oral presentations of their research findings. They will attend workshops
and seminars aimed at preparing them for admissions to competitive graduate
programs. Students will be part of a collective group of approximately 100 other
students from all over the United States and Puerto Rico participating in other
Summer Research Opportunity Programs on campus. REU-Microbiology students will
participate with other summer research interns in several social and educational
events.
