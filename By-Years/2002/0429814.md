This award supports the initiation of an exploratory project whose long term aim
is development of equipment and procedures for determination of the three-
dimensional atomic structure of proteins that cannot be crystallized. The new
equipment will be used to generate a beam of superliquid helium drops, each
containing a single hydrated protein molecule. The molecules will be oriented
within the drops by use of laser, and an electron diffraction pattern will be
generated by passing the drops through a high energy electron beam. Data from
individual drops will be combined to provide a diffraction pattern, and then
analyzed using recently developed iterative methods. Alternatively, more
standard approaches that depend on isomorphous replacement can be used.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two initial steps to be supported by this award
include the development of a molecular-beam source of hydrated proteins in
submicron-sized, vitreous ice balls at liquid helium temperature, and the
development of an electron diffraction camera and area detector capable of
analysis of the jet of the doped ice balls. Laser spectroscopy will be used to
confirm that proteins in the ice-balls are not denatured, and the success of the
second step will be demonstrated by looking for Debye-Scherrer ring electron
diffraction patterns from the proteins in the beam of doped ice balls. The
project will provide traing for a postdoctoral student, and will augment the
content of existing departmental education outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
