A fundamental challenge in machine learning is the design of computational
agents that, rather than being explicitly programmed, autonomously learn complex
tasks in stochastic real-world environments. Past approaches, such as
reinforcement learning algorithms for solving Markov decision processes, scale
poorly to large state spaces. The proposed research addresses this curse of
dimensionality by investigating a novel framework combining reinforcement
learning and online convex optimization, in particular mirror descent and
related algorithms. Mirror descent scales significantly better than classical
first-order gradient descent in high-dimensional state spaces, by using a
distance-generating function specific to a particular state space geometry.

The proposed framework enables several significant algorithmic advances in the
design of autonomous machine learning agents: a new class of first-order mirror-
descent based methods for learning sparse solutions to Markov decision processes
will be developed that scale significantly significantly better than previous
second-order methods; novel hierarchical methods for solving semi-Markov
decision processes will be investigated; and finally, applications to a variety
of high-dimensional Markov decision processes will be explored.

The anticipated outcomes of the proposed work include foundational advances in
designing autonomous agents that learn to solve sequential decision-making
problems, which will impact a large number of target applications from
manufacturing to robotics and scheduling. The educational goal includes the
development of a graduate-level course in online convex optimization for
sequential decision-making, as well as interdisciplinary tutorials to enhance
the cross-fertilization of ideas from applied mathematics and optimization to
machine learning and artificial intelligence.
