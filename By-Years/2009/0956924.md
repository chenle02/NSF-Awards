Multimedia research, in particular, media understanding research which
traditionally largely relies on computer vision research, has been around for
many years. However, in general this area still remains open due to the
challenging nature in computer vision research. The goal of this project is to
attempt to narrow down the whole area to the connected multimedia with the hope
to solve for real-world problems in this narrow area that shall lead to the
technology development. To achieve this goal, this project is aimed at
organizing an international workshop on connected multimedia to specifically
address the general media understanding problem under the two constraints -- the
social aspect and the cultural aspect. The intellectual merits are manifested
through the expected advances in the literature of multimedia, data mining,
information retrieval, as well as computer vision after the workshop; it is also
expected that organizing this workshop may expedite and catalyze the
interdisciplinary development in the areas of multimedia, data mining,
information retrieval, and computer vision. The broader impacts of organizing
this workshop include the promoted collaborations between computer scientists
and social scientists and between academia and industries to work together to
solve the problems on the topic of connected multimedia, which may further lead
to technological development to provide effective solutions to several important
real-world problems. The advanced literature this workshop generates may also
serve as the updated materials for the graduate students working in the related
areas to broaden and enrich their exposure to their professional training and
education.
