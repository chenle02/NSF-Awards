This project seeks to develop dynamic multiple photon laser microscopic methods
to non-invasively quantify plasmid retention, transfer, and expression within
model bacterial biofilms.&lt;br/&gt;Recent literature has confirmed that
adherent bacteria are phenotypically different than their freely suspended
counterparts. Being bound within a biofilm may also enhance the segregational
stability, expression, and rate of conjugative transfer of plasmid-DNA between
bacteria. This is important since plasmid-bearing bacteria, in a biofilm, may
transfer genes and phenotypes (e.g., disinfectant and antibiotic resistance,
xenobiotic degradation capacity) more readily to neighboring bacteria. To date,
little quantitative data exists regarding plasmid retention, transfer, and
expression in mixed culture biofilm ecosystems. Specific aims are to: (1)
Develop recombinant bacterial species and recombinant plasmid(s) that will allow
non-invasive microscopic determination of areal concentrations of all biofilm
inhabitants including plasmid-bearing hosts, plasmid-free recipients, and
transconjugants in a developing model biofilm; (2) Evaluate the segregational
and structural stability of the transfer recombinant plasmid in developing pure
cultures; (3) Refine existing non-invasive microscopic methods to quantify
plasmid retention and transfer within developing binary-and tertiary culture
biofilms; and (4) Quantify plasmid transfer kinetics and heterologous gene
expression within a model tertiary culture biofilm community as a function of
environmental conditions (nutrient concentration, O2 concentration, pH), donor
species (gram positive vs. gram negative), and donor fluid phase
concentration.&lt;br/&gt;
