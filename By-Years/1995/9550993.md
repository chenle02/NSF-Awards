The university is purchasing a modern photodiode array (PDA) instrument to
upgrade its analytical chemistry curriculum. Semester-long courses in
Quantitative and Instrumental Analysis are being integrated into a 2-semester
series entitled Analytical Chemistry I and II. The department also plans to
integrate a course in Spectrometric Identification. The instrument is utilized
in General Chemistry and Biochemistry. The primary objective in General
Chemistry is to increase student interest in the sciences by exposing them to
modern instrumentation early in their undergraduate career. In Analytical
Chemistry-I, students are exposed to the advantages of PDA technology for the
quantitative analysis of mixtures, and to study reaction equilibria under
varying environmental conditions. The instrument is used for lessons in
precision and accuracy in Analytical Chemistry-II and for lessons in
spectroscopy in Spectrometric Identification. Lastly, the instrument exposes
Biochemistry majors to the latest methods for analyzing enzyme kinetics,
including the determination of constants that characterize binding and reaction
rates.
