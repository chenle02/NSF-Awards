Original wind speed records in the form of continuous gust strip charts are
examined to develop pertinent statistics of wind speeds for use in existing
probabilistic load combination methods. The wind is modelled as a square wave
Poisson pulse process. The statistics obtained are expected frequency of
structurally significant wind speeds, mean duration of wind speed, and the
probability distribution of the mean wind speed during an occurrence. The
statistics are verified by comparing extreme wind statistics obtained from the
developed model with those obtained previously by other researchers. Various
sites from across the contiguous U.S. are used in the development of the
statistics. Results from this work will contribute to improve mapping and gust
criteria for structures design, and will be useful in structural reliability
modeling.
