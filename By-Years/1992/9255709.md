Based on the research on one of the participants of this workshop, children
carry their most positive associations and strongest desires for future
experiences with subjects encountered in their work in the arts- graphic,
dramatic, plastic or mechanical. Scientists tend to liken their work closely to
that of the creative teachers with three scientist, three artists and three
experts in learning theory and innovative science teaching most of whom are
MacArthur Fellows who have been meeting informally over the last two years. The
workshop will produce some prototype materials on three topics which must be of
common experience to middle school or high school students and be topics of
current research. These materials will be for teachers to implement in classes
the following year. The materials will have input from students in a separate,
concurrent summer program at the same location. The MacArthur Foundation is
cofunding the Workshop. The results of the Workshop may result in the production
of more materials using the methods of the graphic arts in the study of science.
