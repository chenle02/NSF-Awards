Abstract The development of theories about organizations has been impeded by
the absence of systematic studies of attributes across heterogeneous types of
organizations. Apart from uncertainties in how to devise representative samples
of organizations, in general, there are measurement uncertainties. Specifically,
what is the reliability of measures of organizational attributes across diverse
samples of organizations? This investigation entails a survey in a sample of 300
firms of three types: for-profit businesses, non-profit, and government
agencies. Within each, five upper level functionaries will be asked a variety of
questions about their organization's: size, specialization, values, and so on.
Reliability coefficients will then be computed to assess the consistency among
the five respondents within each surveyed organization. In addition,
covariations among responses will be analyzed to indicate what type of
functionary is best able to speak for an organization.
