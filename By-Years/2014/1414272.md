Support is provided for student travel and partial support for a limited number
of faculty speakers at "Tenth International Nanotechnology Conference on
Communication and Cooperation (INC10)" to be held on May 13-16, 2014 at the NIST
campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The INC10 meeting brings together some of the
world's most renowned and technologically advanced researchers to exchange
information and ideas on nanotechnology, nano-optics and nano-
electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronics, a two-trillion-dollar enterprise,
has been the major enabler of the computer, communication and consumer
industries throughout the 20th century, and has propelled the growth of the
global economy for last several decades. Most of the building blocks of these
industries will reach fundamental limits by the end of the next decade. It is of
fundamental importance that these limits are overcome in the next 10 years,
possibly through the use of devices enabled by nanotechnology. The meeting
(INC10) will provide an important forum for discussion and dissemination of
relevant information to young scientists and researchers.
