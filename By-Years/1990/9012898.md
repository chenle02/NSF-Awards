This award will enable the investigator to complete the final chapters of a book
in progress, "Engineering Birth: Science, Technology and the 'Perfect Child'".
The central thesis is that the new reproductive technologies interact with
values and beliefs about human perfectibility, to set norms for the "perfect
child." Thus these developments recall, transformed, an old ideology. Parts I
and II of the book set the historic and conceptual framework and explore the
interaction of the ideology of human perfectibility and the new reproductive
technologies today. Part III is the current project and poses the following
question: Why, even while invoking the possibility of creating new or improved
human beings, does much of the bioethics and feminist literature fail to discuss
how standards are being set, the criteria themselves, and what the meaning might
be for the future direction and use of such reproductive research? The current
research examines the bioethics and feminist critiques, situating them in their
milieus outside the medical arena, and compares them with values, norms and
standards being set in medical contexts. The chapters in Part III will show how
the different cultures in which the critiques are embedded inhibit analysis of
the ways technology and values interact to shape standards of human
perfectibility and the "perfect child." These differences inhibit dialogue as
well as attempts to influence or change the direction of research. Some of the
feminist literature, however, provides ways to bridge these divides. Drawing on
an experiential methodology that links theory and practice, this work suggests
integrative models for evaluating procreative norms, and thus a means to link
ethics, research and practice. The project calls attention to the positive role
feminist perspectives can play in integrating ethical perspectives and in
setting frameworks for meaningful dialogue between persons making ethical
judgments and those involved in scientific and technological research. The book
manuscript that will result is scheduled for publication in a new series on the
philosophy of technology at a university press. This research has an important
and timely focus; its results will be useful and accessible to a wide audience.
The qualifications and track record of the investigator are excellent;
institutional support is very good; the research plan is sensible; the budget is
very modest. Support is highly recommended.
