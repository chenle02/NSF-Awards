This supports the work of Professor Fedor Bogomolov to work on the geometry of
algebraic varieties and related problems in birational geometry. He proposes to
work on constructing minimal dominant classes of algebraic varieties, asymptotic
formulas for cohomology of lines bundles and a counter-example to Lang's
conjecture in higher dimensions. He also wants to work on the Sylow subgroups of
Galois Groups of certain function fields. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry, yet it directly connects to one of the greatest advances
made in the solution of equations--Galois theory. Algebraic geometry itself is
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
