9728398 Maul The nucleus is a highly compartmentalized structure in which there
is selective trafficking of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope, as
well as targetting of these macromolecules to specific sites within the nucleus.
Although there does not seem to be a need for trafficking of DNA, which in the
case of the cell's DNA is a permanent resident of the nucleus, there now is
evidence that the DNA of at least some viruses is targeted to specific domains
within the nucleus. The significance of this is not understood. It is reasonably
assumed, however, that the targeting is important in viral transcription and
replication. These studies will examine in detail the function of nuclear
targeting of viral DNA to specific domains, termed ND10, that have been
identified in preliminary studies. The long term goal is to define the molecular
basis of this DNA targeting and its general significance for nuclear structure,
gene targeting, and viral infection. ***
