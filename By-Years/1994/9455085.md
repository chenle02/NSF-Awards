This project, available in 1995, 1996, and 1997, offers a three- week workshop
that gives 20 persons each year hands-on experience aimed at mastery of use of
modern nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. It is now widely
accepted that these two techniques are so powerful and central to chemistry that
virtually all institutions that instruct undergraduates in chemistry have
acquired this instrumentation or are planning to do so. Since the techniques are
strongly complementary, they are taught in tandem in this workshop, although
attendees can emphasize one or the other if they wish. Participants will attend
lectures, work in groups, conduct experiments, and devise exercises. Eminent
scientists and major vendors of the instrumentation will visit the course and
discuss with participants academic and industrial uses of the techniques.
Participants will develop instructional modules for use at their home
institutions, and will share them with each other at the course and via E-mail.
The experience will be reinforced and continued through participation in the
activities of research groups and by donation of post-workshop instrument time
at the host institution.
