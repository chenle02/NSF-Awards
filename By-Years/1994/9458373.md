9458373 Pyrak-Nolte This research project will attempt to quantitatively
establish the links among the mechanical, hydraulic, and seismic properties of
rock discontinuities. All rocks contain mechanical discontinuities on many
length scales. These discontinuities, such as cracks, fractures, or joints, are
sources of anisotropy and inhomogeneity. They influence and control the many
forms of rock behavior. Bridging between newly developed departments of Civil
Engineering and Geological Sciences at Notre Dame will be provided by this P.I.
A new line of undergraduate courses, previously nonexistent here, will be
developed to integrate the concepts of geoscience with civil engineering.
