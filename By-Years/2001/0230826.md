The purpose of this project is to create a high performance Open Network
Laboratory (ONL) for use by the networking research community, to enable
experimental evaluation of advanced networking concepts in a realistic working
environment. The laboratory will be built around a set of open-source,
extensible, high performance routers that have been developed at Washington
University, and which will be made available to remote users through a Remote
Laboratory Interface (RLI) to be developed through this program. The interface
will allow users to easily configure and run experiments, using a combination of
web forms and a graphical user interface. It will also allow users to extend,
modify or replace the software running in the routers' embedded processors and
to similarly extend, modify or replace the routers' hardware, which is
implemented largely using Field Programmable Gate Arrays, which can be
dynamically reconfigured to support new capabilities.
