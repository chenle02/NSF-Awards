This project seeks to develop controller design procedures for repetitive
control systems that relate controller design to specified levels of performance
of the system. Procedures will be developed for the simplified case of
repetitive controllers with large time delay values as well as the more general
case where the time delay values are not large. The controller design procedure
will be based on H infinity control theory and robust performance will be
sought. Available theory for H infinity control of distributed parameter systems
will be modified and applied to repetitive control systems. Currently available
repetitive controllers will also be viewed in an H infinity framework so that
the relationship of weights used in the H infinity problem and the resulting
controller is better understood. It is expected that the H infinity repetitive
controllers designed using this approach will perform at least as well as
currently available repetitive controllers. Usefulness of the controller design
procedures developed here and of the controllers themselves will be established
by application to closed loop servohydraulic testing. The use of servohydraulic
actuators raises considerations of actuator-related nonlinearities which are
specific to this application. These nonlinear effects will be characterized as
model error, in terns compatible with the H infinity controller design
procedure. Furthermore, the stability of repetitive control systems with these
nonlinear effects will be evaluated by appropriate stability analysis
techniques.*** //
