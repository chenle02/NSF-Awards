This project will introduce Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT- IR)
into undergraduate laboratory instruction and undergraduate research projects at
SUNY-College at Oneonta. The laboratory experience with FT- IR in instrumental
analysis laboratories will complement the lecture material on Fourier transform
techniques. These powerful techniques are used increasingly in industrial and
other research laboratories to solve difficult problems in chemistry. Thus
chemistry education at the college will be upgraded substantially, and chemistry
graduates will be better prepared to enter the scientific workforce or to begin
graduate studies.
