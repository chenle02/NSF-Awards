PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION

IIP 1156098 Missouri University of Science and Technology Madria

Missouri University of Science and Technology (MUST) is planning to join the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)entitled "Center for Net
Centric Software and Systems" which currently is a multi- university center
comprised of the University of North Texas (lead institution), the University of
Texas at Dallas, and Arizona State University.

MUST requests funding for becoming a site of the Center for Net Centric Software
and Systems, under the leadership of Professor Sanjay Madria. The funds from
this planning grant will be used primarily to organize an industry-university
meeting that will help market the proposed site to industry. The proposed site
will bring capabilities in situational-aware collaborative computing to the
center. Initial research projects at the planning meeting will be in areas such
as sensor data fusion, secure and trusted data aggregation, software code
optimization and cloud computing. The research group at MUST will, therefore,
bring several complementary research capabilities to the current Net Centric
research thrusts.

Research findings at the proposed site will enhance knowledge of scientific
community and industrial members in the area of Net-centric computing and
wireless technologies. Utilizing existing programs and facilities, MUST will
support and extend its efforts and seek to integrate new paradigms developed in
its educational curriculum. Plans are also detailed for outreach to recruit
students from underrepresented groups.
