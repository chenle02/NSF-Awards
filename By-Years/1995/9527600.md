9527749 Bultman The presence of an endophytic fungus is often associated with
enhanced survival and reproduction of the host grass. Because insect herbivores
often cause less damage to grasses infected by the fungi compared to grasses
lacking the fungal associates, the grass-fungus association has been described
as a defensive mutualism. A hypothesized mechanism for this defense may be
fungal-produced alkaloids that can be toxic to insects. The proposed study
specifically tests if the advantage of endophyte infection to grasses is due to
enhanced resistance to insects following plant damage. Laboratory experiments
manipulating nutrient levels, plant damage, and fungal infection will be
conducted using Chewings, hard, and tall fescues and perennial ryegrass. Plant
tissue will be fed to fall and true armyworm larvae and their growth and
survival monitored to assess the presence and magnitude of base level and wound-
induced resistance in fungal-infected and fungal-free plants. The level of plant
protein nitrogen and alkaloids will also be monitored to help interpret
differences in insect performance among experimental treatments. Biomass gain
and consumption of the two insect herbivores will be assessed to further
evaluate mechanisms responsible for treatment effects on insect performance. The
economic significance of fungal endophytes of grasses is well documented. The
fungi, and the toxins they produce, have detrimental effects on livestock that
translate to annual revenue losses of over $600 million in the US. The proposed
research, by providing information on the basic ecology of grass endophytes,
should assist efforts to manage them in agricultural settings.
