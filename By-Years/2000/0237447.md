A grant has been awarded to the University of Arizona under the direction of
Peter Reinthal to collect, compile and repatriate data and digital photographs
of biological specimens originating from Mexico for an international database
project. The Zoological Collections at the University of Arizona have one of the
largest holdings of biological vertebrate specimens (fish, amphibians and
reptiles, birds and mammals) from Mexico of any institution in the world. These
specimens represent important scientific information for researchers who are
attempting to understand, study, map and conserve biodiversity. These specimens
also were collected over many decades and can not be replicated or replaced.
Support for this project will enable us to digitally photograph specimens and
incorporate the photographs and data from each specimen in a collaborative
effort with CONABIO, an international biodiversity database project based in
Mexico City, and the University of Arizona collection database. Such efforts
will make this important scientific information available to the scientific
community and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, specimens from
all four vertebrate collections will be digitally photographed and the
photographs will be incorporated into our BIOTA database currently used at the
University of Arizona. All&lt;br/&gt;photographs and data regarding these will
be electronically incorporated into a biodiversity database project currently
underway at CONABIO. The University of Arizona will become established as a
CONABIO node institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information generated by this
project will fill an important gap in our understanding of biodiversity in North
America. This project will make information and photographs of these important
specimens&lt;br/&gt;available for scientists, educational institutions,
government and non-government scientists and managers and the general public.
Importantly, Mexican scientists and researchers will now have research access to
these significant Mexican specimens through their national biodiversity
database.&lt;br/&gt;
