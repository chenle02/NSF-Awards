This award will support the participation of 10 undergraduate students each
year in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by the
Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior (CISAB) at Indiana
University, Bloomington. The program is ten weeks in length and focuses on
recruiting undergraduate students from groups currently underrepresented in the
sciences. This program is a new REU site that will build on the formal
undergraduate internship program offered by CISAB for the past two years and on
CISAB's collective experience with undergraduate training. Students will conduct
research projects and present their findings at a concluding symposium. They
will also attend (1) a team-taught course introducing research issues and
techniques in the areas represented by CISAB faculty, (2) classes on mentoring
and career issues taught via the Committee on Institutional Cooperation's
campus-wide Summer Research Opportunities Program, and (3) seminars on ethics
and conduct in science taught in conjunction with the Poynter Center for the
Study of Ethics &amp; American Institutions. The program will give students
intensive research experience and will introduce them to science as a
profession, to interdisciplinary modes of thinking, and to specific research
techniques used in the study of animal behavior. This award will foster the
continued education and training of individuals who will be part of the next
generation of basic researchers in the diverse aspects of animal behavior.
