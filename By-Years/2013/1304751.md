This project supports hosting the three day sixteenth edition of the GENI
Engineering conference, including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be
held on the University of Utah campus. The Global Environment for Network
Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype
form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in
networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large
socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale'
experiments in future internets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GENI Project Office
organizes three major GENI Engineering conferences (GECs) per year, in which the
entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on
subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working
groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live
experiments. About 250 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US
institutions will gather in Salt Lake City to showcase their ideas and results.
In the demo session each demo will be provided with a wired connection to the
GENI infrastructure. Additionally, wireless connectivity will be available for
demonstrations and participants. The GEC 16 conference will be held on the
University of Utah campus, with organizational oversight by an experienced
University of Utah event coordinator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
&lt;br/&gt;The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both
an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior
to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students
understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other
institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new
community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already
being used as an instrument for research. This project supports the development
and use of the research instrument.
