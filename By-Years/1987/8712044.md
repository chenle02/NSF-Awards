Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a key technique for the
study of molecules that contain an unpaired electron. EPR measurements on
inorganic, organometallic and organic materials under photochemical,
electrochemical and thermal stimulation lead to an understanding of chemical
structure that is unattainable by any other technique. The acquisition of EPR
instrumentation enhances the ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.
The Department of Chemistry of the University of Oregon will use an award from
the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help purchase a state-of the-art
EPR spectrometer. The areas of study in chemistry that will be enhanced include:
1) Radical clocks, a new type of radical probe 2) Novel stable nitroxide free
radicals for applications as spin labels for biophysical studies 3) EPR of
cyclic dihydropyrene aromatics 4) New inorganic multicomponent oxides via sol-
gel synthetic routes 5) EPR as a probe of surface defects 6) 19-electron
complexes A unique feature of the proposal is the way the EPR facility is
managed, providing access to the entire science community within the University
including Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Geology Departments.
