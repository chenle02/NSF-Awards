This research is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of mathematical
models for networks of concurrent processes, and the relationships between such
models. Of particular interest is the relationship between "CCS/CSP-style"
models and "dataflow-style" models. The primary tool to be used in this
investigation is a collection of mathematical structures called concurrent
transition systems. Concurrent transition systems, are a generalization of
ordinary nondeterministic transition systems into which concurrency information
has been incorporated in a convenient fashion. The basic approach consists of
three steps: (1) use concurrent transition systems to define a general
operational model of concurrent processes, called labeled processes, in which
network-building operations on processes have simple algebraic definitions; (2)
define various ways of mapping the labeled process model to more abstract
models; and (3) investigate how the network-building operations translate under
these abstraction mappings. Preliminary work has resulted in a simple
characterization of a subclass of labeled processes, called Kahn processes,
which are "dataflow-like" processes with timing-independent, functional
behavior. From this characterization, a simple and direct proof is obtained, of
the fact that network interconnection of Kahn processes obeys Kahn's fixed point
principle.
