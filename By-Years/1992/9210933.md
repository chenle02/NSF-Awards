This research project addresses a central issue in the cell biology of vision
and photoreception: the mechanisms and significance of turnover of light-
sensitive membrane and its constituent light-sensitive molecule (rhodopsin). The
assembly of light-sensitive membranes in light receptors are being studied in
the normal and also in the vitamin-A deprived condition. Intracellular membranes
that serve as the precursors of photosensitive membranes accumulate as large
masses within vitamin-A deficient photoreceptors. When such cells are exposed to
very bright light that compensates for their relative insensitivity, the
internal membrane is rapidly added to the light-sensitive membrane. This
laboratory also is testing an hypothesis concerning the relationship between the
biochemical pathway that is involved in the response to light and the regulation
of assembly and degradation of the light-sensitive membrane in photoreceptors.
Techniques being used include pharmacological agents that specifically mimic
various steps in the biochemical pathway. The structural effects of these agents
on photoreceptor cells will be studied with electron microscopy. Functional
effects will be assessed with electrophysiological methods. The pathway by which
vitamin A derivatives enter and are utilized by the retina to provide the light-
sensitive molecules for photoreception is also being investigated.
