Bousfield will continue his research in homotopy theory and will focus
particularly on the newly emerging theory of vn-periodic localizations of
spaces. He will explore unstable versions of periodicity results and will work
to analyze homotopy types by resolving them into vn-periodic parts for positive
integers n. Bousfield is establishing strong links between the v1-periodic
localization and the K-theoretic localization of spaces, and this is leading to
solutions of old problems concerning the K-theory of iterated loop spaces. He
will continue his work, using homotopical and K-theoretic techniques. For
instance, he will work on the development of a K-theoretic unstable Adams
spectral sequence. Bousfield will also work to extend his algebraic
classification of K-local spectra to cover mapping classes and will continue
other related research. The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned
with reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to
perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the calculations. The nature of the
geometric information involved is the crux of the difficulty. While questions
about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to be
reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known as topological
properties of geometric objects. These are properties such as connectedness
(being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so forth. All
systematic study of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two
geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are
only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of differences that
can occur, all these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they
have been reduced to matters of calculation, and two of the principal tools for
this are homotopy theory and K-theory.
