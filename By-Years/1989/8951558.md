Upper-division instruction in molecular biology and biochemistry will be
enhanced by the purchase of a new liquid scintillation counter, a computer to
support this counter and for general laboratory computing, and units for gel
electrophoresis of proteins and DNA. The college's curriculum is
interdisciplinary; instruction in this field centers on an upper-division
program integrating molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology, and an
advanced research program involving work mostly with bacteria and bacteriophage
T4. The new equipment will allow many students to do work with radioisotopes and
two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This will greatly strengthen
a program that has been very successful in preparing students for more advanced
studies. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
