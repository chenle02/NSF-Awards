Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier
forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and electronic
privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.
The students, supported by this travel award, are provided a unique opportunity
to participate in this symposium and a forum in which to meet and interact with
the leading international researchers in cyber security. This research
experience will encourage these promising graduate students to pursue careers in
cyber security.
