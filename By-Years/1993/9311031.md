9311031 Durrani The main objective of this equipment grant is the acquisition of
a shaking table facility by the Civil Engineering Department of Rice University.
The shaking table facility is needed to test up to one-fifth scale structural
models under dynamic base excitation. The shaking table will be 5 ft x 5 ft in
size with a test load capacity of 1,500 pounds. The highest frequency targeted
for the table is 40 Hz. Rice has cost-shared approximately half of the total
requested amount for this experimental equipment and will continue to maintain
and upgrade the system in the future. The availability of a shaking table will
enable experimental verification of several ongoing and future research projects
related to seismic response of structures. The installation of a shaking table
in the structures laboratory will complement the existing research focus on
analytical research and will provide the foundation for a wide range of future
projects in experimental structural dynamics. ***
