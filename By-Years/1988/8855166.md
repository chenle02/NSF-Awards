This program will offer 24 high school juniors and seniors a research oriented,
three week summer program using as its central theme, Our Nutritional
Environment. Students will select non-commercial plants and invertebrate animals
from the local area and determine the role of these organisms in their community
and their nutritional value. The sociological and philosophical implications of
science in general and this type of research in particular will be presented as
a continuous and interwoven component. Completion of this program will provide
the participants with a complete research experience, starting with the
development of a research proposal and continuing through collection of data,
forming conclusions, and preparing research results for a scientific audience.
The final product is presentation or publication of a paper. The research
project will be undertaken and completed i the context of ethical and social
awareness. Providing the participants with cognizance of their potential as
scientists and the many careers available to scientists will be an additional
outcome.
