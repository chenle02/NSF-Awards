In planning for ocean science beyond the next decade, the Joint Subcommittee on
Ocean Science and Technology (JSOST) is evaluating the current status and future
needs of the nation's research infrastructure. Given current struggles to
maintain, operate, and upgrade major infrastructure elements while maintaining a
robust research portfolio, a strategic plan is needed for future investments to
ensure that new facilities provide the greatest value, least redundancy, and
highest efficiency in terms of operation and flexibility to incorporate new
technological advances. Infrastructure represents a major investment that
requires thorough review and consideration to support the development of the
most critical technologies. The ability of the U.S. to conduct ocean research in
the future will depend on an insightful analysis of the major upcoming
scientific and policy questions and assessment of the technology and facilities
required to answer those questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Research
Council will assemble an expert committee to provide advice and a perspective
from the worldwide ocean community on the types of U.S. ocean infrastructure
that will facilitate research in 2030, including advice as to what criteria may
be most appropriate for setting priorities. The committee will identify major
research questions anticipated to be at the forefront of ocean science in 2030
based on national and international assessments, input from the worldwide
scientific community, and ongoing research planning activities. Next, the
committee will define categories of infrastructure that should be included in
planning for the nation's ocean research infrastructure of 2030 and that will be
required to answer the major research questions of the future. In addition, the
committee will recommend ways in which the federal agencies can maximize the
value of investments in ocean infrastructure.
