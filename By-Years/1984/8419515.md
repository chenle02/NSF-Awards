An experimental study of dynamical instabilities in laminar premixed flames is
conducted. The results are to be compared with recent predictions of theoretical
combustion science and nonlinear dynamics. Most of the research is to be
conducted on low-pressure, hydrocarbon-air flames on a porous plug burner. Prior
experimental studies of low-pressure, burner-stabilized hydrocarbon flames have
identified four nonsteady modes of propagation: an axial made in which the flame
front moves perpendicular to the burner; a radial mode in which the flame front
periodically changes its spatial extent on the burner; a spiral mode in which
the flame front assumes a nonplanar shape, such as a saddle. Even the most
complicated motion of the flame front is described by only a few modes. The
observations are similar to predictions for flames freely propagating in
channels. This experimental study is to determine the spatial and temporal
characteristics of these modes as a function of the external parameters. In
addition, several studies are to be conducted which examine combustion phenomena
from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and the theory of chaotic systems.
