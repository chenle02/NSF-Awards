9500691 Ruan This project is to support American scientist and graduate student
participation in a June workshop titled "Quantum Groups and their Connection
with Quantized Functional Analysis". The workshop will be held at the Fields
Institute currently located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The workshop will be
an important opportunity for US scientists and graduate students to interact
with world leaders in the area of Operator Algebras. Priority for these funds
will be given to mathematicians from underrepresented groups, junior
investigators and graduate students. ***
