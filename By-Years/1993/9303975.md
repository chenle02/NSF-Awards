The principal goal of this research project is to determine by experiment the
equilibrium partitioning of 18-O and 16-O between oxygen-bearing vapor and
silicate glasses, melts, and crystals at low pressures over a wide range of
temperature and silicate composition. Of particular interest are the equilibrium
fractionation factors between silicates and CO2 gas at pressures to 2000 bars,
the equilibrium fractionation factors and apparent self diffusion coefficients
for exchange between CO2 gas and felsic glasses and melts, and the fractionation
factors between CO2 gas and minerals. The results of the research will be
applicable to interpreting the oxygen isotopic compositions of cogenetic igneous
rocks in terms of petrogenetic processes and to developing a more complete
understanding of the compositional and structural factors influencing the
partitioning of oxygen isotopes in geological materials.
