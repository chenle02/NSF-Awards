A current challenge for genetics and genomics research is discovering DNA
sequences that alter the expression of genes operating during development and
various physiological processes. This project will develop the statistical
method of structural equation modeling to mine genome-wide DNA sequence and gene
expression data to identify these connections. The research relies on methods
developed in the area of computational Bayesian statistics to overcome
computational difficulties posed by the scale and complexity of genomic data,
which make extracting relevant biological information difficult.

This research will develop software for analyzing genomic data that will be used
by researchers in the fields of medical, agricultural, and conservation genetics
to discover important biological network relationships between DNA sequences and
the expression of genes. The software will be used as a starting point for
investigating why and how DNA sequences produce differences among individuals in
both appearance and susceptibility to genetic diseases. The underlying
statistical methods of the software will result in faster and more efficient
computational network analysis for data collected at the scale of the entire
genome.
