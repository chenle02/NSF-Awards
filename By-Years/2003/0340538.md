&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract EF-0340538&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
grant has been awarded to Dr. Mary B. Saffo of the Marine Biological Laboratory
to use morphological (using transmission electron microscopy) and molecular
(primarily ssu rDNA) data to describe and determine the phylogenetic position of
an enigmatic protist (Nephromyces). Nephromyces was originally described as a
chytrid fungus based on light-microscope morphology of some cell types but
preliminary data indicates that it may need to be transferred to the Alveolata.
The Alveolata is one of the major branches of the protist portion of the Tree of
Life. It is a large assemblage including the phyla Ciliophora, Dinoflagellata,
and the Apicomplexa but also including many small enigmatic symbionts (often
parasites) such as Perkinsus, Haplosporidea, Colpodella and possibly
Nephromyces. Phylogenetic relationships among the members of the Alveolata are
confusing and it is possible that a better understanding of enigmatic taxa such
as Nephromyces may hold the clue to their relationships. Furthermore, the
phylogenetic position of the protist will allow Dr. Saffo to begin to address
questions about how its symbiosis with its tunicate host and its own bacterial
symbionts originated, and how have these three species
coevolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
