CTS - 9622204 T. Mountziaris SUNY Buffalo ABSTRACT The project involves the
purchase of a high-performance computer (server) to extend and upgrade the
capacities of an existing workstation cluster. The computer will serve the
computational needs of the research groups of five professors. Research projects
that will benefit cover various topics including thin film technology, design of
configurationally tailored media for application in catalysis and separations,
reaction and transport in evolving biphasic media, molecular simulation to
predict thermophysical properties, and inverse problems involving complex
dynamical systems. The server will also be useful for interacting with the
national supercomputing centers. It will encourage graduate education by
allowing the integration of advanced computational techniques, molecular
simulation and interactive visualization into the graduate curriculum.
