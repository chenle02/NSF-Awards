The aim of this project is to study the mathematical structures of various
differential equations, concentrating on models that may develop moving
interfaces. These problems are used to model a number of different phenomena in
Physics, Mathematical Finance, Image processing, and Biology. The main
mathematical challenge in such problems is to understand the smoothness or
regularity of the interfaces. The models combine the difficulty of analyzing the
differential equation with the difficulty in locating the moving interface.

The nonlocal equations to be investigated in this research project arise
naturally in probability, in the study of stochastic processes with jumps. More
precisely, free boundary problems involving nonlocal equations appear when
considering optimal stopping problems, which are used in the pricing of American
options in finance. When the underlying stochastic process is Brownian motion
(with continuous paths), the regularity theory for solutions and free boundaries
is well understood. However, when considering jump-processes the equations
become nonlocal, and the structure of the model is more complicated. One of the
main goals of the project is to provide a full understanding of such models,
establishing regularity results for solutions and free boundaries in this type
of problems.
