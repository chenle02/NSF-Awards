The Department of Applied Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology
will purchase a customized Linux cluster which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular:

1. Further Development of the W-Curve as a Visualization and analytic Tool for
the study of Long Genomic sequences, by Douglas J. Cork and F.R. McMorris;

2. Numerical simulation of stochastic Partial Differential Equations in Fluid
Dynamics, by Jinqiao Duan;

3. Parallel algorithms for Meshless Methods, by Gregory Fasshauer;

4. Numerical Investigations of Interfacial Dynamics in Fluid Dynamics, by
Xiaofan Li.
