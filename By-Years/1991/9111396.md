The proposed work is to conduct and analyze two specific experiments using the
newly assembled Collisionless Terrella Experiment (CTX). The results from these
experiments will significantly expand our understanding of collisionless
particle transport in planetary magnetospheres. They will be used to test basic
theories of chaos and transport induced by dynamic and static non-axisymmetric
perturbations to a dipole magnetic field. For the first experiment, energetic
electrons trapped within the dipole magnetic field will be generated by
operating our microwave plasma source so as to directly heat the high-field
regions of the dipole. As seen elsewhere, these electrons will become unstable
to a spectrum of low-frequency interchange instabilities and induce
collisionless radial transport. We will measure the amplitude, frequency, and
wavelength of the fluctuations, the condition for the onset of chaos, and the
magnitude of the resulting transport. We will also be able to observe
marginally-stable pressure profiles and test theories of adiabatic transport.
For the second experiment, we will impose a multipolar static perturbation to
the energetic electron plasma breaking azimuthal symmetry and destroying
conservation of angular momentum. By measuring the decrease in the confinement
of the trapped electrons as the magnitude of the perturbation is increased, we
will be able to document the conditions leading to three-dimensional chaos.
These experiments will be guided and interpreted by numerical and theoretical
analysis. By making correlations between laboratory and numerical simulations,
we will demonstrate how magnetic fluctuations can induce transport and heating
of energetic particles in dipole fields and establish models for similar
processes occurring in planetary magnetospheres.
