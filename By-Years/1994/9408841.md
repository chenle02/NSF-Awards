9408841 Boyer This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
physical modeling of ocean currents between Don L. Boyer, Arizona State
University and Peter A. Davies of the University of Dundee. The objective of
their research is to develop physical models of the interaction of tidal
currents and other unsteady background flows with bathymetry in the vicinity of
continental shelf breaks. They will investigate phenomenon such as fronts and
their instabilities, mean along and cross-isobath volume transports, hydraulic
jumps and internal waves. The collaboration with the University of Dundee allows
the investigators to apply this modeling approach to specific oceanic regions.
The U.K. investigator's research is part of a large European Community Marine
Science and Technology (MAST) program that includes similar studies along the
Iberian and North West European continental shelves. This collaboration takes
advantage of extensive field measurements and modeling efforts of MAST. Their
research will provide integrated data sets on specific sites, including the
Portuguese section of the Iberian shelf and the Hebridean shelf edge, and should
accelerate the modeling efforts of both groups. The results will further our
understanding of physical aspects of ocean currents. ***
