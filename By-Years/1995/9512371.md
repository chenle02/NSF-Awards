The San Francisco State University (SFSU) Department of Physics and Astronomy
will acquire a versatile dilution refrigerator system dedicated to the testing
of low temperature elementary particle detectors fabricated by physics Master's
students at SFSU and by collaborating researchers and Ph.D. students at nearby
institutions including Stanford University (SU), Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL), and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). These
novel detectors will achieve unparalled sensitivity and resolution by sensing
quasiparticles, phonons, and electron-hole pairs generated by collisions of
incident particles with nuclei and electrons in superconducting and insulating
crystals. The initial goals of the research effort are to develop detectors for
dark matter searches, neutrino experiments, and X-ray astronomy measurements. As
the technology matures, additional applications are likely to include
measurements of ultralow alpha radioactivity in bulk materials, Xray
fluorescence for trace elements.
