Professor Bruce Ault is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to investigate intermediates of chemical reactions which have been
trapped in a matrix of solid Argon. Some of these studies may further our
understanding of the chemical vapor deposition process used for making
semiconductor devices. Ault will exploit the unique capabilities of matrix
isolation to study several classes of reactive intermediates. A significant
portion of the effort will be directed toward the development of excimer laser
multiphoton ionization as a photochemical means of generating reactive
intermediates, including radical fragments, novel rearrangement products, and
ions. Two important classes of molecular complexes will also be characterized
after formation through twin jet deposition. The first class consists of
complexes between crown ethers and certain cations and neutral acids. The second
class consists of intermediate complexes of group III and V elements which are
thought to play a major role in the chemical vapor deposition of semiconductor
films. Spectroscopic characterization of these complexes will lead to a better
understanding of molecular interactions and the role of intermediate complexes
in chemical processes.
