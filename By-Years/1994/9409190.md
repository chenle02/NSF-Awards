9409190 Smith ABSTRACT (PRIDE) Partnership for Retraining and Innovations in
Delivering Education Drexel University, in partnership with Camden County
College, Delaware County Community College, and the Community College of
Philadelphia will create a "Ship Yard" community college to retrain displaced
defense industry personnel at the Philadelphia Naval Ship Yard (PNSY) and the
Philadelphia Naval Station. A full spectrum of educational opportunities, from
GED and certificate courses through continuing professional education and B.S.
and M.S. degree programs, will be offered to an estimated target population of
over 5,000 workers. Workers will be trained for careers in manufacturing in one
of a number of areas identified as important to the Greater Philadelphia Area:
e.g., biotechnology, environmental controls and remediation, and
telecommunication. Industry involvement will include participation on an
advisory board, curriculum development, and adjunct teaching. Resources at the
PNSY, including manufacturing equipment and facilities and the Career Transition
Center, will be available to this program. ***
