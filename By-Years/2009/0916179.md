Award Abstract:

Peer-to-peer systems have seen continued growth, in terms of traffic volume, and
as the architecture of choice to build new applications and network services ?
notable benefits lie in their distributed design leading to higher reliability
and flexibility. However as users/peers increasingly become content providers,
and generally conduct more of their business on the network, privacy is a
critical concern.

By leveraging peers? trust relationships through referral mechanisms based on
underlying reputation systems, applications that deliver a new standard of
privacy are being devised. Peer-to-peer systems that dynamically adapt, in a
distributed and scalable manner, based on the outcomes of peer transactions, are
being modeled and analyzed. The focus is on unstructured networks where peer-
membership correlations among communities of interest can be learned to improve
the search performance of reputation-biased random walks and limited-scope
flooding. Content-sharing applications are being designed based that leverage
this framework to incentivize cooperative behavior while enabling collaborative
filtering and content pushing.

Expected results include the development analysis and testing of a new framework
for privacy-preserving search for large-scale, unstructured, on-line, peer-to-
peer networks. Complementary incentive mechanisms resulting in improve file
sharing and promoting honest referrals will be devised. The results will be
disseminated through peer-reviewed venues and, where possible, industry
concerns, while data and simulation tools are made available on the web.

The efforts impact will lie in contributing new ways to improve privacy and
promote more honest and efficient cooperation in large-scale on-line peer-to-
peer systems, for content sharing, as well as a broader set of social networking
applications.
