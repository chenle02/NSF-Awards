This project incorporates a 200Mhz FT-NMR into the undergraduate curriculum at
Ithaca College. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has become one of the
most powerful methods to study molecular structure and certain chemical dynamic
processes. Ithaca biology and chemistry majors uses spectra obtained from the
FT-NMR in the organic chemistry course. Advanced laboratory courses and an
upperclass course on nuclear magnetic resonance are improved by the availability
of this instrument. An active academic year and summer undergraduate research
participation program insures constant use of the FT- NMR. The institution is
providing an overmatch of 150% of the NSF funds.
