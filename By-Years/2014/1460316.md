Providing seamless, high quality wireless service anytime and anywhere requires
substantial structural changes in today's macro-cellular networks. One such
change, introducing small cell base stations, is seen as a highly promising
solution. However, it requires meeting fundamental challenges: 1) nodes? self-
organization, 2) network heterogeneity, and 3) high sensitivity of resource
allocation to the system parameters. The proposed research addresses these
challenges by exploring a dimension that has often been overlooked: the user's
context. To achieve this goal, first, machine learning techniques are proposed
to extract context from three dimensions: device, geo-location, and social
metrics. Then, context-aware resource management schemes are developed by
advancing novel techniques from matching theory - a powerful tool from economics
and game theory. Subsequently, the learned context is leveraged to devise
cooperative small cell models using new tools from coalitional game theory.
Comprehensive evaluation is done via testbed implementation and software
simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed analytical tools
will lay the foundations of context-aware, self-organizing small cell networks
and will impact multiple disciplines such as communications, game theory, and
social sciences. The generated results will provide fresh ideas for developing
new small cell products. The research is fully integrated into the educational
plan via incorporation in new and existing courses as well as training students
via mentoring, participation in testbed development, and internships at
industrial labs. A developed small cell educational tool will foster this
integration via new hands-on activities and demonstrations to the community.
Specialized outreach activities will contribute to increasing the participation
of minority high school students in science and engineering.
