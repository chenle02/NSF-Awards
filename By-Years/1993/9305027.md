9305027 Storer This project is a study of high performance adaptive lossy
compression techniques. That is, techniques that are able to achieve the best
possible compression in a single pass over the data (with no prior knowledge of
the data) and which can be implemented to run in real time at high data rates.
Thus, the research employs a combination of data compression theory,
experimental results, algorithms (serial and parallel) design, and to some
extent, hardware design. A new approach to image compression has been developed
that combines some of the most successful techniques for dynamic lossless
compression and some of the most successful techniques for static lossy
compression to achieve a fully adaptive single-pass lossy compression algorithm
that needs only the fidelity criterion to be specified in advance. This new
algorithm is capable of achieving "state of the art" image compression; in fact,
in practice for a given fidelity it typically equals or exceeds the amount of
compression achieved by the best methods previously available. A number of new
directions of research are identified that include extensions of this approach,
applications of a similar approach to video compression (where, arbitrarily
shaped "superblocks" of pixels are tracked from frame to frame), the design of
parallel lossless compression algorithms (that can be used as components in a
complete data compression system), the design of parallel data compression
hardware, and new techniques to suppress error propagation with adaptive
algorithms. The theme of this research is flexible adaptive techniques that can
be used for data compression applications ranging from lossless text
compression, to lossy image compression, to compression of digitized high
resolution video. All of the techniques considered have efficient parallel
implementations and ultimately, inexpensive custom hardware implementations. ***
