This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, will entail
spectroscopic studies of small metal and semiconductor molecules, and reactivity
studies of metal clusters as functions of size and composition. These studies
will contribute towards the development of a unified theory of
metal/semiconductor electronic structure which can account for the variation in
physical and chemical properties with size. Clusters will be prepared by laser
vaporization of a target material in the throat of a pulsed supersonic nozzle,
and will be detected in a vacuum chamber by photoionization time-of-flight
spectrometry. Measurements of the depletion of bare metal clusters and growth of
products then provide chemical reactivity rates for metal clusters as functions
of size and composition. Two-photon ionization, laser induced fluorescence, and
stimulated emission spectroscopies will be employed to measure bond lenghts,
vibrational frequencies, and term symbols of various metal and semiconductor
dimers and trimers.
