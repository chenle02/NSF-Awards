9361050 Spielberg This project is to design and test an interactive environment
that will enable the appropriate applications expert to set up a solution
scheme, provide the data, and monitor the execution for a given class of
problems. In order to deal with the high intrinsic combinatorial complexity of
the problems, solution schemes will be designed for execution on parallel
computing systems. This will involve trade-offs between algorithmic and computer
related considerations so that the application code is adapted to all
exigencies. Parallel computing will also be essential for a truly interactive
system so that response times are acceptable during the testing of moderately
large problems. Significant enhancements have resulted from related
technologies. The successful development of this project will give additional
impetus to such trends. ***
