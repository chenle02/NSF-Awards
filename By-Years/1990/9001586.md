In this study, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is used in conjunction with
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the surfaces of platinum single
crystals and model graphite- supported platinum catalysts following a variety of
treatments, including use of the samples as catalysts for cyclohexene
aromatization. Several crystal planes are studied, including some with low and
some with high Miller indices. Single-crystal studies are compared with model
catalyst studies to ascertain which features of the STM scans are relevant to
catalytic performance. This is essentially a baseline study to establish
reliability guidelines for application of STM in catalysis research. In
principle, this relatively new technique has great potential to reveal surface
features in reacting systems heretofore impossible to detect.
