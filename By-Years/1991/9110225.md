This project aims to explain why some lifesaving interventions are implemented
in the United States while others are not. Findings should prove useful to
decision makers who are responsibe for promoting the implementation of
lifesaving interventions. The proposal calls for (1) Identifying 300 lifesaving
interventions in the fields of medicine, consumer product safety, transportation
safety, environmental protection, and occupational safety and health that have
been analyzed for cost-effectiveness. (2) Collecting data on the extent to which
these interventions are currently implemented in the United States, the primary
dependent variable under study. (3) Collecting data on economic, psychological
and political variables that theory suggests may explain the extent of
implementation. (4) Incorporating this information into a computerized database
to be managed at the Harvard Center for RIsk Analysis, (5) Estimating an
explanatory model using a variety of statistical methods. (6) Publishing two
papers, one describing the HCRA database and one reporting the results of the
explanatory model. ***//
