This project implements a new model of education intended to transform the way
geographic techniques are taught to majors and non-majors in the Department of
Geography at the University of Texas. Recent technological advances have
intensified divergence between specialized training in geographical techniques
and systematic training in geography's subdisciplines. This project will enable
the power of advances in computer-assisted cartography, geographic information
systems, remote sensing, and spatial statistics to be applied across the
discipline. Its method stresses the commonality of content and method in the
practice of modern geography.
