Mathematics of America Association (MAA) is developing a new publication called
MATH HORIZONS (MH), a quarterly magazine for students enrolled in undergraduate
mathematics courses and advanced high school students. Students would be
significantly involved in the publication, which would have articles on a
variety of mathematics topics, include problem sections, and provide career
information.
