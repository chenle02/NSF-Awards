The investigators will study improved computational algorithms for model
reduction of complex fluid flows. This research will have two main thrusts, new
closure models and a parametric modeling framework. The investigators will
investigate closure for models that are based on the proper orthogonal
decomposition. This component of the research will leverage current developments
in large eddy simulation along with two-level algorithms for efficient
computational implementation. The fact that the closure models follow from both
mathematical and physical arguments will allow for a methodology that
generalizes to physical settings other than fluid flow. A new globalization
methodology that combines more accurate local models with an interpolation
framework to evaluate the models in parameter space will also be studied. The
local model improvements are provided using flow sensitivity analysis and basis
functions are constructed using a multidimensional Hermite interpolation method.
The investigators will emphasize problems in geophysical fluid dynamics as well
as flows with free convection.

This research will expand the applicability of computationally efficient
simulations to a wider class of fluid flows. The availability of dramatically
faster simulations is important to many engineering applications including
optimization and control of fluid flows, data assimilation and uncertainty
quantification. Therefore, the research conducted in this project has direct
application to a wide range of problems that include data assimilation in
climate and weather modeling as well as simulation, optimization, and control of
energy efficient buildings.
