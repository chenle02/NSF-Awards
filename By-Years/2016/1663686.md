The Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC; http://earthref.org/MAGIC/) has
been developed under collaborative NSF proposals. It forms an open community
digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with web portals, allowing
users free access to upload, search, visualize, and download these data to
improve research capabilities in the Earth Sciences. This award provides support
for an open MagIC workshop, Earth?s Magnetic Field from the Beginning, at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography on January 24-26, 2017. The PIs have two
important goals: (1) to educate the paleomagnetic community about major
modifications to the MagIC database including streamlined approaches to
uploading their data and discovering those contributed by others; and (2) to
engage a broader group of researchers in one of the major scientific challenges
outlined in their motivations for developing the MagIC database. The topic they
have chosen is the geomagnetic evolution of Earth from 4.6 Ga to the present.
