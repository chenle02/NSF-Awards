In an effort to increase the number of women entering graduate school in CISE
disciplines, the Computing Research Association (CRA) is proposing a distributed
mentoring project where 20- 30 female undergraduate students will be matched
with a number of female professors in CISE research areas each year, to
participate in summer of research at the mentor's institution. The students will
most likely be computer science or computer engineering majors although this is
not required. The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic
departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering and Industrial
Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The mission of CRA is to
represent and inform the computing research community and to support and promote
its interests. Dr. Weingarten is the Executive Director of CRA. Dr. O'Rourke,
the academic leader of this project, is the Department Chair of Computer Science
at Smith College, Massachusetts.
