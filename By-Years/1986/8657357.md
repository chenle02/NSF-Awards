This grant initiates funding for the principal investigator's Presidential
Young Investigator award. To date, the PI has received a Petroleum Research Fund
Award of $18,000 that qualifies for NSF matching funds (American Chemical
Society, Petroleum Research Fund, Grant 1987). Accordingly, $43,000 in funds are
provided in this action ($25,000 for the base award plus $18,000 in matching
funds). The PI`s work involves studies of ionic and transport properties of
materials of geological and geophysical interest. Several avenues of
investigation are being pursued. Direct determination of the frequency-dependent
AC impedance of two-phase systems (crystal-melt systems) at high temperatures
and pressures will lead to models incorporating both textural parameters and
frequency into the theoretical formulations of bulk impedance of multiphase
systems. Geophysically, these results will be significant in terms of
characterization of shallow geothermal anomalies and in terms of interpretation
of upper mantle electrical conductivity anomalies and the thermal and physical
state of the upper mantle. Additional experiments are being developed to
determine electrical conductivities of volatile-bearing melts at elevated P and
T. Determination of the effects of volatiles, especially H.2O and CO.2, on ionic
transport is of significance not only in the geological problems of magma
formation, ascent, and eruption, but also in materials science and ceramic
engineering in terms of corrosion and weathering resistance. A novel type of
experiment combines tracer diffusion studies with electrochemically-induced
migration studies of volatiles in melts. These studies will enable determination
of the complete array of ionic transport, chemical equilibrium, and isotopic
exchange parameters in melt-volatile systems.
