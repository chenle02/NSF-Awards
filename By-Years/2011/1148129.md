When do cartels form? What market conditions are conducive to cartel formation?
How long do cartels last? In what markets can we expect cartels to persist for a
long time? What are the implications of recessions for cartel activity? Are
enforcement efforts, such as leniency programs, reducing the frequency of
cartels? What new policies might prove effective?

This award funds research into these and other questions using a combination of
research methods. The PI will use a stochastic dynamic model of the birth and
death of cartels to analyze the possible determinants of cartel duration and the
frequency of cartels in an economy. The PI will use this birth-death process to
simulate a panel data set of industries that includes some endogenous
cartelization. The simulation model will be used to identify improved methods
for estimating the probability of detection through data on discovered cartels;
to provide an ex ante evaluation of the performance of various competition
policies; and finally to discover useful proxies for the latent cartel rate to
improve the ex post evaluation of cartel policies. The PI will also use
qualitative research methods to develop new facts about cartel birth, death, and
detection through the analysis of US and European cases and interviews with
executives who have participated in cartel arrangements. The case analysis will
better identify the true source of cartel detection. The interviews shed light
on why firms chose to form a cartel and what caused it to break down.

Broader impacts are fully integrated into the research, because the research
questions are driven in part by the challenges faced by competition and
antitrust enforcement agencies. Deterring and ending cartels is good for
consumers, but it is difficult to evaluate the full benefit of these policies
from observations limited to the population of observed cartels. The combination
of research methods here will allow the PI to develop new recommendations for
competition authorities in the US and also around the globe.
