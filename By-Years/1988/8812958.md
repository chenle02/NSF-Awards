A collaborative effort to develop algorithms for the numerical solution of
problems arising in electrical and mechanical engineering on massively parallel
super-computers will be initiated. The three boundary-value problems that will
be used as examples include Laplace's equation, Poisson's equation, and the
reduced wave equation. These equations appear in electromagnetic fields, heat
conduction and diffusion, and fluid mechanics. The problem of distributing the
computational tasks associated with finite element method will be addressed.
These tasks include assembling the system of equations and the solution of large
sparse, systems of equation using frontal methods and multi-level adaptive
techniques. Two- and three-dimensional open domain problems will be studied as
they seem particularly suited to the hypercube architecture. Furthermore,
resources will be used to train interdisciplinary graduate students which serve
to build infrastructure and foster collaboration within engineering.
