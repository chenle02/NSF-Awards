Schroeder TQM in Education: Changing the Culture of Schools Abstract The
literature on TQM is replete with examples of failed implementation due to
unsuitable organizational culture. However, to date there have been only limited
attempts to rigorously delineate the type of culture associated with successful
TQM implementation. The proposed research seeks to directly address this issue
by theoretically and empirically defining the type of organizational culture
which supports, rather than hinders, implementation of TQM and by documenting
longitudinal changes in organizational culture during TQM implementation. Since
public school districts are increasingly criticized for having cultures that
inhibit organizational change and renewal, this research investigates
transformation to TQM in US K-12 schools. A three-stage approach will be used to
develop an ideal culture for TQM in schools. In the first stage, academics and
school leaders will review the literature and convene a panel to theoretically
define the ideal school culture for TQM implementation. A multi-disciplinary
team will consider organizational change, culture, and TQM from the literatures
of Organization Theory, School Administration, Educational Psychology, and
Quality Management in constructing multiple methods for measuring the level of
TQM culture in schools. In the second stage, the school culture of a sample of
relatively successful, long-term implementers of TQM will be measured to
determine their degree of alignment with the theoretically determined culture of
TQM. The beginning culture of a second sample of new TQM adopters will be
measured and a set of hypotheses will be formed about the cultural changes
needed if TQM is to be successfully implemented in these sites. Stage three will
continue the process of tracking TQM implementation and school culture in both
samples. As the co-variance of culture and TQM are studied longitudinally,
tentative conclusions and an enriched theory will emerge about the process of
changing organizational culture to be more TQM-supportive, thereby improving the
likelihood of successful organizational transformation.
