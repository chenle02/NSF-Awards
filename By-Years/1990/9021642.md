This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Robert Youngs,
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Professor Wang Hsiu Hwa,
National Pingtung Institute of Agriculture supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA
(Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This proposal plans to study the
relationship between removing moisture from wood and developments of
microfractures using numerical models and laboratory experiments include the
determination of stresses that develop during early stages of drying redwood and
Castanopsis carlesli, a Taiwan species resembling red oak in structure.
Microfractures are a major problem in wood products. They can greatly reduce the
quality of wood and lower the value of the wood products, and are a principal
source of loss of value wood products between the US and Taiwan. The result of
this research can provide useful information for understanding the development
of microfractures in wood and wood products and reduce the damage in wood during
shipping, storage and processing. This project is jointly supported by the NSF
and the Taiwan National Science Council.
