This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on main group compounds by Dr. Gerard F. R. Parkin of the
Chemistry Department, Columbia University. Synthetic, structural, mechanistic
and thermodynamic studies will be undertaken to provide a comprehensive and
fundamental understanding of main group (e.g., Al, Ga, Ge, In, Sn, Tl) complexes
and their potential applications. Emphasis will be placed on metal-alkyl and
metal-chalcogenide complexes and on the energetics of metal-main group multiple
bonds. A series of new, structurally analogous compounds will be prepared using
sterically-controlling ligands. The ligands to be used include
poly(pyrazolyl)hydroborate, tris(imidazolyl)phosphine, and tetraaza(14)annulene.
The steric environments created will be capable of supporting monomeric alkyl,
hydride, chalcogenolate, subvalent, and multiply bonded chalcogenide and
pnictide derivatives. Chalcogens S, Se, and Te are included in the study;
pnictogens include P and Bi. Complexes of main group elements find application
as precursors for ceramic materials, semiconductors, and superconductors. For
example, binary II-VI chalcogenides (e.g., ZnSe and ZnTe) and III-V pnictides
(eg., GaAs and InP) are used in photovoltaic energy conversion devices, light-
emiting diodes, solid-state lasers and optical switches. Ceramics and porous
solid state materials formed from chalcogenides and pnictides are also in use.
In this study, new molecular compounds of controlled structure will be prepared
and characterized in order to better be able to correlate the chemistry of these
compounds with the properties of materials containing them.
