Fifteen microcomputers and related hardware are being used to effect changes in
the curriculum and scientific orientation of the Department of Psychology. The
department is in the process of improving its laboratory facilities so that
major and non-major students have greater exposure to the empirical techniques
used to examine behavior. To this end, the computers are used to allow students
to perform a wide range of experiments in a laboratory setting. The first
priority is development of a laboratory component for the introductory level
course. The experiments conducted in this laboratory replicate experiments that
serve as the basis for the principles being discussed in lecture. The emphases
of these labs is the analysis of specific phenomena, the use of systematic
empiricism to acquire information, and the means for analyzing and reporting the
results of an experiment. The laboratory is also used for advanced-level classes
in which students perform a series of experiments specific to that field. The
computer facility is also available to students conducting independent research
projects. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
