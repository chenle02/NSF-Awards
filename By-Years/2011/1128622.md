GOALI: Integrated Multi-functional Solar Panel Antenna
Array&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore
reconfigurable phased array antennas that are directly integrated with solar
cells to form multi-functional panels. The approach is to integrate smart
combinations of transparent mesh antennas and slot antennas on or around solar
cells, and then to creatively excite the antennas to achieve multiple diversity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research solves one of the most
important problems in space exploration by integrating electromagnetics with
solar cells. The project addresses fundamentals of optimal antenna elements with
minimal impact on solar cells, integration of active electronics with antennas
on solar panels, and reconfigurablility. The development will yield active
phased reconfigurable antenna array integrated on solar panels for very high
data rate communication, transmitting energy harvested from space, and for low
cost space mission by re-using one panel for multiple flights. None of those
advantages can be achieved by traditional antennas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Besides satellite applications, the
proposed integration technique can be employed to form self-powered ground
receivers. Research outcomes can be easily adapted to integration of antennas
with composite surfaces such as wings of unmanned aerial vehicle for various
applications. On the education side, this collaborative effort with industry
will create exciting hands-on projects in undergraduate classrooms, senior
designs, and summer internship opportunities. The industry partner will take the
leadership in commercializing the proposed technology from laboratory to ready-
to-implement level, which will directly impact urban communication, renewable
energy research, and space weather monitoring.
