This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of Physical Chemistry in the subfield of Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry. Recently Professor Ladanyi has been studying solution
phase reaction dynamics in collaboration with Professor J. T. Hynes at the
University of Colorado and Professor G. T. Evans at Oregan State University. Her
contribution to these projects has mostly dealt with the application of integral
equation approaches to evaluate the effects of equilibrium solvation on the
reaction free energy surfaces. This award will allow her group to expand the
scope of this research by applying computer simulation methods to the study of
static and dynamic solvation and by developing and applying analytical dynamical
models to the effects of non-equilibrium solvation on chemical reaction rates.
