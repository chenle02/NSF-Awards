This awards supports a two-year collaborative research project between
Professor Ken-Ichi Nishikawa of the University of Iowa and Professor Jun-ichi
Sakai of Toyama University, Japan. Also involved in the project are Professor
Torsten Neubert of the University of Michigan and Shinji Koide of Toyama
University. Recently the Japan-U.S. satellite "Yohkoh" has obtained new
observations of solar flare plasmas. In particular, the coalescences of current
loops have been observed in the active regions on the Sun, which were proposed
by Sakai et al since 1982. This observation has pointed out the importance of
their idea that the solar flare is generated by the coaslescence of current
loops. This research project will model the dynamics of the coalescence of
current loops by means of a 3-D electromagnetic (E-M) particle simulation code
associated with theories and MHD simulations. The main topic is to investigate
the kinetic processes such as energy transfer, acceleration of high-energy
particles, and electromagnetic emissions associated with the current loop
coalescence that cannot be studied by MHD simulations.
