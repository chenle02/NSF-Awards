The workshop will expose participants to state-of-the-art developments in
computer networks, with emphasis on local area networks. It is designed for
faculty at small colleges and universities and preference will be given to
faculty at historically black colleges and universities and institutions with
large Hispanic or other minority enrollments. In addition faculty from other
small institutions are encouraged to apply. During a typical day, time is evenly
divided between network concepts and theory and laboratory assignments on
protocol design and implementation.//
