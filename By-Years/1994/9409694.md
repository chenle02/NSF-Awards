A real-time system has specific time constraints for the processing of database
query as well as consistency requirements for its temporal data. If it is not
possible to produce an exact answer to a database query by a specified deadline,
approximate query processing can be used to provide an approximate answer within
the time constraints, but it does not address the temporal dimension of the
data. This project integrates the two areas of approximate query processing and
temporal data in order to examine the performance of approximate query
processing for a real-time database. An analysis of the overhead required for
the semantic support of approximate query processing determines the design of
the approximate query processing system. A performance analysis demonstrates how
well the system satisfies the timing constraints of the queries and maintains
the temporal consistency requirements of the data in its approximate answers.
The result of this project provides an approximate query processing system that
is applicable in real-time environments where data consistency must be
maintained an deadlines must be met.
