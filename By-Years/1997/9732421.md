Proposal No.: 9732421 PI: Ataai University: U of Pittsburgh ABSTRACT As the
result of NSF support of our REU site in the last four years, we have built and
sustained a high-quality program that has attracted many capable and highly
motivated students from primarily undergraduate colleges as well as research
universities, into an active research environment. Most of the REU interns of
our program, who have completed their undergraduate degree, have entered various
graduate programs (88% of African Americans, and 79% of students from the
primarily undergraduate institutions). We are requesting 3 years of support to
continue our NSF-Supported REU site (15 summer interns) in the Department of
Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. Our goal is
to introduce undergraduates from engineering and the sciences, especially
undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering, chemistry, and biology at small
colleges and universities to research activities. Our educational philosophy
upon which our program is based includes hands-on laboratory experimentation
with advice and guidance supplied by a faculty mentor, and enriched by seminars
and visits to industrial laboratories, as well as extracurricular social
interactions. We plan to continue recruiting from a great number of colleges and
universities in and around the Western Pennsylvania region, Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and to enroll a large number of students from
the primarily undergraduate institutions (at least 50%) and the balance from
research universities.
