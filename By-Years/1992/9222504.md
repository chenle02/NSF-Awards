Metamorphosis is a developmental process that is characterized by changes in
form and physiology of non-reproductive structures to allow for the occupation
of new ecological niches. In amphibians, the internal and external changes of
metamorphosis occur in temporal relationships that appear to depend on a
progressively-rising level of thyroid hormones in the blood. Moreover, the rate
at which metamorphic events occur is also influenced by environmental factors
such as the daily changes of light and darkness. Since melatonin, a hormone
produced and secreted by the pineal gland, plays a major role in signalling
photoperiodic changes, Dr. Wright will determine whether it interacts with
thyroid hormone in the regulation of the metamorphic process. Using both in
vitro and in vivo approaches, she will examine the influence of circadian
rhythms on the reciprocal interactions between melatonin and thyroid hormones in
the development of the tadpole. Amphibians serve as primary models for
embryological and developmental studies and the vast majority of what we have
learned about the developmental biology of amphibians is directly applicable to
our understanding of human development. Therefore, these results are likely to
provide new insights into the role of hormones in early development. Moreover,
the findings will be related to conservation of biological diversity since
identifying the environmental and hormonal factors that influence development
may help in understanding the recent global decline in amphibian populations.
Dr. Wright is supervising this research at an undergraduate institution and,
therefore, a major goal of this project is to introduce students into the
scientific process and to prepare them for professional scientific careers.
