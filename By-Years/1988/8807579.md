This is a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology to support Dr.
Thorsness' research and training under the mentorship of Dr. June B. Nasrallah.
The proposal outlines experiments to study self- incompatability in Brassica,
using a combination of genetic and cell biology approaches. The cellular site(s)
of expression of the genetically-defined S-locus, which directs the self-
incompatability response, will be identified by transforming plants with
chimeric genes produced by fusing the S-locus promoter to various reporter genes
(including lethal and non-lethal reporters). The project has both theoretical
and potentially pragmatic significance. The results will identify the cells of
the plant which express the S-locus gene products, and will permit biological
analysis of the self-incomptability phenomenon. The use of lethal reporter genes
may generate plants with altered fertility which may be of agricultural
usefulness.
