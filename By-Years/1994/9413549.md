ABSTRACT CTS-9413549 Jonathan Barnett This proposal requests funds to acquire
laboratory instruments and experimental apparatuses for a fire science
laboratory. The instrumentation will be used in a new fire science laboratory
being constructed at the Worchester Polytechnic Institute. The Cone Calorimeter
will be used to collect fundamental material properties for use in computer fire
modeling. In addition to a similar use, the Room Calorimeter will be used for
model validation. A computer workstation will be used for a dedicated
computational platform. The new equipment will be used to attract new graduate
students to the WPI's fire protection engineering program, enhance the
laboratory components of the doctoral level scholars funded by an NSF GRTP
grant, and help expedite the development of a new generation computer fire
model. An university-based comprehensive fire research program supported by a
large group of scholars will be developed.
