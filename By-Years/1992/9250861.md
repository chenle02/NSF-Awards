This project integrates cell culture into team-taught, cross- disciplinary
courses in Biology and Chemistry. Three functional groups of equipment are used:
tissue culture equipment (a CO2 incubator), immunology and biochemistry
equipment (tabletop centrifuges, fraction collectors and a microplate reader),
and microscopy equipment (a low light level video camera and printer to
establish a florescent video imaging system). Equipment in all three groups
supports innovative laboratory exercises in new or revised courses in
Immunology, Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics. This
instrumentation also supports student/faculty research teams in both biology and
chemistry.
