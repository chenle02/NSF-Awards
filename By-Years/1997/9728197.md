Peter J. Bryant Molecular and genetic methods will be used to investigate the
functions of a newly discovered family of Imaginal Disc Growth Factors (IDGFs)
from Drosophila. The factors were discovered in conditioned medium from imaginal
disc cultures, and have been shown to be related to chitinases rather than to
previously known growth factors. They cooperate with insulin to stimulate the
proliferation, polarization and motility of imaginal disc cells in vitro. The
first goal is to identify the functions of IDGFs in vivo by isolating and
characterizing mutations and deficiencies in the genes encoding these proteins.
P-element mutagenesis and radiation mutagenesis will be used to produce loss-of-
function mutations and deficiencies of the IDGF genes, and the mutant phenotypes
produced by single and multiple losses will be analyzed. Genetic methods will
also be used to determine whether individual IDGFs can compensate for loss of
other members of the family, and to test the hypothesis that these proteins are
secreted by the fat body into the blood. The second goal is to test the effects
of each IDGF and of combinations of IDGFs, with and without insulin, on cell
proliferation and polarization both in cell lines and in larval tissues. Each
IDGF will be produced in a baculoviral expression system. The binding of IDGFs
to cells and to proteins will be studied in order to determine whether these
proteins interact with a cell-surface receptor, and the possibility that they
interact directly with insulin will be tested. The IDGFs will also be tested for
chitinase activity. The third goal is to test the hypothesis that the expression
of IDGF genes is under the control of the known transcription factor serpent,
which has an appropriate expression pattern and DNA-binding properties. The
discovery of these proteins opens up a variety of new approaches to the problem
of growth control in Drosophila.
