The proposed research concerns the use of ideas from mathematical logic to
enhance the understanding of some central objects in mathematics: symmetries,
functions, and differential equations. The part of mathematical logic which is
relevant to the proposed research is model theory, which is about the ways in
which mathematical objects or classes of objects are defined linguistically.
Although mathematical logic has traditional connections with the philosophy and
foundations of mathematics, there have been many recent applications to core
areas of mathematics, and the proposed research is in the latter tradition.
Among key problems to be studied are: (i) classifying the ways in which a
"group" (collection of symmetries) can act as symmetries of a nice space,
sometimes under some model theoretic assumptions, and (ii) what are the
equations satisfied by some very special functions, such as exponential
functions.

Here are some more details, written for mathematicians. The proposed research
has two main parts. A central theme of the first part is the classification of
groups definable in models of a first order theory without the independence
property. This belongs to the "tame" model theory of groups, generalizing
"stable group theory" which itself generalizes part of the theory of algebraic
groups. Although the motivation belongs largely to "pure" model theory, this
part of the proposal touches also on topological dynamics and Lie groups. For
example we expect to produce "new" invariants of a discrete group, with many
questions raised. The second part of the proposal deals with applications of
model theory to diophantine geometry over function fields, building on earlier
work of the PI and others. One problem is the extension of Ax-Schanuel-type
theorems, on exponentiation and transcendence, to families of semiabelian
varieties. Another problem is to obtain a "transparent" account of the positive
characteristic Mordell-Lang conjecture (due originally to Hrushovski).
