This project supports a three week mathematical research institute to be
organized by the American Mathematical Society during the summer of 1988. The
institute will be the thirty-sixth in a series planned with the purpose of
bringing together a large group of mathematicians who are interested in a
particular field of mathematical research. Emphasis is placed primarily on
instruction at a very high level with seminars and lectures by distinguished
mathematicians in related fields. The 1988 institute will focus on "Operator
Theory/Operator Algebras and Applications". During the last twenty years
operator theory has come of age. The subject has developed in several
directions, using new and powerful methods that led to the solutions of basic
problems thought to be inaccessible in the sixties. These developments have made
mutually enriching contact with other areas of mathematics, including algebraic
topology and index theory, complex analysis in one and several variables, and
probability theory. This institute will summarize the current progress and
examine the common and unifying theories that exist in the subject.
