Plants produce many more ovules than develop into seeds. Some ovules may not
develop into seeds because pollen tubes fail to reach the ovary and fertilize
ovules; other ovules are fertilized and then aborted. The failure of an ovule to
develop into a seed can also depend on the genotype of the pollen donor. In
general, seeds sired by foreign pollen are more likely to be developed over
seeds sired by self pollen when both types of seeds are competing in the same
fruit. There have been few investigations attempting to determine the mechanism
of preferential development of outcrossed seeds although many authors have
hypothesized that variation in pollen tube growth is important. Pollen tubes of
certain donors may simply not get to the ovary and fertilize any ovules.
Patterns of preferential development could also be caused by selective abortion
if seeds sired by self pollen are aborted with greater frequency than seeds
sired by foreign pollen. Despite the possible role of seed abortion in
determining patterns of preferential development, abortion of seeds sired by
specific pollen donors has not been examined in any plant. The proposed work
differs from previous studies because it will look at both variation in pollen
tube growth and seed abortion. The PIs have developed a technique that enables
them to determine the genetic makeup of ovules as they begin to abort.
Preliminary data suggest that seeds sired by self pollen are aborted with
greater frequency than seeds sired by foreign pollen.
