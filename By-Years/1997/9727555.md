This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focusses on the development of new continuous electrophoretic
separations in narrow channels coupled to capillary sample introduction.
Professor Ewing and his students at Penn State University will pursue work to
improve detection schemes for these separations using electrochemical arrays and
post-separation derivatization for fluorescence detection. The goal of this work
is to develop a fast continuous or sequential analysis protocol for very small
samples taken from neuronal environments. Another focus of this work will be in
using these methods to monitor enzymatic reactions in order to do drug
screening. This project has both fundamental and applied goals that will advance
the sensitivity and speed of small sample analyses. New developments in
continuous electrophoretic separations of very small samples in narrow channels
will be pursued in this project. Professor Ewing and his students at Penn State
University will focus on substantial improvements in the detection limits for
these separations using both electrochemical and fluorescence methods of
analysis. An important aspect of this work will be enhancing the speed of these
analyses using very small samples so that screening methods can be developed in
fields such as neurochemistry and drug development. This project has both
fundamental scientific components and important applied goals that will be of
societal value.
