This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance studies of catalytic
surface chemistry. Professor Cecil Dybowski will study the adsorption of Xe gas
on zeolite materials using solid state NMR methods. By determining the
fundamental phenomena which give rise to chemical shifts and changes in peak
shape, the use of the Xe adsorption method to probe surface chemistry will be
advanced. Microporous zeolites with particular surface chemistries will be used
to probe both chemical shift and dynamic relaxation of Xe nuclear magnetic
resonances. Using diffusion measurements, the role of surface oxide structure on
relaxation times will be determined. This will lead to a better understanding of
the chemistry of adsorption.
