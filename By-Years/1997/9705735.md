9705735 Burrows This project plans to develop a partnership with KCTS Public
Television, Laubach Literacy Action, and the National Alliance of Urban Literacy
Coalitions to develop an implementation plan to promote higher science literacy
in at-risk families in inner city settings. These organizations reach families
that seldom participate in formal and informal science learning programs. A
training design for literacy providers to use science literacy materials as an
integrated part of their adult literacy curriculum will be developed. Video and
print materials that are specifically designed for low literacy adults will be
developed. These are expected to be simple, fun, and effective ways to foster
the love of science and learning in themselves and their children. Front-end
evaluation focus groups will be conducted with providers and parents to gain
insights into the specific needs and general expectations of the parents and
literacy providers, and to get feedback on the proposed project materials.
