The purpose of the Working Conference is to have leaders in the different
fields of the earth sciences and earth science education develop a structure by
which a network of experts in the earth sciences and education communities can
address unresolved issues in earth science education. The Working Conference is
a necessary extension of the l985 Conference and the l986 Task Force meetings.
Future improvements in teacher preparation and state certification requirements,
in-service instruction, curriculum development, and instructional research in
earth science education depend on the resolution of these major issues in earth
science education.
