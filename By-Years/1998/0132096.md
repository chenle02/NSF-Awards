This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
commercialize the Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) system, a novel materials joining
process. The goal is to establish MPW as a reliable and economic method to weld
tubular structures. The project will conduct research and engineering that will
address the critical technical hurdles for the commercial implementation and
dissemination of the new welding technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial applications would revolutionize the assembly process of the
hydroformed tubular structures in automotive chassis and space frame
applications. This process will promote the hybrid automotive body structure
design that uses tubes of both aluminums and steels and will enable joining of
different materials such as titanium to superalloys for aerospace and electronic
applications.
