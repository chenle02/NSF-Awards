Monazite is a common trace mineral in metamorphic rocks, and is critical for age
determinations. The Light Rare-Earth Elements (LREEs) are a main chemical
constituent of monazite, yet the host of LREEs before monazite forms in a rock
is unclear. Using natural samples from Great Smoky Mountains National Park, this
work will discriminate whether LREEs are hosted by major silicate minerals or
LREE-rich trace minerals such as allanite. The work will also show whether
monazite forms instantaneously or has a protracted growth history. These results
will help characterize monazite-forming reactions to improve our understanding
of the ages monazite provide, and better constrain the tectonic processes that
produced the Smokies and other mountain belts. Results will also be used to
improve interpretive aids for the 10 million people that visit the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park each year.
