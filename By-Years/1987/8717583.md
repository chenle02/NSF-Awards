It is clear from a number of studies of dioeceous plants (separate male and
female plants) from diverse ecosystems that two sexes are not equally
distributed in the same microhabitats. Yet little is understood of the
physiological bases of the difference in distribution. This study will test
several hypotheses relating to the possible differences in water relations
between sexes and their implications for productivity and survival. Among the
experimental techniques in this project will be the analysis of stable isotope
ratios of water (specifically D/H ratios) at natural abundance levels to detect
the depths from which individual trees are extracting water. The information is
critical as it says much about the potential for growth and survival of
individual trees. Since this information is also recorded in tree rings as
plants grow, our analysis should provide fundamental long-term information on
water sources used by plants and in combination with carbon isotope ratio
analysis should provide an integrated measure of the productivity to water
consumption ratio under these conditions. Among the applied aspects of our
dioeceous species (such as poplars) constitute a major fraction of the tree
species used for pulp production. Since this study are focusing on the
parameters affecting growth, productivity and survival, they could have direct
application to this important industry.
