This project supports a year-long Faculty Learning Community (FLC) on the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) for linguists from across the United
States. The primary objective is to increase the availability and quality of
SoTL-related materials in the field of linguistics, leading to better
pedagogical outcomes in K-12 and higher education, following many other STEM
fields such as Chemistry, Engineering, and Psychology. The project will result
in the training of a cohort of linguists who will promote inclusivity,
mentoring, networking, and pedagogical development. This work has the potential
to create a network of linguistics scholars with expertise on teaching and
learning, which will benefit the field of Linguistics, as well as the academe.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will meet online bi-weekly throughout the
2019-2020 academic year and will have two in-person workshops. The FLC will be
facilitated by the two Associate Editors of the Teaching Linguistics section of
Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA).
Participants in the FLC will design a SoTL project to be carried out in one of
their courses in the Spring 2020 term, and will present on their preliminary
findings at the May workshop. During the workshop, participants will also
consult with their peers, as well as the facilitators and project consultants,
to determine best practices in disseminating their scholarship, and to create a
strategy for spreading SoTL to the rest of the LSA membership, beginning with
plans for the 2021 annual meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
