Industry in the Appalachia Region of Northeast Tennessee has nowhere to turn to
hire qualified college graduates with networking experience and cannot locally
find unbiased assistance in planning and implementing local area networks
(LANs). While the Computer Engineering Technology department should be a natural
focus for this type of training, it has not been able to provide these skills
because it has been severely lacking in the requisite equipment. Students have
been exposed to LANs in a single limited-availability course that deals with a
single network operating system (NOS). However, efforts are being made to
correct this deficiency in order to increase the region's industrial success.
The Computer Networking Laboratory seeks to eliminate these problems by
providing students with a variety of network architectures and a large capacity
network (up to 50 simultaneous users). At the same time, data gathered from
laboratory experiences can be compiled into a document that makes available to
companies and educational institutions the information necessary to emulate or
adapt the exercises or put the results to work in a business environment.
Several NOSs are being implemented in a hands-on laboratory environment, and the
students are being given the opportunity to experiment with the LANs. A
communications server is being included to enable users to call from remote
sites and log on to use the facilities, which provides a new dimension in
distance education. The new laboratory also allows industry workshops to be
conducted to educate persons requiring specialized training. The program has the
potential to reach at least four academic program areas in the current catalog
(over 100 students per year) and potentially that many from industry. The impact
on local institutions can be amplified by the production of the self-help
documentation.
