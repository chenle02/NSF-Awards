The Mt. Wilson Solar Photographic Digitization Project will make available to
the community in digital form a selection of solar images in the archives of the
Carnegie Observatories. These images date from 1894 and include many which can
be judged to be of superb quality by modern standards. The digitization will use
commercial scanning technology with a prepress scanner having 16-bit precision
and up to 3000 by 3000 dots per inch spatial resolution. These images will
permit a variety of retrospective analyses of the state of solar magnetism and
activity, and they will provide a temporal baseline of 100 years for numerous
solar attributes. The 20th Century was a period of increased anthropogenic
production of greenhouse gases, which may contribute to global climate change.
The sun could also be a factor in global climate change. The data provided by
this digitization will allow the scientific community to freely examine the
secular variation of the sun's magnetic behavior during this same time frame,
and may thus be crucial in disentangling the solar and anthropogenic effects.
