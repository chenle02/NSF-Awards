The PI's proposed research is concerned with the study of canonical Kahler
metrics on algebraic varieties. There are deep conjectures relating the
existence of extremal metrics to stability of the underlying algebraic variety
and understanding this relationship has been studied intensively in the last
decade. One major aspect of the PI's research is what one can say when no
extremal metric exists. This problem will be studied both on the algebraic side
to understand how varieties can be destabilized, and also in terms of metrics,
which involves extending many of the existing results on extremal metrics to
non-compact manifolds with cusp-like singularities along divisors. Another
direction in the PI's proposal is the use of geometric flows to attack the
existence of canonical metrics. Here too one of the most fascinating aspects is
to study what kinds of singularities can form when no extremal metric exists and
the PI will build on his earlier work on the Calabi flow on ruled surfaces and
toric varieties and on the Kahler-Ricci flow.

Geometric partial differential equations govern much of the physical world. For
example solutions of Einstein's equations are intimately related to our
understanding of the universe. The proposed research studies differential
equations related to Einstein's equations and the key question is how the global
structure of a space influences the local, analytic properties of the solutions
of such equations. Understanding this phenomenon will have applications in
physics and the sciences in general.
