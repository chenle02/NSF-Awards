This four year project, Enhancing the Success of Minorities in Science and
Engineering: Outcome and Process Evaluation of the Meyerhoff Program,
investigates the effectiveness of the Meyerhoff Program for talented Black
students in science and engineering. The program components are recruitment,
Summer Bridge Program, scholarships, study groups, program values, program
community, personal advising and counseling, tutoring, summer research
internships, faculty and administrative involvement, mentors, and family
involvement. The evaluation will determine which of the program components and
other key program factors provide the critical support needed to keep talented
undergraduate Black students in science and mathematics. Also, the evaluation
will identify what type of institutional support is needed for continuing and
replicating an innovative intervention program.
