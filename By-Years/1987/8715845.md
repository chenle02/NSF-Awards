The knowledge of nonlinear optical phenomena at a surface and their use as
probes for surface physical and chemical properties will have fundamental impact
on surface sciences, materials processing, and development of optical and
electronic devices. The use of state-of-the-art surface preparation coupled with
sophisticated laser instrumentation and the appropriate surface analysis system
enhances the ability of investigators to obtain detailed information on the
surface before, during, and after interaction with the laser light. This award,
co-supported by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the
Instrumentation for Materials Research Program, will aid in the acquisition of
the major portion of an Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) Surface Analysis System. The
areas that will be enhanced by the acquisition are: 1) The interaction of
intense light with adsorbates and surfaces. 2) The electronic structure of
nearly free electron (NFE) metals, particularly the charge density near
surfaces. 3) Development of fast time-resolution for the study of desorption
dynamics, energy transfer, and reaction dynamics on surfaces.
