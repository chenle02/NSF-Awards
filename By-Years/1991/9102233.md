Professor Zucker will work on locally symmetric spaces as well as
transcendental methods in algebraic geometry. He will also study Torelli type
questions for fibre spaces. Professor Karpishpan will work on Hodge theory from
the point of view of deformation theory, using differential Lie algebras. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
