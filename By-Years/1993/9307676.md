9307676 Hadjipanayis This project deals with the synthesis and characterization
of granular solids and exchange-coupled magnetic metal multilayers. The magnetic
properties will be correlated with the microstructure and the magnetic domain
structure observed by Lorentz microscopy. The magnetic studies include field and
temperature dependence of coercivity, remanence curves, anisotropy measurements,
and magnetic after effects. The magnetic properties of iron and cobalt granular
solids will be studied systematically by investigating the effects of sample
preparation, different matrix material, film microstructure and particle
interactions. Similar Studies will be made on iron/iron oxide and cobalt/coblat
oxide films. The research includes modeling studies of the micromagnetic
behavior of the materials. %%% This project will support research that will
produce new types of magnetic materials. Some of the materials consist of small
magnetic particles. Others are thin films of iron and cobalt and ion and cobalt
oxides. The materials are of fundamental interest, but are of great
technological interest also in the area of magnetic recording materials. The
complex materials properties of the magnets will be characterized by a variety
of techniques, electron microscopy. In addition, the properties of the materials
will be modeled as an aid in the interpretation of the observed phenomena. ***
