Under a Phase II SBIR award the deposition of polymer coatings by pulsed plasmas
will be studied. The effects of process parameters and substrate bias on coating
composition will be evaluated with special emphasis on the effects of duty
cycle, pulse width, RF frequency and absorbed power. A variety of products will
be coated for testing in commercial applications where abrasion resistance,
surface hardness and surface adhesion are important.
