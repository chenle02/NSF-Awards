The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of
mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by
polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in
theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of
the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first
topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the
collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an
algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic
geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of "organisms" as itself
being an "organism" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact.
The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, focusing here on
resolution of singularities, applied in this project to families of varieties.
Resolution of singularities is a fundamental procedure where "bad" points of an
algebraic variety are removed and replaced by "good" points.

Abramovich will continue studying problems in birational geometry, specifically
the problem of functorial semistable reduction. Here Abramovich and
collaborators will build on Hironaka's method of resolution of singularities in
order to resolve singularities of families of varieties. Long term goals include
extending this effort to other geometric categories and to singular foliations.
In addition, Abramovich will continue to study moduli spaces. The main foci are
Moduli and arithmetic of K3 surfaces, where one wishes to find situations where
K3 moduli spaces are algebraically hyperbolic; representability of logarithmic
moduli, where an analogue of Artin's criteria is sought; a quest to describe
explicit moduli of certain stable surfaces; and completion of a long-term
project on the logarithmic degeneration formula.
