This research in theoretical physics is directed at many- body problems in
diverse areas - nuclei, molecular dynamics, atomic clusters - which share common
mathematical properties. The topics include studying the chaotic nature of large
amplitude collective motion in nuclei near level crossings, propagation of many-
particle systems in a random field, molecular dynamics at finite temperatures,
shape transitions and electronic degrees of freedom of metallic clusters and
collective motion of carbon clusters.
