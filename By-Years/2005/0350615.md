This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor David N. Hendrickson to better control the
quantum properties of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). The quantum tunneling of
magnetization in monodisperse nanomagnets with well-defined structures prepared
by chemical synthesis in solution at ambient temperatures will be investigated.
The SMMs will be characterized by sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance
methods, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetometry techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals of this research include: 1) synthesizing new SMMs
in order to adjust the various factors controlling the nature of magnetization
dynamics; (2) investigating the mechanism for the resonant quantum tunneling of
magnetization (QTM); (3) pursuing the influence of intermolecular magnetic
exchange interactions on QTM; (4) studying how the properties of SMMs change
going from a molecule with a relatively large spin such as S = 13 to one with a
small spin such as S = 4; (5) examining in detail spin parity effects exhibited
by half-integer (e.g., S = 9/2, 13/2, etc.) spin SMMs; (6) preparing and
characterizing new SMMs with transport properties; (7) attaching SMMs to
functionalized metal surfaces or to polymers; (8) developing SMMs with photon
accessibility; (9) preparing non-compensated spin SMMs doping S = 0
antiferromagnetic rings and polynuclear complexes; and (10) discovering why
certain Mn12 SMMs exhibit magnetization tunneling with one-half the activation
energy of other Mn12 SMMs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single molecule magnets offer
the potential for data storage on the nanoscale and other applications. This
research is to develop new types of single molecule magnets and study the new
quantum effects they present. Collaborations involve physics groups in three
different countries and several chemistry groups, which will enhance the
research training of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
