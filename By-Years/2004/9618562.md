This award provides partial support to the National Academy of Sciences for the
Frontiers of Science Symposia. The purpose of the symposia are to promote the
exchange of ideas among young scientific researchers in disparate disciplines.
In particular, the symposia are intended to give outstanding young scientists
exposure to frontiers research currently under way in areas other than their own
with the idea of providing the participants an appreciation of the value and
potential benefits of research in different fields to their own work. Also,
these discussions would transmit information about methods and instrumentation
use in one field to scientists in other fields.
