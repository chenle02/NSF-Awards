This research involves convexity-related inequalities and positive dependence
in statistics. The related areas in statistics include multivariate analysis,
reliability theory, multiple decision problems, and statistical computing. The
mathematical tools to be used are convexity, majorization theory, conditioning
and mixture of distributions. The research will provide a partial ordering of
positive dependence among random variables via multivariate majorization. The
effects of positive dependence in system reliability theory will be explored.
Open problems in optimal-partitioning inequalities will be studied and a
comparison of statistical experiments via positive dependence will be made.
