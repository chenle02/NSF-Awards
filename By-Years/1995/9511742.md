9511765 Willis Many animals, from spawning salmon to hungry seabirds and
insects, locate distant unseen resources (such as food or the salmon's home
stream) by using odors released by that resource. These investigators study the
male moth, Manduca sexta, which locates mates by flying upwind in a trail of the
sex-attractant odor (pheromones) released by receptive females. The male moth's
flight is guided by combining information from all of its senses, including
smell, vision, and touch. To explore how the male moths adapt their behavior to
changes in their environment, such as changing wind speed or odor concentration,
male moths are video- taped while flying freely toward the pheromones in a
laboratory wind tunnel and activity from their flight muscles is recorded. In
this way, control signals from the nervous system can be correlated with the
behavior that is videotaped. The results from these free-flight studies can then
be compared to results from tethered male moths provided with computer-driven
sensory stimulation from a flight simulator and tethered males using the muscle
activity patterns generated in the moth's nervous system to drive the
computerized flight simulator. This will enable these investigators to analyze
how the moth's nervous system combines the information from all of its senses
with the on-going behavior patterns that underlie this complex behavior.
Finally, computer simulations of odor-guided flight in moths will be used to
test hypotheses about how the nervous system controls behavior. Knowledge
derived from these studies can them be used to design artificial systems that
could perform similar adaptive control functions.
