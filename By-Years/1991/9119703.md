This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will aid in
purchasing a high resolution mass spectrometer for the Department of Chemistry
at New York University. The research studies to be performed include the
following: molecular recognition in solutions and solids, solid state host-
organic zeolites, self assembling hosts, tunneling in biological electron
transfer reactions, new methods for conformational restriction, synthetic
peptide models for investigating the determinants of alpha helical structure,
organic photochemistry, synthesis of new neuroreceptor ligands, and topics in
organic synthesis. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique
of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular
weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in
combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in
mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
