Brain-machine interface technology has the potential of improving the quality of
life for millions of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the
central nervous system or other neurological disorders. Our previous findings
showed that monkeys can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling
a robot arm through a brain-machine interface using visual feedback, even in the
absence of overt arm movements. This proposal aims at bringing the field one
step closer towards the ultimate control of neuroprosthetic devices through an
effortless recall of a motor memory in a manner that mimics the natural process
of skill acquisition and motor control. This goal will be pursued through the
following specific aims: 1) To investigate the formation and stabilization of a
prosthetic motor memory; 2) To investigate the neuron-behavior relationship for
prosthetic function.

This project will establish a scientific basis for understanding how the brain
controls movement of disembodied devices, and will drive the development of the
next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in
millions of neurologically impaired patients. The strong educational component
of this proposal relies on brain-machine interfaces as an ideal platform for
interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. The proposed efforts aim
to address the nations current talent shortage of science and engineering majors
which could have a severe negative impact on economic growth. This will be
pursued through a mentoring program aimed at increasing the number of
underrepresented and women students entering careers in engineering. The program
will also involve undergraduate and graduate students, academics, and the
industrial community in brain-machine interface research through teaching,
collaborations, data sharing, workshops and tutorials.
