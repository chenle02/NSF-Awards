A motion picture camera and auxiliary image analysis equipment will be obtained
for an ongoing research effort with a greatly advanced capability to study
experimentally the fundamental problem of dendritic crystal growth. The point of
departure of this work is that it will attempt to account for both free and
forced convection of energy and solute in the context of the dendritic growth of
ice and succinonitrile which means that shapes and pattern formation must be
considered. The cinemicrography system and image analysis equipment provided
here, in conjunction with the present wild macroscope, temperature measurement
and control for the free and forced convection growth cells provides the
capability of making the necessary measurements with the precision required to
enhance significantly our understanding of dendritic growth and pattern
formation which is fundamental in the development of many new materials.
