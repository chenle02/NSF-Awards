9311037 Numbers Science and religion have had a long and at times contentious
relationship in the United States. Within the past decade, advocates of more
fundamentalist Christian sects have argued that many of the theories of
contemporary science, especially the theory of evolution, have been advanced by
a "religion" known as secular humanism. The fundamentalists have offered an
alternative creationist theory and have convinced at least two state
legislatures that the opposing theories should have equal standing in biology
classes. In his dissertation research, Mr. Sheldon is examining the development
of "secular humanism" and its relationship to science in 20th century America.
His objectives are to understand the role of science and religion in humanist
thought and the ways in which prominent scientists and popularists have adopted
humanism as a framework for the presentation of the history, discoveries and
methods of science. The project focuses on John Dewey, H. J. Muller, Carl Sagan,
B. F. Skinner and others. The project involves a thorough survey of the primary
humanist journals in America as well as published works of the principal actors
and critics. In addition, Mr. Sheldon is using interviews and archival research
to provide crucial data on the institutional development of humanism and its
relation to scientists and their ideas. ***
