The investigators continue studies of the effect that symmetry has on the
solutions of differential equations. Three particular topics are the stability
of heteroclinic cycles (which is related to the existence of intermittency and
bursting phenomena), the symmetry of chaotic attractors (which may be related to
some of the distinctive patterns observed in turbulent fluid flow), and the
coupling of gauge and spatial symmetries (such as occurs in the Ginzburg-Landau
model for superconductivity). They will also attempt to relate their results to
specific experiments. They believe that both the bursting phenomena associated
with heteroclinic cycles and the symmetry-increasing bifurcations of chaotic
attractors have been observed in the Couette-Taylor experiment; part of their
work will be to make these connections more precise. Many models of physical
phenomena including topics as diverse as the transition from conduction to
convection in fluid dynamics and the ways in which animals walk contain
symmetries in their formulation. These symmetries are known to influence the
kinds of solutions that are found in such models. Most previous work has focused
on the kinds of equilibria and periodic solutions that appear. This project
undertakes to broaden the class of solutions that are studied to include such
topics as chaos and intermittency in symmetric systems. Recent research and
experiments indicate that this is both reasonable and tractable.
