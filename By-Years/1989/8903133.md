Professor Vala is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and
the Chemical Instrumentation Program in spectroscopic studies of the electronic
and magnetic properties of dimeric and trimeric transition metal clusters (both
homonuclear and heteronuclear), small carbon clusters, and metal carbides, all
isolated in rare gas matrices. These species can play central roles in
heterogeneous catalysis, nucleation, chemisorption, and organo-metallic
chemistry. Details of ground and excited state assignments, magnetic moments,
spin-orbit splittings, and cluster geometries are being learned using a variety
of techniques, including absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magnetic
linear dichroism (MLD), MCD and MLD saturation spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and double resonance techniques (visible/infrared and
microwave/MCD). Also being studied are various interactions with the supporting
matrix, including crystal field splittings, site symmetries, and Jahn-Teller
interactions.
