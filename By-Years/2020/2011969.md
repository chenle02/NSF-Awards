Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthen education and research. The
project at Savannah State University seeks to build on previous successful
efforts to increase participation of African-American and other students from
historically disenfranchised groups in STEM disciplines. The goal of the project
is early engagement of STEM students with immersive, interactive and relevant
interdisciplinary applications of science, while offering professional
development opportunities to the faculty. The project will impact all STEM
majors at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the goals to:
transform STEM teaching and learning by reforming nine gateway STEM lab courses;
strengthen the institutionâ€™s undergraduate research training model through a
team-based applied interdisciplinary training approach; and implement a
sustained training program for five cohorts of faculty to support faculty
commitment to new teaching reforms. The project also seeks to institutionalize
reformed teaching and learning strategies by including virtual reality
environments within critical gateway science laboratory courses. A research
study will be conducted to investigate the impact of the interventions and
strategies in the gateway course on student learning outcomes. The project will
be guided and evaluated by internal and external advisory boards and
evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
