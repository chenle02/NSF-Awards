This project is concerned with the structure of central simple algebras and the
ways in which they combine to form Brauer groups. The principal investigator
will study central simple algebras in order to explore how one of them can
contain another. An ultimate goal is to explore how semisimple algebras, which
are built from central simple algebras, can be inserted into central simple
algebras over other fields. Solutions to these problems will have applications
in the theory of finite groups. The research supported concerns the study of the
Brauer group of a field. This group is an invariant that helps to explain the
structure of the algebras over fields that occur as subalgebras of rings of
matrices or linear transformations. This work has shed light on the structure of
finite dimensional division rings and has potential applications to the theory
of finite groups.
