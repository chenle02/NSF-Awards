Research is conducted on a procedure to predict the performance behavior of
adsorbants used in a water or wastewater treatment process where the target
compound for removal is present with others of unknown composition that are
subject to competitive adsorption. This is a renewal of research previously
conducted in which significant progress was made in the development and use of
mathematical models to characterize the performance of fixed-bed adsorbers used
in water and wastewater treatment practice.
