Gametophytes of the fern ceratipteris richardii are either hermaphroditic or
male. The primary sex-determining signal in this and many other ferns is
antheridiogen, a gibberellin-like pheromone that is secreted by the gametophyte.
In its presence, a juvenile gametophyte develops as a male, whereas in its
absence, the juvenile develops as a hermaphoxlite. The primary objective of this
proposal is to use a combined genetic and molecular approach to understand how
antheridiogen governs the sex of the gametophyte of Ceratopteris. The specific
objectives are 1) to identify key regulatory genes involved in sex determination
by generating and characterizing mutations; and 2) to isolate genes whose
expression is altered in response to antheridiogen using a gene expression
screen which identifies mRNAs that differ in abundance between two mRNA
populations by a subtractive hybridization method; the temporal and spatial
patterns of their expression will then be assessed and their function
investigated by expressing their antisense cDNA in transgenic plants. %%% This
analysis of the sex determining process in Ceratopterts may advance our general
understanding of similar processes in higher plants, and will also relate to
more general questions concerning hormonal control of genes involved in the
reproductive development of all organisms.
