William J. DeSisto, University of Maine, will apply atomic layer deposition
reactions to passivate nanoparticles. These coated nanoparticles will be used in
next-generation, high energy density, compact energy storage devices. Initial
experiments will focus on coating nano-sized lithium-ion battery anodes with
titanium nitride. Miniaturized batteries using these anodes will be fabricated
and evaluated by industrial collaborators at Yardley/Lithion Technical Products.

This award is supported jointly by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat
Terrorism Program supports new concepts in basic research and workforce
development with the potential to contribute to national security. The coated
nanoparticle technology may lead to smaller and more stable batteries that will
be used in many specialty applications. Students will be engaged in the research
in both academic and industrial settings.
