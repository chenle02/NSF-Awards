9630716 Irish The dicot flower generally consists of four whorls of floral
organs, which arise through the coordinated proliferation of cells in each of
the three cell layers of the floral meristem. Cell-cell interactions are
important for the development of this floral pattern. These intercellular
signaling events potentially include interwhorl, interorgan, and interlayer
interactions. This project will investigate the extent to which each of these
possible signaling mechanisms participates in establishing the floral pattern.
Previous work has shown that expression of the DTA gene in the petal and stamen
organ primordia results in ablation of petals and stamens. Grafing experiments,
in which Nicotiana plants containing the DTA gene construct are grafted with
wild type plants, will be used to examine the effects of ablating only part of
the floral organ primordia. The resulting chimeric plants can be used to assess
the degree to which remaining tissues can regenerate part or all of the missing
patern elements. The results of these experiments will help to define the extent
to which different signaling processes play in the specification of the
differentiated floral pattern. In addition, the role of the floral homeotic
APETALA3 (AP3) gene in cell-cell interactions in the development of the
Arabidopsis flower will be defined. Using the heterologous Ac/Ds transposable
element system, it will be possible to generate Arabidopsis plants that are
mosaics of wild type AP3 and mutant ap3 tissues. These plants will be used to
assess the role of the AP3 gene product in intercellular communication. Defining
the parameters of where intercellular signals act, in combination with the
analyses of the roles of individual gene products in these signaling processes,
will lead to a more complete understanding of how meristematic cells coordinate
their development to form the differentiated flower.
