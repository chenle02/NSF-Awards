9350013 Bifano This REU Site focuses the summer research efforts of 9
undergraduates on projects relating to synthesis and processing of advanced
engineering materials. The synthesis research centers on development of CVD
processes to create ceramic and diamond films. Synthesis also focuses on
fracture toughening of composites and ceramics, and systems approaches to
material crystallization. The processing research is concerned with unique
fabrication technologies that are necessary to obtain final component features
on advanced materials, including ultraprecision ductile-regime machining of
brittle materials. ***
