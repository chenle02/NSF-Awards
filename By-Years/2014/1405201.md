Title: Improving the voltage of solar cells using photon management &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work focuses on the study of new approaches to
enhance the efficiency of solar cells through novel approaches to manage photon
absorption. The efficiency of solar cells is determined by both the photocurrent
and the operating voltage. Currently, photocurrents in many leading cell
technologies are approaching their upper limit, leaving little room for
improvement. On the other hand, operating voltages are still lagging behind
their predicted limit. Traditionally, the voltage could only be enhanced by
improving the quality of solar cell materials, which tends to increase the cost
significantly. In this effort new approaches will be developed based on optical
designs to improve the operating voltage. Theoretical and experimental studies
aim to establish new mechanisms and design principles for voltage enhancement
based on photonic engineering. By investigating strategies for increasing cell
voltage, the PI anticipates improved understanding of fundamental processes that
will lead to higher efficiency of solar systems. There is a strong educational
plan to involve students with the research effort and to collaborate with an
industrial partner. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students
in clean energy technologies which will have a profound impact on society.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work focuses on new approaches to
enhance the operating voltage of solar cells. Several new mechanisms using
photon management in semiconductor nanostructures will be investigated. The
proposed photon management seeks to address issues beyond anti-reflection and
light trapping. Photonics can improve the voltage through the Purcell effect
where radiative recombination rates are enhanced or suppressed by engineering
the optical density of states. Such effects become more important as solar cells
reach high efficiencies, particularly for direct bandgap semiconductors. Near-
field emission will be theoretically investigated in various nanostructures to
reduce the loss of voltage in practical solar cells. The project combines
detailed balance analysis and nanophotonic simulations. In particular, cell
architectures will be investigated to achieve efficiency beyond the Shockley-
Queisser limit.
