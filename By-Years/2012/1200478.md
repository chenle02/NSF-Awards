The primary research aim of this project is to study the interplay between
topology, geometry and combinatorics. Three areas will receive special emphasis:
triangulations of compact manifolds (with and without boundary) and closely
related spaces, finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids. Compact
manifolds are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics. In the
last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking
their topology and geometry. However, questions of a combinatorial character
have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of facets required
to triangulate a given manifold? How do various topological invariants determine
how complicated it is to represent the manifold on a computer? What methods are
there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?
Conversely, given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that
imply about the possible geometries on the manifold? Similar questions, where
even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic
varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds. Finite
linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory,
topology, geometry and combinatorics. How are the topology and geometry of the
quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation
theoretic data? Matroids are a combinatorial abstraction of linear independence
with a variety of applications including hyperplane arrangements, linear
optimization, reliability, order restricted statistical inference, and the
aforementioned linear quotients of spheres. The project will concentrate on
enumerative properties of matroids. The questions above are representative of
the research that will be conducted by the PI during the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; How does one study complicated spaces and
structures? One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects. For
instance, an n-dimensional object might be represented as a collection of
n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons.
How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are
needed? How is this reflected in the shape and geometry of the original object?
Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models? These are
types of questions addressed in this research.
