This award provides support for the acquisition of an infrared detector and
beamsplitter by the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of
Chicago. The equipment is to be added to an existing Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectrometer now housed in the Department of Chemistry at Chicago. The addition
will allow the Principal Investigator and other geologists to analyze
quantitatively for H2O and CO2 in glass inclusions trapped in minerals of
volcanic rocks. The gas content of glassy inclusions (quenched melt) in volcanic
minerals can reveal the pressure of pre-eruptive magma. Such knowledge is
relevant to understanding volcanic eruptions.
