The broader impact/commercial impact of this project is centered on its ability
to significantly enhance the conductive ink applications in the printed
electronics market. Printed electronics is dominated by high viscosity silver
pastes for screen-printing applications. However, these pastes are extremely
high cost, require high annealing temperatures, and do not achieve the high
conductivities with its metal content. Electroninks? particle-free silver pastes
open the possibility of using of a low silver weight percentage paste that can
achieve high conductivities at low temperatures enabling a range of new
applications in printed electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on optimizing novel silver
ink formulations that have a low weight percentage of silver (10-20%) that
achieve much higher conductivity (50-90% of bulk silver) than current silver
pastes (5-10% of bulk silver) at temperatures that are compatible with low-cost
substrates (&lt;150ÂºC). Electroninks will focus on novel silver precursor
chemistries that allow full gelation of otherwise low-viscosity inks for screen-
printing applications.
