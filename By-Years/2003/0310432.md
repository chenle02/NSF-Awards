Interdisciplinary (99) This project is expanding opportunities for undergraduate
student learning and research with GIS and GPS technologies by adapting the
"Problem-Based Learning" approaches of an initiative at the University of Maine
Farmington. Emphasis is being placed on the development of curricular
initiatives for conventional GIS analyses in biology and environmental studies
as well as problems in economics, political science, and sociology. The project
is having local, regional and national impacts through numerous external
collaborations via class projects, internship experiences, training programs,
and independent research projects. Following the initial stage of planning
curriculum integration, developing an evaluation strategy, and purchasing
additional equipment to augment existing GIS and GPS facilities a dedicated
spatial ecology laboratory is being developed for maximizing student access to
GIS technology.
