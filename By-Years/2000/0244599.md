&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will be concerned with implementing new algorithms for
doing simulations of fully unquenched lattice QCD with light dynamical quarks.
One approach will be the use of a new truncated determinant and multi-boson
algorithm. In this approach the infrared quark modes are treated exactly.
Calculations will be done on a 163 x 32 lattice. The feasibility of using all-
point propagators in an unquenched study of electromagnetic hadronic fine-
structure will be examined. A detailed study will be made of the decays of the
Bc Meson, which was recently seen at the Tevatron. Resummation techniques will
be used in studying the radiative decays as well as production processes of
Standard Model and beyond the standard model particles. Differences between the
high energy behavior of deconstructed theories and extra-dimension theories will
be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;
