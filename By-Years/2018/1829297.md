The project seeks to assemble a permanent inlet and instrumented facility for
studying the microphysical properties of warm clouds, i.e. clouds whose tops are
at temperatures greater than zero degrees Celsius, and how they evolve in a
complex process involving the aerosol particles on which droplets form. Clouds
that form regularly at mountaintops such as the Pico Este (PE) in Puerto Rico
provide the opportunity to study the interaction between clouds and aerosols,
especially at those locations where the properties of the aerosols are well
known. The PE site has been used by a number of international research groups in
past measurement programs because of its unique, sub-tropical island location.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aerosol and Cloud Analysis System (ACAS) will have an
open and flexible architecture that will accommodate additional sensors that are
either acquired or developed by the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras
(UPRRP), or that are provided by guest research organizations. This instrument
will remain permanently operational at the PE site year-round for ongoing
research and educational outreach. The ACAS and the cloud and aerosol research
associated with its measurements, provides a comprehensive training ground for a
broad range of educational opportunities related to understanding the
measurement techniques, their limitations and uncertainties, fundamental aerosol
and cloud chemistry and physics, and basic meteorology. Underrepresented student
groups will interact with scientists and state-of-the-art instrumentation and be
exposed to unique research opportunities. Project results will be used in
educational materials for students and communities over a range of educational
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
