0243363&lt;br/&gt;Pinkel&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of California San
Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography provides support for a development
to significantly upgrade a hydrographic Doppler sonar system on R/V Roger
Revelle, which will expand the oceanographic research capabilities of the ship
which is as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. It is expected that the upgrade development here will
extend the depth to which the sonar can profile ocean currents from the moving
research vessel, and serve as a template for other systems. This upgrade should
provide a substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
