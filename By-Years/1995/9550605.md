9550605 Morgan The proposed research would investigate the optical and
electronic properties of 2-6 semiconductors and the relationship of these
properties to the photorefractive response. Specific objectives of this project
are (1) to determine the effect of purification, crystal growth techniques and
post-growth treatments on trap density, carrier transport properties, absorption
coefficient and other properties relevant to the material's photorefractive
performance, (2) to use selected transition metals as dopants in order to
evaluate the relationship between dopant species and concentration, defect and
transport properties and photorefractive properties, (3) to measure the time
response of the photorefractive effect and its dependence on defect properties
and (4) to study the effectiveness of studying the bandgap and other properties
by alloying in order to optimize the material for use at a specific wavelength.
The project will support 4 undergraduate and 2 graduate students. ***
