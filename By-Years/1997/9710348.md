The scientific psychology community began developing a Human Capital Initiative
(HCI) in 1992. At about the same time, the National Science Foundation developed
its own Human Capital Initiative (NSF 95-8). The NSF HCI was broader in scope,
and included all of the social and behavioral sciences represented within the
Division for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research (SBER). The American
Psychological Society has proposed to convene a workshop to coordinate the
scientific agenda of the Psychology HCI with the research priorities of the NSF
HCI. The goal is to identify current areas of psychological science where
further development is most likely to enhance understanding of the issues
identified in the NSF HCI. The workshop will produce a document focusing on the
relevance of basic research in psychology for the NSF Human Capital Initiative.
