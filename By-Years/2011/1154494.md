Allan Hancock College, a Hispanic-serving community college on California's
central coast, offers two-year scholarships to STEM students of high academic
ability but financial need. Students in engineering, biology, chemistry,
geological science, physics, mathematics or computer science are freed to
undertake full-time course loads, and are supported thoroughly to ensure
academic success and retention in challenging STEM disciplines through their two
years at the college. Built on a series of NSF- and federally-funded
initiatives, the infrastructure is in place to support the scholars and
facilitate their transfer to four-year institutions to complete their bachelor's
degrees. Though the students study a wide variety of STEM disciplines, many of
the foundational courses are common to several disciplines, so the program has a
coherence that supports the student efforts. Active mentoring, monitoring of
progress, and opportunities for networking with professionals in industry and
academe are also integral parts of the program. With scholarship size set to
meet most of the demonstrated need, the pipeline of underrepresented minority
scientists and engineers is thereby opened wider.
